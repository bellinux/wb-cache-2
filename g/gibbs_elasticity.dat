40|$|The <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity</b> modulus {{represents}} {{an important tool}} to predict the foamability for transient and permanent foams like polyurethane flexible systems. Elasticity is related to foamability and so {{is used as a}} synonymous {{for the purpose of this}} paper. In this article we propose a method and a thermodynamic model to analyze the espumability of silicone surfactants in polyol binary mixtures using surface tension data. The present work describes foamability through the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity</b> modulus expressed in terms of first and second derivatives of surface pressure vs bulk composition. Furthermore, the Gibbs adsorption equation and the corresponding novel surface equation of state based on a modification of the Langmuir isotherm resulted in an elasticity equation with analytical solution. It is shown that according to foam model systems of surfactant solution in polyol used at commercial processes, optimum concentration level of surfactant obtained at this article by Gibbs adsorption equation and maximus on elasticity modulus finally match...|$|E
40|$|The disjoining {{pressure}} isotherm in foam films is theoretically {{studied and}} an important contribution of adsorption is discovered. On {{the basis of the}} interfacial thermodynamics an adsorption disjoining pressure component is derived, which is repulsive and exponentially decaying by the film thickness. Expressions for its magnitude and decay length are derived in terms of well-known thermodynamic characteristics such as the partial <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity</b> and adsorption length. Several adsorption isotherms are considered and the corresponding adsorption disjoining pressure components are calculated. An important coupling between the interfacial layer phases and wetting transitions is discussed as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{surface tension}} of flowing soap films is {{measured}} {{with respect to}} the film thickness and the concentration of soap solution. We perform this measurement by measuring the curvature of the nylon wires that bound the soap film channel and use the measured curvature to parametrize the relation between the surface tension and the tension of the wire. We find the surface tension of our soap films increases when the film is relatively thin or made of soap solution of low concentration, otherwise it approaches an asymptotic value 30 mN/m. A simple adsorption model with only two parameters describes our observations reasonably well. With our measurements, we are also able to measure <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity</b> for our soap film.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework is}} developed {{for measuring the}} dilatational rheological properties of gas-liquid interfaces by analyzing small amplitude radial oscillations of an air bubble blown into a liquid substrate. Contrary to earlier analyses which customarily require the bubble radius change during the oscillation, {{the present study is}} based on the readily measurable quantities of bubble pressure change during the oscillation and phase lag between the bubble pressure and the relative displacement of the oscillation generating device. To expose the extensive interrelationships among the various experimental parameters that {{have a profound effect on}} bubble dynamics, the analysis is focused on the influence of the variable gas volumes at the sides of the differential pressure transducer, the gas phase compressibility, the dynamic behavior of the transducer membrane and the bubble surface being only a segment of a sphere, as they play a key role in the response of the system. A linear viscoelastic surface behavior is assumed which includes intrinsic surface viscosities and <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticities.</b> New data are deduced from previous measurements on the dilatational surface properties of stearic acid monolayers which, being practically insoluble in water, offer an ideal experimental system without the complications due to bulk-interface interactions. For a fixed frequency of oscillation, a virtually constant dilatational surface viscosity is determined throughout the employed concentration range. Yet, surface viscosity is found to slightly increase when the oscillation frequency increases. I...|$|R
40|$|An {{unprecedented}} microgravity {{observation of}} maximal shape oscillations of a surfactant-bearing water drop {{the size of}} a ping pong ball was observed during a mission of Space Shuttle Columbia as part of the second United States Microgravity Laboratory-USML- 2 (STS- 73, October 20 -November 5, 1995). The observation was precipitated by the action of an intense sound field which produced a deforming force on the drop. When this deforming force was suddenly reduced, the drop executed nearly free and axisymmetric oscillations for several cycles, demonstrating a remarkable amplitude of nonlinear motion. Whether arising from the discussion of modes of oscillation of the atomic nucleus, or the explosion of stars, or how rain forms, the complex processes influencing the motion, fission, and coalescence of drops have fascinated scientists for centuries. Therefore, the axisymmetric oscillations of a maximally deformed liquid drop are noteworthy, not only for their scientific value but also for their aesthetic character. Scientists from Yale University, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Vanderbilt University conducted liquid drop experiments in microgravity using the acoustic positioning/manipulation environment of the Drop Physics Module (DPM). The Yale/JPL group's objectives were to study the rheological properties of liquid drop surfaces on which are adsorbed surfactant molecules, and to infer surface properties such as surface tension, <b>Gibb's</b> <b>elasticity,</b> and surface dilatational viscosity by using a theory which relies on spherical symmetry to solve the momentum and mass transport equations...|$|R
40|$|We investigate, in {{a fairly}} general setting, the limit of large volume {{equilibrium}} <b>Gibbs</b> measures for <b>elasticity</b> type Hamiltonians with clamped boundary conditions. The existence of a quasiconvex free energy, forming the large deviations rate functional, is shown using a new interpolation lemma for partition functions. The local behaviour of the Gibbs measures can be parametrized by Young measures on the space of gradient Gibbs measures. In view of unboundedness of the state space, the crucial tool here is an exponential tightness estimate that holds for a vast class of potentials {{and the construction of}} suitable compact sets of gradient Gibbs measures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough {{extensively}} {{studied in}} the past, drainage of aqueous foams still offers major unaddressed issues. Among them, the behaviour of foam films during drainage has great significance as {{the thickness of the}} films is known to control the Ostwald ripening in foams, which in turn impacts liquid drainage. We propose a model relating the films' behavior to the liquid flow in foam channels. It is assumed that Marangoni driven recirculation counter flows take place in the transitional region between the foam channel and the adjoining films, and the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity</b> is therefore introduced as a relevant parameter. The velocity of these counter flows is found to be proportional to the liquid velocity in the channel. The resulting channel permeability is determined and it is shown that Marangoni stresses do not contribute to rigidify the channel's surfaces, in strong contrast with the drainage of horizontal thin liquid films. New experimental data are provided and support the proposed model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{stability}} of a partially mobile thin liquid plane-parallel film between two gas or oil phases is studied. The long wave approximation {{is used to}} analyze the influence of soluble ionic surfactants and non-surface active background electrolyte on the increment/decrement of fluctuations. The material properties of the corresponding multiphase flow and interfaces are taken into account. The equilibrium state of the film is described by the classical DLVO theory in which the Van der Waals and electrostatic disjoining pressures are included. The fluctuation analysis of the electro-diffusion fluxes, velocity of the components, concentrations, electric potential and film thickness give the analytical criteria for {{stability of}} the equilibrium state. Numerical results show changes of the stability region with increasing surfactant concentration and significant influence of the background electrolyte. The stabilizing effects of the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity,</b> surface and bulk viscosities are demonstrated [...] The results are useful for control of the foam breakdown in the industrial systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{elementary}} topological T 1 {{process in}} a two-dimensional foam corresponds to the "flip" of one soap film {{with respect to the}} geometrical constraints. From a mechanical point of view, this T 1 process is an elementary relaxation process through which the entire structure of an out-of-equilibrium foam evolves. The dynamics of this elementary relaxation process has been poorly investigated and is generally neglected during simulations of foams. We study both experimentally and theoretically the T 1 dynamics in a dry two-dimensional foam. We show that the dynamics is controlled by the surface viscoelastic properties of the soap films (surface shear plus dilatational viscosity, ms+k, and <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity</b> e), and is independent of the shear viscosity of the bulk liquid. Moreover, our approach illustrates that the dynamics of T 1 relaxation process provides a convenient tool for measuring the surface rheological properties: we obtained e = 32 +/- 8 mN/m and ms+k = 1. 3 +/- 0. 7 mPa. m. s for SDS, and e = 65 +/- 12 mN/m and ms+k = 31 +/- 12 mPa. m. s for BSA, in good agreement with values reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we present}} the exact {{solution}} of two approaching spherical droplets problem, at small Reynolds and Peclet numbers, {{taking into account}} surface shear and dilatational viscosities, <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity,</b> surface and bulk diffusivities due {{to the presence of}} surfactant in both disperse and continuous phases. For large interparticle distances, the drag force coefficient, f, increases only about 50 % from fully mobile to tangentially immobile interfaces, while at small distances, f can differ several orders of magnitude. There is significant influence of the degree of surface coverage, 0, on hydrodynamic resistance beta for insoluble surfactant monolayers. When the surfactant is soluble only in the continuous phase the bulk diffusion suppresses the Marangoni effect only for very low values of 0, while in reverse situation, the bulk diffusion from the drop phase is more efficient and the hydrodynamic resistance is lower. Surfactants with low value of the critical micelle concentration (CMC) make the interfaces tangentially immobile, while large CMC surfactants cannot suppress interfacial mobility, which lowers the hydrodynamic resistance between drops. For micron-sized droplets the interfacial viscosities practically block the surface mobility and they approach each other as solid spheres with high values of the drag coefficient...|$|E
40|$|The mutual {{approach}} of two bubbles {{and the rate}} of thinning and the deformation of the partially mobile thin liquid film intervening between them is studied. The material properties of the interfaces (surface viscosity, <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity,</b> surface and:or bulk diffusivity) are taken into account. In the normal stress balance at the fluid interfaces we include the contribution of the intermolecular forces. To obtain the liquid velocity and pressure distribution the lubrication approximation is used. From the normal stress boundary condition the first order (with respect to the capillary number) shape function is derived. It provides information on the inversion thickness, at which the curvature in the gap between the drops changes from convex to concave, and the pimple thickness, at which the curvature of the interfaces spontaneously increases due to the action of the attractive intermolecular forces. The analytical and numerical investigations reveal significant influence of the disjoining pressure and the surfactant on both thicknesses. Explanation of the following effects is proposed: (i) increase of the pimple thickness and decrease of the inversion thickness with the increase of the interfacial mobility; (ii) role of the surface viscosity; (iii) role of the van der Waal...|$|E
40|$|The {{deformability}} of droplets i {{accounted for}} {{as a new}} effect in the statistical mechanics ofmicroemul-sions. It is assumed that a plane-parallel film is formed between two colliding microemulsion droplets. The collision is accompanied bydeformation of the droplets and by an increase of their interfacial area. The increased interfacial energy gives rise to an effective soft repulsion between the two droplets. In addition, the deformed roplets, having the shape of spherical segments, exhibit considerably greater van der Waals attraction than two spheres of the same volume, separated atthe same surface-to-surface distance. The superposition ofthese two effects leads to the appearance ofa potential well in the energy of droplet-droplet in eraction. The latter depends on the droplet interfaeial tension, the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity,</b> the Hamaker constant, and {{the thickness of the}} liquid film separating the droplets. The soft repulsion and the increased attraction predicted by this model lead to pronouncedly ower values of the calculated second virial coefficient in comparison with the hard sphere model of microemulsions. The deformable droplet model proposed in this paper allows the explanation of experimental findings uch as the ab-normally low measured values of the second virial and diffusion coefficients a well as the dimer formation in microemulsions. © 1991 Academic Press, Inc. 1...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} our derivations of analytical expressions for {{the frequencies}} and damping constants for small-amplitude axisymmetric shape oscillations of a liquid drop suspended in an immiscible fluid host in microgravity. In particular, this work addresses large Reynolds number shape oscillations {{and focuses on}} the surface rheological effects that arise from the presence of insoluble surfactants at the interface. Parameters characterizing viscous effects from the bulk phases, surface viscous effects, Marangoni effects from the surface advection and diffusion of surfactants, and the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity</b> are all considered and analyzed to determine {{the relative importance of}} each contribution. Supplementing the analytical treatment for small-amplitude oscillations, a numerical boundary integral equation formulation is developed for the study of large-amplittide axisymmetric oscillations of a drop in vacuum. The boundary integral formulation is an extension of classical potential flow theory and approximately accounts for viscous effects in the bulk fluid as well as the surface viscous and Marangoni effects resulting from an insoluble surfactant contaminating the interface. Theoretical and numerical results are presented for four distinct cases. These, range from the case when the effects of the surfactants are 'negligible' to 'large' when compared to the viscous effects in the bulk phases. The feasibility of the non-contact measurement of the surface parameters, using experimental observations for the oscillation frequencies and damping constants of drops and bubbles, is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We used {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) simulations {{to investigate the}} structures and properties of Newton black films (NBF) for several surfactants: sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C 16 TAB), and surfactin using film thicknesses up to 10 nm. By calculating the interface formation energy for various packing conditions on the surface pressure-area isotherm, {{we found that the}} most probable surface concentration is 42 Å 2 /molecule for SDS and C 16 TAB and 170 Å 2 /molecule for surfactin. We then used this most probable concentration of each surfactant to simulate NBF with various film thicknesses. From analyzing the disjoining pressure-film thickness isotherms with the density profiles and the solvation coordination number, we found that the increase of the disjoining pressure during the film thinning was coupled with the change in inner structure of the NBF (i. e., density profile and the solvation of ionic entities). In the range of film thicknesses less than 30 Å, the disjoining pressures for the SDS and C 16 TAB were found to be larger than that of the surfactin. We predicted the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity</b> (175 dyn/cm for surfactin; 109 dyn/cm for C 16 TAB; 38 dyn/cm for SDS) required to assess the stability of NBF against surface concentration fluctuations, and the shear modulus (6. 5 GPa for the surfactin; 6. 1 GPa for the C 16 TAB; 3. 5 GPa for the SDS) and the yield stress (0. 8 GPa for surfactin; 0. 8 GPa for C 16 TAB; 0. 4 GPa for the SDS) to assess the mechanical stability against the externally imposed mechanical perturbation. 1...|$|E
40|$|We report novel {{observations}} {{revealing the}} catastrophic breakup of water drops containing surfactant molecules, which are suspended {{in oil and}} subjected to an electric field of strength similar to 10 (5) V/m. The observed breakup was distinctly different from the gradual end pinch-off or tip-streaming modes reported earlier in the literature. There was no observable characteristic deformation of the drop prior to breakup. The time scales involved in the breakup and the resultant droplet sizes were much smaller in the phenomenon observed by us. We hypothesize that this mode of drop breakup is obtained by the combined effect of an external electric field that imposes tensile stresses {{on the surface of}} the drop, and characteristic stress-strain behavior for tensile deformation exhibited by the liquid drop in the presence of a suitable surfactant, which not only lowers the interfacial tension (and hence the cohesive strength) of the drop but also simultaneously renders the interface nonductile or brittle at high enough concentration. We have identified the relevant thermodynamic parameter, viz., the sum of interfacial tension, sigma, and the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity,</b> epsilon, which plays a decisive role in determining the mode of drop breakup. The parameter (epsilon + sigma) represents the internal restoration stress of a liquid drop opposing rapid, short-time-scale perturbations or local deformations in the drop shape under the influence of external impulses or stresses. A thermodynamic "state" diagram of (epsilon + sigma) versus interfacial area per surfactant molecule adsorbed at the drop interface shows a "maximum" at a critical transition concentration (ctc). Below this concentration of the surfactant, the drop undergoes tip streaming or pinch off. Above this concentration, the drop may undergo catastrophic disintegration if the external stress is high enough to overcome the ultimate cohesive strength of the drop's interface...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe propose an {{experimental}} approach, alternative to Langmuir trough, pendant or sessile drop experiments, to study insoluble monolayers at the air-water interface. The method {{is based on}} the direct deposition of an insoluble surfactant at the interface of an air bubble, measuring the surface tension according to the classical axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA) technique. This bubble configuration, in contrast to the classical ones for studying Langmuir monolayers have several remarkable advantages like the easy control of the surrounding bulk composition (opening new potential research applications), the fast experimental time for a monolayer to be ready (< 20 min), the small bulk volume (10 mL), and mostly the simple way to carry out dilatational rheology. The experiment consists of performing compression of an insoluble monolayer recording the Π-AB curve (Π is the interfacial pressure and AB the bubble area) and obtaining dilatational rheology over the compression range establishing the E-Π curve (with E is the elastic modulus). We showed that the experimental results can be satisfactorily fitted using the Volmer's equation of state including the two-dimensional compressibility factor ε, offering access to the excluded area per molecule ω 0 and to the number N of molecules at the interface, without initially knowing the amount of deposited material. This proof of concept study was carried out on dioleoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (DPPC), and cholesterol at 20 °C, systems chosen to show qualitative differences in their thermodynamic behavior upon monolayer compression. Likewise, dilatational rheology of these insoluble monolayers allows evidencing the compressibility of the DOPC monolayer in contrast to the DPPC monolayer, and finally, the compression domains where the interface loses the surfactant through a comparison of the dilatational elasticity with the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>elasticity</b> calculated from the compression curves. Finally, we propose an example of the new application offered by the possibility to exchange the fluid phase surrounding the bubble, herein to study mixed monolayers made with soluble/insoluble surfactants (Tween 80 /Span 65) ...|$|E
