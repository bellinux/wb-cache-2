Look up the records and see what becomes of the shortstops who get too old to cover all the ground between second base and the foul line. A lot of them camp on third for a while. And why shouldn't they? A man can play third when he can't play short. That's a cinch.|$|E
500|$|... "Miss Independent" [...] is a R-{{influenced}} pop song. Katherine St Asaph of Popdust {{noted that}} [...] "it’s the closest Kelly Clarkson’s come to R" [...] Clarkson said that Aguilera's rhythmic style heavily influenced the song. She remarked, [...] "You can <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> her influence in 'Miss Independent', especially the hook. And once {{you hear the}} song, it's constantly in your head. Believe me, I cannot get it out!" [...] Rachell Kipp of the Associated Press wrote that [...] "Miss Independent" [...] "sounds like a half-baked remake of Aguilera's [...] "Dirrty" [...] (2002)" [...] The song has a length of three minutes and 35 seconds and is written in the key of D major, Clarkson's vocal range spans from F3 to F5.|$|E
500|$|Just Good Old Rock and Roll is {{much more}} {{straightforward}} than past works, consisting of funk-influenced hard rock, although [...] "So Many People to Tell" [...] and [...] "Silver Passion Mine" [...] also exhibit a late-psychedelic sound.

If you listen to the album, you'll <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> diversity, feel and tempo changes...That was our learning curve." [...] In early 1970, Whetstone and Wade departed the band and moved to Canada where they formed Stallion Thumbrock. Morgan and Kincaid constructed another line-up of The Electric Prunes that included Michael Kearns, Clay Groomer, Huey Plumeigh, and Galen Pugh; however, by mid-1970 the band dissolved.|$|E

500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we {{finished}} writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic [...] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of,</b> which made it unique and special.|$|E
500|$|Endtroducing..... {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics when it {{was first}} released. Alternative Press called it [...] "an undeniable hip-hop masterpiece" [...] showing [...] "DJ Shadow remembers that sampling is an art form", while David Bennun from The Guardian said the record was [...] "not only one of the most daring and original albums of recent times, but also one of the loveliest." [...] In Playboy, Robert Christgau claimed that while listeners unfamiliar with its style of music would not find the tracks as powerful, [...] "they are so rich and eclectic, and spun out with such a sense of flow, that this album establishes the kind of convincing aural reality other British techno experimenters only fantasize about." [...] Tom Wilkes of Melody Maker wrote: [...] "The album flips hip hop inside out all over again like a reversible glove, and again, and again, and each time it's sudden and new. I am, I confess, totally confounded by it. I <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> good records, but very few impossible ones... You need this record. You are incomplete without it." [...] Author and rock critic Greil Marcus published a glowing review of the album in his [...] "Real Life Rock Top Ten" [...] column for Interview, where he called it [...] "absolutely modern – which is to say ambient-dreamy and techno-abstract" [...] and [...] "quite brilliant throughout".|$|E

[...] "How do we define ourselves within a cultural context that wants to reduce complex realities to simplistic clichés?" [...] he asked rhetorically. He told the online journal Inside Higher Ed: [...] "We are, I think, {{a different kind of}} Christian...

From our perspective, that means less nationalism, and a much more global perspective, care for creation.
