5|$|In 2008, the British Antarctic Survey {{reported}} a volcanic eruption under the Antarctica ice sheet 2,200 years ago. It {{is believed to}} be that this was the biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years. Volcanic ash deposits from the volcano were <b>identified</b> <b>through</b> an airborne radar survey, buried under later snowfalls in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Most high-energy particles, beside {{displacing}} carbon atom {{from the}} lattice site, also pass it enough surplus energy for a rapid migration through the lattice. However, when relatively gentle gamma irradiation is used, this {{extra energy is}} minimal. Thus the interstitials remain near the original vacancies and form vacancy-interstitials pairs <b>identified</b> <b>through</b> optical absorption.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, an Argentine Army {{expedition}} found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one {{of which}} had an intact and inflated tyre)—and noted that the wreckage was well localised, a fact which pointed to a head-on impact with the ground, and which also ruled out a mid-air explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, a foot in an ankle boot and a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been <b>identified</b> <b>through</b> DNA testing.|$|E
5|$|Olga's murder {{following}} the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. In later years, when {{dozens of people}} made claims to be surviving members of the imperial family, a woman named Marga Boodts claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga, but her claim was not taken seriously. Olga was murdered along with her family at Yekaterinburg. Her remains were <b>identified</b> <b>through</b> DNA testing and were buried during a funeral ceremony in 1998 at Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg {{along with those of}} her parents and two of her sisters.|$|E

5|$|Mon thong is {{the most}} commercially sought after for its thick, {{full-bodied}} creamy and mild sweet tasting flesh with relatively moderate smell emitted and smaller seeds, while Chanee {{is the best in}} terms of its resistance to infection by Phytophthora palmivora. Kan Yao is somewhat less common, but prized for its longer window of time when it is both sweet and odorless at the same time. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, five are currently in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Mon Thong, Kan Yao, Ruang, and Kradum. There are more than 100 registered cultivars since the 1920s in Malaysia and up to 193 cultivars by 1992, and many superior cultivars have been <b>identified</b> <b>through</b> competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture, and Agrotourism Show. In Vietnam, the same process has been achieved through competitions held by the Southern Fruit Research Institute. A recently popular variety is, Cat Mountain King or Musang King.|$|E
5|$|Remains {{that were}} {{recovered}} from the Pentagon were photographed, and {{turned over to the}} Armed Forces Medical Examiner office, located at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The medical examiner's office was able to identify remains belonging to 179 of the victims. Investigators eventually identified 184 of the 189 people who died in the attack. The remains of the five hijackers were <b>identified</b> <b>through</b> a process of elimination, and were turned over as evidence to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). On September 21, the ACFD relinquished control of the crime scene to the FBI. The Washington Field Office, National Capital Response Squad (NCRS), and the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) led the crime scene investigation at the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently <b>identified</b> <b>through</b> the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E

5|$|Tapaculos are {{the most}} {{primitive}} family of suboscines, divided into 12 genera containing 60 species. Scytalopus, the genus to which the Perijá tapaculo belongs, has an abundance of similar species, {{many of which are}} difficult to classify through appearance. Some individual species from other genera are like Scytalopus in size and plumage, but have different behaviour and morphological features. Vocal studies and mitochondrial DNA analysis are often used to differentiate between species within the genus; a number of visually identical species previously classified as subspecies of the Magellanic tapaculo (S. magellanicus) have been <b>identified</b> <b>through</b> these methods, and the majority of subspecies within the genus have subsequently been reclassified as separate species.|$|E
