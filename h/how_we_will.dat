500|$|Posey {{was sent}} a script for [...] "Eagleton" [...] and enjoyed {{it so much}} she {{immediately}} agreed to play the part. She also said she was excited to work with director Nicole Holofcener. The episode was filmed in November 2010. Posey was shooting scenes for a film in Boston at the time, and flew into Los Angeles for the Parks and Recreation filming {{just a few hours}} before the shots began. As a result, Posey was exhausted during the filming, including the Eagleton public forum scene, which was shot at the Toluca Lake Sports Center in Toluca Lake district of Los Angeles. The scene in which Leslie and Lindsay fight among piles of garbage was filmed during temperatures of more than 100 degrees. Although stuntwomen were used, Poehler and Posey performed some of the fight themselves. Despite wearing wool blazers that made the heat even harder to endure, the two actresses said they enjoyed filming the scene. Poehler jokingly said it was included in the script [...] "just because it's in Parker and I's contract, that that's <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> work together. It's the only way we'll work together, is fighting in garbage." ...|$|E

2500|$|During Minnesota's 2006 DFL primary for Minnesota's 5th District {{seat in the}} United States House of Representatives the Twin Cities-based {{publication}} American Jewish World endorsed Keith Ellison citing {{his work}} during the ethics complaint {{as one of their}} reasons. [...] They wrote [...] "Ellison acted as the lawyer for the House DFL caucus in an ethics proceeding against former representative Arlon Lindner, who contended that gays were not victims of Nazi oppression in the Holocaust. [...] Ellison understands the importance of guarding against Holocaust denial and revisionism, and links the lessons of the Shoah to more recent cases of genocide in Rwanda and Darfur." [...] The Ellison campaign called this an [...] "extremely valued and valuable endorsement", and Ellison said [...] "I am humbled, and just plain thrilled, by the confidence the American Jewish World has placed in my vision of a just future where there are no throw-away people and peace is our guiding principle. ...This is <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> win – by creating a powerful force of real people unified behind a passion for justice."
