25|$|Mr. Libby {{was sentenced}} to thirty months of prison, two years of probation, and a $250,000 fine. In making the {{sentencing}} decision, the district court rejected {{the advice of the}} probation office, which recommended a lesser sentence and the consideration of <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> have led to a sentence of home confinement or probation.|$|E
25|$|After the 2008 {{epidemic}} {{was declared}} a national emergency, the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MOHCW) collaborated {{with several other}} departments, governments, and non-governmental organizations to create a Cholera Command and Control Centre.

25|$|Epileptic brain {{activity}} in musical hallucinations originates {{in the left}} or right temporal lobe. In a specific case studied by Williams et al. 2008, a patient who received a left temporal lobectomy in order to treat epilepsy was diagnosed with musical hallucinations post-surgery. The patient also had multiple additional risk <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> have accounted for the hallucinations including mild neuropsychiatric dysfunction and tinnitus.|$|E
25|$|Researchers have {{hypothesized}} {{a number}} of <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be responsible for these differences between countries, including national differences in overall income levels, self-serving biases and self-enhancement, and approach and avoidance orientations. Taken together, {{these findings suggest that}} while extraversion-introversion does have a strong correlation with happiness, it does not stand alone as a sole predictor of subjective well-being, and that other factors must be accounted for when trying to determine the correlates of happiness.|$|E

30|$|There {{is a key}} <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> act as a “game changer”: {{counter-terrorism}} policies, that, as we argue, it is {{not possible}} to know if act as a pull, a push, or a neutral factor because the EU does not follow an evidence-based policing system.|$|R
25|$|Those in the {{business}} have considered domesticating the mopane worms {{in a manner that}} is similar to the domestication of silkworms. The industry would thus be less susceptible to the pitfalls that are associated with it, such as climatic change, drought and other <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> compromise a harvest. For a domesticated industry to succeed on a small scale and be accessible to the poorest of the poor, the cost of production would have to be comparable with the cost of wild worms or dried worms at the market.|$|E
25|$|Public {{views are}} crucial {{to the success of}} opt-out or presumed consent {{donation}} systems. In a study done to determine if health policy change to a presumed consent or opt-out system would help to increase donors, an increase of 20 to 30 percent was seen among countries who changed their policies from some type of opt-in system to an opt-out system. Of course, this increase must have {{a great deal to do}} with the health policy change, but also may be influenced by other <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> have impacted donor increases.|$|E
25|$|The 1947 English cricket {{season was}} {{dominated}} by the batting exploits of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich, who both broke records for the numbers of runs scored in a season. Mann's accuracy {{was one of the}} few <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> subdue the English pair, and his first bowling in Test cricket, in the first game of the five-match series, was a spell of eight successive maidens; he finished the innings with figures of no wickets for 10 runs in 20 overs. He followed that up when England followed on with second-innings figures of one for 94 in 60 overs: the single wicket that he took was that of Compton, but Compton had made 163 by that stage and the match was easily saved.|$|E
30|$|Another <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> {{influence}} self-recognition is a state-dependent memory distortion, i.e., {{difficulties in}} remembering (hypo)manic episodes during a depressive state (Akiskal et al. 2000). However, in our general population study most respondents were euthymic {{during the interview}} and therefore state-dependent memory disturbances presumably did not influence recall.|$|R
30|$|Country {{of origin}} is another <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> {{potentially}} be {{of importance for}} any state dependence. However, only small effects could be found and only the group from Eastern Europe shows a significant increased effect. Somewhat surprisingly, we found no increased effect of being from a refugee country.|$|R
50|$|A {{positive}} association {{exists between}} firearm availability and increased suicide risk. This relationship is most strongly {{established in the}} United States. This association is almost certainly not due to confounding, as any confounding risk <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> account for this association would have to meet multiple implausible criteria.|$|R
25|$|Colony {{founding}} {{can be done}} by {{an individual}} or in groups, known as pleometrosis. This joint effort of the co-foundresses contributes to the growth and survival of the incipient colony; nests founded by multiple queens begin the growth period with three times as many workers when compared to colonies founded by a single queen. Despite this, such associations are not always stable. The emergence of the first workers instigates queen-queen and queen-worker fighting. In pleometrotic conditions, only one queen emerges victorious, whereas the queens that lost are subsequently killed by the workers. The two <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> affect the survival of individual queens are their relative fighting capabilities and their relative contribution to worker production. Size, an indicator of fighting capacity, positively correlates with survival rates. However, manipulation of the queen's relative contribution to worker production had no correlation with survival rate.|$|E
25|$|The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) {{recommends}} statin {{treatment for}} adults {{with an estimated}} 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease that is greater than 10%. Guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend statin treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190mg/dL or those with diabetes, age 40–75 with LDL-C 70–190mg/dl; or in those with a 10-year risk of developing heart attack or stroke of 7.5% or more. In this latter group, statin assignment was not automatic, but was recommended to occur only after a clinician-patient risk discussion with shared decision making where other risk factors and lifestyle are addressed, the potential for benefit from a statin is weighed against the potential for adverse effects or drug interactions and informed patient preference is elicited. Moreover, if a risk decision was uncertain, factors such as family history, coronary calcium score, ankle-brachial index, and an inflammation test (hs-CRP ≥ 2.0mg/L) were suggested to inform the risk decision. Additional <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be used were an LDL-C ≥ 160 or a very high lifetime risk. However, critics such as Steven E. Nissen say that the AHA/ACC guidelines were not properly validated, overestimate the risk by at least 50%, and recommend statins for patients who will not benefit, based on populations whose observed risk is lower than predicted by the guidelines. The European Society of Cardiology and the European Atherosclerosis Society recommend the use of statins for primary prevention, depending on baseline estimated cardiovascular score and LDL thresholds.|$|E
