50|$|The Auxiliary Fire Service (AFS) {{was first}} formed in 1938 in Great Britain {{as part of}} the Civil Defence Service. Its role was to {{supplement}} the work of brigades at local level. In this job it was hampered severely by the incompatibility of equipment used by these different brigades — most importantly the lack of a standard size of <b>hydrant</b> <b>valve.</b> The Auxiliary Fire Service and the local brigades were superseded in August 1941 by the National Fire Service. After the war the AFS was reformed alongside the Civil Defence Corps, forming part of the UK's planned emergency response to a nuclear attack. It was disbanded in the UK in 1968.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effects of}} the 1938 Act were short lived (though it was not {{repealed}} until 1947), as all local brigades and Auxiliary Fire Service units in Great Britain were merged into the National Fire Service in 1941, which was itself {{under the auspices of}} the Civil Defence Service. There was a separate National Fire Service (Northern Ireland). [...] Before the war, there had been little or no standardisation of equipment, most importantly in the diameter of <b>hydrant</b> <b>valves.</b> This made regional integration difficult.|$|R

5000|$|Most fire <b>hydrant</b> <b>valves</b> are not {{designed}} to throttle the water flow; {{they are designed to}} be operated full-on or full-off. The valving arrangement of most dry-barrel hydrants is for the drain valve to be open at anything other than full operation. Usage at partial-opening can consequently result in considerable flow directly into the soil surrounding the hydrant, which, over time, can cause severe scouring. Gate or butterfly valves can be installed directly onto the hydrant orifices to control individual outputs and allow for changing equipment connections without turning off the flow to other orifices. These valves can be up to 12 inches in diameter to accommodate the large central [...] "steamer" [...] orifices on many US hydrants. It is good practice to install valves on all orifices before using a hydrant as the protective caps are unreliable and can cause major injury if they fail.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Leaks {{in water}} {{distribution}} network are generally detected and located using conventional methods {{that is not}} able to give previously any idea about leak size. Current paper draw proposal plan to discriminate leaks according to its size, using a modular system in four blocs: 1) Signal preprocessing, 2) Representation using modified Mexican hat wavelet 3) Dimensionality reduction using random projection combined to principal component analysis and 4) Classification with artificial neural networks. These are used to listen for leak sounds at contact points with the pipe such as fire <b>hydrants</b> and <b>valve.</b> Acoustic equipment also includes leak noise correlators. These are modern computer-based instruments that have a simple field setup and work by measuring leak signals (sound or vibration) at two points that bracket a suspected leak. The position of the leak is then determined automatically based on the time shift between the leak signals calculated using the cross-correlation method...|$|R

50|$|The Ice Pigging method {{occupies}} a ‘middle ground’ {{between two of}} the traditional methods of cleaning pipes; that of ‘flushing’, which involves pumping high velocity water through pipes in order to carry away residue, and pigging, forcing a solid object through the pipe to push away any loose material. Ice Pigging utilises the main principles behind these two methods. An ice-water slurry, typically between 50 and 90% ice fraction is introduced to and removed from pipes with little complication, provided the presence of suitable <b>hydrants</b> and <b>valves.</b> The high ice fraction, lends several attributes which are particularly appealing for application in pigging; It is able to hold itself together under continuous shear. If the ice becomes stuck then given enough time it will just melt and be carried away. It is fairly inexpensive to make. It leaves the pipe walls themselves undamaged, and only removes waste residue. Because Ice Pigging is a relatively quick process (when compared to alternative methods), it can be use for a number of applications including: underground pipes for fresh water and sewage, food manufacturing pipe work and many others.|$|R
2500|$|Early pumpers used cisterns as {{a source}} of water. Water was later put into wooden pipes under the streets and a [...] "fire plug" [...] was pulled out of the top of the pipe when a suction hose was to be inserted. Later systems {{incorporated}} pressurized fire hydrants, where the pressure was increased when a fire alarm was sounded. This was found to be harmful to the system and unreliable. Today's <b>valved</b> <b>hydrant</b> systems are kept under pressure at all times, although additional pressure may be added when needed. Pressurized hydrants eliminate much of the work in obtaining water for pumping through the engine and into the attack hoses. Many rural fire engines still rely upon cisterns or other sources for drafting water into the pumps.Steam pumper came in to use in the 1850s.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{affirms the}} prime {{importance}} of automatic sprinklers in tall {{buildings and the}} importance of ensuring operating sprinklers / fire <b>hydrants</b> / landing <b>valves</b> in the farthest building corners can be provided with undisturbed water supply of sufficient flow / pressure. In the worst scenario, all fixed fire pumps inside the building may fail to operate, and the smaller header tank at roof can run out of water. This issue has not been resolved worldwide in normal fires as well as those caused by terrorist and arsonist attack. (6) Portable pumps will be delivered to refuge floors for relaying water into building’s fire fighting systems. It is proposed to install mains for compressed air and water to supply portable / fixed impulse fire extinguishing devices, to supplement the ordinary fire fighting systems and enable the most effective choice when water shortage becomes critical. These can greatly enhance fire safety of the tallest buildings against attacks from terrorist / arsonist...|$|R
40|$|What is a dual water system? Two separate, underground, {{piped water}} sys-tems that serve a {{parcel of land}} or lot charac-terize dual water systems. The potable water system conveys {{drinking}} water (i. e., water treated to meet U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Safe Drinking Water Act requirements) for household use while the non-potable system conveys water for landscape irrigation and other purposes (Figure 1). Note that the non-potable water is still treated, just not to drinking water standards. The potable-water or primary system operates like any other potable-water supply and distri-bution system, requiring a water source, treat-ment plant, storage facility, and distribution system. These systems generally require pumps to lift potable water from the treatment plant to storage tanks from which it is distrib-uted by gravity {{to the point of}} use. The non-potable water {{is often referred to as}} a secondary system and distributes water from non-potable sources such as seawater or household gray water. This system may include distribution pipes, <b>valves,</b> <b>hydrants,</b> standpipes, a pumping system, and, if required, treatment and storage...|$|R
5000|$|During World War I, the Mueller {{brothers}} formed Mueller Metals Company {{in order}} to address the shortage of brass rod munitions fuses, constructing a plant in Port Huron, Michigan. The plant went into production as the war was ending, and the Muellers took a large loss on the facility. In 1927, Oscar Mueller exchanged his interest in Mueller Co. for the Port Huron plant, converting it into an independent brass tubing and fitting manufacturing enterprise under the name of Mueller Brass Company. Throughout the late 1920s, Mueller Co. opened additional sales and distribution offices in Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Dallas, and Atlanta, though the Great Depression led to the closure of all of these offices. However, a production plant was opened in Los Angeles in 1933 {{in order to}} handle distribution for the company's still-growing market in the western United States. The Los Angeles plant remained in operation until 1977, when it was replaced by a new facility in Brea, California. Mueller Co. also acquired Columbia Iron Works, a Chattanooga, Tennessee-based manufacturer of <b>hydrants</b> and gate <b>valves</b> in 1933.|$|R
5000|$|In 1923, Mueller Co. {{acquired}} the National Casting Company and established the Mueller Iron Foundry Company. The iron foundry {{became part of}} Mueller Co. in 1928, and continued operation until the mid-1950s. Mueller Co. acquired Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Columbia Iron Works, a manufacturer of fire <b>hydrants</b> and gate <b>valves,</b> in 1933, later changing the outfit's brand name to Mueller in 1955. Mueller still manufactures gate valves at this location, but the fire hydrant manufacturing operation was moved to Albertville, Alabama in 1975, earning the town the moniker [...] "Fire Hydrant Capital of the World" [...] in 1991. In 1965, Mueller Co. bought the Los Angeles-based Adams Clamp Company and moved its production operations first to Decatur, Illinois, and later to its current location in Cleveland, Tennessee. In 1988, Mueller Co. acquired Hersey-Sparling Meter Company, which began operating under its former name, Hersey Meters, until it was merged with Arkion Systems in 2009 and became known as Mueller Systems. In 1996, Henry Pratt Company, a manufacturer of butterfly and other specialty valves, and James Jones Company became subsidiaries of Mueller Co. Pratt subsequently acquired several companies between 2001 and 2003, including Hydro Gate and Milliken Valve, among others. The leak detection company, Echologics, and Hydro Guard, a brand of water line flushing systems, are Mueller Co.'s most recent acquisitions; they both became divisions of the company in 2011.|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} against contamination events in water distribution systems involves two distinct phases: detection {{of the presence}} of a contaminant and implementation of actions to isolate and/or expel it rapidly. The problem of detection is confronted by installing a series of monitoring stations, strategically placed across the distribution system and consisting of sensors to detect the presence of contaminants. The actions to be implemented may include operations on distribution system devices (<b>valves</b> and <b>hydrants),</b> injection of reagents to eliminate the contaminant or simply alert users. The procedure proposed here attempts to address the problems related to the two phases by means of two consecutive optimisation processes, both of them performed off-line and assuming a specific 24 -hour water demand sequence in each network node, whereas the accidental/intentional injection of contaminant can occur in any node and at any hour of the day. With reference to this vast range of possible injection scenarios, the first multi-objective optimisation process defines the position of a pre-selected number ns of sensors across the distribution system in order to minimize the expected percentage of undetected contamination events and the expected volume of contaminated water consumed up {{to the beginning of the}} response operations following detection. A single configuration of stations is then selected from the Pareto front produced by this optimisation process (“knee point” of the Pareto front). At the end of this first optimisation process and with reference to the selected set of sensors, a potentially contaminated area in the network is associated to each sensor for each sub-period of the day. The second multi-objective optimisation process is then aimed to identify, with reference to each station and sub-period, and thus inside the corresponding potentially contaminated area, the <b>hydrant</b> opening and <b>valve</b> closing operations to be carried out in order to minimize both the number of operations and the expected volume of contaminated water consumed between the beginning of the response operations and the disappearance of the contaminant, assuming the availability of an unlimited number of response teams. Once these devices have been identified (“knee point” of the Pareto front relevant to the second optimisation process), an a posteriori analysis is performed to determine the sequence in which they should be activated based on the number of response teams actually available. In these optimisation processes, a hydraulic and quality simulator (EPANET) is linked to a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) in order to compute the value of the objective functions of the problem across different contamination scenarios. The results obtained applying the procedure to a real and complex water distribution system have shown it to be a robust and effective method for reducing the impact on the population...|$|R
