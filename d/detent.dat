25|$|In 1782, Arnold {{took out}} another patent {{to protect the}} latest and most {{important}} inventions, which were potentially lucrative. Several other watchmakers, most notably Thomas Earnshaw, had started to copy Arnold's work. Around 1780, Earnshaw modifyied his <b>detent</b> escapement by mounting the <b>detent</b> on a spring to create the spring <b>detent</b> escapement.|$|E
25|$|Another part of {{the patent}} {{concerned}} the escapement—a modification of Arnold's pivoted <b>detent</b> escapement that essentially mounted the <b>detent</b> on a spring. The specification only shows the part of this escapement that is the method of impulse on the impulse roller.|$|E
25|$|In 1780, {{while making}} these {{chronometers}} for Brockbank, Earnshaw modified the pivoted <b>detent</b> by mounting the locking piece on a spring, thus dispensing with the pivots. Arnold managed {{to see this}} new idea and promptly took out the 1782 patent for his own design of spring <b>detent,</b> {{but it is not}} known whether this preceded Earnshaw's own idea.|$|E
40|$|A {{composite}} nut {{is shown}} which permits a fastener to be inserted or removed {{from either side}} with an indicator of fastener engagement. The nut has a plurality of segments, preferably at least three segments, which are internally threaded, spring loaded apart by an internal spring, and has <b>detents</b> on opposite sides which force the nut segments into operative engagements with a threaded member when pushed in and release the segments for quick insertion or removal of the nut when moved out. When the nut is installed, end pressure {{on one of the}} <b>detents</b> presses the nut segments into operative engagement with a threaded member where continued rotation locks the structure together with the <b>detents</b> depressed to indicate positive locking engagement of the nut. On removal, counterclockwise rotation of the nut relieves the endwise pressure on the <b>detents,</b> permitting internal springs to force the <b>detents</b> outward and allowing the nut segments to move outward and separate to permit quick removal of the fastener...|$|R

25|$|Arnold's pivoted <b>detent</b> {{escapement}} did {{not need}} oil on acting surfaces, with the advantage {{that the rate of}} action did not deteriorate, and remained stable for long periods. At the time, only vegetable oil was available, which degraded quickly compared to modern lubricants.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, a year later, in 1783, Earnshaw—through another watchmaker, Thomas Wright—took out {{a patent}} that {{included}} Earnshaw's pattern of integral compensation balance and spring <b>detent</b> escapement in the multiple specification. However, {{both of these}} were undeveloped and compared to Arnold's were of little use, the balance especially having to be redesigned.|$|E
25|$|By 1772, Arnold had {{finalized}} {{the design}} of his pocket timekeepers and started series production with a standardized movement caliper, this being around 50mm in diameter, larger than a conventional watch of the period, and showing seconds with a pivoted <b>detent</b> escapement and spiral compensation curb. However, the latter appears to have proved ineffective, {{which seems to have}} substantially slowed the rate of production.|$|E

25|$|This {{surviving}} watch {{dates from}} around 1769-1770, and is signed Arnold No. 1 Invenit et Fecit. The movement, which indicates centre seconds, has a steel balance with a bimetallic temperature compensation strip that acts {{on the flat}} balance spring. Though now altered, the original escapement was Arnold's horizontal pivoted <b>detent</b> as fitted to the larger timekeepers, which was it seems not entirely successful and needed improvements.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{research}} has established that Arnold's success was {{not due to}} the form of <b>detent</b> escapement, but to his original methods of adjusting the balance spring for positional errors by manipulating the overcoil terminal curve. For obvious reasons, Arnold tried to keep these methods secret, certainly it is recorded that he clearly expressed his concerns about possible plagiarism to Earnshaw, warning him {{in no uncertain terms}} not to use his Helical balance spring.|$|E
25|$|The handle {{material}} of the SARK {{is composed of}} two titanium liners utilizing a Walker linerlock and a double <b>detent</b> as the locking mechanism. The reasons for using titanium as a linerlock material are its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. The handle's scales are made from black G-10 fiberglass, although models were made {{for a few years}} using green G-10. A pocket clip held in place by three screws allows the knife to be clipped to a pocket, web-gear or MOLLE.|$|E

50|$|Many {{cordless}} drills incorporate {{this type}} of torque limiter in a planetary gearset. It may {{be a part of}} an assembly of multiple gearsets used to primarily reduce speed and multiply torque as well as perform ratio changes. The torque limiter is typically the last gearset in the transmission. It uses the planet carrier as the input with the sun gear as the output, and the annulus normally locked. A series of ball <b>detents</b> act on the annulus to lock it, allowing power to be transmitted from the planet carrier to the sun gear. When the torque transmitted through the gearset reaches a determinate amount, the torque acting on the annulus causes it to unlock from its ball <b>detents</b> and freely rotate, causing power to be diverted from the load on the sun gear to the annulus and thereby stalling the output until torque is reduced to an amount where the ball <b>detents</b> can lock the annulus again. This system equally limits torque in both directions of rotation and also works with the sun gear as the input. The compression of the ball <b>detents</b> (and therefore the amount of torque at which the limiter is utilized) is typically adjusted by means of a rotating collar accessible to the user which is indexed and held in place with its own separate ball <b>detents.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Detents</b> are {{for example}} used to simply arrest {{rotation}} {{in one direction}} or to intentionally divide a rotation into discrete increments.|$|R
25|$|Virtually all {{vehicles}} (except many motorcycles {{and commercial}} semi-tractors) have a turn-indicator self-cancelling feature that returns the lever to the neutral (no signal) {{position as the}} steering wheel approaches the straight-ahead position after a turn has been made. Beginning in the late 1960s, indicating for a lane change was facilitated {{by the addition of}} a spring-loaded momentary signal-on position just shy of the left and right detents. The signal operates for however long the driver holds the lever partway towards the left or right turn signal <b>detent.</b> Some recent vehicles have an automatic lane-change indication feature; tapping the lever partway towards the left or right signal position and immediately releasing it causes the applicable turn indicators to flash three to five times.|$|E
25|$|The Umnumzaan {{implements}} {{a version}} of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium lock bar, milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium lock bar comes in direct contact with the back of the blade, thus locking the blade in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a <b>detent</b> in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.|$|E
25|$|At {{a second}} interview, Mr. Cooke told Wheatstone of his {{intention}} to bring out a working telegraph, and explained his method. Wheatstone, according to his own statement, remarked to Cooke that the method would not act, and produced his own experimental telegraph. Finally, Cooke proposed that they should enter into a partnership, but Wheatstone was at first reluctant to comply. He was a well-known man of science, and had meant to publish his results without seeking to make capital of them. Cooke, on the other hand, declared that his sole object {{was to make a}} fortune from the scheme. In May they agreed to join their forces, Wheatstone contributing the scientific, and Cooke the administrative talent. The deed of partnership was dated 19 November 1837. A joint patent was taken out for their inventions, including the five-needle telegraph of Wheatstone, and an alarm worked by a relay, in which the current, by dipping a needle into mercury, completed a local circuit, and released the <b>detent</b> of a clockwork.|$|E

50|$|Ball <b>detents</b> {{are one of}} the {{mechanisms}} often used in folding knives to prevent unwanted opening of the blade when carrying it.|$|R
50|$|The Matrix also {{features}} a removable breech. The breech is able to be removed via a rod that runs {{the entire length of}} the body. The stock breech is threaded to accept Autococker threaded barrels and has a pair of rubber ball <b>detents.</b> The <b>detents</b> can easily be removed and cleaned or replaced using an o-ring pick to remove them and a hex key to push them back in. The completely removable breech leaves ways for aftermarket manufactures to develop new and improved breeches.|$|R
25|$|EVA 1 {{started with}} astronauts Dave Wolf and Tim Kopra {{switching}} their spacesuit power to internal battery at 16:19 UTC. Despite a communication {{problem with the}} spacewalkers, the Japanese Exposed Facility was successfully installed on the Japanese Experiment Module {{by means of a}} complex series of steps involving the robotic arms of both the station and the shuttle. The JEF was first unberthed from the shuttle payload bay by the station arm, after which the shuttle arm took the load. The station arm was then moved to the worksite on Node-2 (Harmony), wherefrom it took the 4.1 ton facility back. The facility was then successfully latched on to the Experiment Module. As part of the EVA, the spacewalkers successfully deployed the port Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attach System (UCCAS), which could not be deployed during STS-119. During the prior mission, the deployment failed due to a jamming caused by a stuck <b>detent</b> pin. Engineers designed a custom tool to force the pin to release, which was used to deploy the mechanism. Meanwhile, the shuttle managers announced {{that there would be no}} need for a focused inspection of the heat shield. The nose cap and wing leading-edge panels of the shuttle were cleared for entry as they were, but a reentry clearance was not given. Beyond one impact site having a gouge, the rest of the impacts were found to be mostly a loss of coating. The other activity scheduled for EVA 1, the deployment of a starboard side cargo carrier, was postponed for want of time. A fuel cell issue found before launch was analyzed, though the cell continued to function as expected with no impact to the mission.|$|E
500|$|Cooke {{had some}} ideas for {{building}} a telegraph prior to his partnership with Wheatstone and had consulted scientist Michael Faraday for expert advice. [...] However, much of the scientific knowledge for the model actually put into practice came from Wheatstone. [...] Cooke's earlier ideas for a mechanical telegraph (involving a clockwork mechanism with an electromagnetic <b>detent)</b> were largely abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the descent, Aldrin {{had called}} out {{navigation}} data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the LM. A few {{moments before the}} landing, a light informed Aldrin {{that at least one}} of the [...] probes hanging from Eagle footpads had touched the surface, and he said: [...] "Contact light!" [...] Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong said [...] "Shutdown." [...] Aldrin immediately said [...] "Okay, engine stop. ACA – out of detent." [...] Armstrong acknowledged [...] "Out of <b>detent.</b> Auto" [...] and Aldrin continued [...] "Mode control – both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm – off. 413 is in." ...|$|E
5000|$|The system {{consists}} of a push button swivel attached to the sling (approximate diameter 9.4 mm, a little under [...] inches) which is placed into a mouting socket on the firearm (approximate diameter 9.6 mm, a little over [...] inches). The swivel is kept in place by a four ball <b>detents</b> connected to the push button, which presses against {{the walls of the}} socket. The sling swivel can quickly be taken on and off by pushing the QD button, which retracts the ball <b>detents.</b> The flush cup sockets can be either rotating or non rotating.|$|R
50|$|A bi-stable {{pneumatic}} valve is typically a pilot valve {{that is a}} 3 ported 2 position <b>detented</b> valve. The valve retains its position during loss of power, hence the bi-stable name.|$|R
50|$|Professional models include {{precision}} bearings, scales {{to allow}} the user to take photos at specific angles, <b>detents</b> to stop at common angles and integrated levels to aid in adjusting the tripod.|$|R
500|$|Nautical {{chronometers}} were {{of great}} importance in the 18th and 19th centuries as aids to navigation. [...] Accurate measurement of time was needed for the determination of longitude. [...] Earnshaw {{was not the first}} to make such chronometers, but {{he was one of the}} first to make them cheaply enough that they started to become essential equipment for a ship at sea. [...] By the time the Beagle set sail it was being reported in The Nautical Magazine that the price of chronometers was dropping rapidly while the same quality was being maintained. [...] Earnshaws' chronometer had a novel escapement mechanism, the spring <b>detent</b> escapement, and a bimetallic strip for temperature compensation so that it would continue to maintain accuracy in all climates around the world.|$|E
500|$|The handle {{material}} of the CQC-6 {{is composed of}} two titanium liners utilizing a Walker linerlock and a single or double <b>detent</b> as the locking mechanism, although one experimental model exists with a ratchet lock. [...] Titanium bolsters make up the front half of the knife with the back half represented by linen micarta scales. The reasons for using titanium as a linerlock material were due to its memory characteristics and corrosion resistance. [...] The screws in the handle, and pivot are traditional straight-head screws to accommodate easy disassembly in the field with an improvised tool, if needed. [...] Most models feature traction grooves for a more secure grip in a wet environment and a chamfered lockface. Early knives were made with black linen micarta and later models featured a proprietary green color made exclusively for Emerson. [...] A pocket clip {{held in place by}} three screws allows the knife to be clipped to a pocket, web-gear, or MOLLE.|$|E
500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only must the spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] <b>detent</b> at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{insisting on}} his notion that China should {{exercise}} liberty of speech, publication, association, and exercise all basic human rights, including organizing political party, {{he had been}} summoned, residential surveillanced, administrative <b>detented,</b> re-education through labor, criminal <b>detented,</b> arrested and sentenced to jail. In the last 43 years (from 1970 to 2012) he had been arrested, detained 39 times, sentenced into jail for 22 years, {{to become one of}} the longest political prisoners in jail during the last four decades. He refused to go abroad before PRC really archives constitutional democracy, and he adhered to sit through the end of the prison.|$|R
50|$|After {{removing}} and inverting the detachable slot-car pin, {{the cars}} {{could also be}} run on the floor, with the front wheels steerable into one of three set positions (left, center, right), held by small <b>detents</b> on the reverse side of the pin.|$|R
50|$|Scrollmice {{almost always}} mount their scroll wheels on an {{internal}} spring-loaded frame and switch, so that simply pushing down makes them {{work as an}} extra button, made easier to do without accidentally spinning it by wheel <b>detents</b> present in most scrollmice. Thus most mice today effectively have three buttons.|$|R
