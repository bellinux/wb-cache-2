40|$|Politically <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> {{have become}} a {{specific}} risk factor in money laundering. The Financial Action Task Force has formulated clear and specific requirements for dealing with these individuals. Internationally, various jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and the European Union have adopted effective legislation encompassing the 2003 Financial Action Task Force Recommendations. In South Africa the requirement to apply appropriate, risk based procedures to politically <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> has been limited to banks. The aim of this research {{study was to identify}} whether the South African anti-money laundering regulatory framework, adequately addresses managing the risks of politically <b>exposed</b> <b>persons.</b> The regulatory frameworks of the United Kingdom and the European Union, as well as the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force, were used to determine whether best practice is followed in South Africa with regard to politically <b>exposed</b> <b>persons.</b> The process of how money is laundered has been examined as well as the methods that corrupt politically <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> use in order to launder money. The study has shown that politically <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> are not regulated in South Africa in accordance with the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations issued in 2003, while the South African Anti-Money Laundering Regulatory Framework does not adequately address the risk posed by corrupt, politically <b>exposed</b> <b>persons.</b> Both international best practice and the recommendations of the World Bank were considered in terms {{of the way in which}} to address the risks posed by these persons effectively.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) was detected in Singapore {{at the beginning}} of March 2003. The outbreak, initiated by a traveler to Hong Kong in late February 2003, led to sequential spread of SARS to three major acute care hospitals in Singapore. The critical factor in containing this outbreak was early detection and complete assessment of movements and follow-up of patients, healthcare workers, and visitors who were contacts. Visitor records were important in helping identify <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> who could carry the infection into the community. In the three hospital outbreaks, three different containment strategies were used to contain spread of infection: closing an entire hospital, removing all potentially infected persons to a dedicated SARS hospital, and managing <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> in place. On the basis of this experience, if a nosocomial outbreak is detected late, a hospital may need to be closed in order to contain spread of the disease. Outbreaks detected early can be managed by either removing all <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> to a designated location or isolating and managing them in place...|$|R

40|$|Sister-chromatid {{exchange}} (SCE) {{in blood}} lymphocytes, serum tumors markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and {{tissue polypeptide antigen}} (TPA), and urinary excretion of chromium, cobalt and nickel were determined in 26 male workers occupationally exposed to chromium, cobalt and nickel dust and in 25 controls matched for age and smoking habits. The differences in the urinary excretion of metals between <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> and controls were statistically significant. An analysis of variance on the SCE rank values revealed that both exposure status (<b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> vs. controls) and smoking habits (smokers and former smokers vs. never smokers) had a statistically significant effect. For the tumor markers, the analysis of variance did not reveal {{a statistically significant difference}} between <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> and controls. However, CEA serum levels were significantly correlated not only with smoking habits but also with duration of exposure. As cobalt is only weakly mutagenic, these results suggest that the small amount of absorbed chromium and nickel may have been sufficient to induce SCE. The hypothesis that tumor markers may be increased in groups of subjects exposed to genotoxic substances deserves further study...|$|R
