It was now a month since we had settled the {{theological}} difference, and {{in all that time}} there had been no quarrel. Nor had our peace been the cold daughter of divorce; we had not lived aloof; he had come oftener, he had talked with me more than before; he had spent hours with me, with temper soothed, with eye content, with manner home-like and mild. Kind subjects of conversation had grown between us; he had inquired into my plans of life, and I had communicated them; the school project pleased him; he made me repeat it more than once, though he called it an Alnaschar dream. The jar was over; the mutual understanding was settling and fixing; feelings of union and hope made themselves profoundly felt in the heart; affection and deep esteem and dawning trust had each fastened its bond.|$|R

40|$|Chlorisondamine and {{mecamylamine}} are nicotinic antagonists {{that produce}} both ganglionic and central blockade. Chlorison-damine, when administered {{as a large}} systemic dose, produces a persistent central block, despite being charged. The present study evaluated the cardiovascular effects of chlorisondamine. Shortly after administration, chlorisondamine (0. 10, 1, and 10 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>m.)</b> lowered blood pressure significantly and decreased heart rate at the low dose (0. 1 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>m.)</b> and increased heart rate at the high dose (10 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>m.).</b> Mecamylamine (1 and 10 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>m.)</b> also lowered blood pressure and heart rate. After both antagonists, heart rate returned to baseline values within 90 min and blood pressure within 24 h. Low doses of nicotine (0. 01 – 0. 03 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>m.)</b> lowered blood pressure but did not affect heart rate. Higher doses (0. 10 – 3. 2 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>m.)</b> transientl...|$|R

This {{study was designed to}} establish the most efficient route(s) (systemic, mucosal, or a combination) of immunization for induction of long-term immunity and to define correlates of protection. Mice were immunized orally alone (oral group), intramuscularly (<b>i.</b> <b>m.)</b> alone (<b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> group), orally followed by <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> (oral/i. <b>m.</b> group), or <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> followed by orally (<b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> /oral group). Long-term protective immunity to oral H. pylori challenge was observed 3 months after immunization through the <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> or oral/i. m. route. Protection correlated with an increase in H. pylori-specific interleukin- 12 and both immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG 1) and IgG 2 a serum titers following challenge. Mice that were not protected (oral or <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> /oral) had increased levels of IgA in both sera and Peyer's patches.
