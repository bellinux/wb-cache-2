5|$|The {{moment he}} starts to speak, not at the lectern, but walking around it on cat's paws, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> enchanting. In the Middle Ages, this man would have been sent into exile. He is not only eloquent, he also keeps his {{listeners}} spellbound by his sparking personality, reflected in his small, dark eyes.|$|E
5|$|Desperate for {{something}} to put on, Leslie tells Mark that he should propose to Ann {{in front of the}} camera and he agrees. Not long after, however, Ann confides in Leslie that she wants to break up with Mark, citing that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> not the one. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) tries to make Andy jealous by flirting with someone over the phone, but it backfires when it turns out to be Joe (Kirk Fox) from the Pawnee sewer department. Andy is forced to kick Joe out of the studio when he actually arrives to bring April to his van.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the end, a bus {{shows up}} outside the Krusty Krab, despite Squidward {{claiming}} that the buses do not run this late at night. The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching {{the description of the}} Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately realize that they are experiencing genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung up out of nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking the light switch on and off.|$|E

25|$|Superman/Batman #76 {{looks at}} Superman's {{reaction}} to Dick Grayson assuming {{the role of}} Batman; initially angry at this perceived 'disrespect' to his friend's memory- regarding it as essentially Dick wearing Bruce's skin as Batman was the true identity-, a talk with Wonder Woman helps Superman realise that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> lashing out over his grief at his friend's loss, and he later acknowledges Dick as the new Batman.|$|E
25|$|On {{one hand}} the stranger's opinion {{does not really}} matter because of his lack of {{connection}} to society, {{but on the other}} the stranger’s opinion does matter, because of his lack of connection to society. He holds a certain objectivity that allows him to be unbiased and decide freely without fear. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> able to see, think, and decide without being influenced by the opinion of others.|$|E
25|$|One notable {{change in}} {{plotting}} {{is that in}} the film Théoden is possessed by Saruman, whereas in the book <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> depressed and deluded by Wormtongue. Afterwards, in the film, Théoden is still unsure of what to do, and flees to Helm's Deep. In the book he rides out to war, only ending up besieged when he considers helping Erkenbrand. Erkenbrand does not exist in the films: his character is combined with Éomer as the Rohirrim general who arrives with Gandalf at the film's end. Éomer himself is present during the entire battle in the book.|$|E

25|$|Poirot visits Mertonshire, {{where an}} old friend, Lady Carmichael, gives him {{details of the}} Grant family. All the girls {{are going to the}} bad as their father cannot control them. They keep company with Hawker, who has an {{unpleasant}} reputation, as does another of his 'lady friends', Mrs Larkin. Lady Carmichael is thrilled to think that Poirot has visited to investigate some special crime but the detective tells her <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> there to tame four wild horses. He visits General Grant whose house is filled with artifacts from India. The General himself completes the clichéd picture, sitting in an armchair with his foot bandaged up from gout, drinking port and railing against the world. Poirot breaks the news of the drugs and listens to the old man's cries of anger and sworn threats against whoever is getting his girls into trouble. Leaving the room, Poirot clumsily trips against his host.|$|E
25|$|Critic Randy Rasmussen {{suggests}} that the character of Bill is fundamentally more naïve, strait-laced, less disclosing and more unconscious of his vindictive motives than his counterpart, Fridolin. For Rasmussen and others, the film's Bill Harford is essentially sleep-walking through life with no deeper awareness of his surroundings. In the novella, when his wife discloses a private sexual fantasy, he in turn admits {{one of his own}} (of a girl in her mid to late teens), while in the film <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> shocked. The film's argument over whether he has fantasies over female patients and whether women have sexual fantasies is simply absent from the novella, where both husband and wife assume the other has fantasies. In the film, Bill's estrangement from Alice revolves around her confessing a recent fantasy to him; in the novella, both exchange fantasies, after which she declares that in her youth she could have easily married someone else, which is what precipitates their sense of estrangement.|$|E
25|$|Mulch is a kleptomaniac, {{criminal}} dwarf who {{has been}} involved in crime for about 300 years. When considered with the average Dwarf life span he is not that old, making him nice and spry, a good advantage for a criminal. He once was a mining dwarf, but later decided that stealing from Mud Men (in other words, humans) suited him much better. Because he has stolen from 'Mud Men' Mulch no longer has any significant magic powers of the usual fairy, however he has retained the gift of tongues, and has even shown his ability to speak 'American Dog' in The Arctic Incident. He insists that humans were stealing from fairy-kind and the earth and that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> taking them back or repossessing the items. In the early books, he assisted the LEP against Artemis Fowl, although later, he sides with Artemis Fowl. But eventually, when the fairies and Artemis are on stable ground, he joins forces with The People on many adventures, acting as a LEP helper at the beginning of The Time Paradox.|$|E
50|$|Pythagoras {{lived at}} roughly the same time that Xenophanes did and, in {{contrast}} to the latter, the school that he founded sought to reconcile religious belief and reason. Little is known about his life with any reliability, however, and no writings of his survive, so it <b>is</b> possible that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> a mystic whose successors introduced rationalism into Pythagoreanism, that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> a rationalist whose successors are responsible for the mysticism in Pythagoreanism, or that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> actually the author of the doctrine; {{there is no way to}} know for certain.|$|R

500|$|... "Dances with Smurfs" [...] {{served as}} a parody and social {{commentary}} of the political commentary style of Glenn Beck, a nationally syndicated radio show host and former Fox News Channel political pundit. Cartman makes outrageous claims with no basis for fact under the guise that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> asking rhetorical questions and seeking further discussion. Beck {{has been criticized for}} utilizing a similar style of commentary in his radio and television shows.|$|E

Perry defeats Doofenshmirtz without catching {{the attention of the}} three and the water washes away Candace's toilet paper. When they get outside to meet up with their father, Phineas is dumbfounded as to where their mummy went, but Lawrence thinks <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> referring to their mother and they get into the car. As they ride off, Ferb explains the process of mummification and Candace says that only the [...] "lucky [...] " [...] get the full process.|$|E
500|$|Michael Binstein and Charles Bowden's 1993 book, Trust Me: Charles Keating and the Missing Billions, also {{presents}} Keating {{as a complex}} individual with contradictory tendencies, and concludes:Charlie Keating built things, and, at some level that haunts anyone who looks over his records, he thought his schemes would work. He did not simply rob a bank. He broke a bank with his dreams. If <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> a thief, why did he put the money into deals and projects instead of into his own pocket? If he is just a hardworking businessman simply {{trying to make a}} profit and create jobs, why the need for jets, fancy meals, big paychecks to his family? If he is such a devout communicant of his faith, why did he peddle hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of junk bonds to old people when he knew his empire was in serious jeopardy? ...|$|E

Mohareb offers to take Thalaba through the city and they travel through the cave of Zohak. Zohak, an {{individual}} punished to have snakes constantly eat at his brain, tries to stop them before Mohareb distracts him. The two continue to travel into the dwelling of Haruth and Maruth and, when Mohareb finds out that Thalaba is not evil, attacks him. However, the ring protects Thalaba. After Mohareb claims that magic was the only reason why Thalaba lives, Thalaba decides {{to get rid of}} the ring into a pit before the two resume fighting.

500|$|The 13th season also {{continued}} a South Park tradition of lampooning celebrities and timely issues. The episode [...] "Margaritaville" [...] satirized the global recession affecting {{much of the}} industrialized world {{at the time of}} the episode's broadcast. Parker and Stone said they had long planned to do an episode about the recession, but did not want to rush it because they wanted to make sure the script was strong. [...] "Fatbeard" [...] was based on real-life piracy in Somalia, which began receiving increasing international media attention in 2008; the Somali pirates are portrayed in a sympathetic light in the episode. [...] "Dances with Smurfs" [...] parodied the political commentary of Glenn Beck, a nationally syndicated radio show host and Fox News Channel political pundit. In the episode, Cartman makes outrageous claims with no basis in fact under the guise that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> asking rhetorical questions and seeking further discussion, a practice for which Beck has been criticized.|$|E
