40|$|DehIVa {{is one of}} two dehalogenases {{produced}} by the soil- and water-borne bacterium Burkholderia cepacia MBA 4. It acts to break down short-chain <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>acids</b> through a nucleophilic attack and subsequent hydrolysis of an enzyme-substrate intermediate to remove the halide ions from L-enantiomers substituted at the C 2 position (e. g L- 2 -monochloropropionic acid). Dehalogenases are an important group of enzymes that are responsible for breaking down a diverse range of halogenated environmental pollutants. The dhlIVa gene coding for DehIVa was expressed in Escherichia coli and the protein was purified and crystallized using the hanging-drop method. Crystals grown in PEG 4000 and ammonium sulfate diffracted to 3. 1 Å. crystals had a primitive hexagonal unit cell, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 104. 2, c = 135. 8 Å, α = β = 90, γ = 120 °. Determining this structure will provide valuable insights into the characterization of the catalytic mechanisms of this group of enzymes. © 2005 International Union of Crystallography.

40|$|Plants are {{increasingly}} being employed to clean up environmental pollutants such as heavy metals; however, a major limitation of phytoremediation is the inability of plants to mineralize most organic pollutants. A key component of organic pollutants is <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> compounds that include 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1, 2 -DCA). Although plants lack the enzymatic activity required to metabolize this compound, two bacterial enzymes, haloalkane dehalogenase (DhlA) and haloacid dehalogenase (DhlB) from the bacterium Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ 10, {{have the ability to}} dehalogenate a range of <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatics,</b> including 1, 2 -DCA. We have engineered the dhlA and dhlB genes into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum ‘Xanthi’) plants and used 1, 2 -DCA as a model substrate to demonstrate the ability of the transgenic tobacco to remediate a range of <b>halogenated,</b> <b>aliphatic</b> hydrocarbons. DhlA converts 1, 2 -DCA to 2 -chloroethanol, which is then metabolized to the phytotoxic 2 -chloroacetaldehyde, then chloroacetic acid, by endogenous plant alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, respectively. Chloroacetic acid is dehalogenated by DhlB to produce the glyoxylate cycle intermediate glycolate. Plants expressing only DhlA produced phytotoxic levels of chlorinated intermediates and died, while plants expressing DhlA together with DhlB thrived at levels of 1, 2 -DCA that were toxic to DhlA-expressing plants.

The crude extracts of Escherichia coli strains expressing mlr 5434 and blr 1087 showed the ability to dehalogenate 18 halogenated compounds, indicating that these ORFs indeed encode haloalkane dehalogenases. Therefore, these ORFs were referred to as dmlA (dehalogenase from Mesorhizobium loti) and dbjA (dehalogenase from Bradyrhizobium japonicum), respectively. The principal component analysis of the substrate specificities of various haloalkane dehalogenases clearly showed that DbjA and DmlA constitute a novel substrate specificity class with extraordinarily high activity towards �-methylated compounds. Comparison of the circular dichroism spectra of DbjA and other dehalogenases strongly suggested that DbjA contains more �-helices than the other dehalogenases.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{methodology for}} {{quantitative structure-activity relationship}} (QSAR) development in environmental toxicology is provided. The methodology is summarized in a strategy with six sequential steps. The strategy rests on two cornerstones, namely (1) the use of statistical design to select a series of representative compounds (the so-called training set) {{on which to base}} a QSAR, and (2) the multivariate modelling of the relationship between physicochemical and biological properties of the training set compounds. The first step of the strategy is the division of chemicals into classes of structurally similar compounds. Briefly, steps 2 to 6 are: (2) physico-chemical and structural characterization of the compounds in a class, (3) selection of a training set of representative compounds, (4) biological testing of the selected training set, (5) QSAR model development, and (6) experimental validation of the QSAR and predictions for non-tested compounds. The thesis summarizes the results obtained from the application of the strategy to the class of <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> compounds. Biological measurements were made in four biological test systems, reflecting acute toxicity, mutagenicity, relative cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. QSARs were developed relating each biological endpoint to the structural descriptors of the compounds. Multivariate PLS modelling was used in the data analysis. The developed QSARs were used for predicting the biological activity pattern of the non-tested compounds in the class. These predictions may be used {{as a starting point for}} a priority ranking for further biological testing of these compounds.
