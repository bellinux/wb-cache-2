40|$|Techniques are {{available}} to minimize the concentration of asbestos fibers in drinking water. Filtration research conducted at locations on Lake Superior and in the Cascade Mountains in Washington has shown that amphibole and chrysotile fibers can be removed by granular media filtration. Removal percentages can exceed 99 % when the raw water is coagulated properly and the filtered water turbidity is 0. 10 ntu (nephelometric turbidity units) or lower. Filtered water fiber counts below detectable limits of 0. 1 to 0. 01 X 10 (6) fibers/L can be attained. A study by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California showed that when raw water chrysotile counts ranged from 200 X 10 (6) fibers/L to 2000 X 10 (6) fibers/L, filtered water fiber counts frequently exceeded 1 X 10 (6) fibers/L. Even so, striving to attain a filtered water turbidity of 0. 1 ntu resulted in improved fiber removal. Pilot scale and distribution system research projects have shown that asbestos cement (AC) pipes can be protected from dissolution and leaching effects that can result in release of asbestos fibers into drinking water. Suggested techniques include modifying low pH, low alkalinity waters so they are not aggressive; coating the pipe wall with a chemical precipitate; and applying a cement mortar lining to the pipe wall. Operation and maintenance practices related to the distribution system, when AC water mains are in service, can influence the <b>fiber</b> <b>count</b> in tapwater. Main flushing can stir up sediment that accumulates in low-flow and dead-end areas, raising the <b>fiber</b> <b>count.</b> If mains are tapped and the cuttings are not flushed away through the tapping machine, but are instead permitted {{to fall into the}} water main, the <b>fiber</b> <b>count</b> can be raised...|$|E

Air samples were collected for analysis of asbestos fibers at key locations in all the three plants including fiber warehouse and factory main gate {{in order to assess}} the industrial hygiene conditions prevailed in work zone of this factory. A total of 24 samples were collected and analyzed by phase-contrast and polarized-light microscopy. Observations on asbestos fibers collected on membrane filters suggest that they are chrysotile asbestos and their average concentrations ranged between 0. 036 – 0. 148 fiber per cubic centimeter (f/cc) (mean 0. 075 ± 0. 034 f/cc). These <b>fiber</b> <b>counts</b> are less than the existing Indian Standard (0. 5 f/cc). However, <b>fiber</b> <b>counts</b> in the ingredient mixing locations of all the plants of AC factory are higher than the proposed Indian Standard (0. 1 f/cc).

This experiment centered on evaluating the uniformity of fiber dispersion on membrane filters when collected by the NIOSH method and two other methods. Using a dust generator, a mixing chamber, and sampling trains, asbestos fiber samples were collected on membrane filters, using each of the three methods. Wedges cut from the filters were analyzed by phase contrast microscopy to determine the average <b>fiber</b> <b>counts</b> (AFCs) on their inner and outer halves. The difference (D) between both halves was then calculated. From this data, 1) an ANOVA test was employed to determine whether any method had a mean difference (D) which was significantly different from the others, and 2) t tests were used on counts obtained from each method to determine if the average inner area counts (I) were significantly different from the average outer area counts (0).

40|$|My {{comments}} {{are restricted to}} studies involving gastrointestinal exposure of humans and animals to asbestos via the diet or intubation. There have been three studies designed to determine whether human ingestion of asbestos in drinking water {{could result in the}} detection of asbestos in urine or postmortem tissues (1 - 3). One study concluded that ingested asbestos could not be found in human urine (1). However, other studies found evidence that ingested asbestos could penetrate the GI tract, migrate, and be recovered in urine and tissues (2, 3). These two positive human studies were uncontrolled to the extent that inhaled asbestos {{may have contributed to the}} positive findings. Hence, we look to controlled animal studies for confirmation of the human findings, especially with regard to dose. There have been at least 12 animal studies involving rats and baboons (4 - 15). Five rat studies (4 - 8) and two baboon studies (8 - 10) presented evidence of asbestos penetration of the GI tract and/or migration to various tissues. Three rat studies (11 - 13) and two baboon studies (14, 15) found little or no evidence of penetration and migration. The positive animal findings (4 - 10) are not completely convincing for various reasons: (a) the number of fibers observed on a grid opening basis was quite small (8, 10); (b) the qualitative presentation of data prevented numerical comparisons of test and control <b>fiber</b> <b>count</b> data (4, 6); (c) too few control data were obtained (7); and (d) <b>fiber</b> <b>count</b> data were reported in terms of fibers per milligram or milliliter (5).

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was applied to detect the architectural organization of skeletal muscle. This study investigated the feasibility and accuracy of using the DTI to evaluate effectiveness of EPCs treatment. Mouse bone marrow-derived EPCs were isolated, cultured, characterized, and transplanted to hindlimb ischemia mice model. DTI was performed on the hindlimb at postischemia time points. The edema regions of diffusion restriction (high signal in diffusion weighted imaging) were decreased in the ischemic muscle of EPCs treated mice after 14 days compared with the controls. These results from DTI show the lower apparent diffusion coefficient and eigenvalues (λ 1, λ 2, and λ 3) and the higher fractional anisotropy and <b>fiber</b> <b>counts</b> of ischemic muscle on 7 and 14 days after EPCs treatment compared to the controls.

This study employed the Stelometer instrument, which is the traditional fiber tenacity reference method and might still be an option as a rapid screening tool because of its low cost and portable attributes. In addition to flat bundle break force and weight variables from a routine Stelometer test, the number of fibers in the bundle were counted manually and the fiber crystallinity (CIIR) was characterized by the previously proposed attenuated total reflection-sampling device based Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) protocol. Based on the plots of either tenacity vs. linear density or <b>fiber</b> <b>count</b> vs. mass, the fibers were subjectively divided into fine or coarse sets, respectively. Relative to the distinctive increase in fiber tenacity with linear density, there was an unclear trend between the linear density and CIIR for these fibers.

Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) membranes were obtained after solvent evaporation and wrapped around a mandrel. The effectiveness of nerve regeneration was compared with that obtained with polyethylene and PCL extruded prostheses 30 and 60 days after surgery. The comparison between extruded and membrane-derived tubes clearly showed structural differences that were directly proportional to the hardness and transparency. An important factor to be considered is that the <b>fiber</b> <b>count</b> indicated that membrane-derived PCL tubes provided a significantly greater number of axons 30 days after repair. Sixty days after the procedure, the greatest regenerative performance was obtained with PCL, regardless of tube construction method. An intense imunolabeling of S 100, type IV collagen, and laminin could be observed in the tissue obtained from membrane-derived PCL and PLLA groups, indicating that such constructs were able to positively stimulate Schwann cell responses.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{alternative}} signaling method for multi-channel fiber ribbon based optical links. The method {{is based on}} a hybrid of differential signaling and single-ended channels. Channels are grouped into code blocks of n-bits. Each code word transmitted in the block is restricted to conform to an n choose m rule. Electrical drivers steer current between m active VCSELS with no dummy loads. A virtual reference is synthesized from the received signals and used for differential discrimination. This signaling method approaches the signal-to-noise characteristics of fully differential signaling but can be implemented with significantly lower channel overhead, giving as much as a 33 % reduction in <b>fiber</b> <b>count</b> and a 44 % reduction in power. Further, code utilization rates on these links can be as low as 51 %, leaving substantial code space available for ECC or channel management functions.

With an increased focus on allergies, physiological comfort, and fire safety, {{a variety of}} functional coatings (e.g., water-proof, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and/or FR finishes) are now applied to mattress tickings. The majority of modern ticking materials have a high polypropylene and/or polyester <b>fiber</b> <b>count,</b> with the fiber content varying significantly with the fabric structure and design pattern. These tickings are highly flammable, but are not necessarily a greater fire threat, as these synthetic fabrics tend to melt away from the ignition source and self-extinguish.

The present work took for study three types of chemical fibers (wool-type rayon, wool-type polyester, wool-type polyacrylonitrile) and two types of wool fibers S 11 and S 12. The main characteristics of wool type chemical fibers (<b>fiber</b> <b>count,</b> nominal length, breaking length, relative elongation, brightness) and of wool fibers (diameter, almeter length, uster irregularit) have been measured.

The rayon fibers present the biggest torsional rigidity, as compared to the other types of analyzed fibers, both untreated and heat treated. After heat treatment, the rayon fibers considerable improves their handle. The variation coefficient of breaking torsion increases in the case of heat treated polyester and poly-acrylonitrile fibers while for rayon and wool fibers this coefficient decreases. ...|$|E

METHODS Postmortem computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking were performed in 10 deceased subjects. The Likert scale grading of colored fractional anisotropy maps was correlated to the body temperature and intracranial pathology to assess the diagnostic feasibility of postmortem diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tracking. RESULTS Optimal fiber tracking (> 15, 000 fiber tracts) was achieved with a body temperature at 10 °C. Likert scale grading showed no linear correlation (P > 0. 7) to fiber tract counts.

40|$|AbstractThe {{discrete}} {{modeling of}} individual fibers in cement-based materials provides several advantages, including {{the ability to}} simulate the effects of fiber dispersion on pre- and post-cracking composite performance. Recent efforts in this direction have sought a balance between accurate representation of fiber behavior and computational expense. This paper describes a computationally efficient approach to representing individual fibers, and their composite behavior, within lattice models of cement-based materials. Distinguishing features of this semi-discrete approach include: (1) fibers can be positioned freely in the computational domain, irrespective of the background lattice representing the matrix phase; (2) the pre- and post-cracking actions of the fibers are simulated with little computational expense, since the number of system degrees of freedom is independent of <b>fiber</b> <b>count.</b> Simulated pullouts of single fibers are compared with theory and test results for the cases of perfectly-plastic and slip-hardening behavior of the fiber–matrix interface. To achieve objective results with respect to discretization of the matrix, pullout forces are distributed along the embedded lengths of fibers that bridge a developing crack. This {{is in contrast to}} models that lump the pullout force at the crack surfaces, which can lead to spurious break-off of matrix particles as the discretization of the matrix is refined. With respect to fracture in multi-fiber composites, the proposed model matches theoretical predictions of post-cracking strength and pullout displacement corresponding to the load-free condition. The work presented herein is a significant step toward the modeling of strain-hardening composites that exhibit multiple cracking...|$|E

The 2 week control group had a mean number of myelin fibers of 186 +/- 5. 2664, and the HBOT group had a mean number of 2026. 3 +/- 302; this was not statistically significant. The 4 week control group presented a mean of 2495. 1 +/- 479 fibers and the HBOT group presented a mean of 2359. 9 +/- 473; this was not statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} exposure from specific products to evaluate potential risk from roof repair activities. Five asbestos-containing fibered roof coatings and plastic cements, rep-resenting {{a broad range of}} these types of products, were tested in exposure simulations. These products were applied to representative roof substrates. Release of asbestos fibers during ap-plication and sanding of the product shortly thereafter (wet sanding) were tested initially. Other roof substrates were cured to simulate a product that had been on a rooftop for several months and then were tested to evaluate release of fibers during hand sanding and hand scrap-ing activities. Additional tests were also conducted to evaluate asbestos release during product removal from tools and clothing. Two personal (n 5 84) and background/clearance (n 5 49) samples were collected during each 30 -min test and analyzed for total fiber concentration [phase-contrast microscopy (PCM) ] and for asbestos <b>fiber</b> <b>count</b> [transmission electron micros-copy (TEM) ]. PCM concentrations ranged from < 0. 005 to 0. 032 fibers per cubic centimeter (f cc 21). Chrysotile fibers were detected in 28 of 84 personal samples collected. TEM concen-trations ranged from < 0. 0021 to 0. 056 f cc 21. Calculated 8 -h time-weighted averages (TWAs) ranged from 0. 0003 to 0. 002 f cc 21 and were comparable to the background TWA concentra-tion of 0. 0002 f cc 21 measured in this study. Based on these results, it is unlikely that roofers were exposed to airborne asbestos concentrations above the current or historical occupational guidelines during scraping and sanding of these products during roof repair...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There is {{a recent}} trend towards {{integrating}} resting state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (RS-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) for brain connectivity estimation, as motivated by how estimates from these modalities are presumably two views reflecting the same underlying brain circuitry. In this paper, we show on a cohort of 60 subjects that conventional functional connectivity (FC) estimates based on Pearson’s correlation and anatomical connectivity (AC) estimates based on <b>fiber</b> <b>counts</b> are actually not that highly correlated for typical RS-fMRI (~ 7 min) and dMRI (~ 32 gradient directions) data. The FC-AC correlation can be significantly increased by considering sparse partial correlation and modeling fiber endpoint uncertainty, but the resulting FC-AC correlation is still rather low in absolute terms. We further exemplify the inconsistencies between FC and AC estimates by integrating them as priors into activation detection and demonstrating significant differences in their detection sensitivity. Importantly, we illustrate that these inconsistencies can be useful in fMRI-dMRI integration for improving brain connectivity estimation...|$|R
30|$|TA {{muscles were}} {{harvested}} 1, 3, 5, and 7 d following CTX injury. The muscles were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS overnight and paraffin embedded for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The proportion of fibers with central nuclei (regenerating <b>fibers)</b> was <b>counted</b> in the injured area, and the CSAs of the fibers were measured using Image Pro Plus 5.1 software (Olympus).|$|R
40|$|Carbon <b>fibers</b> are <b>counted</b> {{when they}} fall on {{high-voltage}} grid. An arc discharge vaporizes fiber and triggers timer. The equal-duration pulses from timer are integrated by operational amplifier, giving an output voltage that {{is proportional to}} the number of fibers incident after reset switch was opened. If two or more fibers arrive at grid simultaneously, they are vaporized one at a time; thus all of them are counted...|$|R
