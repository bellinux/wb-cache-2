[...] In response, Matt Groening said, [...] "That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal. He thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do." [...] On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W.

[...] The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply {{in the form of a}} short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] in which Bart replied, [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons.

50|$|In the {{six years}} from 2000 to 2006, the U.S. spent $4.7 billion on Plan Colombia, an effort to {{eradicate}} coca production in Colombia. The main result of this effort was to shift coca production into more remote areas and force other forms of adaptation. The overall acreage cultivated for coca in Colombia {{at the end of}} {{the six years}} was found to be the same, after the U.S. <b>Drug</b> <b>Czar's</b> office announced a change in measuring methodology in 2005 and included new areas in its surveys.

2500|$|In 2002, five (former) police {{officers}} created Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, a NGO that {{has gained a}} lot of media attention, showing that support for a regulation of drug sales also comes from the [...] "other side" [...] of the drug war and that maintaining a global corruption pyramid for the tax-free Mafia monopoly isn't a good idea, compared to controlling access, age and quality. The former Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the <b>Drug</b> <b>Czar</b> John P. Walters, has described the drug problem in the United States as a [...] "public health challenge", and he has publicly eschewed the notion of a [...] "war on drugs." [...] He has supported additional resources for substance abuse treatment and has touted random student drug testing as an effective prevention strategy.
