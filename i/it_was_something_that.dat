Known actors such as Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees for the role as Agent Doggett. Both Phillips and Bochner were {{considered}} for the role, but the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. In an interview with, Chris Carter said [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> we all talked about, but I wrote his voice. So, I think he was someone we all came up with together, but his voice {{came out of my}} head.

In 2012 they extended their involvement with Children in Need as they opened the telecast with a performance of their single [...] "Live While We're Young". A prominent annual event in British culture, the group said it was [...] "incredible" [...] {{to be involved in}} Children in Need as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> they had [...] "always watched as children".|$|E
500|$|The Killing Joke is a {{story about}} Batman and the Joker; it isn't about {{anything}} that you're ever going to encounter in real life, because Batman and the Joker are not like any human beings that have ever lived. So there's no important human information being imparted ... Yeah, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> I thought was clumsy, misjudged and had no real human importance. It was just about a couple of licensed DC characters that didn't really relate to the real world in any way.|$|E

The 1979 version {{was produced by}} Richard Gordon, who explains why he and Metzger made their film version: [...] "Well, it hadn't been done since the Bob Hope version, {{it had never been}} done in color, it was a well-known title, had a certain reputation, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> logically could or in fact should be made in England." ...|$|E

[...] "I will say that I was proud of the material, but maybe it's not the best version of Diamond Rio," [...] Olander told the publication. [...] "We were kind of in a no-man's land. We didn't fit in with country radio and we didn't fit with Christian radio. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> wasn't fully realized."

The episode's title is a reference to the Jewish mourning prayer service. Gordon was inspired to write the episode based on his heritage. He noted, [...] "I was always compelled by the Golem mythology. We had never dealt with the horrors of antisemitism {{and the power of the}} word [...] And because I'm Jewish, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was really compelling to me personally." [...] The idea to create a story centering on a Golem, however, had been proposed several times before by [...] "probably every Jewish writer who's passed through", according to Gordon.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E

According to Lopez, {{she knew}} that there was {{something}} [...] "inside of me that I have to offer to this [...] And then, you know, things happen. Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I feel that this song was just meant to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song for me to go through all these kinds of things as an actress with this character. You draw from all different experiences in your life. From way back to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest". [...] "Alive" [...] means [...] "the world" [...] to Lopez because of its positive message and the fact that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> she created with Judd.|$|E

[...] Would I apologize to her if I saw her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age.

500|$|Alan Baker broadly agrees, stating, [...] "There is no {{evidence}} that this was common practice among gladiators. As far as we know, the only time this phrase was used was at an event staged by Claudius." [...] Plass notes that [...] "it is hard to see why or how the phrase came to be used on this occasion if it was not a regular formula. On the other hand, if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Claudius might expect to hear it would more naturally serve in its role as a feed line for his repartee portraying his invincible gaucherie." [...] He comments on the distancing effect of the Latin source and the first person of the Greek source and notes that the interpretation and response by the fighters [...] "seems to be a maneuver within rules governing clemency in the arena".|$|E
500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{was made}} in 1993 for the first season and remained unchanged until Duchovny left the show. Carter sought to make the title an [...] "impactful opening" [...] with [...] "supernatural images". These scenes notably include a split-screen image of a seed germinating {{as well as a}} [...] "terror-filled, warped face". The latter was created when Carter found a video operator who was able to create the effect. The sequence was extremely popular and won the show its first Emmy Award, which was for Outstanding Graphic Design and Title Sequences. Rabwin was particularly pleased with the sequence and felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had [...] "never [...] seen on television before".

[...] The comparison to Animal Farm was reiterated by SLG Publisher Dan Vado and critic Carl Doherty. In an interview with PhilStar Global, famed writer Neil Gaiman described the work as [...] "heartbreaking and funny", adding that it is [...] "beautifully drawn."

[...] He was also critical of the Scientology organization leadership, including its head David Miscavige: [...] "I think that there are probably things of Scientology that are valuable and that can help people - my main issue is not with Scientology per se, it is with Scientology the organization - it is a corrupt I believe and probably a criminal endeavor, and that has to do with people who are in charge of Scientology mainly David Miscavige..." ...|$|E
500|$|Watoosh! saw {{the band}} mixing {{multiple}} genres and making diverse {{songs on the}} same album, stretching from hip hop to indie and ska punk. However, this evolved into a more collected sound that was a mix of fewer genres on their second album, Billy Talent. The result of {{this has not been}} described by the band as their defining sound and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> appeared to them after experimenting with different styles. [...] On Billy Talent II, the band altered their sound yet again, based on more mid-tempo and emotional compositions; a bit more collected than their previous work. It was also based on far less angst and aggression behind the production, things that were known factors behind their debut. [...] In their music there are raw and frequent backup vocals heavily collaborated by main vocals, quick changes between loud and quiet, and Kowalewicz's characteristic vocals which are the key elements that emphasize that assertion.|$|E

500|$|On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards {{were awarded}} Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and {{life-saving}} efforts {{during the second}} depot-laying journey. [...] Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers. [...] The young wireless operator, Lionel Hooke, joined Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd and was responsible for many technological innovations. [...] He became the company's managing director in 1945 and its chairman in 1962, having been knighted for services to industry in 1957. Of the four dogs who survived the trek, Con was killed by the other dogs in a fight before the rescue. The others, Oscar, Gunner and Towser, returned in the ship to New Zealand and were placed in Wellington Zoo, where Oscar lived, allegedly, {{to the age of}} 25. Near {{the end of his life}} Dick Richards, the last survivor of the party, was without regrets and did not regard the struggle as futile.

500|$|Singer {{turned down}} {{directing}} opportunities with films like The Truman Show and The Devil's Own after {{the success of}} The Usual Suspects. He instead pursued Apt Pupil: [...] "It was a very dark subject matter, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> came from passion." [...] He acknowledged in retrospect that Apt Pupil [...] "wasn't really {{supposed to be a}} big success". Singer was financially supported by producer Scott Rudin and the production company Spelling Films. Ian McKellen was cast as Dussander, and Brad Renfro was cast as Bowden. With $1million paid toward pre-production, filming was scheduled to begin in June 1996. Due to financial disagreements between Singer and Rudin, the start date was pushed back and subsequently canceled. [...] Singer and his production team stayed together while producer Don Murphy and his partner Jane Hamsher sought refinancing. Mike Medavoy, a former chairman of TriStar Pictures, rescued the production with the financial backing of his production company Phoenix Pictures. The company provided filmmakers with $14million to produce Apt Pupil. Filming took place on location in Altadena, California. Singer related to how Todd Bowden rebelled against his suburban environment. The director used the name of his high school football team, the Pirates, and the green-and-gold team colors in the film, saying, [...] "I just projected my own childhood right out to Southern California." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1994, {{the label}} {{arranged}} her {{to fly to}} London and meet with producer Tom Bailey. They recorded the songs [...] "I Want You", [...] "Fly" [...] and [...] "Just Like Honey", which was later re-recorded by Keith Fernley of Bailey's group Babble with {{a different set of}} lyrics and became the song [...] "Father's Field". Lords used lyrics she had previously written in New Zealand based on her personal journals she kept since she was a child. After finishing her recording with Bailey, Lords wanted something with a harder edge to add another dimension to her album. She was introduced to producer Ben Watkins of the electronic group Juno Reactor and decided to incorporate more rave sound. Mainly inspired by the music she would hear at warehouse parties during her stay in London, Lords teamed up with American singer Wonder with whom she created the lyrics to the song [...] "Control". Lords later commented on the inspiration behind the album's sound: [...] "It was in England that I fell in love with techno music. I was working in the UK doing some modelling a couple of years ago, and I was sharing a flat with some other girls in South London. We were really broke, and the cheapest place to go and have a good night out were raves - you could get in for about three bucks. So I went to a lot of raves and clubs, and I {{fell in love with the}} music - <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> wasn't happening in the States at the time."
