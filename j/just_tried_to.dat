While most critics agreed that it successfully captured the essence of its sample, they also pointed out technical shortcomings and outdated gameplay.|$|E

Dongalor also tries staging a tragic play with a boy saying goodbye to his dog because his father cannot afford the pet due {{to the death of}} his mother, but the Pagan women are unmoved, although Dongalor cries like a baby. Meanwhile, Longshaft tells Kröd and his three friends to go to the Hessemeel Mountains, through the Forest of Certain Death, and light a pyre {{at the top of a}} tower to warn the other freedom fighters about the pending danger. The foursome go through the forest, where they find a strong man has been savagely killed. They are approached by three beautiful wenches, who insist a group of banshees <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> kill them. When they seek romance from the group, the homosexual Bruce is the only one who is skeptical, until the wenches bring a gay man from the forest for him. The wenches, who are revealed to be Succubi, impregnate Loquasto and Zezelryck after kissing them, as does the Incubus after kissing Bruce.|$|E

500|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of Metroid Prime, Nintendo asked Retro Studios {{to produce a}} sequel. The developers decided against recycling {{the features of the}} first game, and instead used new sound models, weapon effects, and art designs. They also implemented the Screw Attack and wall jumping features seen in previous Metroid games, which were not incorporated in the first Prime due to time constraints. Another element considered for the previous game was the multiplayer component. Since the game was a first-person adventure and its deathmatch mode could not easily replicate other shooters in the market, Retro <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> [...] "make a multiplayer experience that fans of Metroid games would instantly know and recognise".|$|E
500|$|On how {{continuity}} was emphasized {{during the}} making of the episode, Bochco explained that for each of the episode's five acts there was a different stage of hair, makeup, and wardrobe so the crew could depict the physical changes to Simmons as time progresses. Rather than try and film the episode in complete order, which was [...] "impossible" [...] due to location scheduling needs, the production <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> avoid changing from one stage to another, and then back again. On how much the episode shows 'the entity' on the planet, Bochco and Titley compared it to the shark in Jaws, with this episode just showing [...] " [...] fin from time to time", and a bigger reveal of the creature coming in a later episode.|$|E

Powell said that [...] "It's quite interesting to have two people's viewpoints within the same song. I'm not sure how many bands actually do that. In most bands, the guitarist writes the music and the singer writes the lyrics. We tend to share things out more evenly." [...] He also criticised the attachment of an indie pop label to the band, saying [...] "We're seen as one of the indie bands. But we've always <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make pop music.

[...] Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton conceded that his teammate had done a [...] "fantastic job," [...] stating that [...] "t the end of the day, he was quicker during the race." [...] Speaking about his start at the post-race press conference, Hamilton explained that his car suffered from a lot of wheelspin, which made him get off the line slowly.

500|$|The writers {{made several}} other changes going from season one to season two, {{including}} making the scripts more focused around the entire cast {{rather than just}} Leslie. They also tried to make Leslie appear more intelligent in the second season after receiving audience feedback that she appeared [...] "ditzy", which Michael Schur said was never their intention. Schur said, [...] "In the end, we just felt that Amy is an enormously likable presence on screen, so as the season went on we <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> create situations where that would shine through." [...] During the episode [...] "Kaboom", a major subplot was resolved when the large construction pit that Leslie had long sought {{to turn into a}} park was filled with dirt and turned into a lot. The pit was first established in the premiere episode and had been a focal point of the series since the show began. Schur said while the pit project was originally conceived as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal, and it was expected to only become a park during the series finale. However, Schur said he felt the early episodes were too focused on the pit and had led viewers to believe the entire show was about filling the pit, which was not the writers' intention, so they accelerated the resolution of that story arc. The idea of Ben and Chris, two state auditors who come in from outside Pawnee to help the town deal with budget problems, was conceived from news reports at the time of a number of states considering shutting down schools, parks and other services due to the global recession.|$|E
500|$|The year 1983 saw Streep play {{her first}} non-fictional character, the nuclear {{whistleblower}} and labor union activist Karen Silkwood {{who died in}} a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant, in Mike Nichols's biographical film Silkwood. Streep felt a personal connection to Silkwood, and in preparation she met with people close to the woman, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality. She said, [...] "I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> look at what she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside." [...] Jack Kroll of Newsweek considered Streep's characterization to have been [...] "brilliant", while Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens expressed approval in that Streep had played Karen as a human being rather than a myth, despite Karen's father Bill thinking that Streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down. Pauline Kael believed that Streep had been miscast. Streep next played opposite Robert De Niro in the romance Falling in Love (1984), which was poorly received, and portrayed a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II in the British drama Plenty (1985), adapted from the play by David Hare. For the latter, Roger Ebert wrote that she conveyed [...] "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms." [...] In 2008, Molly Haskell praised Streep's performance in Plenty, believing it to be [...] "one of Streep's most difficult and ambiguous" [...] films and [...] "most feminist" [...] role.|$|E

500|$|Entering the 2005–06 season, Horton {{stated in}} {{response}} to a question about his shoulders, [...] "I feel better. I feel stronger, bigger." [...] In the season opener against the Atlanta Thrashers, Horton scored the first goal for the Panthers. Through the first games of the season, Horton was tied for the team lead in goals. On November 8, 2005, Horton was placed on injured reserve because of a knee injury. He was activated on December 1 and scored in his first game back against the Washington Capitals to help the Panthers win 32. Horton added 2 goals against the Chicago Blackhawks in the Panthers' next game to bring his season total to 10 in 17 games. Against the Nashville Predators on December 13, Horton recorded his first career hat trick and stated after the game that, [...] "It's a pretty nice feeling. I felt like there was no one on me. I <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get it to the net and it went in every time." [...] Despite missing 10 games to injury, Horton was tied with teammate Olli Jokinen for the team lead in goals with 16 after 38 games. Against Washington on January 9, Horton and Joe Nieuwendyk scored a goal in the shootout to help the Panthers win 43. Two days after his shootout goal, Horton was promoted to the Panthers' first line. Despite his promotion to the first line, Horton's name was mentioned in a potential trade with the Vancouver Canucks; however, nothing materialized. [...] In a 62 win over the Ottawa Senators, Horton scored 2 goals including one on a rebound, after which he said, [...] "It just popped right out to me. It was a long time coming for goals for me. I got lucky tonight and hopefully they keep going in." [...] In March, Horton began playing in penalty kill situations for the first time in his career. Also against the Lightning, Horton scored the Panthers' only goal with his 27th goal of the season. Horton completed the season playing 71 games, scoring 28 goals and adding 19 assists.|$|E

When asked about the play, Moore answered, [...] "Why do I {{need to talk about}} that? I don't understand why y’all keep asking about that play. ... I think it was a miscue with the handoff." [...] After consulting Sanchez and his assistant coaches, Jets head coach Rex Ryan echoed the analysis: [...] "My understanding is, I thought [...] reversed out the wrong way. That's what happened.

2500|$|Scates {{was highly}} {{competitive}} {{both as a}} player and a coach, and he designed his practices to underscore competition and intensity. Practices moved at a high pace, with high repetitions and little time between drills. [...] "I ran shorter drills and quicker, and I didn’t stop the drills to explain things very much. I <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> coach and keep things going at the same time." [...] John Wooden was a major influence on Scates and eventually a lifelong friend. [...] "I used to sit up there and watch him when we weren’t practicing. I learned a lot from that. I liked how he changed drills very quickly. He didn’t have any down time. And then I read a book he wrote in 1965 called 'Practical Modern Basketball.'" ...|$|E
