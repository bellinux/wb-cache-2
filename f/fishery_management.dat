5|$|While {{large enough}} to perhaps be dangerous, the bignose shark seldom comes into contact with humans due to its {{preference}} for deep water. This species is a bycatch of gillnet, bottom trawl, and deep-set pelagic longline fisheries (particularly those targeting tuna) {{in many parts of}} its range. It is regularly taken in Cuban waters and used to produce liver oil, shagreen, and fishmeal. Elsewhere, such as in Southeast Asia, the meat is consumed and the fins shipped to East Asia for shark fin soup. The bignose shark is not used commercially in United States, where it is listed as Prohibited Species under the 2007 <b>Fishery</b> <b>Management</b> Plan for Atlantic tunas, swordfish and sharks, or in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled {{electric ray}} (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis. A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific <b>Fishery</b> <b>Management</b> Council.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> is {{a complex}} task, many {{countries}} in the world have managed to develop <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> regimes that can improve the economic efficiency of the fisheries.

Community-based cooperative <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> is one of the property rightsbased <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> systems, which has received attention in recent years particularly in the developing countries. In Tanzania, community-based cooperative <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> seems a feasible option because the current system is entirely based on common property and an open access approach.

40|$|For much of {{the last}} half century {{fisheries}} managers have grappled with what is needed to achieve effective fisheries governance.

Additional protection for scallops was given closing parts of Georges Bank to groundfish fishing. The scallops recovered.|$|E
25|$|The Miami Terrace {{and other}} areas of deep sea coral can be damaged by certain kinds of fishing gear such as bottom {{trawling}} or dredging.

25|$|Another major area {{of concern}} for the DFG was water flow. By mid-July each year, snowpack in the {{mountains}} (the major source of water for the Smith River) had completely melted away. Combined with irrigation in the upper Smith River, this meant that water levels on the Smith were too low by mid-summer to support recreational boating or floating. Low water levels also hurt the sport fishery, but although DFG attempted to secure additional water rights these efforts largely failed over the next 20 years. In 1974, DFG abandoned its attempt to manage the Smith River as a sport fishery, and instead began implementing a wild trout <b>fishery</b> <b>management</b> plan. This meant stocking only native fish, as needed, and no more stocking of nonnative sport fish.|$|E

40|$|Fisheries {{are subject}} to a deep-rooted problem of {{economic}} inefficiency, {{often referred to as}} the fisheries problem. The fisheries problem derives fundamentally from inappropriate social institutions controlling the fishing activity, the foremost of which is the common property arrangement. <b>Fisheries</b> <b>management</b> consists of replacing these institutions with more appropriate ones. Which institutions are most appropriate depends on the social objectives of the fisheries. There are strong economic arguments for the view that there should be only a single objective, namely to maximize the present value of the flow of benefits from the fisheries. In reality, different interest groups often push for several, often conflicting, objectives. In that case a multi-objective programming approach may be appropriate. A set of institutions to manage fisheries is referred to as the <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> regime. The <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> regime consists of a (i) <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> system, (ii) <b>fisheries</b> enforcement system and (iii) fisheries judicial system. Each one of these has to be appropriately designed and implemented. The efficacy of the overall <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> regime cannot be greater than that of its weakest link. At the same time it is of the greatest importance to keep an eye on the cost of <b>fisheries</b> <b>management.</b> Global evidence suggests that the cost of <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> often constitutes a substantial fraction of the value of the harvest. The problem, thus, is to strike the right balance between the efficacy of the <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> regime and its cost of design, implementation and operation. The problem of <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> is by its nature multidisciplinary. It involves marine ecology and biology, mathematics, economics, game theory, political science and anthropology to name a few. The problem is, moreover, typically quite complex, requiring powerful modelling and calculation techniques.

25|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{have become increasingly}} prominent for reef management. MPAs promote responsible <b>fishery</b> <b>management</b> and habitat protection. Much like national parks and wildlife refuges, and to varying degrees, MPAs restrict potentially damaging activities. MPAs encompass both social and biological objectives, including reef restoration, aesthetics, biodiversity, and economic benefits. However, {{there are very few}} MPAs that have actually made a substantial difference. Research in Indonesia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea shows that there is no significant difference between an MPA site and an unprotected site. Conflicts surrounding MPAs involve lack of participation, clashing views of the government and fisheries, effectiveness of the area, and funding. In some situations, as in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, MPAs can also provide revenue, potentially equal to the income they would have generated without controls, as Kiribati did for its Phoenix Islands.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008, {{commercial}} fisheries in both Oregon and California were closed {{due to the}} extremely low population of Chinook salmon present. The low population is being blamed on {{the collapse of the}} Sacramento River run, one of the biggest south of the Columbia. In April 2009 California again canceled the season. The Pacific <b>Fishery</b> <b>Management</b> Council’s goal for the Sacramento River run is an escapement total (fish that return to freshwater spawn areas and hatcheries) of 122,000–180,000 fish. The 2007 escapement was estimated at 88,000, and the 2008 estimate was 66,000 fish. Scientists from universities and federal, state, and tribal agencies concluded the 2004 and 2005 broods were harmed by poor ocean conditions in 2005 and 2006, in addition to “a long-term, steady degradation of the freshwater and estuarine environment.” Such conditions included weak upwelling, warm sea surface temperatures, and low densities of food.|$|E
