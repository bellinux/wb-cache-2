5|$|Aspects of Raonic's game which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> {{include his}} return of serve, quickness and mobility, backhand, short game, {{and the use}} of {{backspin}} or sidespin. His above-average height—196cm (6ft 5in)—is linked to his strong serve, but is said to limit his movement around the court.|$|E
5|$|Aspects of Scouting {{practice}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> as too militaristic. Military-style uniforms, badges of rank, flag ceremonies, {{and brass}} bands were commonly {{accepted in the}} early years because they were a part of normal society, but since then have diminished or been abandoned in both Scouting and society.|$|E
5|$|Numerous feminist {{movements}} and ideologies have {{developed over the}} years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of feminism <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives.

5|$|The Marvel vs. Capcom {{series has}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, who have praised its fast-paced gameplay, animated visuals, and wealth of playable characters. On the other hand, the games <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for {{their lack of}} content, especially more recent installments. The series has enjoyed broad appeal, especially in markets outside of Japan, selling approximately 8.4 million units as of September 2017.|$|E
5|$|The claims <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for {{ignoring}} {{that the second}} law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of self-organizing life.|$|E
5|$|The media <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for {{focusing}} {{more on the}} First Lady's fashion {{sense than}} her serious contributions. She said after the 2008 election that {{she would like to}} focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families. In 2008 U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance, and has stated that Obama is miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.|$|E

5|$|D.O.-granting U.S. {{medical schools}} have {{curricula}} identical {{for the most}} part to those of M.D.-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations through the major specialties of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, who {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E
5|$|These modernizations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> by some naval historians, {{given that}} not only these ships would {{eventually}} prove to be inferior to the British battleships {{they were meant to}} face (namely the Queen Elizabeth-class), since by the time the decision to proceed was taken a war between Italy and the United Kingdom seemed more likely, but also because the cost of the reconstruction would be not much less than the cost of building a brand new Littorio-class battleship; moreover, the reconstruction work caused bottlenecks in the providing of steel plates, that caused substantial delays {{in the construction of the}} modern battleships, which otherwise might have been completed at an earlier date.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{repetitive}} {{actions and}} long-playing times, 4X games <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for excessive micromanagement. In {{early stages of}} a game this is usually not a problem, but later in a game directing an empire's numerous settlements can demand several minutes to play a single turn. This increases playing-times, which are a particular burden in multiplayer games. 4X games began to offer AI governors that automate the micromanagement of a colony's build orders, but players criticized these governors for making poor decisions. In response, developers have tried other approaches to reduce micromanagement, and some approaches have been more well received than others. Commentators generally agree that Galactic Civilizations succeeds, which GamingNexus.com attributes to the game's use of programmable governors. Sins of a Solar Empire was designed to reduce the incentives for micromanagement, and reviewers found that the game's interface made empire management more elegant. On the other hand, Master of Orion III reduced micromanagement by limiting complete player control over their empire.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> {{for making}} {{statements}} supporting peace and respecting national sovereignty, but while carrying out military actions {{such as in}} Grenada, fomenting a civil war in Colombia to break off Panama, and Iraq. The U.S. <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for advocating free trade but while protecting local industries with import tariffs on foreign goods such as lumber and agricultural products. The U.S. <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for advocating concern for human rights while refusing to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The U.S. has publicly stated that it is opposed to torture, but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for condoning it in the School of the Americas. The U.S. has advocated a respect for national sovereignty but has supported internal guerrilla movements and paramilitary organizations, such as the Contras in Nicaragua. The U.S. <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for voicing concern about narcotics production {{in countries such as}} Bolivia and Venezuela but doesn't follow through on cutting certain bilateral aid programs. The U.S. <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for not maintaining a consistent policy; it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> accused of denouncing alleged rights violations in China while supporting alleged human rights abuses by Israel.|$|R

5|$|Because the {{governor}} controls so many appointments to commissions—approximately 2,000 {{according to a}} 1992 estimate—the office has been historically {{considered one of the}} most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, {{the governor}} is given wide discretion in awarding state contracts, further augmenting his influence. In the second half of the 20th century, attempts were made to curb the use of the governor's appointment power for political patronage. During his second term in office, Happy Chandler issued an executive order creating a merit system that forbade the hiring or firing of state employees for political reasons; his successor, Bert T. Combs, pushed a new merit system through the legislature, protecting it from abolition by executive order. Despite the presence of the merit system, many governors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for abusing their appointment power. In 2005, Ernie Fletcher and several members of his administration were indicted for violating the merit system in their hiring practices; the charges were later dropped as part of an agreement with the prosecutor, Attorney General Greg Stumbo.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general views <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for {{not fully}} {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors {{when there are}} numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E
5|$|GRCs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> as {{creating}} unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one {{vote in a}} GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one vote in a SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP {{that he or she}} does not like. The situation is {{compounded by the fact that}} a 30% deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.|$|E

5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} judges <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized.</b> The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges, who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning {{such things as the}} children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of the}} country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E
5|$|The only extant {{pieces of}} the Consolatio are fragments, of which seven were {{preserved}} by the early Christian author Lactantius in his work Divinarum Institutionum (The Divine Institutes). In the work, Lactantius used the excerpt from the Consolatio both {{to point out the}} futility of paganism, as well as to argue that pagans actually accept some tenets of Christianity, without them even realizing it. Lactantius criticized what Cicero wrote, but also applauded Cicero for paralleling—albeit coincidentally—what the Bible says at times. However, the quotes preserved by Lactantius <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> due to their lack of context. MacKendrick notes that Lactantius was using partial quotations in order to frame what Cicero wrote so that Lactantius could more easily refute his ideas. Other excerpts from the Consolatio were preserved by Cicero himself, of which two sections were quoted by him in his Tusculanae Disputationes.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E
