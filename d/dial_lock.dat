5000|$|Low digits: in {{the days}} of rotary dial telephones, using only those digits that require the least dial {{rotation}} (1 and 2) permitted a <b>dial</b> <b>lock</b> in hole 3 to effectively disable unauthorised access to the telephone network without preventing access to the emergency number 112. The same choice also maximised dialling speed. Additionally, telephone systems used pulse dialling instead of later DTMF tones; briefly activating the hook once has the same effect as dialling [...] "1", so repeatedly pushing the hook might result in calling 1-1-1. For this reason, Germany's police emergency number was changed from 111 to 110. With numeric keypads, pressing only the first and second button on the keypad is marginally easier in a difficult situation than other keys.|$|E
30|$|Calipers are the {{orthotic}} devices used in SCI {{cases with}} injury at T 6 –T 9. The classification of calipers {{has been mentioned}} in Fig.  9. They are fitted to the lower limb of SCI patients {{with the help of}} metal rods. KAFO is a type of orthotic device which stabilizes knee, ankle and foot, where the knee is supported by a caliper. In some cases, the joint is locked using a drop lock, spring loaded lock, cam lock, ball lock, <b>dial</b> <b>lock</b> or a plunger type of lock. The KAFOs are mainly used to support the patients with muscle weakness, upper motor neuron lesions and lost structural integrity [40]. However, combination of KAFO and a Shannon’s brace provides better support. Shannon’s brace is used separately or combined with KAFO to provide waist support, once the patient shows improvement. It helps the patients in restoring his functional abilities. In context to locomotion, it helps a patient to become independent of supportive/mobility aids.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{variation}} of the traditional <b>dial</b> based combination <b>lock</b> wherein the [...] "secret" [...] is encoded in an electronic microcontroller. These are popular for safe and vault doors where tradition tends towards <b>dial</b> <b>locks</b> rather than keys. They allow many valid combinations, one per authorized user, so changing one person's access has no effect on other users. These locks often have auditing features, recording which combination is used at what time for every opening. Power for the lock may be provided by a battery or by a tiny generator set in operation by spinning the dial.|$|R
50|$|The XG-9's {{integrated}} switch for on/off/self-timer/battery {{check was}} removed and its functions {{spread around the}} camera. The self timer was relocated to a switch {{on the front of}} the camera, on the left-hand side of the mirror housing. A new main on-off switch was placed beneath the shutter speed <b>dial.</b> The <b>lock</b> button for the shutter speed dial also functioned as a battery check; the front LED, also used for the self-timer, lit when that button was pressed and the batteries held adequate charge. Film speed and exposure compensation settings were moved to beneath the rewind knob.|$|R
50|$|Another night, {{the plaster}} from Henry's attic wall starts coming off, {{revealing}} two master <b>lock</b> <b>dials</b> {{to a hundred}} little locked cupboards. When they are home alone, Henry and Henrietta discover a key {{in one of the}} cupboards they have managed to open, which unlocks the door into Grandfather's bedroom. There they find a journal which has a map of the cupboards.|$|R
50|$|Full-program auto-exposure soon {{followed}} {{with the advent}} of the Canon A-1 in 1978. This SLR had a 'P' mode on the shutter speed <b>dial,</b> and a <b>lock</b> on the aperture ring to allow the lens to be put on 'Auto' mode. Other manufacturers {{soon followed}} with Nikon introducing the FA, Minolta introducing the X-700 in 1981, and Pentax introducing the Super Program. Olympus, however, continued with 'aperture-priority' automation in their OM system line.|$|R
50|$|A {{dual control}} (dual custody) {{combination}} <b>lock</b> has two <b>dials</b> controlling two <b>locking</b> mechanisms for the door. They are usually configured so that both <b>locks</b> must be <b>dialed</b> {{open at the}} same time for the door to be unlocked. No single person is given both combinations, requiring two people to cooperate to open the door. Some doors may be configured so that either dial will unlock the door, trading off increased convenience for lessened security.|$|R
5000|$|Electronic locks {{as well as}} {{mechanical}} locks {{are available}} on many models of safes. The highest reliability exists for mechanical locks, although they are often more time consuming to open than electronic locks. [...] Some mechanical combination locks have key locks, too, that lock the combination <b>lock</b> <b>dial</b> from turning, thereby precluding casual attempts by anyone with physical access to the safe from trying multiple combinations {{in the hopes of}} unlocking the safe.|$|R

2500|$|Increased [...] in Australia {{has led to}} the {{potential}} for confusion over which number to call in an emergency. As a secondary emergency number, 112 is not guaranteed to work from all technologies; most notably, it does not work from landlines. In order to encourage use of 000, mobile telephones imported commercially into Australia are required to be programmed to treat 000 in the same fashion as 112 (i.e. <b>dialling</b> with key <b>lock</b> enabled, use of any carrier, preferential routing, etc.). On older or privately imported (e.g. roaming from another country) telephones, 000 may not receive such preferential treatment.|$|R

5000|$|Ofo is a [...] "non-docking" [...] {{platform}} for users {{to create what}} {{is said to be}} the world's first bike sharing company. It allows a true bike-sharing model where riders can provide the use of their own bicycles for access to the companies entire team. The [...] "non-docking" [...] platform is committed to solving the traffic problem of urban congestion. First, users need to download the Ofo application, then type in the number on the bicycle and obtain a passcode. Secondly, the user needs to turn the <b>dial</b> on the <b>lock</b> for each number in the passcode aligns with a yellow indicator. Once the passcode is in, simply press the round button to unlock.Thirdly, when the user finishs the trip and wants to return the bike, it simply leaves the bike in any area where bike-parking is allowed. It then becomes ready for the next user. There is no need to find a specially designated docking station.|$|R
5000|$|The R9 was an {{evolutionary}} step from the R8 and appears superficially very similar; {{enough so that}} some have opined {{that it should have}} been simply a Mark II of the R8, or in Leica nomenclature, an [...] "R8.2".2 The silver top-plate color available on the R8 was replaced by an 'Anthracite' color on the R9; black remained available. Another external change was the addition of an LCD frame counter on the top plate between the wind lever and the shutter-speed dial. The mode selector <b>dial</b> gained a <b>lock,</b> after many R8 user complaints that it was too easily moved from the desired setting when handling the camera. The rear LCD display gained a backlight so it could be viewed in dim lighting. The mass of the R9 was reduced by 100g (to 790g) from the R8, achieved by switching to a magnesium casting for the top plate (formerly zinc alloy) and substituting aluminum for steel at the bottom plate's frame. Electronic changes included the ability to tune the sensitivity of matrix metering in steps of 0.1 EV independently of the other metering modes, and several improvements to the flash support. Metz's HSS (High Speed Sync) flash mode was now supported, allowing fill flash at shutter speeds greater than the X-sync speed by the use of many repeated small flashes of the electronic flashgun. This mode could be used from 1/360 to the camera's shortest 1/8000 of a second shutter speed. Also improved was the use of fill-flash at slower shutter speeds and wider apertures, by enabling lower-power illumination modes on modern Metz equipment. The manual flash exposure compensation ability in Program mode was improved, and AE lock was now possible in all automated modes.|$|R
