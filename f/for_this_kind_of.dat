5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, {{as they were in}} a container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E

5|$|The use of Malmö Stadion for concerts has {{increased}} since {{the construction of}} Swedbank Stadion and Malmö FF's departure. Since 2007, several known artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John, Dolly Parton, The Eagles, Kiss, and Rod Stewart have performed at the stadium. Due to the climate in Sweden {{and the lack of}} a retractable roof at the ground, all of these concerts have been held during the European summer, between June–August. The main stage has been placed either facing the Southern Stand, or along one of the short sides of the stadium. The pitch has been covered up with wooden floorboards during the performances to minimize the damage done to the grass. Many spectators complained about the less than impressive sound quality at both the Elton John and Dolly Parton concerts, citing the stadiums layout as unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> concert.|$|E

25|$|Cosmopolitan {{democracy}}, {{also known}} as Global democracy or World Federalism, is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, {{the people who are}} affected by decisions also have a say in them.|$|E

Perhaps the modern 'naming and shaming' comes closest. The importance of respectability, reputation and public standing were critical in this case, as so often in traditional societies.|$|E
25|$|The {{daily dose}} of {{reserpine}} in antihypertensive treatment is as low as 0.1 to 0.25mg. The use of reserpine as an antipsychotic drug had been nearly completely abandoned, but more recently it made a comeback as adjunctive treatment, {{in combination with other}} antipsychotics, so that more refractory patients get dopamine blockade from the other antipsychotic, and dopamine depletion from reserpine. Doses <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> adjunctive goal can be kept low, resulting in better tolerability. Originally, doses of 0.5mg to 40mg daily were used to treat psychotic diseases.|$|E

In response, part of the labor movement wanted to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for NAFTA's rejection in Congress. Ultimately, the ambivalence of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor side agreement too much would cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner among Democrats, and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from Mexico.|$|E

His playing was marked by definition—where other pianists' playing became blurry-sounding from overuse of the pedal or deficiencies in finger technique, Rachmaninoff's textures were always crystal clear. Only Josef Hofmann and Josef Lhévinne shared this kind of clarity with him. All three men had Anton Rubinstein as a model <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> playing—Hofmann as a student of Rubinstein's, Rachmaninoff from hearing his famous series of historical recitals in Moscow while studying with Zverev, and Lhevinne from hearing and playing with him.|$|E

It can deliver several watts of radio frequency power at a frequency of several gigahertz and {{it also has a}} control terminal, the base. However, it is not widely used since it requires voltages exceeding 200 volts to work properly, while gallium arsenide or other compound semiconductor FETs deliver a similar performance while being easier to work with. A similar device structure, proposed more or less in the same period in the paper , was the IMPISTOR, being a transistor with IMPATT collector-base junction.|$|E
