40|$|Currently music {{streaming}} services {{are starting to}} dominate the music industry. Streaming out rule physical records as well as digital download, and by doing so {{music streaming}} has contributed to shift ownership of artefacts with access to ditto. This presentation aims to describe the affordances and surplus values that are connected to such an access service taking the Swedish founded company of Spotify as a case example. By employing Zygmunt Bauman’s concept of Liquid Modernity {{as a way to}} comprehend contemporary society in an encounter with Bruno Latour’s Actor-Network Theory (ANT) I will show how and in what ways accessed music streaming indeed are an networked actor of a liquid nature.   The presentation will <b>focus</b> <b>one</b> <b>main</b> part of my forthcoming thesis Liquid Music Streaming, namely the actor – the Spotify streaming service. According to the ANT analysis, the feature of music streaming needs a number of networked actors in order to act as a music-streaming actor. Foremost music streaming needs an actor e. g. a company that can create a practice of musicking. The analysis of the Spotify Company and its service shows in summary how the company management structure is agile with autonomous working squads that constantly update the service based on user-generated data. Hence the Spotify music streaming are a runaway object, to use Yrjö Engeström’s terminology, a result of subject’s activity and impossible to master or overview from any single point of lookout. Secondly, music streaming needs the actor of distribution channels to reach its primary final cause – the end-user. Distribution of musical goods, e. g. musical files, are networked by Internet Service Providers (ISP) as well as providers of digital devices, the right holders of music and political jurisdictions. Besides these major actors the service is associated to yet other services and products, developers and public institutions, not to forget the end-user. These entities are not solid and static but constantly changing and reshaping. The conclusion will present the Spotify streaming service as an liquid actor that are inescapably intertwined and dependent on several other liquid actors in order to preform its liquid service of streaming. ...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach – A literature search was carried out in order to find definitions of the service concept and expressions about the service characteristics. Databases were searched and 34 articles were used for further analysis. The same procedure was carried out for service characteristics. The articles that were chosen by the databases were reviewed thoroughly and those most relevant to the search topic were chosen. Sixteen leading scholars who had been shaping the service research field were also asked two basic questions. Findings – The analysis of the concept of service and service characteristics shows that the definitions are too narrow and the characteristics are outdated as generic service characteristics. It is suggested that service is used as a perspective. When service is portrayed as a perspective, the approach is clear: it depends on who is portraying the service and on the purpose.

This study utilized data from the General Social Survey, with a sample size of 19, 597. Several multiple regression models were run sequentially to estimate standardized path coefficients for the causal model. Overall, above average satisfaction with life was reported by Canadian respondents. Respondents who were female, younger, married, from high socioeconomic status background, born in Canada, very religious, and demonstrated high level of neighborhood interaction had greater satisfaction with life. Similarly, respondents had greater life satisfaction if they had better health, social contact, leisure activities, more time with family and friends, more enjoyment with volunteer activities, and a greater sense of belonging to the community. Our results suggest that a holistic approach is necessary for understanding the causal process of life satisfaction. A significant number of causal connections contradict some of the findings in literature today. We have provided some possible explanations for these anomalies and policy implications...|$|R

Concern has been raised within the welfare services that these children are involved in levels and types of care that are developmentally inappropriate and that jeopardize their health and development. Despite a vast literature on the psychological impacts of caregiving upon adult carers, there has been little investigation into the impacts upon children. This review <b>focuses</b> on <b>one</b> <b>main</b> area of research that has examined children as caregivers; research on the ‘parentified child’.

Studies suggest that identity development and personality, interpersonal relationships and relationships with an individual’s own children could be affected. How the literature conceptualizes caring and the psychological theories that underpin the concept of parentification are discussed. The empirical studies are then summarized under four headings; precursors to parentification, impacts upon adult relationships, direct impacts upon the child and circumscribed research. Conceptual and methodological limitations are discussed. These include the lack of a clear definition of parentification, and problems with measurement, sampling and design. Finally, recommendations for improving and developing the parentification literature are presented that draw upon studies of resiliency, adult care giving and attachment...|$|R
