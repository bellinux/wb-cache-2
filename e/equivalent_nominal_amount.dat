50|$|The {{concept of}} real {{interest}} rate is useful {{to account for the}} impact of inflation. In the case of a loan, it is this real interest that the lender effectively receives. For example, if the lender is receiving 8 percent from a loan and the inflation rate is also 8 percent, then the (effective) real rate of interest is zero: despite the increased <b>nominal</b> <b>amount</b> of currency received, the lender would have no monetary value benefit from such a loan because each unit of currency would get devaluated due to inflation by the same factor as the <b>nominal</b> <b>amount</b> gets increased.|$|R

40|$|In intertemporal choice {{experiments}} {{people usually}} choose between smaller-sooner and larger-later amounts of money. That is, they make tradeoffs {{in terms of}} <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts.</b> Yet the factor governing intertemporal tradeoffs in the marketplace is usually the interest rate. In this study, we tested whether two major phenomena that occur when trading off <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts,</b> excessive discounting and the hyperbolic-interval effect, would also occur when trade-offs are made in terms of interest rates. They don’t. In a large-scale (N= 1, 960) internet study of Spanish consumers who made intertemporal tradeoffs for money, tradeoffs {{described in terms of}} <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> induced high discount rates and a considerable hyperbolic-interval effect (replicating earlier studies). However, when they were described as both amounts and interest rates, discount rates were much lower, and there was no effect for how finely the interval was partitioned. When the tradeoffs were described as interest rates only, discount rates were even lower, and the hyperbolic-interval effect was reversed. Thus, some of the most-cited results in intertemporal choice research are unique to a specific way of eliciting discount rates...|$|R
