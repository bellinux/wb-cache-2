5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should <b>I</b> <b>apologize?</b> If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
25|$|Because Wyclef {{produced}} {{the majority of}} the tracks on Can-I-Bus, Williams blamed him for the general dissatisfaction with Can-I-Bus and cut ties with him, going as far as to diss Wyclef, most notably on the title track of his second album ("You mad at the last album? <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> for it / Yo, I can't call it, motherfucking Wyclef spoiled it!"). Said album, 2000 B.C., was also released to mixed feelings and reviews—the latter once more focusing on the lack of topical variety and uninspired production—and also suffered from very little promotion by Universal Records.|$|E
500|$|I {{anticipated}} some [...] "pedophelia!!!" [...] Cries {{for this}} video. All I {{can say is}} Maddie and Shia {{are two of the}} only actors I felt could play, these two warring 'Sia' self states. <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> to those who feel triggered by [...] "Elastic Heart". My intention was to create some emotional content, not to upset anybody.|$|E
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "Oh, come now, Willis! You don't think she'll {{make any}} trouble? <b>I</b> <b>apologized.</b> <b>I</b> said {{everything}} I could think of. She must think I was sincere." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{that brief}} explanation, <b>I</b> <b>apologized</b> for {{interrupting}} the reader, and Morgan began once more.|$|R
6000|$|It was undeniable. <b>I</b> <b>apologized,</b> and Pollie {{surrendered}} {{her future}} into my hands. [...] "It's Bob Halibut, miss," [...] she whispered hoarsely.|$|R
500|$|On June 17, Jackson issued another public {{apology for}} {{his choice of}} words. He promised that future copies of the album would include an apology. By this point, however, two million copies of the record had already been shipped. The singer concluded, [...] "I just want you all to know how {{strongly}} I am committed to tolerance, peace and love, and <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> to anyone {{who might have been}} hurt." [...] The next day, in his review of HIStory, Jon Pareles of The New York Times alleged, [...] "In... 'They Don't Care About Us', he gives the lie to his entire catalogue of brotherhood anthems with a burst of anti-Semitism." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 17, Jackson issued another public {{apology to}} anyone {{offended}} by {{his choice of}} words and promised that future copies of the album would include an apology, Jackson concluded, [...] "I just want you all to know how strongly I am committed to tolerance, peace and love, and <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> to anyone {{who might have been}} hurt". The next day, in his review of HIStory, Jon Pareles of The New York Times alleged, [...] "In... 'They Don't Care About Us', he gives the lie to his entire catalogue of brotherhood anthems with a burst of anti-Semitism: 'Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me'".|$|E
500|$|I don't want to {{escalate}} it because I like Madonna, [...] She's been {{to my house}} for dinner. It {{was something that was}} said {{in the heat of the}} moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> to her if I saw her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.|$|E
60|$|In {{watching}} his face, I {{made quite a}} firework of the Aged's sausage, and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick's; for which <b>I</b> <b>apologized.</b>|$|R
50|$|Call off the dogs, please. <b>I</b> surrender...I <b>apologize.</b> <b>I</b> am chastened {{and will}} never use 'hot tub' and 'Marin county' in the same {{sentence}} again.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately, {{no notice}} was {{taken of the}} exclamation, though {{it was hard to}} believe that her words had not been overheard; and presently, {{recovering}} from my fright, <b>I</b> <b>apologized</b> for hurting her, and hoped she would forgive me.|$|R
500|$|In 2017, Getzlaf {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Calgary Flames defencemen Mark Giordano and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno. In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Selänne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official. He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to understand that there are eyes and ears on us all the time. Fortunately enough, nobody heard it. If you can read lips, it's a little bit harder, and <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> for that. That's a thing that you won't hear from me again. I hope I didn't offend anybody outside the circle that we trust." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Key was {{implicated in}} the arrest of Kim Dotcom and the {{subsequent}} revelations that the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) had illegally spied on Dotcom. As Prime Minister, Key was directly responsible for the GCSB, which {{is not allowed to}} spy on New Zealand citizens – and Dotcom had been granted permanent residency. Three days later, [...] Key apologised for the illegal spying. [...] "I apologize to Mr Dotcom. <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> to New Zealanders because every New Zealander…is entitled to be protected from the law {{when it comes to the}} GCSB, and we failed to provide that appropriate protection for him." [...] It subsequently came to light that Deputy Prime Minister Bill English had been asked by the GCSB to sign a [...] "ministerial certificate" [...] suppressing details of the bureau's involvement in the case while Key was overseas – the only time this had been done in the last ten years.|$|E
500|$|Press {{framing of}} Reagan changed {{from that of}} just helpmate and {{protector}} to someone with hidden power. As {{the image of her}} as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny that she was the power behind the throne. At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff. She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying [...] "In no way do <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> for it." [...] She wrote in her memoirs, [...] "I don't think I was as bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted," [...] but went on, [...] "However the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. I always did that for Ronnie, and I always will." ...|$|E
60|$|There it was, you see. He didn't seem to {{know any}} way to do a person a favor except by killing him or making a lunatic out of him. <b>I</b> <b>apologized,</b> as well as I could; but privately I did not think much of his processes--at that time.|$|R
60|$|He {{went back}} unwillingly. He {{returned}} to me--of course without the fish. Knowing how bitterly disappointed my uncle {{would have been}} in his place, <b>I</b> <b>apologized</b> very earnestly. In my eagerness to make atonement, I even offered to show him a spot where he might try again, lower down the stream.|$|R
60|$|EDSTASTON. <b>I</b> must <b>apologize</b> for the {{disturbance}} I made, madam.|$|R
500|$|Some media commentators, such as Howard Kurtz and Toby Harnden, criticized {{what they}} {{perceived}} as {{a rush to judgment}} about the shooter's motivation, disputing suggestions that the shooting {{was the result of the}} Tea Party movement or anything in connection to Palin. Paul Krugman wrote an op-ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic. With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting, Keith Olbermann said, [...] "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no place in our Democracy, and <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence." [...] Jon Stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting, but, [...] "For all the hyperbole and vitriol that's become a part of our political process—when the reality of that rhetoric, when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified. ... Maybe it helps us to remember to match our rhetoric with reality more often." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 15, 2017, Douglas Elmendorf, {{dean of the}} Kennedy School, {{announced}} that Chelsea Manning {{had been invited to}} spend only one day at the school, and that her title of visiting fellow did not convey a special honor. [...] "We did not intend to honor her in any way," [...] Elmendorf wrote, [...] "or to endorse any of her words or deeds…. However, I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow was a mistake, for which I accept responsibility. … Therefore, we are withdrawing the invitation to her to serve as a Visiting Fellow—and the perceived honor that it implies to some people—while maintaining the invitation for her to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum. <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> to her and to the many concerned people from whom I have heard today for not recognizing upfront the full implications of our original invitation." [...] When Elmendorf phoned Manning, a member of her support team challenged him to explain why Harvard was so concerned about the title [...] "visiting fellow." [...] The team was alienated by his response, which they inferred suggested she had nothing to contribute. Manning then hung up on the dean.|$|E
500|$|Rosie O'Donnell reacted {{negatively}} to Fink's casting and first solo musical performance. In {{an interview with}} Access Hollywood, she deemed her rendition of [...] "I Know What Boys Like" [...] underwhelming, and stated that it failed to meet her expectations. She called Lauren [...] "so unlikable," [...] and questioned why the producers had not cast a [...] "pretty heavy girl". Fink brushed off O'Donnell's comments. O'Donnell later apologized, and said, [...] "Oh, Ashley – I love your swagger – your acting – your face – your heart – as a famous fat person – I am often asked about the issue… I love the story line – I love the show – and if in any way something I said hurt you – <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> MORE. You are so talented, and I can't wait to hear you belt it…as I know you can—the often misquoted Rosie." [...] Fink was defended by Justin Thompson of Socialite Life, who commented: [...] "I've loved her character and how they've developed her and she's just {{become a source of}} great comedy – is that because she's full-figured? No. Is it because her character is well-written? Yes. It’s kind of sad to see Rosie lambaste what the show is trying to do." ...|$|E

[...] "One day I {{sat down}} and watched Bacchus seated on the hearthrug, with his moony eyes looking into space so thoughtfully and patiently that <b>I</b> <b>apologized</b> for {{comparing}} you to him.

60|$|My blue-eyed friend erected {{himself into}} an obelisk of profanity. He cursed me by his gods--the {{right and left}} bower; he even cursed the very good cigars he had given me.

6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] he answered. [...] "I am {{fairly well}} known here. <b>I</b> must <b>apologize,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, for {{speaking}} to you, but your appearance certainly indicated {{that you were}} in some sort of trouble, and you were becoming--pardon me--an object of comment to the passers-by." ...|$|R
40|$|How can 30 % {{of nickel}} in Rossi’s reactor be transmuted into copper? In {{the present article}} I would like to answer a {{question}} posed by L.

2500|$|In December 2008, Erdoğan criticised the <b>I</b> <b>Apologize</b> {{campaign}} by Turkish intellectuals {{to recognize the}} Armenian Genocide, saying, [...] "I neither accept nor support this campaign. We did not commit a crime, therefore {{we do not need}} to apologise... It will not have any benefit other than stirring up trouble, disturbing our peace and undoing the steps which have been taken." [...] In November 2009, he said, [...] "it's not possible for a Muslim to commit genocide." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 editorial, Gupta {{announced}} {{that in the}} process of working on a documentary about marijuana he had changed his mind about the drug's risks and benefits.
