5|$|Because {{of their}} rapid growth rate, short life span, and {{tolerance}} to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids {{are regarded as}} one of the most promising species for mariculture.

5|$|Both of the Russian Toy {{varieties}} can be {{crossed and}} produce smooth- and long-coated puppies {{from the same}} litter. In addition, when two smooth-coated dogs are bred together, they may occasionally bear a long-coated offspring if the long hair gene is present in their pedigrees. However, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> records of two long-coated Russian Toys breeding together and producing smooth-coated offspring.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid is in U.S. {{pregnancy}} category C, meaning there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> adequate {{studies of}} its safety when used by pregnant women, and although animal {{studies have shown}} mild toxicity to the fetus, the benefits of using the drug may outweigh its risks. It also passes into breast milk, although the clinical significance of this (if any) is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Sigurd {{was in the}} {{fortunate}} position that on his accession to the earldom there seem to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> other serious contenders. In this respect his rule was unlike that of the earlier generation of the sons of Earl Thorfinn and {{of the next generation}} in that it avoided the bitter feuding that beset the earldom during both of those periods.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{changes to}} US-412 {{have been more}} minor. On March 7, 1994, the highway was {{relocated}} near Chouteau. Finally, on October 4, 2004, the Transportation Commission approved the realignment of US-60, US-412, and SH-8 at their junction near Orienta. Other than routine maintenance, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> further changes to the highway since then.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as there would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> room for such soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|Aldermaston {{is under}} the {{catchment}} of Thames Valley Police and is covered by the Brimpton Neighbourhood Policing Team. In a meeting with Aldermaston Parish Council, the police reported that 57 criminal offences {{were reported to have}} taken place in the parish between 2009 and 2010. Of this, the majority was theft from non-dwelling properties. Vehicle crime had dropped by 57% on the previous year but violent crime had risen from four to six incidents. Five of these crimes were reported to be domestic violence. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> reported cases of robbery in Aldermaston since 2006.|$|E
5|$|All recent {{specimens}} of the Borneo shark {{have been collected}} solely from fishery landing sites at Mukah in Sarawak, despite thorough surveys across the rest of Borneo (including at the locality of the type specimen). Thus, its range may now be restricted to shallow, inshore waters in northwestern Borneo. Of the five earlier specimens, four came from Borneo and one from Zhoushan Island in China, hinting at a wider historical distribution. This species was also recorded from Borongan in the Philippines in 1895, and Java in 1933; these records cannot be substantiated and there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> subsequent sightings from these areas.|$|E

However, as of 2007, there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> plans to start filming soon, so {{it appears to be}} cancelled.|$|R
