Polyviologen electrochromes showed much faster reduction after exposure to UV light. Thionine and 2, 2 ?-dicyano- 1, 1 ?-dimethylviologen dimesylate, which have more anodic reduction potentials compared to methylene blue, can be used to produce oxygen indicators with decreased sensitivity to oxygen.

Among various <b>electrochromes,</b> organic <b>electrochromes</b> such as poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and viologens can modulate visible light and offer high contrast ratios and fast switching times. In the present thesis, PEDOT/fulleropyrrolidine films were prepared {{for the first time}} and the optical response of the film is completely altered by the presence of the fullerene derivative; a coloration efficiency of 386 cm 2 C- 1 was acheived. Electrohromic devicves (ECDs) with a PEDOT film as cathode and a Prussian blue (PB) film as anode were constructured and the superior EC performance of the an in-situ polymerized ionic liquid based gel electrolyte compared to a conventional gel electrolyte was demonstrated. The optimized in-situ polymerized gel was then used in a heptyl viologen based ECD and the switching of a large area device (8 cm  6 cm) for antiglare electrochromic rearview (ECRA) mirrors was demonstrated. PEDOT films were then transposed over plastic substrates and their ability to serve as a transparent conductor and an electrochromic electrode was shown. Similarly viologens offer different colors depending on the N-substituent. Although a variety of viologens were synthesized in the past, a reversible and high write-erase efficiency continues to pose a formidable challenge. To address this concern, new derivatives of viologens were synthesized by the use of substituents like butylbenzimidazole and ethylindole, their ECDs were constructed and characterized. Further, a hybrid viologen was also prepared by using a phosphonitrillic trimer (P 3 N 3 Cl 6) as a central core and the potential of this viologen for durable, high contrast ECDs was shown. These viologen based ECDs showed very high contrast ratios, high coloration efficiencies, short response times and the devices can endure more than 2000 cycles without undergoing degradation. These devices and materials are very much useful for applications such as flexible displays, energy saving switchable windows in buildings and automobiles and ECRA mirrors...|$|R

The {{proximity of the}} two ferrocenyl units {{to each other in}} the biferrocenyl units introduces electrostatic and electronic effects that are observed by cyclic voltammetry and are responsible for mixed-valence stabilization and localization. The use of the polyfluorinated electrolyte [n-Bu 4 N][BAr 4 F] {ArF = 3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl} allows observing considerable enhancement of these effects and separation of electrochemical waves representing the two ferrocenyl groups of the biferrocenyl unit. The electrostatic effect is also selectively observed with the latter electrolyte between the two central ferrocenyl units of bis(biferrocenyl) diyne. Oxidation of all of these poly(biferrocenyl) complexes using a ferricinium salt yields blue, robust biferrocenium complexes. Their localized mixed-valent electronic structure was demonstrated at both Mössbauer and infrared time scales even with the counteranion (BAr 4 F) that provokes the maximum electrostatic effect and very much enhances the difference between the two oxidation potentials. Their near-infrared spectra show the intervalent charge transfer and are similar to those previously recorded for biferrocenium and derivatives, confirming the class-II mixed valence. The biferrocene units around the arene linker are completely electronically independent in the neutral and cationic complexes. In conclusion, from a practical standpoint, the easy oxidation of these stiff electrochromic nanosystems and the largely increased robustness of their oxidized form compared to ferricinium make their potential use as <b>electrochromes</b> considerably more attractive than that of simple ferrocene derivatives...|$|R

Improvements in electrochromic and redox switching capability for PEDOP films were attained by use of reduced graphene oxide functionalized with an ionic liquid (RGO/IL) as a dopant/counter ion. Further, the variation in localized nanoscale conduction / work function profile of PEDOP, when doped with an intr 1 insically conducting charge balancing counter ion such as functionalized carbon nanotubes was compared with the nanoscale behavior of same polymer doped with insulating counter ions and correlated to the significantly increased electrochromic switching by {{using a combination of}} electrochemical tools and microscopy probes. Electrochromic devices usingPEDOP andpoly(5 -cyano-indole) or PCIND as cathodic and anodic <b>electrochromes</b> with a novel ionic liquid based polymeric electrolyte were assembled, and the performance attributes of the device were examined in detail, to ultimately demonstrate the suitability of the PEDOP-PCIND device for smart window applications. Electrically conductive composites of Sb 2 S 3 nanorods enwrapped by PEDOP were prepared and used as electrodes in asymmetric supercapacitors; structure-property correlation with an emphasis on the ability of Sb 2 S 3 to serve as electron conduits was evaluated.

40|$|Conducting {{polymers}} {{and their}} application as electrodes in electrochromics {{has been widely}} studied because of their high contrast, low power consumption and ease of processability as compared with inorganic metal oxides. Another component of an electrochromic device is the electrolyte. Organic electrolytes are widely used in electrochromic devices but have limitations such as volatility, flammability and leakage. Therefore, one of the aims of this thesis was to develop polymer electrolytes that afford comparable conductivity to organic electrolytes without the drawbacks mentioned above. The following polymer electrolytes containing polyethylene oxide (PEO), with molecular weight (2, 000, 10, 000 and 20, 000), salt lithium perchlorate (LiClO 4), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide(LiTFSI), and plasticiser ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate (EC/PC), ionic liquid were successfully developed. The conductivity of these electrolytes {{were found to be}} in the range of 10 - 3 to 10 - 5 S/cm with average photopic transparency between 89 % - 90 %. In this thesis dual polymer electrochromic devices were prepared using poly (3, 4 - ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polypyrrole (PPy) using vapour phase polymerisation which have a number of advantages including ease of processing, uniform coating over large surface areas and negligible monomer wastage. The contrast of the PEDOT/PPy device was found to be 43 % at the applied potential of ± 1500 mV and 32 % at the applied potential of ± 1000 mV. The assembled devices were tested for long term stability using ionic liquid as well as polymer electrolytes. The contrast of the PEDOT/PPy device degraded from 43 % to 36 % over a period of 15, 000 cycles when switched between ± 1500 mV. PEDOT/PPy devices were found to be quite stable with photopic contrast of 32 % over extended periods of cycling (50, 000) when cycled in between appropriate potentials of ± 1000 mV. Device failure or degradation of photopic contrast of the electrochromic device on long term cycling is a commonly observed phenomenon in dual polymer devices. Various techniques such as Impedance, Raman and FTIR were used to study the possible reasons for device failure and aid in the development of ways by which device degradation could be minimised or eliminated. Degradation of the PEDOT/PPy device was minimised by running at low applied potentials, but there was a loss in contrast in the dual polymer electrochromic device. Alternate <b>electrochromes</b> were investigated in an attempt to improve the device contrast range. Replacing the cathodically colouring polymer from PEDOT to poly(3, 4 -propylenedioxythiophene) (ProDOT) gave a higher contrast as compared with PEDOT on a single electrode basis. A dual polymer electrochromic device assembled using ProDOT/PPy, when operated at lower potentials of ± 1000 mV, gave contrasts between 39 % - 42 %. These contrasts were similar to that of a PEDOT/PPy device operated at higher applied potentials of ± 1500 mV. The lower operating applied potentials utilised in the ProDOT/PPy devices resulted in enhanced cycle life of the device. However, it was observed that the contrast of the dual polymer electrochromic devices was limited by the anodically colouring polymer. This finding implied that even if the cathodically colouring polymer gave a high value of contrast as an individual electrode, {{it does not mean that}} there would be an increase in contrast for the device. The PEDOT/PPy device at high applied potential of ± 1500 mV gave contrast of 42 %, but at low applied potential of ± 1000 mV the device gave contrast of 32 %. I have tried to match the anion dopant in the conducting polymer with the anion dopant in the electrolyte to study the effect of contrast at low potential. Interestingly, it resulted in the contrast of the PEDOT/PPy device being increased to 42 % at ± 1000 mV as compared to 32 % at ± 1000 mV, suggesting that anion matching is important for achieving better contrast...|$|R

The hybrid-film formation is primarily based on coulombic interactions between the surface hydroxyl groups of tungsten oxide and the positively charged centers on the polymer backbone; this has been confirmed by electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction.

Electrochromic devices were constructed with the PPBP hybrid dissolved in a highly conductive, thermally stable and electrochemically inert ionic liquid based gel electrolyte and a Prussian blue (PB) layer as the anode. The PPBP-PB device showed an extremely large coloration efficiency of 504 cm 2 C- 1, an exceptionally high transmission modulation of 70. 5 % at 590 nm, one among the highest reported contrasts in organic electrochromics, a large reflectance contrast of 59. 2 % at 545 nm and fast switching kinetics. The device was durable as it retained 96. 2 % of its original transmission after 1000 color-bleach cycles, thus exemplifying its use for both reflective and transmissive electrochromic applications.
