40|$|The text {{analyzes}} international {{compliance procedures}} {{related to the}} 1993 North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, the 1998 Convention on the Access to Information, Public Participation to Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters and the 1999 Protocol on Water and Health to the 1992 Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes. The common feature of these procedures {{is that they can}} be initiated by individuals and non-governmental organizations. This novelty of international compliance procedures in environmental matters made them comparable with international procedures established by universal human rights treaties. All of them can be initiates by communications of individuals. The three mentioned procedures were established due to different reasons. By the pressure of environmental non-governmental organizations and to satisfy some economic concerns, the North American Free Trade Treaty was supplemented by the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation that was aimed at improvement of the application of national environmental law. Unequal levels of the application of national environmental laws in Canada, Mexico and the USA might have negative consequences to trade between them and to environmental protection in them. To prevent such development the Agreement was concluded and individuals and NGO-s are allowed to trigger international <b>fact-finding</b> <b>procedure.</b> The subject-matter and purposes of the Aarhus Convention - democratization of environmental governance - implies that the public {{should have the right to}} initiate international conciliatory procedures. In spite of the fact that subject-matter and purposes of the London protocol are different, corresponding conciliatory procedure was inspired by the Aarhus procedure. All three procedures are intended, at last resort, to improve protection of the environment. The protection of an individual interest is not the first aim. Due to that, legal standing and rule on local remedies are not defined in the same way as in human rights proceedings. Value of these proceedings is not manifested just in an achievement of the higher effectiveness of environmental law, but also in democratization of an important field of international cooperation...|$|E

5000|$|Traced back to 2010, from {{a series}} of events within the elections, with the issue of massive corruption, in which Benigno Simeon Aquino III formed a special body tasked to {{investigate}} the alleged instances of graft and corruption of the Gloria Macapagal Arroyo administration, along with a few other incidents. The commission looked into how her administration rigged the 2004 presidential election, misusing government funds and profited from government contracts. On July 30, 2010, President Benigno Aquino III signed Executive Order No. 1 establishing the Philippine Truth Commission of 2010. It is an entity under the Office of the President that is formed to investigate graft and corruption reports and to submit recommendations based on the <b>fact-finding</b> <b>procedures</b> to the President. Two cases assailed the validity and constitutionality of Executive Order No. 1. The first case is a special civil action for prohibition instituted by petitioner Louis Biraogo. The second case is a special civilaction for certiorari and prohibition filed by Lagman, Albano, Jr., Datumanong, and Fua.|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} about the {{application}} of procedural approaches in the US-Zeroing case that serve to highlight potential problems with Appellate Body decision-making. Those problems go to central issues of judicial restraint, including concerns surrounding standards of review, appellate fact-finding, and notions of justiciability and ripeness. This essay will begin with an analysis of US-Zeroing 2 ̆ 7 s approach in applying the specialized standard of review under the Antidumping Agreement, arguing that it fails {{to adhere to the}} obligation of deference to permissible Member State interpretations of WTO antidumping obligations. It then examines the <b>fact-finding</b> <b>procedures</b> applied by the Appellate Body, which raise troubling concerns about the Appellate Body 2 ̆ 7 s failure to confer deference to the reasonable factual findings of Member States and WTO panels. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of the Appellate Body 2 ̆ 7 s rejection of the mandatory/discretionary doctrine, a key tool that restricts the jurisdictional authority of the WTO. The essay concludes that the Appellate Body in US-Zeroing circumvented the particularized standard of review required under the Antidumping Agreement, took upon itself the unacceptable task of appellate fact-finding, and inappropriately expanded the authority of WTO panels to hear facial challenges of agency measures. Rather than adhere to an approach of deference as required by the WTO commitments, the Appellate Body engaged in de novo review of both the law and the facts to reach its preferred result on zeroing...|$|R

But there are exceptions to this rule, for example, if they have signed another document relating to the same contract, there arises the problem of which terms shall prevail. This is a matter of substantive law as well as of evidence. In this article, I compare this Japanese rule with the English-American Parol Evidence Rule...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} proof in both {{science and}} law. Both disciplines utilize proof {{of facts and}} proof of theories, but for different purposes and, consequently, in different ways. Some similarities exist, however, in how both disciplines use a series of premises followed by a conclusion to form an argument, and thus constitute a logic. This article analyzes {{the ways in which}} legal logic and scientific logic differ. Finding facts in law involves the same logic but quite different <b>procedures</b> than scientific <b>fact-finding.</b> Finding, or rather constructing, the law is also very different from scientific theorizing. But such differences do not indicate that one system of inquiry is deficient or the other superior. The <b>fact-finding</b> and law-constructing <b>procedures</b> that may seem odd or cumbersome to some scientists are rational responses to constraints that are simply not present in scientific inquiry. While these differences may seem obvious, their value lies in assisting us in describing the contrasting cultures of law and science...|$|R
40|$|Therefore, {{the aims}} of the study are to explore the origin, nature and purpose of fact-finding missions, to explore what is {{currently}} on the ground, to expose the inherent deficiencies in the current practice, which compromise the missions' capacity to promote and protect human and peoples' rights. Having identified the shortcomings, lessons and inspiration will be drawn from the practice and rules of procedure of other regional and international treaty monitoring bodies, particularly the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). The starting point of the analysis shall be to identify the various fact-finding related issues that arose in the response of the Government of Zimbabwe to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) report. A survey of the reaction and response of other countries in which similar fact-finding missions were conducted, shall be carried out to gauge the consistence or otherwise in the ACHPR's practice. It shall be strongly suggested that the ACHPR should substantially borrow from other human rights systems, if necessary. After closely observing these issues, the study will come up with a position and firm recommendations to the ACHPR in terms of which its practice can be revamped for the achievement of an effective and progressive promotion and protection of human and peoples' rights as contemplated by the African Charter. [...] . This study has four chapters. Chapter one constitutes introductory remarks putting the study into context and the justification thereof. Chapter two explores the nature, origin, forms and importance of fact-finding in human rights protection. It searches for the underlying principles governing credible and plausible fact-finding. Chapter three analyses the ACHPR fact-finding practice to see what is there and critically compare it to the IACHR, UN and ILO practice. It aims at demonstrating {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the African system. Chapter four revisits the weaknesses unearthed in chapter three and proposes recommendations for overall improvement. The study concludes by soliciting draft rules of procedure from the general principles explored in chapter two, combined with lessons learnt from other systems in chapter three. The model <b>fact-finding</b> rules of <b>procedures</b> are marked Annexure A at the end of this work. " [...] Introduction. Prepared under the supervision of Prof. J.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a human {{relations}} systems model for professional personnel in higher education. The model developed provided a mechanism for systematically analyzing bargaining alternatives. A review of selected literature on alternative approaches for collective bargaining and creative or innovative alternatives within collective bargaining was made. Models for bargaining in higher education, selected management strategies, union strategies, and union-management cooperation efforts were summarized. In addition, strikes, impasse procedures, state statutes involving impasse procedures, as well as proposals for federal legislation were reported. Among the strategies selected were Boulwarism, cost package bargaining, multi-employer bargaining, joint bargaining, coalition bargaining, profit and progress sharing plans, and union-management cooperation. Impasse procedures included strikes, arbitration, mediation, and <b>fact-finding.</b> The impasse <b>procedures</b> of the New York, Massachusetts, Hawaii, and Pennsylvania bargaining statutes were examined. The review consisted of an explanation of each alternative, and an evaluation in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative. A review of selectedliterature on systems theory, and models and systems in labor re-. lations was also made. A human relations systems analysis model, designed from the literature review pertaining to models and systems of labor relations, was presented. The model provided a means of analyzing alternatives and generating tailor made approaches to bargaining, and spawned new hypotheses. Practical utilization of the model by analyzing alternatives in hypothetical settings and generating tailor made approaches to bargaining was demonstrated. Important factors favoring or not favoring an alternative were reported. The efficacy of an approach was entirely dependent upon the unique educational setting. The majority of alternatives examined were judged as possessing potential for application in higher education. Of the alternatives studied all could be expected to be associated with operational difficulties in higher education institutions. Alternatives were seen as requiring varying degrees of modification before being implemented in higher education in order to minimize such difficulties. Most of the alternatives examined should not be used as the sole approach, or method in an approach, to human relations taken by an institution; but rather, should be included as part of a more comprehensive approach to human relations. Most constructive changes in collective bargaining for education were judged as being derived from strategies, mechanisms, methods, and procedures. All management strategies studied were judged to be applicable for higher education collective bargaining. Joint bargaining by unions was anticipated in states where funding for higher education was represented by a single line item in the state budget. Union-management cooperation was the alternative closest to the concept of integrative bargaining, and represented the approach most writers in the field were suggesting be pursued. Profit and progress sharing plans were thought to have limited application as principal approaches to faculty-administration relations. Many alternatives studied were best characterized as attempts to avoid or circumvent the strike. A major problem facing the education relations system appeared to be in finding an acceptable substitute for the strike in the public sector. At present no single impasse procedure appeared to be as effective as the strike in resolving labor disputes. The most viable impasse procedures were identified as procedures in which the government official responsible for settling such disputes was provided with as many alternatives as possible, including non-intervention, and was given complete freedom in making a choice of which procedure or combination of procedures were to be used in an intervention into a labor dispute. Separate legislation as well as federal legislation for education labor relations appeared inadvisable. Implications of the study were identified. Recommendations to improve bargaining, and recommendations for additional research were offered. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
