500|$|After she {{graduated}} from high school, Sanders left her foster parents' home in Detroit to study at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), a historically black college in Alabama that was Lorenzo Malloy's alma mater. She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher. When she left Detroit to go to Alabama, her foster mother stood {{at the train station}} crying. Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to mumble something, but the words would not come out. By the time she arrived in Alabama, she felt she knew what her foster mother was saying. [...] "The minute I got off that train, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was trying to say. She was trying to tell me in ten words or less about racism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it was not}} planned, Zsa Zsa {{was given}} a {{personality}} {{similar to that of}} her on-screen aunt, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), an established character in EastEnders. During the development of the character, she changed a lot and was fluid until filming started, when Kenny had a full day on set with Henry. She explained: [...] "The words were there and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was like but when I saw Linda [...] speak and when I engaged with her, I realised that it was like looking in a mirror." [...] When the character was announced, she was described as beautiful, funky, an outspoken tomboy, very bright, but likes to think she does not need anybody's help. Kenny said of the character in an interview with Soaplife magazine: [...] "Zsa Zsa doesn't like authority or anyone who messes with her. She's a lone wolf and doesn't care about anyone." [...] She told entertainment website Digital Spy that Zsa Zsa is [...] "a real bitch" [...] and [...] "very mean and cold", while a profile for the character on the official EastEnders website says she is sarcastic, a rebel and [...] "desperately wants the security that comes with a family but is terrified of being dependent on anyone. Her experience has taught her that adults let you down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Majesty pardon me. She {{called me}} to her closet {{yesterday}} and pledged me to secrecy before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I said, Tom, she hasn't accused me-- that is, openly; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{will make}} others think," [...] {{returned}} Nellie. And now she {{showed signs of}} bursting into tears again. [...] "Oh, I feel as if I must pack up and go home!" ...|$|R
60|$|STREPHON. I do {{not want}} the girl who is to be born today. How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> will be like? I want you.|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. (Aside.) How the dickens should <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> prefers? She told me {{that she}} doted on horses. (Aloud.) I think it is.|$|R
6000|$|... "She was furious, of course. She did {{not refer}} to the matter when we were alone together, {{but there was no}} need to. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was thinking." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant--I {{knew she}} was right, and I rose at once {{to go to the}} card-table. As I left the piano Miss Fairlie turned a page of the music, and touched the keys again with a surer hand.|$|E
60|$|Now, as for Justine Marie, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was {{as well as}} if I {{had seen}} her. I knew she was well enough; there were girls like her in Madame Beck's school--phlegmatics--pale, slow, inert, but kind-natured, neutral of evil, undistinguished for good.|$|E
6000|$|... "Being {{kind and}} good isn't liking. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks. But of course I can't expect to {{convince}} you of it; {{no one else could}} see it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see they}} are very {{superior}} people," [...] said Bernard. [...] "And little Miss Evers--what does she do in the morning? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does in the evening!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guess she is," [...] said Mrs. Moses. [...] "That gal {{is worth}} any seven grown-up women in town. And she was four nights settin' {{in my kitchen}} before <b>I</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was up to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course," [...] Mrs. March now assented, and {{she waved}} her fan thoughtfully before her face. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was {{thinking}} of, and I looked at Miss Gage, who had involuntarily taken the pose and expression of the moment when I first saw her at the kiosk in Congress Park. [...] "And Miss Gage?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{considered}} the matter. The word of honor {{of a fellow}} such as he was could not be worth much, but the merest chance {{of getting rid of}} tramps should not be neglected. I went in to talk to Euphemia about it, although <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would say. I reasoned with myself as much as with her.|$|E
60|$|These {{were our}} words, yet we scarce heeded their meaning. Between us was drawn a subtler communion than speech, and we dared--neither of us--to risk speech. She searched my face, but {{her lips were}} closed. She did not take my hand again as in the afternoon. She turned away. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would have said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now YOU know it, {{will you}} not turn to Violet for advice and comfort? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> can be. If you could guess <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saved me from, you would fly {{at once to}} her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very possibly," [...] Newman rejoined. [...] "But {{she will}} not <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> was in that convent {{yesterday}} and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>SHE</b> is doing. Lord deliver us! You can guess whether {{it made me feel}} forgiving!" ...|$|R
60|$|Why the deuce should Mrs. Botibol blow me a kiss? I wouldn't {{kiss her}} for the world. Why do I grin when I see her, as if I was delighted? Am I? I don't care a straw for Mrs. Botibol. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks about me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said about my last volume of poems (I had it from a dear mutual friend). Why, I say in a word, are we going on ogling and {{telegraphing}} each other in this insane way?--Because we are both performing the ceremonies demanded by the Great Snob Society; whose dictates we all of us obey.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{was going}} to be at: on came her histarrix agen, and she began screechin and roaring like mad. Down comes of course the eleven gals and old Shum. There was a pretty row. [...] "Look here, sir," [...] says she, [...] "at the conduck of your {{precious}} trull of a daughter--alone with this man, kissin and dandlin, and Lawd knows what besides." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} crying, mademoiselle," [...] I said, [...] "and I think I can guess the reason. M. Claude {{has told me}} {{something}} about it. He has asked you for your hand, and you have refused him. Is it not so?" [...] This {{was a little bit}} of hypocrisy on my part, I confess, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had been crying about perfectly: but I wished to be loyal to M. Claude.|$|E
60|$|It revived my utmost indignation to {{find that}} she was still pursued by this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country. By degrees she led me into more {{temperate}} talk, and she told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,--she didn't say, of me; she had no need; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant,--but ever did his duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a gentle heart.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cursed if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was. <b>I</b> rammed a cake of good Trinidad tobacco into my boot when I saw her. I've {{seen the}} inside of a French prison before now. Give way, Bill, and have it over.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Almost {{the very}} words I said to her!' exclaimed her mother. 'Now really, another time, when <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{would tell you}} but for this reason, and won't, I have a great mind, my dear Doctor, to tell you myself.' ...|$|R
60|$|EMILY--[With her sugary smile.] That isn't what Martha means, you silly. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> {{thinking}} about us, and I'm {{not sure that}} I don't agree with her--partly. She feels that we're so awfully strict--about certain things. It must be so different in the Far West--I suppose--so much freer.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant, {{having so}} {{recently}} {{heard the story}} of Isarte, and in obedience to her command I raised her from the couch. She was tall, and heavier than I had expected, though so greatly emaciated; but the {{thought that she was}} Yoletta's mother, and the mother of the house, nerved me to my task, and cautiously moving step by step through the gloom, I carried her safely to that white-haired, moonlit woman of stone in the long gallery. When I had ascended the steps and brought her sufficiently near, she put her arms about the statue, and pressed its stony lips with hers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Pasmer," [...] said Dan, [...] "you and I are {{the only}} frank and open people I know. Well, she began to talk last night about {{influence}}--the influence of other people on us; and she killed off nearly all the people I like before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was up to, and she finished with Mrs. Brinkley. I'm glad she didn't happen to think of you, Mrs. Pasmer, or I shouldn't be associating with you at the present moment." [...] This idea seemed to give Mrs. Pasmer inexpressible pleasure. Dan went on: [...] "Do you quite see the connection between our being entirely devoted {{to each other and}} my dropping Mrs. Brinkley?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ethelbertha {{replied that}} of course <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant. She {{said that she was}} not {{thinking}} of me, and that Jephson was, no doubt, sensible enough (Jephson is engaged), but she did not see the object of bringing half the parish into it. (Nobody suggested bringing [...] "half the parish" [...] into it. Ethelbertha will talk so wildly.) To suppose that Brown and MacShaughnassy could be of any use whatever, she considered absurd. What could a couple of raw bachelors know about life and human nature? As regarded MacShaughnassy in particular, she was of opinion that if we only wanted out of him all that he knew, and could keep him to the subject, {{we ought to be able}} to get that into about a page.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I would--to-morrow. Why shouldn't I? What are {{fame and}} name and society to me--a {{descendant}} of wreckers and smugglers, like her. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> made of, my boy, to her innermost fibre; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the perfect and pure quarry she was dug from: {{and that gives}} a man confidence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is not. She {{is not a}} friend, as {{you call}} her, if she {{encourages}} you in the wrong, {{if she does n't}} help you. No, I have no patience with her," [...] I declared; [...] "I don't like her, and I won't go to see her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> will say, my lad, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{ought to}} say. I am going round to Thompson's {{now for a}} copy of the deposition, and will bring it for her to see. Thompson will read it aloud at the meeting of the court today, so by this {{afternoon}} every one will know that you are cleared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{this instant}} they {{caught sight of}} us, and there came a moment's pause, and then, before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was going to do, Maiwa lifted the assegai she still held, and whirled it at Wambe's head. I saw the flash of light speed towards him, and so did he, for he stepped {{backward}} to avoid it--stepped backward right into the trap. He yelled with pain as the iron teeth of the 'Thing that bites' sprang up with a rattling sound like living fangs and fastened into him--such a yell I have not often heard. Now at last he tasted of the torture which he had inflicted upon so many, and though I trust I am a Christian, I cannot say that I felt sorry for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, so do we. And there's {{about as}} much {{prospect}} of his marrying her. Rufus, it's pretty hard! She's just {{in the mood to}} be taken with him, but she won't let herself, because she knows it's of no use. That Miss Rasmith has been telling her how much he is run after, and I could see that that settled it for Ellen as plainly as if she said so. More plainly, for there's enough of the girl in her to make her say one thing when she means another. She was just saying she was sick of him, and never wanted to speak to him again, when he came up and asked her to walk, and she went with him instantly. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant. She wasn't going to let him suppose that anything Miss Rasmith had said was going to change her." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing. There was a {{hook and}} line {{attached}} to the pole, and with womanly dexterity she was fastening the hook to the extreme end of the rod. Soon she reached up, and gently struck at my legs. After a few attempts the hook caught in my trousers, a little below my right knee. Then {{there was a slight}} pull, a long scratch down my leg, and the hook was stopped by the top of my boot. Then came a steady downward pull, and I felt myself descending. Gently and firmly the rod was drawn down; carefully the lower end was kept free from the ground; and in a few moments my ankle was seized with a vigorous grasp. Then some one seemed to climb up me, my feet touched the ground, an arm was thrown around my neck, the hand of another arm was busy {{at the back of my}} knapsack, and I soon stood firmly in the road, entirely divested of negative gravity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Curse her," [...] he said, as {{the fumes}} mounted into his brain, [...] "curse her, {{she is trying}} to frighten me with her infernal magic, but <b>she</b> sha'n't. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is at; but I will be {{beforehand}} with her." [...] And, staggering under the mingled influence of drink and excitement, he rose and left the house.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I don't {{care for}} her conversation--I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it amounts to.' I made no rejoinder--I {{scarcely}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> rejoinder to make--and the girl went on, 'I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> says.' Still <b>I</b> was silent, but the next moment I saw that my delicacy had been wasted, for Miss Mavis asked, 'Does she make out that she knows Mr. Porterfield?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{believes}} she is alive, too," [...] she said. [...] "He can't sleep or rest till he finds her, {{for my husband}} loves her as well as I do. But sometimes I feel it's wicked to hope <b>she</b> is alive. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> suffers, for <b>I</b> suffered, myself; and life isn't worth living when despair and disappointment fills it." ...|$|R
