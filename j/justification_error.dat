40|$|A {{periodic}} spectral {{problem in}} a bounded domain with double inhomogeneities in mass density and stiffness coefficients is considered. A previous study [BKS 08] has explored the problem by the method of asymptotic expansions with <b>justification</b> of <b>errors</b> showing that all eigenelements of the homogenized problem really approximate some of the perturbed eigenelements. Within this chapter additional results, partly announced in [BKS 08], are obtained on the eigenfunction convergence {{at the bottom of}} the spectrum. It is shown that the eigenfunctions, which correspond to the eigenvalues {{at the bottom of the}} spectrum, could converge either to zero or to the eigenfunctions of the homogenized problem. The result was obtained by the method of two-scale convergence [Al 92, Zh 00]...|$|R
40|$|Moral {{nihilism}} {{maintains that}} value judgments cannot be justified. In this paper I argue against two prominent nihilistic theories: error theory and expressivism. First I present a meta-valuation thesis, {{which holds that}} it would be more valuable if at least some value judgments were justified. Second I argue for a value-justification thesis, which holds that the greater value of value-justifying theories warrants a rejection of nihilistic theories. This latter thesis requires a pragmatist premise: justified beliefs are the most valuable of possible beliefs. With this premise and a critique of meta-ethical theory choice, I argue that meta-ethical justification proceeds via an atypical form of the method of reflective equilibrium. Since this particular method cannot produce a <b>justification</b> for <b>error</b> theory or expressivism, I conclude that these two forms of moral nihilism should be rejected in favor of more valuable meta-ethical theories...|$|R

40|$|We study phase field {{equations}} {{based on}} the diffuse-interface approximation of general homogeneous free energy densities showing different local minima of possible equilibrium configurations in perforated/porous domains. The study of such free energies in homogeneous environments found a broad interest over the last decades and hence is now widely accepted and applied in both science and engineering. Here, we focus on strongly heterogeneous materials with perforations such as porous media. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, we present a general formal derivation of upscaled phase field equations for arbitrary free energy densities and give a rigorous <b>justification</b> by <b>error</b> estimates for a broad class of polynomial free energies. The error between the effective macroscopic solution of the new upscaled formulation and the solution of the microscopic phase field problem is of order ϵ^ 1 / 2 for a material given characteristic heterogeneity ϵ. Our new, effective, and reliable macroscopic porous media formulation of general phase field equations opens new modelling directions and computational perspectives for interfacial transport in strongly heterogeneous environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{introduce}} {{a novel approach}} for debugging ill-typed programs in the Hindley/Milner system. We map the typing problem for a program {{to a system of}} constraints each attached to program code that generates the constraints. We use reasoning about constraint satisfiability and implication to find minimal <b>justifications</b> of type <b>errors,</b> and to explain unexpected types that arise. Through an interactive process akin to declarative debugging, a user can track down exactly where a type error occurs. We are able to capture various extensions of the Hindley/Milner system such as type annotations and Haskell-style type class overloading. The approach has been implemented as part of the Chameleon system...|$|R

The value of these results for educational purposes is pointed out. Also new insights emerge. For example, {{it is noted that}} for the (Z= 4,N= 4) nucleus { 48 }Cr, a good quantum number comes out: (- 1) ^{(v_p+v_n) / 2 }, where v_p and v_n are the seniority quantum numbers of the protons and neutrons, respectively.

Chameleon provides an extension to Haskell supporting advanced and programmable type extensions. Chameleon maps the typing problem for a program {{to a system of}} constraints each attached to program code that generates the constraints. We use reasoning about constraint satisfiability and implication to find minimal <b>justifications</b> of type <b>errors,</b> and to explain unexpected types that arise. Through an interactive process akin to declarative debugging, a user can track down exactly where a type error occurs. The approach handles Hindley/Milner types with Haskell-style overloading.

40|$|In $D= 4,N= 2 $ {{theories}} on $R^{ 3, 1 }$, the index receives contributions {{not only from}} single-particle BPS states, counted by the BPS indices, but also from multi-particle states made of BPS constituents. In a recent work [arXiv: 1406. 2360], a general formula expressing the index {{in terms of the}} BPS indices was proposed, which is smooth across walls of marginal stability and reproduces the expected single-particle contributions. In this note, I analyze the two-particle contributions predicted by this formula, and show agreement with the spectral asymmetry of the continuum of scattering states in the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of two non-relativistic, mutually non-local dyons. This provides a physical <b>justification</b> for the <b>error</b> function profile used in the mathematics literature on indefinite theta series, and in the physics literature on black hole partition functions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{investigate}} the doctrines of justification and progressive sanctification and its implications in the Southern Baptist Churches in West Virginia. In the Southern Baptist Churches in West Virginia, {{there seems to be}} much confusion concerning the subject of justification and sanctification {{in the life of the}} believer. This confusion appears to grow out of a misunderstanding of sanctification and its relationship to <b>justification</b> from the <b>error</b> of Roman Catholic doctrine of blending justification and sanctification. The result of this study will expose the disparity of understanding concerning these doctrines and produce a teaching resource for a deeper understanding and stronger walk of faith in the church. Through an online survey of church leadership and the survey of theological studies, the various understandings to be presented are analyzed, compared and evaluated, on the basis of the relationship of justification and sanctification...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} <b>justification</b> with {{rigorous}} <b>error</b> estimates {{showing that the}} leading term in weakly nonlinear geometric optics expansions of highly oscillatory reflecting pulses {{is close to the}} uniquely determined exact solution for small wavelengths ε. Pulses reflecting off fixed noncharacteristic boundaries are considered under the assumption that the underlying boundary problem is uniformly spectrally stable in the sense of Kreiss. There are two respects in which these results make rigorous the formal treatment of pulses in Majda and Artola [MA 88], and Hunter, Majda and Rosales [HMR 86]. First, we give a rigorous construction of leading pulse profiles in problems where pulses traveling with many distinct group velocities are, unavoidably, present; and second, we provide a rigorous error analysis which yields a rate of convergence of approximate to exact solutions as ε → 0. Unlike wavetrains, interacting pulses do not produce resonances that affect leading order profiles. However, our error analysis shows the importance of estimating pulse interactions in the construction and estimation of correctors. Our results apply to a general class of systems that includes quasilinear problems like the compressible Euler equations; moreover, the same methods yield a stability result for uniformly stable Euler shock...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{provide a}} <b>justification</b> with {{rigorous}} <b>error</b> estimates {{showing that the}} leading term in weakly nonlinear geometric optics expansions of highly oscillatory reflecting wavetrains {{is close to the}} uniquely determined exact solution for small wavelengths. Waves reflecting off of fixed noncharacteristic boundaries and off of multidimensional shocks are considered under the assumption that the underlying fixed (respectively, free) boundary problem is uniformly spectrally stable in the sense of Kreiss (respectively, Majda). Our results apply to a general class of problems that includes the compressible Euler equations; as a corollary we rigorously justify the leading term in the geometric optics expansion of highly oscillatory multidimensional shock solutions of the Euler equations. An earlier stability result of this type was obtained by a method that required the construction of high-order approximate solutions. That construction in turn was possible only under a generically valid (absence of) small divisors assumption. Here we are able to remove that assumption and avoid the need for high-order expansions by studying associated singular fixed and free boundary problems. The analysis applies equally to systems that cannot be written in conservative form...|$|R
