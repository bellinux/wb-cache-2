5|$|Parker was at {{home when}} the August 1896 term began, too sick to preside over the court, as he {{suffered}} from Bright's disease. The jurisdiction of the court {{came to an end}} on September 1, 1896, over lands in the Indian Territory; reporters wanted to <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> about his career but had to talk to him at his bedside. Parker died on November 17, 1896, of a number of health conditions, including heart degeneration and Bright's disease. His funeral in Fort Smith had the highest number of attenders up to that point.

5|$|The premier night fighter aces in the RAF—Cunningham, Braham and Branse Burbridge—did not {{appreciate}} press attention. In {{the case of}} Cunningham and Burbridge, this may have stemmed from deeper religious convictions about combat and killing. Burbridge became a priest {{during the war and}} both he and Cunningham did not cooperate with biographers when approached to have their exploits described in print after the war. During the war, Braham also actively shunned the lime-light. One of the country's best-selling newspapers, the Daily Express, asked to <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> but he declined. Much to Braham's embarrassment, his father gave interviews about his then famous son in 1943. When no stories were forthcoming, the newspapers soon lost interest. Braham and Cunningham were certainly aware of each other {{as a result of the}} press attention, and a competitive rivalry developed. In his book Scramble, Braham mentioned with pride the night he surpassed Cunningham's score permanently.|$|E

25|$|Lucas is {{particularly}} {{well known for}} his activism and outspokenness. His criticism of drug use and his sponsorship of public service ad campaigns {{about the dangers of}} unprotected sex in the gay community led Harvey Fierstein to <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> for The Advocate.

25|$|In 1807, Jewitt {{published}} his Journal Kept at Nootka Sound. The interest generated by this journal prompted Richard Alsop to <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> extensively. This material, combined with his earlier and more terse Journal, {{culminated in the}} 1815 publication of A Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of {{the crew of the}} ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives. Very little of the Journal is left out of the Narrative—e.g. the episode (28 March 1804) of an accidental fatal shooting by a father of his children. The main difference is that in the former Jewitt refers to Maquinna as a chief, and in the latter as a king.|$|E

[...] Nonetheless, he felt the final product ended up being better than anything he would have created.|$|E
