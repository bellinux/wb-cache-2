40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of pollution to the optimal taxation and public provision. Environmental deterioration is modelled to be created by a <b>harmful</b> <b>externality</b> of consumption. It is assumed {{that there are two}} types of households with high and low productivity, endogenous wages and a government using a mixed taxation scheme. As a result of the asymmetric information the government needs to take the self-selection constraint into account when designing the optimal tax policy. It will be shown that the social valuation of the externality consist of terms indicating the effects directed on consumers, producers, the government and the labour markets respectively. It turns out that in the consumer side the direct effect and the self-selection effect have opposite signs indicating that the environmental and the redistributive objectives are inconsistent. However, in the producer side the direct effect and the indirect effect from wage adjustment in the labour markets have both positive signs indicating consistence between these two goals of the government. Another considerable result comes from the commodity taxation: it is shown that Dixitś principle of targeting continues to hold unless the endogeneity assumption is enlarged to apply all factor prices...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{corrective}} tax {{has long}} been viewed by economists as a theoretically desirable remedy for the problem of <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities,</b> its actual use has been limited, mainly to the domain of pollution. Liability, in contrast, has great importance in controlling <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities.</b> I compare the tax and liability here in theory and suggest that the conclusions help to explain the observed predominance of liability over taxation, except {{in the area of}} pollution. The following factors are emphasized in the analysis: inefficiency of incentives under taxes when, as would be typical, it would be impractical for the state to incorporate into taxes all of the variables that significantly affect expected harm; efficiency of incentives under strict liability, which requires only that actual harms be measured; efficiency of incentives to exercise precautions under the negligence rule; administrative cost advantages of liability deriving from its being applied only when harm occurs; and dilution of incentives under liability when suit would be unlikely or injurers {{would not be able to}} pay fully for harms caused. ...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{agencies}} {{charged with}} {{public health and}} safety typically promulgate uniform regulatory standards, which suggests the agencies are concerned mainly to reduce <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities,</b> with little concern for firms' costs. A focus on benefits, to the exclusion of costs, in standard-setting and enforcement leads to inefficiencies. We show that, even when the legislature cannot peg the budget to a specific enforcement policy, it can reduce the distortions by limiting the enforcement agency's budget and by permitting the agency to partially self-finance from rebates of noncompliance fines...|$|R
40|$|Traffic safety {{mandates}} {{are typically}} {{designed to reduce}} the <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities</b> of risky behaviors. We consider whether motorcycle helmet laws also reduce a beneficial externality by decreasing organ donation rates. Our central estimates show that state-level counts of organ donors killed in motor vehicle accidents increase by 10 percent following helmet law repeals. In contrast, organ donations due to circumstances other than motor vehicle accidents {{do not respond to}} variation in helmet mandates. The estimates imply that every death of a helmetless motorcyclist prevents or delays as many as 0. 33 deaths among individuals on organ transplant waiting lists...|$|R
40|$|Taxation and {{liability}} are compared as means of controlling <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities,</b> {{with a view}} toward explaining why the use of liability predominates over taxation. Taxation suffers from a disadvantage in the analysis: because taxes do not reflect all the variables affecting expected harm, inefficiency results, whereas efficiency under liability requires only assessment of actual harm. However, liability also suffers from a disadvantage: incentives are diluted because injurers escape suit. Joint use of taxation {{and liability}} is examined, and it is shown that liability should be employed fully, with taxation taking up the slack due to escape from suit. ...|$|R
40|$|Self-{{reporting}} [...] {{the reporting}} by parties {{of their own}} behavior to an enforcement authority [...] is a commonly observed aspect of law enforcement, as {{in the context of}} environmental and safety regulation. We add self-reporting to the model of the control of <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities</b> through probabilistic law enforcement. Optimal self-reporting schemes are characterized and are shown to offer two advantages over schemes without self-reporting: enforcement resources are saved because individuals who are led to report harmful acts need not be identified; risk is reduced because individuals bear certain sanctions when they report their behavior, rather than face uncertain sanctions. ...|$|R

Two features of this association {{suggest that it is}} causal: first, nearly all of it is concentrated among men, who account for over 90 percent of all motorcyclist deaths, and second, helmet mandates are unrelated to the supply of donors who die in circumstances other than motor vehicle accidents.

30|$|The {{problem that}} a {{successful}} market test {{of goods and}} services does not guarantee a full internalization of the social costs they may cause is not specific to innovations. Even when <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities</b> are well known, affected third parties may be unable to force the party which causes the social costs to internalize these costs. (Government regulations such as safety, hygiene, and environmental norms which make violators liable for transgressions aim at curing this.) What is specific to innovations is that, because of the epistemic boundary implied by novelty, their negative effects are often completely unanticipated and hence not subject to existing regulations. The social costs of an innovation only turn out with a considerable time delay after it has spread in the market. Even if regulations or other measures are then invoked, substantial damages may have already accumulated. Hence, because of the epistemic boundary the risk of potentially very substantial welfare losses caused by non-internalized social costs of an innovation can never be excluded.|$|R
40|$|Taxation and {{liability}} are compared here as means of controlling <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities.</b> It is emphasized that liability has {{an advantage over}} taxation: inefficiency of incentives arises under taxation when, as would be typical, it would be impractical for a tax to reflect all variables that significantly affect expected harm, whereas efficiency of incentives under liability {{does not require the}} state to determine expected harm – it requires only that injurers pay for harm that occurs. However, taxation enjoys an advantage over liability: incentives under liability are diluted to the degree that injurers might escape suit.

30|$|The {{economics}} {{of climate change}} is simple. When we burn fossil fuels we emit CO 2 into the atmosphere, and this leads over time to potential harmful effects. Such a process is an externality that occurs because those who produce the emissions do not pay for that privilege, {{and those who are}} harmed are not compensated. One major lesson from economics is that unregulated markets cannot efficiently deal with <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities.</b> Any solution needs substantial reductions in the emissions of CO 2 into the atmosphere. An obvious instrument to achieve that goal is to raise the market price of those emissions. Raising the price on carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to consumers to reduce the consumption of goods and services that are carbon-intensive. Second, it will provide signals to producers to substitute away from inputs that are carbon-intensive. Third, it will provide market incentives to innovate and adopt new low-carbon products and process. Fourth, a carbon price will economize on the information that is required to undertake all these tasks (Nordhaus 2008).|$|R
40|$|Most of us {{intuitively}} take {{discrimination based}} on gender or ethnicity to be impermissible {{because we have a}} right to be treated on the basis of merit and capacity rather than e. g. ethnicity or gender. I call this suggestion the Impermissibility Account. I argue that, despite how the Impermissibility Account seems intuitive to most of us with a humanist outlook, it is indefensible. I show that well-informed discrimination can sometimes be permissible, and even morally required, meaning we cannot have a strict right not to be discriminated against. I then propose an alternative and more plausible account which I call the Fairness and Externalities Account, arguing that acts of discrimination are wrong partly because they are unfair and partly because they create <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities</b> which—analogously to pollution—there is a collective responsibility to minimize. Both of these factors are however defeasible, meaning that if the Fairness and Externalities Account is correct, then discrimination is sometimes permissible. These results are counterintuitive, and suggest that the ethics of discrimination requires further attention...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} view {{of economists}} {{has been that}} corrective taxes are superior to direct regulation of <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities</b> when the state’s information about control costs is incomplete. In recent years, however, many economists seem to have adopted the view that either corrective taxes or quantity regulation could be superior to the other. One argument for this view, identified with Weitzman (1974), holds only if the state is constrained to use a fixed tax rate (a linear tax schedule) even when harm is nonlinear. Corrective taxes are indeed superior to quantity regulation if [...] as seems more plausible [...] the state can impose a nonlinear tax equal to the schedule of harm or can adjust the tax rate upon learning that it diverges from marginal harm. Another argument, associated with Baumol and Oates (1988), is that quantity regulation gains appeal when the state is uncertain about the harm caused by an externality. In this case, however, a corrective tax schedule (equal to the expected harm schedule) is superior to quantity regulation...|$|R
40|$|Sharing is an {{indispensable}} part of American property law, often mediating the harsh implications of ownership rights. Yet sharing {{is also a}} hidden component of this legal structure. In both theory and doctrinal manifestations, sharing is overshadowed by the iconic property right of exclusion. This Article argues that property law suffers a critical loss from its under-recognition of sharing because it fails to use sharing to correct distributional failures {{in a world of}} increasingly scarce resources. Sharing could be the basis for developing a rich range of outcomes in common property disputes. Instead, as described by Calabresi and Melamed in their famed article on remedies, outcomes are tagged to exclusion in the form of blanket property rules and “keep out” signs. As a result, sharing currently functions merely to create very narrow exceptions to broad rights of ownership. To correct this failure, this Article presents a model for sharing as a preferred outcome in property disputes. Sharing as an outcome is a powerful means of addressing property inequalities, limiting <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities,</b> preserving efficiency, and harnessing the extraordinary potential of outcomes in property law...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{a variety}} of factors in the last half-century, local governments have {{increasingly}} relied upon exactions to finance new development projects. Developers and land owners have challenged these development conditions as abuses of the police power or as violations of the United States Constitution’s Equal Protection, Due Process and Takings Clauses. Recently, the Supreme Court has departed from its long tradition of deference to municipalities by heightening judicial scrutiny of challenged exactions. If a court finds an exaction to be unconstitutional, the court typically severs the exaction from the permit and enforces the remaining permit as if it were whole. By thus enforcing permits minus their conditions, courts allow developers to proceed unhindered and prevent municipalities from mitigating the <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities</b> or recouping the public costs resulting from development. The inefficiencies and inequalities created by this heightened review could be mitigated by applying the severability doctrine established in contract and public law to the law of landuse exactions. Applying the severability analysis would restore an element of certainty to municipal regulators by reducing their incentive to over-regulate development, and benefit both developers and municipalities by allowing a more efficient and equitable method of permitting development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCongestion, car exhaust gases, {{permanent}} {{noise and}} risk of accidents {{are the most common}} and severe problems in conurbations, especially in their cores or commerce districts. Such problems basically result from the continuously increasing amount of private and business vehicles on streets. It is obvious that more cars moving on the streets indicate more environmental negative externalities, therefore, new solutions to combat them are not only needed, but absolutely necessary. The aim of this dissemination paper is to focus on the idea of the SmartFreight project which was introduced in the UE a few years ago, but still has been neglected by many city representatives or cargo delivery companies. The project deals with all the problems that appear inside city centres due to cargo trucks services or lorry door-to-door delivery. The authors of this paper posit the hypothesis that for the time being, the SmartFreight project is the best solution against congestion and environmentally <b>harmful</b> <b>externalities</b> in urban areas. To support the hypothesis and show the effectiveness and benefits of the SmartFreight project implementation, the authors discuss all assumptions of the SmartFreight project and analyse statistics, figures and survey data collected in the cities where the SmartFreight project has been launched...|$|R

Since the writing of A. C.

In contrast, liability has great importance in reducing harm. Much of the vast terrain of accidents – from oil spills, to crane mishaps, to car collisions – is subject to liability but not to taxation. I here compare corrective taxation to liability in two versions of a model, with a view toward shedding light on the difference in their application. 1 In the first version, the danger from an injurer’s activity depends on factors that vary among injurers. For example, the probability and seriousness of an oil spill due t...|$|R
40|$|Cargo cycles {{can play}} a {{significant}} role in supplying urban centers, helping to decrease <b>harmful</b> commercial transport <b>externalities.</b> Some companies have already carried out initial pilot schemes using cargo cycles in order to assess technologically and economically feasible use cases. However, a structural overview of the relevant market segments for commercial cargo cycle use and suitable recommendations is lacking. This paper provides results from an extensive empirical survey, based on desk research and 45 expert interviews with corporate fleet managers, urban planners, and representatives from municipalities and bicycle associations. Hidden potentials can be found not only in logistics industries, but also in businesses offering home deliveries and other services. Insight into drivers, constraints and companies' requirements allows recommendations to be derived for municipalities to stimulate cargo cycles' market penetration. These recommendations address regulative frameworks, strategic urban planning, infrastructure adjustments, testing programs, collaborations with the private sector, platforms for knowledge transfer, and the use of cargo cycles by public authorities...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in the number of freight vehicles on South Africa’s rural road network has received substantial attention. Insinuations persist that long-distance road freight haulage is of a somewhat unsavoury economic nature, and that strict economic re-regulation of the land freight transport is necessary. During the 1970 s road transport replaced rail carriage as the dominant form of long-distance freight transport (excluding minerals and ore) in South Africa. On long hauls road freight carriers transport certain primary products of an organic nature (such as timber, fish and agricultural produce), some semi-finished goods, many finished goods and most consumer goods. Road freight carriers are continuously gaining market share on long-distance links where rail transport is the more cost efficient mode. The greater value added by road freight carriers in comparison with rail transport through service effectiveness is often more than the cost premium paid for utilising their service rather than making use of rail transport. Throughout history, governments have involved themselves in transport. A diverse range of arguments have been advanced for this involvement in transport, including the following: Control of excessive competition, co-ordination of transport, integration of transport with economic policy, maintenance of safety, security, and order, provision of costly infrastructure, provision of public goods, recovery of the true resource cost of transport inputs, regulation of <b>harmful</b> conduct and <b>externalities,</b> restraint of monopoly power, and social support. A set of nine instruments can be identified that governments apply to influence the performance of the freight transport industry: Legislation, direct supply, fiscal measures, monetary measures, moral appeal and persuasion, policies relating to strategic commodities, procurement policy, provision of information, and research and development. The best prospects for a sound development of land freight transport activity in South Africa will be offered within the framework of a free-functioning freight transport market.  </p...|$|R
