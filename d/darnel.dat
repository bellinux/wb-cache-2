5|$|Aristotle's pupil and {{successor}} at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, {{wrote the}} History of Plants, the first classical book of botany. It has an Aristotelian structure, {{but rather than}} focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, comparing natural and artificial processes. Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical. Where Aristotle insisted that species have a fixed place on the scala naturae, Theophrastus suggests that one kind of plant can transform into another, as when a field sown to wheat turns to the weed <b>darnel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{writes that}} plants can grow spontaneously, from seed, or from {{vegetative}} {{parts of the}} plant. Plants with bulbs grow from those. Soil and climate influence growth. Some plants change into others unless care is taken, so bergamot turns into mint, and wheat turns into <b>darnel.</b> He reports that if celery is trodden after sowing, it will become curly, and that figs are the easiest trees to propagate, whereas date palms have to be grown from several seeds together, and they like irrigation, dung, salt (at the age of one year) and being transplanted. Other kinds of palm have different habits and fruits. He notes that gall insects come out of wild figs and make the cultivated figs swell, which helps to prevent premature shedding of the fruit. The male spathe of the date palm is cut off and brought to the female, and its dust is shaken over the female tree to make it fruit.|$|E

5000|$|The Five Knights' case, {{also called}} <b>Darnel's</b> or Darnell's case, 3 How. St. Tr. 1 (K.B. 1627), was an {{important}} case in English law, fought by five knights (among them Thomas Darnell) in 1627 against forced loans placed on them by King Charles I in a common law court. Thomas Darnell, John Corbet, Walter Earle, John Heveningham, and Edmund Hampden petitioned King's Bench for a writ of habeas corpus to be set free. The attorney general replied {{that they were being}} held [...] "by the special command of his majesty." [...] The question before the court was whether this was an adequate return on the writ. The court found in favour of the King, since common law had no control over the royal or absolute prerogatives of the monarch. The Petition of Right of 1628 clarified this situation and limited the monarch's absolute prerogatives.|$|R
40|$|Special {{elements}} and values {{have always been}} {{of interest in the}} study of lattice-ordered groups, arising naturally from totally-ordered groups and lexicographic extensions. Much work has been done recently with the class of lattice-ordered groups whose root system of regular subgroups has a plenary subset of special values. We call such l-groups special valued. In this paper, we first show that several familiar structures of l-groups, namely polars, minimal prime subgroups, and the lex kernel, are recognizable from the lattice and the identity; that is, knowing which element of the lattice is the group identity, we can pick out in the lattice all the dements of polars, minimal primes, and the lex kernel. This then leads to an easy proof that special elements can be recognized from the lattice and the identity. We then prove several results about the class S of special-valued l-groups. We give a simple and direct proof that S is closed with respect to joins of convex l-subgroups, incidentally giving a direct proof that S is a quasi torsion class. This proof is then used to show that the special-valued and finite-valued kernels of l-groups are recognizable from the lattice and the identity. We show also that the lateral completion of a special-valued l-group is special-valued and is an a*-extension of the original l-group. Our most important result is that the lateral completion of a completely-distributive normal-valued l-group is special-valued. This lends itself easily to a new and similar proof of Ball, Conrad, and <b>Darnel's</b> result that every normal-valued l-group can be l-embedded into a special-valued l-group. Readers familiar with the impact of the Conrad-Harvey-Holland Theorem on abelian l-groups will recognize the importance of the last theorem {{to the study of the}} class of normal-valued l-groups and to the study of proper varieties of l-groups, all of which are normal valued...|$|R

It is true, of course, that, {{in the end}} of ends, {{nothing but}} the right conquers; the {{prevalent}} thorns of wrong, at last, crackle away in indiscriminate flame: and of the good seed sown, one grain in a thousand some day comes up--and somebody lives by it; but most of our great teachers, not excepting Carlyle and Emerson themselves, are a little too encouraging in their proclamation of this comfort, not, to my mind, very sufficient, when for the present our fields are full of nothing but <b>darnel</b> instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley; and none of them seem to me yet to have enough insisted on the inevitable power and infectiousness of all evil, and the easy and utter extinguishableness of good. Medicine often fails of its effect--but poison never: and while, in summing the observation of past life, not unwatchfully spent, I can truly say that I have a thousand times seen patience disappointed of her hope, and wisdom of her aim, I have never yet seen folly fruitless of mischief, nor vice conclude but in calamity.|$|E
60|$|He levied certain duties called tonnage and {{poundage}} {{which had}} not been granted by the Parliament, and could lawfully be levied by no other power; he called upon the seaport towns to furnish, and to pay all the cost for three months of, a fleet of armed ships; and he required the people to unite in lending him large sums of money, the repayment of which was very doubtful. If the poor people refused, they were pressed as soldiers or sailors; if the gentry refused, they were sent to prison. Five gentlemen, named SIR THOMAS <b>DARNEL,</b> JOHN CORBET, WALTER EARL, JOHN HEVENINGHAM, and EVERARD HAMPDEN, for refusing were taken up by a warrant of the King's privy council, and were sent to prison without any cause but the King's pleasure being stated for their imprisonment.

His lawyers contended No, because to encroach upon the rights of the English people would be to do wrong, and the King could do no wrong. The accommodating judges decided in favour of this wicked nonsense; and here was a fatal division between the King and the people.|$|E

The friend of all the winds, wide-armed he towers And glints his steely aglets in the sun, Or whitens fitfully with sudden bloom Of leaves breeze-lifted, much as when a shoal [...] 120 Of devious minnows wheel from where a pike Lurks balanced 'neath the lily-pads, and whirl A rood of silver bellies to the day. Alas! no acorn from the British oak 'Neath which slim fairies tripping wrought those rings Of greenest emerald, wherewith fireside life Did with the invisible spirit of Nature wed, Was ever planted here!
