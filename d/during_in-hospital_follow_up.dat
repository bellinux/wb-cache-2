40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} {{the long term}} outcome in patients treated with percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA) for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).  DESIGN AND SETTING—Observational, single centre study.  PATIENTS— 25 patients (13  women, 12  men, mean (SD) age 54. 7  (15. 0) years) with drug treatment resistant New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2. 8  (0. 6) symptoms attributed to a high left ventricular outflow gradient (LVOTG) and a coronary artery anatomy suitable for intervention.  INTERVENTION—PTSMA by injection of 4. 1  (2. 6)  ml of alcohol (96 %) into 1. 4  (0. 6) septal perforator arteries to ablate the hypertrophied interventricular septum.  OUTCOME MEASURES—During <b>in-hospital</b> <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> enzyme rise, the frequency of atrioventricular conduction lesions requiring permanent DDD pacing, and in-hospital mortality were assessed. Long term <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> (30  (4) months, range 24 - 36 months) included symptoms, echocardiographic measurements of left atrial and left ventricular dimensions and function, and LVOTG.  RESULTS—Mean postinterventional creatine kinase rise was 780  (436)  U/l. During PTSMA 13  patents developed total heart block, permanent pacing being necessary in five of them. One 86  year old patient died from ventricular fibrillation associated with intensive treatment (β mimetic and theophylline) for coexistent severe obstructive airway disease. After three months, three patients underwent re-PTSMA because of a dissatisfactory primary result, leading to LVOTG elimination in all of them. During long term <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> LVOTG showed sustained reduction (3  (6)  mm Hg at rest and 12  (19)  mm Hg with provocation) associated with stable symptomatic improvement (NYHA class 1. 2  (1. 0)) and without significant global left ventricular dilatation.  CONCLUSIONS—PTSMA is an effective non-surgical technique for reduction of symptoms and LVOTG in HOCM. Prospective, long term observations of larger populations are {{necessary in order to}} {{determine the}} definitive significance of the procedure.    Keywords: hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation; left ventricular outflow tract gradient; myocardial contrast echocardiograph...|$|R

40|$|Background and {{aim of the}} study: Today, ageing of {{the western}} {{population}} is causing aortic valve surgery to be performed in elderly patients with increasing frequency. The study aim was to evaluate surgical outcome in octogenarian patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR). Methods: A total of 100 patients (mean age 82. 1 +/- 2. 7 years; range: 80 - 95 years) who underwent AVR {{over a three-year period}} was reviewed. Concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 34 % of cases, and a bioprosthesis was implanted in 80 %. The mean logistic EuroSCORE was 13. 3 %. Results: Operative mortality was 8. 0 %. In multivariate analysis, a logistic EuroSCORE >= 13. 5 % (p = 0. 02), cross-clamp time >= 75 min (p = 0. 02) and postoperative acute renal failure were predictors for <b>in-hospital</b> mortality. <b>Follow</b> <b>up</b> was 100 % complete; the mean <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> period was 10. 6 months.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis and severe sepsis in surgical ICU patients and define patient characteristics associated with their acquisition and outcome. DESIGN: One-month prospective study of critically ill patients with a 28 day <b>in-hospital</b> <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit (SICU) at a tertiary care institution. METHODS: All patients (n = 170) admitted to the SICU between April 1 and April 30, 1992 were prospectively followed for 28 days. Daily surveillance was performed by two dedicated, specifically-trained research nurses. Medical and nursing chart reviews were performed, and <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> information at six and twelve months was obtained. RESULTS: The in-hospital surveillance represented 2246 patient-days, including 658 ICU patient-days. Overall, 158 patients (93 %) had SIRS for an incidence of 542 episodes/ 1000 patients-days. The incidence of SIRS in the ICU was even higher (840 episodes/ 1000 patients-days). A total of 83 patients (49 %) had sepsis; among them 28 developed severe sepsis. Importantly, 13 patients had severe sepsis after discharge from the ICU. Patient groups were comparable with respect to age, sex ratio, and type of surgery performed. Apache II score on admission to the ICU and ASA score at time of surgery were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) only for patients who subsequently developed severe sepsis. The crude mortality at 28 days was 8. 2 % (14 / 170); it markedly differed among patient groups: 6 % for those with SIRS vs. 35 % for patients with severe sepsis. Patients with sepsis and severe sepsis had a longer mean length of ICU stay (2. 1 +/- 0. 2 and 7. 5 +/- 1. 5, respectively) than those with SIRS (1. 45 +/- 0. 1) or control patients (1. 16 +/- 0. 1). Total length of hospital stay also markedly differed among groups (35 +/- 9 (severe sepsis), 24 +/- 2 (sepsis), 11 +/- 0. 8 (SIRS), and 9 +/- 0. 1 (controls, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Almost everyone in the SICU had SIRS. Therefore, because of its poor specificity, SIRS was not helpful predicting severe sepsis and septic shock. Patients who developed sepsis or severe sepsis had higher crude mortality and length of stay {{than those who did}} not. Studies designed to identify those who develop complications of SIRS would be very useful...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{surgical}} {{approach for}} effusive constric-tive pericarditis (ECP) {{has not been}} extensively studied. We present our institution’s early and long-term results of peri-cardiectomy in our cohort of patients with ECP. Methods: Diagnosis was made primarily by echocardiog-raphy. Right heart catheterisation was performed in eight patients. Pre-operatively, 10 patients had undergone at least one previous attempt at therapeutic pericardiocentesis. Pericardiectomy was performed where appropriate (thick-ened or inflamed). Results: Of our 12 patients (50 % male, median age 48 years, range 17 – 72 years), the underlying aetiology included idiopathic in five (41. 6 %), tuberculosis in four (33 %), and malignancy in three patients (25 %). Elective surgery was performed in nine patients. Median values of both central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased markedly postoperatively (from 16. 5 to 11. 0 mmHg, p = 0. 02; 20. 0 – 15. 0 mmHg, p = 0. 01, respec-tively). There was no <b>in-hospital</b> mortality. <b>Follow</b> <b>up</b> ranged from three months to nine years (median three years).

So {{there is a need}} to study other methods of sternal fixation (titanium plate fixation) and to compare with the traditional wire cerclage method. MethodsThirty isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients were followed in this study regarding closure of their sternums; 15 with our method of concern: the Sternalock plates (group A) and 15 with the conventional stainless steel wiring (group B). The two groups were compared in a prospective non randomized study in the period of Jan 2013 to Jan 2015. Patients were <b>followed</b> <b>up</b> over 6 months postoperatively regarding pain among other factors. ResultsThe two groups' demographics and perioperative variables were properly matched. They were <b>followed</b> <b>in-hospital,</b> at one month and over 6 months postoperatively: no mortalities; pain was much less in group A <b>during</b> <b>in-hospital</b> and at 1 month follow but at six months; no significant pain difference was detectable. Less narcotic need in group A but hospital stay was almost the same. Both groups demonstrated good healing at the end of the study with slightly higher incidence of wound infection and need for refixation in group B.

40|$|Abstract Background A high {{prevalence}} of {{impaired glucose tolerance}} and unknown type 2 -diabetes in patients with coronary heart disease and no previous diagnosis of diabetes have been reported. The aims {{of the present study}} were to investigate the {{prevalence of}} abnormal glucose regulation (AGR) 3 months after an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in patients without known glucometabolic disturbance, to evaluate the reliability of a 75 -g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performed very early after an acute STEMI to predict the presence of AGR at 3 months, and to study other potential predictors measured in-hospital for AGR at 3 months. Methods This was an observational cohort study prospectively enrolling 224 STEMI patients treated with primary PCI. An OGTT was performed very early after an acute STEMI and was repeated in 200 patients after 3 months. We summarised the exact agreement observed, and assessed the observed reproducibility of the OGTTs performed <b>in-hospital</b> and at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> The patients were classified into glucometabolic categories defined according to the World Health Organisation criteria. AGR was defined as the sum of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 -diabetes. Results The prevalence of AGR at three months was 24. 9 % (95 % CI 19. 1, 31. 4 %), reduced from 46. 9 % (95 % CI 40. 2, 53. 6) when measured in-hospital. Only, 108 of 201 (54 %) patients remained in the same glucometabolic category after a repeated OGTT. High levels of HbA 1 c and admission plasma glucose in-hospital significantly predicted AGR at 3 months (p Conclusion The prevalence of AGR in STEMI patients was lower than expected. HbA 1 c, admission plasma glucose and fasting plasma glucose measured in-hospital seem to be useful as early markers of longstanding glucometabolic disturbance. An OGTT performed very early after a STEMI did not provide reliable information on long-term glucometabolic state and should probably not be recommended. </p...|$|R

METHODS: We selected 40 patients who were candidates for elective thoracotomy in the Thoracic Surgery Department of the Federal University of S&# 227;o Paulo/Paulista School of Medicine, in the city of S&# 227;o Paulo, Brazil. The patients were randomized into two groups: conventional thoracotomy (CT, n = 20) and neurovascular bundle preservation (NBP, n = 20). All of the patients underwent thoracic epidural anesthesia and muscle-sparing thoracotomy. Pain intensity was assessed with a visual analog scale on postoperative days 1, 3, and 5, as well as by monitoring patient requests for/consumption of analgesics.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{delivery}} of high-quality manual chest compressions is rarely achieved in practice. Mechanical chest compression devices can consistently deliver high-quality chest compressions. The recent publication of large prehospital trials {{of these devices}} provides important new information {{about the role of}} these devices. RECENT FINDINGS: The Circulation Improving Resuscitation Care (CIRC), LUCAS in cardiac arrest (LINC) and Prehospital Randomized Assessment of a Mechanical Compression Device (PARAMEDIC) trials have recently been published. All these large prehospital trials found that the routine use of mechanical compression devices in the prehospital setting did not improve survival rates compared to those observed with manual chest compressions. There remain limited data on the routine use of devices <b>during</b> <b>in-hospital</b> cardiac arrest. Observational studies report favourable outcomes with the use of mechanical devices in special circumstances, including as a bridge to advanced therapies such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

The dominant correlate of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> blood pressure was blood pressure at initial screening (r = 0. 60; P < 0. 01 between initial and <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> systolic blood pressure; r = 0. 59, P < 0. 01 between initial and <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> diastolic blood pressure). Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that reactions to the stressor provided minimal prediction of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> blood pressure over and above that afforded by blood pressure at initial screening. In the case of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> systolic blood pressure, systolic reactions to stress accounted for only 1 % of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> variance; systolic blood pressure at initial screening accounted for 34 %. With regard to diastolic blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> the independent contribution from diastolic reactions to stress was less than 1 %. CONCLUSION [...] Pressor reactions to psychological stress provide minimal independent prediction of blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> Measurement of reactivity is not a useful clinical index of the course of future blood pressure...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> in {{traumatic}} blunt aortic injury patients who underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) at a Level I Trauma Center In Dayton, Ohio. Previous research has shown that trauma patients, as a whole, have poor <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> in this population. Systems and patient level factors contribute to poor <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> In this population. Because TEVAR In traumatic aortic injuries is now becoming more common than open repair, we wanted to analyze <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> rates In this growing subset of trauma patients. We hypothesized that traumatic blunt aortic injury patients are also lost to <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> in the post-operative period. Our primary objective was to explore if these patients are being followed appropriately and to identify any systems or patient level factors contribute to the failure to <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> Our results suggest that long distance and unemployment were the two main reasons for non-compliance along with a few system level factors, such as not ordering <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> CT, no appointment made with trauma clinic, and incorrect contact information in the records...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relation of}} cardiac autoantibody and disease status in a consecutive series of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by prospective antibody testing at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> METHODS: Antibody status was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence in 110 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (85 male, mean (SD) age 44 (13) years) at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> (mean (SD) 14 (12) months); in 57 of them cardiac specific anti-alpha myosin antibody titres were also measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients underwent complete evaluation at diagnosis and clinical and non-invasive assessment at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> including exercise testing with maximal oxygen consumption measurements. RESULTS: The frequency of cardiac specific antibodies by immunofluorescence was lower at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> than at diagnosis (28 (25 %) v 11 (10 %), P = 0. 002). Mean (SEM) anti-alpha myosin antibody titres at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> were also lower than at diagnosis (0. 24 (0. 02) v 0. 30 (0. 02), P = 0. 038); 24 % of patients at diagnosis and 14 % at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> had an abnormal ELISA result. None of the patients who were negative by immunofluorescence or ELISA at diagnosis became positive at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> Presence of antibody at diagnosis was associated with milder symptoms and greater exercise capacity at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> and persistence of antibody at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> was associated with stable disease and milder symptoms at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac specific autoantibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy become undetectable with disease progression; this is a recognised feature of other autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes. Detection of these antibodies at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> may provide a non-invasive marker of early dilated cardiomyopathy...|$|R
