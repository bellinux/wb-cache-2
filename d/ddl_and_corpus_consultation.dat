It also examined whether the use of concordance program enhanced accuracy in writing, and whether any effects of indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> could be retained over a long-term period. Additionally, their perceptions and attitudes toward the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> were investigated. ^ The results indicated that, in terms of accuracy gain, uncoded/coded indirect feedback with the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> led to more accurate error correction than uncoded indirect feedback only. Likewise, from the short-term perspective, uncoded feedback with the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> was significantly more effective than uncoded/coded indirect feedback only.

While much research on new literacies focuses on the World Wide Web, the aim {{in this study is}} to investigate the importance of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> as a new type of literacy which is of particular relevance in the context of language learning and teaching. After briefly situating the theoretical and pedagogical context of the study in relation to authenticity and learner autonomy, the paper describes an empirical study involving eight postgraduate students of French. As part of a Masters course they write a short text and subsequently attempt to improve it by using concordancing software to consult a small corpus containing texts on a similar subject. The analysis of the results reveals a significant number of changes made by the learners which may be classified as follows in order of frequency: grammatical errors (gender and agreement, prepositions, verb forms/mood, negation and syntax); misspellings, accents and hyphens; lexico- grammatical patterning (native language interference, choice of verb and inappropriate vocabulary); and capitalisation. The conclusion notes that the situation in which these students found themselves (i. e. faced with a text on which the teacher had indicated phrases which could be improved) is replicated in many cases every day, <b>and</b> suggests that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> may have a useful role to play in the context of interactive feedback, particularly in cases where traditional language learning resources are of little use.

One of {{the most important of these}} is the use of the technology itself: whether one sympathises that this is a problem or not, it is clearly an obstacle to DDL for a variety of reasons, and only removing the computer from the equation will help to overcome it. It seems obvious that paper-based materials will not afford all the advantages of the fully autonomous hands-on concordancing DDL is commonly associated with.

However, to date there has been no empirical research aiming to compare the use of paper-based <b>and</b> hands-on <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> directly. In this study, two groups of lower-intermediate level students were introduced to English language corpora in the last 15 - 20 minutes of their regular weekly class, alternating between paper-based materials and hands-on consultation so that each learner had experience of both. After 10 weeks all students were at least moderately familiar with both formats; the efficiency of each was then compared by testing the final two items covered – language points which had previously been seen to pose problems for many of these learners. It is clear that some learners prefer working on paper at least initially, while others are quickly open to working directly on computer. The differences are discussed in relation to feedback obtained at the start and again at the end of the course, taking account of individual motivations and learning styles. The overall results suggest that there is unlikely to be a single best version of DDL for all learners in all situations at all times, and that variety and sensitivity to learner variation and local conditions is crucial...|$|R

40|$|International audienceElectronic corpora {{can be used}} {{not only}} for {{language}} description {{but also as a}} resource for teaching and learning in {{what has come to be}} known as "data-driven learning" or DDL (Johns 1990). The arguments for and against have accumulated over two decades and more: in favour are numerous theoretical pedagogical advantages, while the objections tend to revolve around practical and logistical barriers to implementation. Certainly in its more extreme forms, it seems difficult to reconcile DDL with the reality of ordinary language classrooms (e. g. Mukherjee 2006). One of the most apparent obstacles here is the use of the technology itself - the computer with its query software and interfaces for accessing electronic corpora - which has repeatedly been found to pose substantial problems for many learners (e. g. Yoon & Hirvela 2004) as well as teachers (e. g. Farr 2008). Where this is the case, the obvious question is whether the computer can be successfully removed from the equation without losing the benefits of the overall approach (cf. Boulton 2010). It seems obvious that paper-based materials will not afford all the advantages of the fully autonomous, hands-on concordancing DDL is commonly associated with. However, the earliest instantiations of DDL relied almost exclusively on concordance print-outs, and prepared materials can be argued to allow a gentle lead-in, with teacher and learner roles changing gradually as they concentrate first on the new approach (<b>DDL)</b> <b>and</b> the new materials (corpora) without also having to worry about the new technology at the start. Indeed, such has been common practice in many DDL studies (see Boulton forthcoming for a review). Each approach has its adherents, but to date there has been little if any empirical research attempting a direct comparison of the use of paper-based <b>and</b> hands-on <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation.</b> This study draws on past experience with two different groups of students learning English at an architecture college in France. In the first case, the learners were highly receptive to an encounter with printed DDL materials (Boulton 2010); in the second, a hands-on approach to <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> was far less well received (Boulton 2009). However, the varying conditions mean that direct comparisons are difficult to make. In the present study, two groups of lower-intermediate level students at the same college were introduced to English language corpora in the last 15 - 20 minutes of their regular weekly class. Each group covered the same points using essentially the same processes, but alternated between 'hands-on' consultation (i. e. on computer) and paper-based materials (i. e. 'hands-off'). In this way, after 10 weeks all the students (n= 30) should have been at least moderately familiar with both approaches. The learning outcomes of the hands-on and hands-off approaches were compared by testing the final two items covered - language points which had previously been seen to pose problems for many of these learners. The results were compared against feedback obtained at the start and again at the end of the course on the participants' preferences and affective reactions. Previous experience suggests that those who do best are not necessarily most receptive, and vice versa. In an attempt to identify some of the variables that may underlie the individual differences, two instruments were used to relate the outcomes and reactions to motivation and learning styles. The overall conclusion seems to be that there is unlikely to be a single best version of DDL for all learners in all situations at all times, and that variety and sensitivity to learner variation and local conditions is crucial...|$|R

In this work, we aim towards formal comparison of the expressive power of these frameworks, and thus also the ontology combination paradigms that they instantiate. Reduction from DDL to E-connections is already known. We present two new reductions, from P-DL to <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> vice versa.
