40|$|New Zr-based {{metallic}} glass wires {{with and without}} bio-toxic elements of Ni and Al for the application to biomaterials were prepared by arc-melting type melt-extraction method and their characteristics were tested. The continuous {{metallic glass}} wires with a good white luster and smooth surface were obtained in various alloys such as conventional Zr-Al-Ni-Cu, Ni-free Zr-Al-Co-Cu, and Ni and Al free Zr-Ti-Co alloys. The Zr-based metallic glass wires exhibit high tensile strength reaching 1 GPa. Furthermore, the metallic glass wires showed <b>good</b> bending <b>ductility</b> and could be bent through 180 degrees without fracture. The Zr-based metallic glass wires achieve simultaneously high tensile strength, <b>good</b> bending <b>ductility</b> and high thermal stability. [doi: 10. 2320 /matertrans. MRA 2008006...|$|R
40|$|Fe 80 -xCo 20 Bx (x = 12 - 15 at%) alloy ribbons {{consisting}} of single bcc phase (12 %B), amorphous plus bcc-Fe(Co) mixed phases (13 %B) and amorphous single phase (14 %B and 15 %B) were synthesized by the melt-spinning technique. It is noticed {{that all the}} alloy ribbons containing amorphous phase exhibit <b>good</b> bending <b>ductility</b> in the as-spun state and even after annealing {{which leads to the}} precipitation of nanoscale bcc-Fe(Co) phase. The amorphous plus bcc-Fe(Co) phase alloys with lower hardness exhibited a number of microcracks in the region near the hardness indentation trace, in addition to distinct slip step markings. The decrease in hardness and the maintenance of ductility in the nanocrystalline state are interpreted to originate from microcrack-induced softening phenomenon. The nanocrystalline alloys also exhibit good soft magnetic properties with high saturation magnetization above 1. 7 T in combination with low coercivity of about 20 A/m. The <b>good</b> bending <b>ductility</b> as well as the microcrack-induced softening for the amorphous alloys including nanoscale bcc-Fe(Co) phase {{is believed to be the}} first evidence in the long development history of Fe-based nanocrystalline soft magnetic alloys. The finding of the ductile Fe-based nanocrystalline alloys with high saturation magnetization is encouraging for further extension of nanocrystalline magnetic materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Ambient and {{cryogenic}} surface mechanical attrition treatments (SMAT) {{are applied}} to bcc iron plate. Both processes result in significant surface grain refinement down to the ultrafine-grained regime; the cryogenic treatment results in a 45 % greater grain size reduction. However, the refined region is shallower in the cryogenic SMAT process. The tensile ductility of the grain size gradient remains low (< 10 %), {{in line with the}} expected behavior of the refined surface grains. <b>Good</b> tensile <b>ductility</b> in a grain size gradient requires the continuation of the gradient into an undeformed region...|$|R

Monel 400 typically finds application in marine engineering, chemical and hydro-carbon processings, heat exchangers, valves and pumps. It is covered by the following standards: BS 3075, 3076 NA 13, DTD 204B and ASTM B164.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of steel}} for {{structural}} purposes was initially slow. The Bessemer process in 1855 made steel production more efficient, and cheap steels, which had high tensile and compressive strengths plus <b>good</b> <b>ductility</b> were available from about 1870, but wrought and cast iron continued to satisfy {{most of the}} demand for iron-based building products, due mainly to problems of producing steel from alkaline ores. These problems, caused principally {{by the presence of}} phosphorus, were solved by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas in 1879.|$|E

50|$|As {{the deep}} drawing {{is a cold}} forming operation, the germane {{properties}} of the sheet metal are formability, ductility and yield strength. The material should have <b>good</b> formability and <b>ductility</b> {{so that it can}} be drawn into the desired shape without any cracks.

5000|$|Like similar irons {{with the}} carbon formed into spherical or nodular shapes, {{malleable}} iron exhibits <b>good</b> <b>ductility.</b> Incorrectly {{considered by some}} to be an [...] "old" [...] or [...] "dead" [...] material, malleable iron still has a legitimate place in the design engineer's toolbox. Malleable iron is a good choice for small castings or castings with thin cross sections (less than 0.25 inch, 6.35 mm). Other nodular irons produced with graphite in the spherical shape can be difficult to produce in these applications, due to the formation of carbides from the rapid cooling.|$|E
50|$|Copper {{used for}} the {{manufacture}} of transformer windings {{is in the form}} of wire for small products and strip for larger equipment. For small products, the wire must be strong enough to be wound without breakage, yet flexible enough to provide close-packed windings. Strip products must be of good surface quality so that insulating enamels do not break down under voltage. <b>Good</b> <b>ductility</b> is essential for the strip to be formed and packed while good strength is needed to withstand the high electro-mechanical stresses set up under occasional short-circuit conditions. Copper winding wires in transformers are compatible with all modern insulation materials, such as lacquer and enamel. Lacquers permit the close spacing of windings to give best efficiency in the coils.|$|E
50|$|The ductile-brittle {{transition}} temperature (DBTT), nil ductility temperature (NDT), or nil ductility {{transition temperature}} of a metal is the temperature {{at which the}} fracture energy passes below a predetermined value (for steels typically 40 J for a standard Charpy impact test). DBTT is important since, once a material is cooled below the DBTT, it has a much greater tendency to shatter on impact instead of bending or deforming. For example, zamak 3 exhibits <b>good</b> <b>ductility</b> at room temperature but shatters when impacted at sub-zero temperatures. DBTT {{is a very important}} consideration in selecting materials that are subjected to mechanical stresses. A similar phenomenon, the glass transition temperature, occurs with glasses and polymers, although the mechanism is different in these amorphous materials.|$|E
50|$|While {{there have}} been large {{investigations}} into PA/polyolefin blends, little has been published about the properties of PPA/ polyolefin blends. This {{may be due to}} the relatively high processing temperatures needed for PPA based resins compared to the temperature stability of polyolefins. PPA/PA/polyolefin blends exhibit a <b>good</b> balance of <b>ductility,</b> strength, stiffness, impact, and thermal performance, indicating that these types of materials should have commercial utility.|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} network-woven architecture made of TiB nanowires {{has been}} designed and realized in the matrix of a Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy. The architecturally nanostructured design was achieved by dispersing nanoparticles of B 4 C or B onto the surfaces of spherical Ti 6 Al 4 V powder particles via mechanical mixing and subsequent consolidation by spark plasma sintering. The as-sintered nanostructured Ti 6 Al 4 V-TiB composites demonstrated excellent tensile strengths and ductility that are required for critical applications. The in situ formed TiB nanowires with aspect ratios up to 300 contributed to the high tensile strengths while the architectural design of the TiB nanowires ensured the <b>good</b> tensile <b>ductility...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} Raman-based {{study on the}} {{graphite}} oxide under high pressure. The graphite oxide is stable under hydrostatic high pressure ambient. By carefully fitting the D, G, and D′ bands which are merged at some extent, we successfully retrieve the information of peak position evolution of G band of graphite oxide under pressure, and {{it is found that}} the G band pressure coefficient is very close to that of graphene, and the pressure-induced peak position shift is reversible upon releasing the pressure. The Raman-based high pressure investigation indicates that the graphite oxide possesses <b>good</b> mechanical <b>ductility</b> {{despite the fact that it}} is oxygenated by functional groups.

50|$|Cold-rolled {{sheets and}} strips come in various conditions: full-hard, half-hard, quarter-hard, and skin-rolled. Full-hard rolling reduces the {{thickness}} by 50%, {{while the others}} involve less of a reduction. Skin-rolling, {{also known as a}} skin-pass, involves the least amount of reduction: 0.5-1%. It is used to produce a smooth surface, a uniform thickness, and reduce the yield point phenomenon (by preventing Lüders bands from forming in later processing). It locks dislocations at the surface and thereby reduces the possibility of formation of Lüders bands. To avoid the formation of Lüders bands it is necessary to create substantial density of unpinned dislocations in ferrite matrix. It is also used to break up the spangles in galvanized steel. Skin-rolled stock is usually used in subsequent cold-working processes where <b>good</b> <b>ductility</b> is required.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, slit rolling was {{introduced}} to Hadeed's Rolling Mills, increasing the daily production record by more than 21%. In 1987, a scrap car shredder plant was commissioned. With a capacity of 50 tonnes per hour, it shreds cars into pieces small enough to be charged into the electric arc furnaces. In 1988, Hadeed introduced a new technology (Bar Quenching) to its rolling mills in Jubail for the manufacture of concrete reinforcing bars. This process involves high pressure surface quenching followed by self-tempering. As the bar emerges from the last rolling stand, the surface temperature is rapidly reduced by high pressure water jets. This action causes change in the microstructure of the steel, making it harder and stronger. Subsequently the heat retained in the core dissipates out and heats the surface to around 620 °C causing another change in the microstructure, which improves the ductility and toughness of the bar. This process can meet increasing demands from structural engineers for higher yield strength combined with <b>good</b> <b>ductility</b> and weldability in reinforcing steel to reduce construction costs.|$|E

40|$|Ultrahigh {{carbon steels}} (UHCSs), which contain 1 [...] 2. 1 % carbon, have {{remarkable}} structural properties for automotive application when processed to achieve fine ferrite grains with fine spheroidized carbides.

40|$|Some Fe-rich {{amorphous}} alloys of Fe-B-P-Si and Fe-B-P-Si-C {{systems were}} found to exhibit simultaneously good soft magnetic properties with high-saturation magnetization values near 1. 7 T, which are higher than those for previously reported Fe-based amorphous and glassy alloys, in addition to rather good amorphous ribbon formability, <b>good</b> bending <b>ductility,</b> and rather high corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance increased with increasing P content, accompanying by the increase in thermal stability of the amorphous phase. The decrease in the outer surface velocity of the wheel, which results in the increase of ribbon thickness, also causes an improvement of surface smoothness of the melt-spun amorphous alloy ribbons.
