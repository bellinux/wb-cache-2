2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} the {{definition}} of SPD is flawed due to cultural bias {{and that it does}} not constitute a mental disorder but simply an avoidant attachment style requiring more distant emotional proximity. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then many of the more problematic reactions these individuals show in social situations may be partly accounted for by the judgments commonly imposed on people with this style. However, {{it is important to note}} that impairment is mandatory for any behaviour to be diagnosed as a personality disorder. SPD seems to satisfy this criterion because it is linked to negative outcomes. These include a significantly compromised quality of life, smaller GAF scores even after 15 years and one of the lowest levels of [...] "life success" [...] of all personality disorders (measured as [...] "status, wealth and successful relationships").|$|E
2500|$|There are ten {{figures in}} the Picture Rock Pass {{petroglyph}} group. [...] Three are human-like figures. [...] One of these is a small stick figure in the lower left corner of the grouping. [...] The second human figure is a middle-size figure along the bottom {{to the right of}} center. [...] The largest bipedal figure is more interesting. [...] While {{it appears to be a}} human figure, it also has large horns and what may be a second set of arms. [...] This suggests it may represent a spirit figure. [...] The other seven figures depict four-legged animals. [...] They could be game animals or hunting dogs. [...] One of the animals in the center of the petroglyph grouping appears to have a rider. [...] However, experts note that the patina of the riding figure is different than the four-legged animal it is riding on or any of the other figures. This indicates that the rider was probably added after the original carving was done. [...] <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> the original figure may have been a mountain sheep or another game animal.|$|E

The machinery it has set up for the detection of crime is miserably ineffective--and yet only invent a moral epigram, saying that it works well, and you blind everybody to its blunders from that moment. Crimes cause their own detection, do they? And murder will out (another moral epigram), will it? Ask Coroners who sit at inquests in large towns <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> Lady Glyde. Ask secretaries of life-assurance companies <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> Miss Halcombe. Read your own public journals.

Multiply the cases that are reported by the cases that are NOT reported, and the bodies that are found by the bodies that are NOT found, and what conclusion do you come to? This. That there are foolish criminals who are discovered, and wise criminals who escape. The hiding of a crime, or the detection of a crime, what is it? A trial of skill between the police on one side, and the individual on the other. When the criminal is a brutal, ignorant fool, the police in nine cases out of ten win. When the criminal is a resolute, educated, highly-intelligent man, the police in nine cases out of ten lose. If the police win, you generally hear all about it. If the police lose, you generally hear nothing. And on this tottering foundation you build up your comfortable moral maxim that Crime causes its own detection! Yes--all the crime you know of.

60|$|A citizen told me {{a curious}} thing about those mines. With all my {{experience}} of mining I {{had never heard of}} anything of the sort before. The main gold reef runs about north and south--of course--for that is the custom of a rich gold reef. At Ballarat its course is between walls of slate. Now the citizen told me that throughout a stretch of twelve miles along the reef, the reef is crossed at intervals by a straight black streak of a carbonaceous nature--a streak in the slate; a streak no thicker than a pencil--and that wherever it crosses the reef you will certainly find gold at the junction. It is called the Indicator. Thirty feet {{on each side of the}} Indicator (and down in the slate, of course) is a still finer streak--a streak as fine as a pencil mark; and indeed, that is its name Pencil Mark. Whenever you find the Pencil Mark you know that thirty feet from it is the Indicator; you measure the distance, excavate, find the Indicator, trace it straight to the reef, and sink your shaft; your fortune is made, for certain. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> it is curious.

6000|$|There is an {{old saying}} that God is a circle whose centre is everywhere. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> the saint goes to the centre, the poet and artist to the ring where {{everything}} comes round again. The poet must not seek for what is still and fixed, for that has no life for him; {{and if he did}} his style would become cold and monotonous, and his sense of beauty faint and sickly, as are both style and beauty to my imagination in the prose and poetry of Newman, but be content to find his pleasure in all that is for ever passing away that it may come again, in the beauty of woman, in the fragile flowers of spring, in momentary heroic passion, in whatever is most fleeting, most impassioned, as it were, for its own perfection, most eager to return in its glory. Yet perhaps he must endure the impermanent a little, for these things return, but not wholly, for no two faces are alike, and, it may be, had we more learned eyes, no two flowers. Is it that all things are made by the struggle of the individual and the world, of the unchanging and the returning, and that the saint and the poet are over all, and that the poet has made his home in the Serpent's mouth? ...|$|E
6000|$|Save in some signal exception, a thing {{taken out}} of storage cannot be {{established}} in its former function without a sense of its comparative inadequacy. It stands in the old place, it serves the old use, and yet a new thing would be better; it would even in some subtle wise be more appropriate, if I may indulge so audacious a paradox; for the time is new, and so will be all the subconscious keeping in which our lives are mainly passed. We {{are supposed to have}} associations with the old things which render them precious, but do not the associations rather render them painful? <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> of the inanimate things, how much truer it is of those personalities which once environed and furnished our lives! Take the article of old friends, for instance: has it ever happened to the reader to witness the encounter of old friends after the lapse of years? Such a meeting is conventionally imagined to be full of tender joy, a rapture that vents itself in manly tears, perhaps, and certainly in womanly tears. But really is it any such emotion? Honestly is not it a cruel embarrassment, which all the hypocritical pretences cannot hide? The old friends smile and laugh, and babble incoherently at one another, but are they genuinely glad?
