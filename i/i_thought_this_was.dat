25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{the best way to}} win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. We never got the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but I have no excuses to offer.|$|E
25|$|The Saints' first release after Kuepper's {{departure}} was {{the live}} EP, Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow, in March 1980 on Lost Records with Bailey producing. It {{was followed by}} a studio album, The Monkey Puzzle, co-produced by Bailey and Gerry Nixon for Mushroom Records in February 1981. It reached the Top100 on the Australian Albums Chart. They had shifted to a more melodic pop-rock sound and included Hay on keyboards in the line-up. Hay left again before the next album was released in Australia in 1982 as <b>I</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>This</b> <b>Was</b> Love, But This Ain't Casablanca on Mushroom Records and elsewhere as Out in the Jungle... Where Things Ain't So Pleasant on New Rose Records. Production was credited to Ricardo Mentalban, and with Bailey, in The Saints, were Hall on bass guitar and Iain Shedden (ex-The Jolt) on drums. Additional musicians included Roger Crankwell on saxophone and clarinet, Denis Haines on piano, Paul Neiman on trombone, Steve Sidwell on trumpet and Jess Sutcliffe on piano. The Damned's Brian James guested on lead guitar.|$|E

Affleck {{wanted to}} participate in the film as he was interested in playing a comedy role, saying [...] "it sounded like a fun film to do. I wanted to do a comedy, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an opportunity to try and be funny." [...] Grazer felt that Affleck would be perfect for the role because of his deadpan timing.|$|E

500|$|AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw wrote, [...] "The whole storyline {{with the}} creepy dual-personality doc and the mind-control-dreams was good, though I sort of knew the doc must be {{involved}} from the beginning. I also wonder how it {{fits in with}} the alternate universe." [...] The A.V. Club's Zack Handlen graded the episode with a B-. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly believed that [...] "in some ways, {{this was one of}} the less-distinctive, more X-Files-ish episodes of Fringe on Thursday night... But as usual, there was another narrative layer at work here" [...] involving a grieving Olivia. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 7.4/10, explaining the case-of-the-week failed to have [...] "excitement, surprise, and suspense" [...] and lacked [...] "what makes a typical Fringe episode unique and intriguing". While calling certain parts [...] "kind of boring", Isler did however praise the episode's directing, acting, sets, and other technical aspects. He concluded his review by noting the best part of [...] "Dream Logic" [...] was the ending depicting a young Peter, [...] "It's a haunting scene, and it adds yet another stone in this long pathway to revelation that the Fringe team is building up to... But besides that great little scene at the end, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an average episode. Granted, Fringes 'average' episodes are still better than a lot of the other stuff on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Lewis's sister Leslie Lewis {{provides}} backing vocals on two tracks, {{while her}} father Eddie Gordon plays the bass harp and harmonica. [...] "He was ill last year, {{so we started}} speaking to one another," [...] Lewis told The Independent. [...] "There were no hard feelings. He just wasn't around. Every couple of years I'd get a postcard from the road – {{a picture of him}} standing next to a giant ice-sculpture of a crab, in Alaska. He was a very mysterious character. But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the right time to bring him in." [...] "The Next Messiah" [...] was influenced by her father. [...] "When someone isn't around you create what you imagine your father might be – 'a race-car driver, a four-leaf clover'," [...] Lewis explained. Lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration, for both Acid Tongue and previous work, comes from her parents. Lewis also told The Independent, [...] "I just don't know them very well. And I'm still trying to understand what happened [...] and why. It's this blank slate, I can't even remember what happened. But for some reason, these two people are so incredibly strange and funny and beautiful and messed up, that I want to keep writing about them... and maybe figure out who I am in the process." ...|$|E
500|$|Professor Milton Greene {{was played}} by guest actor Alan Alda, {{best known for}} his role as Hawkeye Pierce from the {{television}} series M*A*S*H. This was Alda's second appearance, having appeared in the previous episode [...] "Mamma Mia". In a scene of [...] "Kidney Now!", Tracy breaks down crying and says [...] "There is no baby. I was chicken! I was chicken!" [...] then Milton, who sees this, asks [...] "A guy crying about a chicken and a baby? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a comedy show." [...] This was a reference to Alda's M*A*S*H character in the series finale episode in which Hawkeye breaks down after realizing he had seen a woman smother her baby to death, not a chicken as Hawkeye had originally recalled in his repressed mind. Comedian actor Chris Parnell, who played Dr. Leo Spaceman in the season finale, has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL), a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Fey was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. Comedian actress Sherri Shepherd reprised her role as Angie Jordan, the wife of Tracy, for the fifth time. Paula Pell made her second guest spot as the character Paula Hornberger, the wife of Pete Hornberger, played by Scott Adsit. In [...] "Kidney Now!", Angie and Paula ask Liz for relationship advice. In addition, 30 Rock writers Jack Burditt, Kay Cannon, and Donald Glover appear in the episode; Burditt and Cannon appear in The Vontella Show segment as members from the audience who ask Liz questions. When Tracy accepts an honorary diploma from his former high school, in his speech, Tracy outs Glover's character. The success of the benefit concert for Milton is not explicitly referenced until Alda's character alludes to it in the season five episode [...] "Christmas Attack Zone", though in the season four episode [...] "Into the Crevasse", Milton is shown to have finished his book entitled From Peanut to President, a biography of U.S. President Jimmy Carter.|$|E

He said [...] "“When I saw LaChapelle’s work, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> amazing. How can someone have such imagination? And {{when you go back}} in history, David LaChappelle was mentored by Andy Warhol. So it was more of the artistic-father thing, that’s why I referred to myself as Andy Warhol’s grandson.” http://www.theafricareport.com/archives2/society-a-culture/3286501-creativity-knows-no-limits-.html ...|$|R

"As I {{read the}} utopian socialists, the {{scientific}} socialists, the German Social Democrats and revolutionary socialists—whatever I could in either English or French—I {{came to the}} conclusion that almost all of them, including my grandfather, were engaged in an effort to change human nature. The more I thought about it, the more <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not likely to be a successful effort. So I turned my attention more and more to political philosophy and less and less to socialist activism of any kind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Columbus {{has stated}} that {{he was drawn to}} {{directing}} the Percy Jackson movie because it gave him the [...] "opportunity to do a movie that we haven't really seen before for this generation. When I was a kid, there were movies that dealt with Greek mythology, which in terms of visual effects was really primitive. So <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an opportunity to deal with Greek mythology which children and adults {{all over the world are}} fascinated by and it was not a new genre but a new avenue, dealing with mythological creatures in a contemporary setting." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Robert Canning {{thought it}} was a fun episode, and said that it [...] "helped that the major flashbacks {{involved}} took place in a fantasy world as to not effect the whole of the show. But even in those flashbacks, the jokes stayed true to what we know of the series. Add to that the great new look of the series and you get a memorable episode from season twenty of The Simpsons." [...] Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict said he had always liked flashback and alternate future episodes, and he thought [...] "Take My Life, Please" [...] put them together in a [...] "clever way". He added: [...] "Maybe it’s all the shiny newness, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> one of the best episodes this season. It took full advantage of the new widescreen format to cram in a ton of background detail and blink-and-you’ll-miss-’em jokes. The finale dragged a bit, and they could have spent more time with the surreality of Homer’s almost-the-same alternate past, but those are minor quibbles." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, Rotten reprised {{the role}} of [...] "Max Candy" [...] in the porn remake of Cape Fear and cited Robert De Niro's {{performance}} in the 1991 version as her inspiration for the role.

2500|$|Katie Atkinson of Billboard {{claimed that}} the video [...] "delivers exactly what the song promises," [...] also noting that [...] "Nicki Minaj's 'Anaconda' feels downright subtle next to this bootyfest." [...] Lucas Villa of AXS drew a similar comparison, writing, [...] " [...] {{certainly}} give Nicki Minaj's 'Anaconda' video a run for its money with their literal cheek-to-cheek moments." [...] Idolator's Robbie Daw praised the video and compared it to Kylie Minogue's [...] "Sexercize", released earlier in the year. Jessica Hyndman of MTV News cited the [...] "plenty of booty" [...] in the video, the [...] "hot oil", [...] "the stiletto heels," [...] the [...] "sexy silhouettes", the [...] "girl on girl grinding" [...] and [...] "J.LO's signature moves" [...] as the [...] "5-star recipe for a perfect music video." [...] Bruna Nessif of E! Online wrote that [...] "the video was a big sequence of bouncing bundonkadonk shots, which was great but also a little annoying because it's hard to focus," [...] but ultimately claimed that [...] "Iggy and J.Lo prove that they're the ultimate #TwerkTeam." [...] Katie Hasty of HitFix was disappointed {{with the lack of}} dancing in the video, claiming that [...] "Lopez– world-class dancer– doesn't really dance here. It's sexy, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> about booties on the dance floor and now I want my money back," [...] also calling the video [...] "generic". Eric Renner Brown of Entertainment Weekly described the video as [...] "elegant and seductive", noting that it's also [...] "seductively highbrow". It was named the sexiest video of 2014 by VH1 {{and one of the most}} unforgettable of the year by Cosmopolitan.|$|E

Along with his playing experience, Hill slowly nurtured a raucous on-stage presence, partly inspired by Howlin' Wolf, Jerry Lee Lewis and Nappy Brown. Hill commented [...] "I've been obsessed with Jerry Lee since I was a kid, and when I saw Nappy Brown crawlin' around, taking his clothes off, well <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> for me!" ...|$|R

He states he [...] "very briefly" [...] joined the Bosnian Army Foreign Volunteer Force: [...] "In Bosnia, I did fight for a while.
