In this position paper we explore the unknown dimensions {{that can be used to}} describe control from full-user to full-system control. We believe a hybrid between the two will be most desirable. Combined with explicit user interaction, autonomous system behavior will create intelligent systems, able to adapt to users and contexts. This provides interesting opportunities for improved user experience as well as functional added value, for instance in energy saving or easy commissioning of light infrastructure. Based on different types of interactions, different levels of interaction-initiative and different interaction layers, a useful mapping of such hybrid control can be made. In our lighting living labs, we have implemented different controls in order to evaluate them on the basis of user experience...|$|E

40|$|Several leading {{lighting}} {{companies for}} example NXP and Philips {{work in a}} project to explore the next generation intelligent <b>lighting</b> <b>system.</b> One innovation of the project is using a distributed architecture to replace current centralized system to increase robustness and extensibility. As a core component of wireless <b>lighting</b> control <b>system,</b> there are many wireless communication protocols can be applied in distributed system. We choose BLE protocol which is a new wireless communication protocol as the communication protocol of distributed system to do research because BLE has a huge potential in low power consumption. However, there exist some problems in BLE based <b>distributed</b> <b>lighting</b> control <b>system.</b> One of these problems is a commissioning problem. The commissioning problem {{we come up with}} is that a constrained device (no screen) router, cannot display a scanning list of BLE based lamps. This prevents specific BLE based lamps which user want to remotely control, from securely joining in the existing access point (router). The main purpose of this thesis is to solve the commissioning problem in a BLE based intelligent <b>lighting</b> control <b>system</b> to make BLE become an appropriate candidate in this field. An innovative solution, developed on standardized BLE protocol, which is used for overcoming the commissioning problem through utilizing modified BLE protocol in a smartphone. The modified BLE protocol is a application protocol. With the modified BLE protocol stack, a third device which is a Commissioning Tool(smartphone) can securely instruct specific BLE based lamps to router. As part of this thesis, a demo was set up and the solution to the commissioning problem has been tested on this system. Results proved that the solution was valid to solve the commissioning problem of BLE based intelligent <b>lighting</b> control <b>system.</b> Electrical EngineeringTelecommunicationsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

40|$|Ambient systems provide {{information}} in the periphery of a user’s attention. Their aim is to present information as unobtrusively as possible to avoid interrupting primary tasks (e. g. writing or reading). In recent years, light {{has been used to}} create ambient systems to display information.
