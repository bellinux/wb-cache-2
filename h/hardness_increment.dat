The results show that: 1.

30|$|The {{hardness}} increments {{of lower}} carbon content materials is smaller, {{as shown in}} Fig.  8 a, and hardness has a direct influence on wear resistance. There are fewer surface cracks on specimens A, B, and C compared with specimen D in Fig.  5, which means that specimen D exhibits more of the fatigue damage mechanism than do the other specimens. A smaller <b>hardness</b> <b>increment</b> makes less of a contribution toward improving the wear resistance, so the weight loss of lower carbon content materials {{is much greater than}} in the others. This indicates that for these specimens the wear mechanism is the dominant damage form, and the SEM observations of worn surfaces in Fig.  5 corroborate this.|$|E

30|$|The {{fatigue and}} wear {{characteristics}} of four different steel wheel materials are investigated in detail by using rolling contact fatigue and wear bench tests on a JD- 1 apparatus, analyzing chemical composition and hardness, and performing profile analysis and micro-morphology analysis. The wear and fatigue behavior {{of one of}} the materials under different operation speeds is also investigated. The results show that the wear resistance of the materials has a positive correlation with their carbon content, while fatigue resistance has a negative correlation. Based on hardness analysis as a function of depth into the specimen, the thickness of layers with a steep hardness gradient has a negative correlation with the initial surface hardness in the tests using different materials. The <b>hardness</b> <b>increments,</b> however, have a positive correlation with initial surface hardness. The rolling tests on one material using different rotation speeds show that the <b>hardness</b> <b>increments</b> and the thickness of layers with a steep hardness gradient increase with the rotation speed.

30|$|For comparison, rolling {{tests with}} {{different}} rotation speeds using the # 3 material show both the <b>hardness</b> <b>increments</b> and {{the thickness of}} layers displaying a steep hardness gradient of the three specimens to increase with rotation speed (Fig.  8 b).

It is obvious that the dominant wear damage mechanism in the specimen with high surface hardness and with high experimental rotation speed is ratcheting rather than an adhesive wear mechanism. It is known that ratcheting can lead to fatigue cracks at the near-surface layer, so generating fatigue failure will therefore be easier in the cases involving high surface hardness and high experimental rotation speed.|$|R

In order to investigate the influence of value and type of load upon the reduction of the operation life of the mechanical transmissions of mining machinery, an experimental fixture was built, and laboratory experimental work was done to study the destruction of non-standard elements. The strain parameters of the samples were determined, as well as local metal hardness changes in the areas adjoining the destruction spots. Crucial strain corresponds to the increased hardness with the limit value for the material given in the destruction area. In accordance with the experimental data, it was determined that the observed local hardness changes take place in areas where the stress is increased over the proportionality limit, and the work of the destruction forces assigned to the density of dislocations immediately adjoining the destruction plane is expressed as <b>hardness</b> <b>increment,</b> the latter being a constant value...|$|E
40|$|A {{shot peening}} process is {{generally}} utilized {{as one of}} the surface treatment processes to improve the fatigue life and the fatigue strength of cyclically loaded components. This improvement is achieved by inducing compressive residual stresses and work hardening effects in areas close to the surface. But the influence of the shot peening process on fatigue strength is not clarified enough. It's significant technologically and industrially to clarify the influence factor of shot peening on the fatigue strength. Former study of author confirmed that main effect on the fatigue strength of the SUS 304 steel hitted by controlled steel ball is the hardening of austenite structure itself due to the shot peening. In this study, the SUS 329 J 1 steel having both austenite and ferrite phases was also investigated from the viewpoint of the work hardening of both structures. An effect of the residual stress on fatigue limit is not observed at all. As a result, we found that the work hardening of the SUS 329 J 1 steel by shot peening was attributed to both the strain-induced martensitic transformation and the hardening of austenite and ferrite phase themselves. Especially, the ferrite phase influences the Vickers hardness distribution of shot-peened material, and the <b>hardness</b> <b>increment</b> of the austenite phase is larger than other phase and mainly due to the fine structure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} for estimating the local yield stress in work-hardened surface layers. It {{is based on}} the concept of in-depth normalized variation of hardness and x-ray diffraction peak width, both of which measure the strain-hardening attained by the materials' surface-treated layers due to, for example, shot-peening. Its principle is directly founded on the classical hardness theory. To study the evolution of those values with plastic deformation, specimens of five steels with different mechanical properties were subjected to interrupted tensile tests. The tests were performed at successive increments of plastic strain, until fracture occurred. The specimens were loaded and unloaded in increments of about 2 % true strain. After each plastic strain <b>increment,</b> <b>hardness</b> and diffraction peak width were measured. It was observed that the variations of diffraction peak width and hardness are related to the material's strain-hardening, and their normalized variations can be considered proportional to the normalized variation of the material's yield stress. Thus, where the yield stress of the bulk material, its hardness or a characteristic diffraction peak width value, and their relative variations along the hardened layers, are known, an empirical expression could be used to estimate the local yield stress {{as a function of the}} treated depth.

40|$|The solid {{solubility}} of Hf in Al {{has been extended}} to 2 wt%Hf (0. 3 at%Hf) by chill casting into a wedge shaped copper mould. This is also the limit of solubility of Hf in sub- 45 mum size high pressure gas atomised powders. Primary precipitation of the metastable Li 2 -Al 3 Hf phase {{in the form of}} cuboid or petal like particles occurred upon exceeding the solubility limit. It is suggested that in the Al-Hf system the solubility limit is controlled by absolute stability rather than solute trapping. The cooling rate required to suppress the nucleation of the metastable and equilibrium Li 2 -Al 3 Hf phases increased with alloy composition. The metastable phase grew from a Hf rich centre along the directions and was responsible for grain size refinement from 480 mum to about 4 mum. Hafnium increased the lattice parameter of alpha-Al at a rate of 0. 003 A/wt%Hf and the micro-hardness of the solid solution by 167. 75 MPa/wt%Hf (17. 1 kgmm- 2 /wt%Hf). Clustering of Hf in clusters < 10 A diameter is envisaged as a possible mechanism for the strength of the solid solutions. Two modes of decomposition of Al-Hf solid solutions have been identified; continuous precipitation of fine spherical Li 2 -Al 3 Hf precipitates and discontinuous precipitation of rod/filament like precipitates of the same phase. Precipitate spacings in the range 0. 16 mum- 0. 3 mum are required to account for the peak <b>hardness</b> <b>increments</b> of 225. 6 - 382. 6 MPa (23 - 39 kgmm- 2) for Al-(0. 32 - 1. 04) wt%Hf alloys aged at 400 °C for up to 1000 h and are in reasonable agreement with the observed spacings of 0. 03 mum- 0. 5 mum. Powders of the Al- 1. 6 wt%Hf alloy were prepared by gas atomisation and the sub- 45 mum powder size fraction was consolidated by extrusion. The as extruded grain size was fine (~ 1 mum) and the Hf was retained in solid solution. Continuous and discontinuous precipitation of spherical (1 nm to 30 nm) and filamentary (aspect ratio ~ 25, diameter < 0. 1 mum) type particles respectively of the Li 2 -Al 3 Hf phase occurred after 10 h ageing at 300 °C and 400 °C. Precipitation of this phase was accompanied by an increase in the tensile strength, yield strength and hardness. The equilibrium Al 3 Hf phase did not precipitate after 1000 h ageing at both temperatures. The contributions of grain size, solid solution strengthening and of the mechanisms for precipitate shearing and precipitate looping by moving dislocations have been calculated and related to the alloy microstructure. The fine grain size contributed about 60 % and 50 % towards the strength of the alloy in the as extruded and aged conditions respectively. After 100 h at both ageing temperatures precipitate looping was the dominant mechanism and the solid solution contribution to strength was diminished. Discontinuous precipitation contributed about 20 % towards the strength of the alloy. The experimental relationship ass= 0. 15 Hv relates the micro-hardness of solid solutions of Al-Hf alloys to the solid solution strengthening contribution to the yield strength of the alloys. Powders of the Al- 2. 25 wt%Li alloy reached peak strength after 10 h at 190 °C. This is attributed to the precipitation of the delta (Al 3 Li) phase. The PM Al- 0. 91 Li- 0. 63 Hf, M- 1. 96 Ll-l. 0 Hf, Al- 2. 2 Ll-l. 23 Hf and Al- 2. 64 Li- 1. 6 Hf (concentration in wt%) alloys have been studied. Precipitation in the Al- 2. 2 Li- 1. 23 Hf and Al- 2. 64 Li-l, 6 Hf alloys was controlled by a two step heat treatment. During solution treatment at 450 °C the alpha-(Hf) -Al 3 (Li, Hf) phase formed by continuous and discontinuous precipitation. During subsequent ageing at 190 °C the delta phase formed in the alpha-Al matrix and at the alpha'/matrix interface and grew giving complete shells around both the spherical and filamentary alpha'(Hf) precipitates. Properties have been measured in the solution treated condition and after ageing. Considerations of the various strengthening mechanisms suggest that solid solution and Orowan strengthening are the two major contributors towards the strength of the alloys. Grain size strengthening accounts for only 20 % of the strength of the peak aged alloys while solid solution strengthening is diminished in the peak aged condition. The high level of solid solution strengthening prior to heat treatments is attributed to precursor phase/s to delta'...|$|R

Three batches of cylindrical disc specimens were prepared from an alloyed steel, 60 Sicr 7 and were austenitized at 820 C for 30 min. Three different batches of samples were quenched in a salt bath maintained at 250, 300 & 350 C respectively for 1 h. Then the dry rolling/sliding wear tests were performed with each batch of samples for three different test cycles namely 6000, 18000 and 30000 cycles respectively to study the wear performance of these specific steels in the context of rail applications along with the in-depth microstructural characterization. The wear resistance was related to the total mass loss measured after the tests and the worn surfaces were analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. Micro-hardness profiles were also obtained to analyze strain- hardening effects beneath the contact surfaces.

The thermal analysis was performed using differential scanning calorimetry. The microstructures, internal microstrains and hardness following heating at a constant rate were characterised at room temperature using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT). The microhardness of the HPT processed sample initially increases following heating to 140 °C, and then remains unchanged on further heating to 210 °C. As the temperature increases up to 210 °C, the crystallite size calculated from XRD line broadening remains about 60 – 70 nm, while the dislocation densities remain in excess of 2 × 10 ^ 14 m^ 2. A multimechanistic model is established to describe the strengthening due to grain refinement, dislocation accumulation, solid solution, precipitation, solute clusters and their segregation. The analysis reveals that solute clusters and lattice defects are key factors in HPT-induced strengthening of alloys, and illustrates the interactions between alloying elements, dislocations and grain boundaries enhance strength and stabilize ultrafine microstructures. Furthermore, for an HPT sample heated beyond 210 °C, the formation of nano-precipitates also contributes to <b>hardness</b> <b>increment.</b> The multimechanistic model for hardness contribution indicates the short-range order strengthening due to cluster-defect complexes is the dominant mechanism, which accounts for more than 40 % of overall hardness...|$|E

Co-Pd multilayers {{obtained}} by Pd capping of pre-deposited Co nanoparticles on amorphous alumina are systematically studied by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, extended x-ray absorption fine structure, SQUID-based magnetometry, and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism. The films are formed by COPD alloyed nanoparticles self-organized across the layers, with the interspace between the nanoparticles filled by the non-alloyed Pd metal. The nanoparticles show atomic arrangements compatible with short-range chemical order of L 10 strucure type. The collective magnetic behavior is that of ferromagnetically coupled particles with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, irrespective of the amount of deposited Pd. For increasing temperature three magnetic phases are identified: hard ferromagnetic with strong coercive field, soft-ferromagnetic as in an amorphous asperomagnet, and superparamagnetic. Increasing the amount of Pd in the system leads to both magnetic <b>hardness</b> <b>increment</b> and higher transition temperatures. Magnetic total moments of 1. 77 (4) μB and 0. 45 (4) μB are found at Co and Pd sites, respectively, where the orbital moment of Co, 0. 40 (2) μB, is high, while that of Pd is negligible. The effective magnetic anisotropy is the largest in the capping metal series (Pd, Pt, W, Cu, Ag, Au), which is attributed to the interparticle interaction between de nanoparticles, in addition to the intraparticle anisotropy arising from hybridization between the 3 d- 4 d bands associated to the Co and Pd chemical arrangement in a L 10 structure type.

During {{the early stages of}} artificial aging at 200 C, the microhardness values continuously increase {{as a result of the}} development of a fine-scale compositional modulation (wavelength: 3 nm) caused by spinodal decomposition. Coarsening of the modulated structure occurs after prolonged aging of WQ-U 6 Nb at 200 C for 16 hours, which leads to a decrease of microhardness. Phase instability has also been found to occur in the NA alloy, in which the formation of partially ordered phase domains resulting from an atomic-scale spinodal modulation (wavelength: 0. 5 nm) renders the appearance of antiphase domain boundaries (APBs) in TEM images. Although 18 -year natural aging does not cause a significant change in hardness, it affects dramatically the aging mechanism of WQ-U 6 Nb subjected to the accelerative aging at 200 C. The result of microhardness measurement shows that the hardness values continuously increase until after aging for 239 hours, and the total <b>hardness</b> <b>increment</b> is twice in magnitude than that in the case of the artificial aging of water-quenched alloy at 200 C. The anomalous increment of hardness for the accelerative aging of NA alloy can be attributed to the precipitation of an ordered U{sub 3 }Nb phase.

The results indicate that the harder material exhibited overall lower wear rates for all test cycles studied i. e., the one austempered at 250 °C showed superior rolling/sliding wear resistance than the rest. It is also {{interesting to note that the}} <b>hardness</b> <b>increment</b> and thickness of the hardened layer increases with increasing the austempering temperature and number of test cycles. Furthermore the results appear to indicate that the initial roughness of the samples has no major effect on the outcome of the results. The higher wear performance of the sample austempered at 250 °C has been attributed to its superior mechanical properties provided by its finer microstructure. It has been evidenced that all samples suffer the TRIP phenomenon since, after wear, no retained austenite could be detected by XRD.
