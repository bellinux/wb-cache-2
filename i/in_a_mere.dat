5|$|In 1921, Mitchell first {{demonstrated}} {{to the world}} that battleships and other gun dependent vessels could be sunk by aircraft loaded with heavy bombs. In one of his most famous demonstrations, Mitchell convinced the Navy to allow bomb loaded aircraft to attack the German dreadnought , a battleship taken as a prize of war by the United States in 1918. Although the Navy had placed strict rules on the bombing exercise, Mitchell and his men violated the rules and attacked the battleship head on, which caused the vessel to sink <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> 22 minutes. Although downplayed at the time this would have a dramatic effect on U.S. policy, leading to increased research and development for aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{near the}} constellation's {{northern}} border with Telescopium is Alpha Pavonis, {{the brightest star}} in Pavo. Its proper name — Peacock — is an English translation of the constellation's name. It was assigned by the British Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office in the late 1930s; the Royal Air Force insisted that all bright stars must have names, the star hitherto having lacked a proper name. Alpha has an apparent (or visual) magnitude of 1.91 and spectral type B2IV. It is a spectroscopic binary system, one estimate placing the distance between the pair of stars as 0.21 astronomical units (AU), or half the distance between Mercury and the Sun. The two stars rotate around each other <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> 11 days and 18 hours. The star system is located around 180 light years away from Earth.|$|E

5|$|The P-series was {{gradually}} replaced {{on the eve}} of war with the new the H-2, powered by improved Jumo 211 A-3 engines of 820kW (1,100hp). A count on 2 September 1939 revealed that the Luftwaffe had a total of 787 He 111s in service, with 705 combat ready, including 400 H-1 and H-2s that had been produced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> four months. Production of the H-3, powered by the 895kW (1,200hp) Jumo 211 D-1, began in October 1939. Experiences during the Polish Campaign led to an increase in defensive armament. MG 17s were fitted whenever possible and the number of machine guns was increased to seven. The two waist positions received an additional MG 15 or 17, and on some variants a belt-fed MG 17 was even installed in the tail.|$|E
5|$|After {{stalling}} offshore {{for almost}} a day, a mid- to upper-tropospheric trough over the central U.S. slowly pulled Tropical Storm Gordon northward then north-northeastward towards Florida's west coast. The storm made landfall between Ft. Myers and Naples with 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. The eastward component of the storm's movement increased, and Gordon moved northeastward onto the Florida Peninsula at 10 mph (17 km/h). The storm barely weakened as it crossed the landmass keeping its 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. Crossing the peninsula <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> six hours, the storm continued to pick up speed. Early on November 17, back over the open ocean, the storm's central pressure began to fall. Improved organization was not apparent and wind shear was pulling {{at the core of}} the deep convection when, on November 17, Gordon suddenly spawned 75 mph (120 km/h) winds and was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.|$|E

25|$|Captain Peake of Peacock turned {{downwind}} {{to bring}} his opposite battery to bear, but Lawrence had carried out the same maneuver more rapidly. The starboard bow of Hornet came up against the stern of Peacock from where the British could bring no guns to bear, and from this position, Hornets gunners shattered Peacock <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> four minutes. Peake was killed, and his First lieutenant surrendered and almost immediately made a distress signal. The British lost 5 men killed and 33 wounded (three mortally); the Americans lost only one man killed and four wounded (one mortally), most to Peacocks first broadside.|$|E
25|$|Clarendon Club, but was {{not taken}} up by the newly formed Yorkshire county club until 1865 under {{recommendation}} of George Parr. Freeman emerged after a few matches in 1865 and 1866 to jump straight {{to the top of the}} tree in 1867. He had tremendous “cut” from leg as well as pace, which was said by those who played against him to reflect a classic round-arm delivery and powerful twist extending as far up as his elbow. On the rough, even stony pitches that prevailed before the advent of the heavy roller George Freeman was a terror to even the best batsmen, with frequent shooters often being impossible for any batsman to stop. Between 1867 and 1871 Freeman took 269 wickets <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> thirty-seven first-class matches for a phenomenal average of 8.94 runs per wicket. In these five seasons he conceded only 26.8 runs for every 100 balls he bowled and took one wicket every 33 balls he bowled.|$|E

25|$|The new, large, fast GTS Finnjet was {{delivered}} to Finnlines in May 1977, replacing both of the old ferries on the route. With her 31-knot top speed the Finnjet was able to cross the Baltic <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> 22 hours, and her accommodations were superior to those of any ferry of the day. Unfortunately she had also been designed before the oil crisis, meaning her operational costs were much higher than originally planned. After delivery of the Finnjet, the Finlandia was rebuilt into the cruise ship MS Finnstar, becoming Finnlines' first (and to date last) genuine cruise ship. The Finnstars service was cut short by the Finnish maritime worker's strike of 1980, as result of which she ceased service and was laid up in Barcelona. In May 1981 she was sold to the Loke Shipping Co. In October of the same year, the Finnjet was rebuilt with additional diesel engines, allowing for more economic operations during the off-season.|$|E
25|$|The infamous 'Gate of Death' at Auschwitz II for the {{incoming}} freight trains was built of brick and cement mortar in 1943, and the three-track rail spur was added. Until mid-August, 45,000 Thessaloniki Jews were murdered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> six months, including over 30,000 Jews from Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz) and Bendzin Ghettos. The spring of 1944 {{marked the beginning}} of the last phase of the Final Solution at Birkenau. The new big ramps and sidings were constructed, and two freight elevators were installed inside Crematoria II and III for moving the bodies faster. The size of the Sonderkommando was nearly quadrupled in preparation for the Special Operation Hungary (Sonderaktion Ungarn). In May 1944 Auschwitz-Birkenau became the site of one of the two largest mass murder operations in modern history following the Großaktion Warschau deportations of the Warsaw Ghetto inmates to Treblinka in 1942. It is estimated that until July 1944 approximately 320,000 Hungarian Jews were gassed at Birkenau in less than eight weeks. The entire operation was photographed by the SS.|$|E
25|$|As part of Spanish {{preparations}} for an intended siege of Brest, a well-situated fort {{was to be}} built on the Peninsula completely commanding the Roadstead of Brest. Águila's chief engineer, Captain Cristóbal de Rojas, designed a modern fortification, christened El Leon - companies took turns in construction, foraging and defence. Spanish admiral Pedro de Zubiaur arrived with twelve ships landing equipment, which accelerated {{the construction of the}} fort, and two shaped bastions with a glacis were formed in front of the drawbridge guarding where the peninsula joined the mainland. The fort had a significant number of guns, one bastion containing eighteen culverins and another smaller bastion had six; many of the these guns were brought by the fleet of Zubiaur. Don Tomé de Paredes was appointed commander of the garrison of the fort, with his company, that of Diego de Aller and Pedro Ortiz Dogaleño totalling 401 men, with a mission to complete the construction of the fort. All this was created <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> twenty six days of construction.|$|E

Recent French Open semifinalist Gaël Monfils was forced to withdraw before his first match due to a shoulder injury contracted during his Nottingham Open semifinal against Ivo Karlović. Karlović was himself upset later in the day by qualifier Simon Stadler, while thirty-second seed Michaël Llodra retired against Mario Ančić due to a left arm injury.

Kuznetsova and Janković's losses, together with the defeats of Ivanovic and Sharapova earlier in the tournament, meant that none of the top four seeds reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam {{for the first time}} in the Open Era. The 133rd-ranked Zheng Jie also continued her run in the tournament, defeating fifteenth seed Ágnes Szávay 6–3, 6–4, and progressing to become the first women's wild card entry to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals. Defending champion Venus Williams advanced to her ninth quarterfinals at Wimbledon in twelve appearances, past 42nd-ranked Russian Alisa Kleybanova, and her sister Serena Williams dispatched compatriot WTA No. 69 Bethanie Mattek in straight sets 6–3, 6–3. Eighteenth seed Nicole Vaidišová recovered from the loss of the first set to win the second in a tie-break, and eventually overcome her opponent eighth seed Anna Chakvetadze after two hours of play, on the score of 4–6, 7–6(0), 6–3, Russian twenty-first seed and recent Eastbourne runner-up Nadia Petrova easily defeated compatriot and victor of Maria Sharapova, 154th-ranked Alla Kudryavtseva 6–1, 6–4, in little more than an hour, and Elena Dementieva, the highest seed remaining in the draw, crushed Israeli twenty-fourth seed Shahar Pe'er 6–2, 6–1.|$|E
