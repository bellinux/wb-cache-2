In order to estimate <b>corrosion</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength it is indispensable to understand {{the role of an}} each influencing factor. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present briefly surveyed results on metallurgical factors on <b>corrosion</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength of stainless steels such as austenitic, martensitic and duplex stainless steels mainly based upon author’s experimental results. The targeted dominant metallurgical factors focussed upon are chemical compositions, heat treatment, manufacturing process and microstructures.

50|$|In normal fatigue-testing {{of smooth}} specimens, about 90 percent {{is spent in}} crack {{nucleation}} and only the remaining 10 percent in crack propagation. However, in <b>corrosion</b> <b>fatigue</b> crack nucleation is facilitated by corrosion; typically, about 10 percent of life is sufficient for this stage. The rest (90 percent) of life is spent in crack propagation. Thus, it is more useful to evaluate crack-propagation behavior during <b>corrosion</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Fracture mechanics uses pre-cracked specimens, effectively measuring crack-propagation behavior. For this reason, emphasis is given to crack-propagation velocity measurements (using fracture mechanics) to study <b>corrosion</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Since fatigue crack grows in a stable fashion below the critical stress-intensity factor for fracture (fracture toughness), the process is called sub-critical crack growth. The diagram on the right shows typical fatigue-crack-growth behavior. In this log-log plot, the crack-propagation velocity is plotted against the applied stress-intensity range. Generally there is a threshold stress-intensity range, below which crack-propagation velocity is insignificant. Three stages may be visualized in this plot. Near the threshold, crack-propagation velocity increases with increasing stress-intensity range. In the second region, the curve is nearly linear and follows Paris' law(6); in the third region crack-propagation velocity increases rapidly, with the stress-intensity range leading to fracture at the fracture-toughness value.

Corrosion alone, in forms such as uniform corrosion or exfoliation, may reduce the strength of aircraft and lead to failure. Both of these forms of corrosion may lead also to expensive component repair or replacement. There are many cases where corrosion alone is not significant from a safety consideration, but is a very significant economic problem. In the case of corrosion alone, one must judge the seriousness of this problem on an individual basis. Nondestructive inspections have found fatigue problems where there is essentially no influence from corrosion.
