40|$|Glycosylation of {{proteins}} {{is important for}} protein stability, secretion and localization. In this study, we have investigated the glycan synthesis pathways of 12 <b>filamentous</b> <b>fungi</b> including those of medical/agricultural/industrial importance for which genomes have been recently sequenced. We have adopted a systems biology approach to combine the results from comparative genomics techniques with high confidence information on the enzymes and fungal glycan structures, reported in the literature. From this, we have developed a composite representation of the glycan synthesis pathways in <b>filamentous</b> <b>fungi</b> (both N- and O-linked).

In the final stages of N-glycan synthesis in the Golgi, <b>filamentous</b> <b>fungi</b> follow the high mannose pathway as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but the level of glycan mannosylation is reduced. Highly specialized N-glycan structures with galactofuranose residues, phosphodiesters and other insufficiently trimmed structures have also been identified in the <b>filamentous</b> <b>fungi.</b> O-linked glycosylation in <b>filamentous</b> <b>fungi</b> was seen to be highl...|$|R
40|$|<b>Filamentous</b> <b>fungi</b> and yeast {{from the}} genera Saccharomyces, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Fusarium {{are well known}} for their impact on our life as pathogens, {{involved}} in food spoilage by degradation or toxin contamination, and also for their wide use in biotechnology {{for the production of}} beverages, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and enzymes.

500|$|The {{growth of}} fungi as hyphae on or in solid {{substrates}} or as single cells in aquatic environments is adapted for the efficient extraction of nutrients, because these growth forms have high surface area to volume ratios. Hyphae are specifically adapted for growth on solid surfaces, and to invade substrates and tissues. They can exert large penetrative mechanical forces; for example, many plant pathogens, including Magnaporthe grisea, form a structure called an appressorium that evolved to puncture plant tissues.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>filamentous</b> <b>fungi</b> {{in drinking water}} {{has been known for}} many years. However, the quantity of scientific literature on the subject is only recently beginning to increase. <b>Filamentous</b> <b>fungi</b> have been considered as annoying contaminants of agar plates used to count bacteria from water. There are various potential issues associated with the fungi-in-drinking-water phenomenon, including blockage of water pipes, organoleptic problems such as odours and taste, biofilm formation, spread of pathogenic fungi, and mycotoxins production. Drinking water raises issues of biosecurity in relation to <b>filamentous</b> <b>fungi</b> and the mycotoxins they may produce. This chapter presents a review of fungi in drinking water, with emphases on (a) methods of isolation, (b) fungi detected, (c) which problems occur, (d) avoidance or removal of <b>filamentous</b> <b>fungi,</b> and (e) methods to detect biochemicals such as mycotoxins.
