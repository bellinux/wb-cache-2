Unlike many six-wheeled vehicles, which have a single front axle and tandem rear axles, 6x6 versions used twin steering front axles- as with the 8x8- and a single rear axle.|$|R
50|$|The {{main gearbox}} was located behind {{the cabin and}} {{connected}} to the engine clutch housing via a short cardan shaft (this design enables a so-called flat floor cabin.) The main gearbox was bolted to an auxiliary gearbox, to a transfer case {{and then to a}} backbone tube and formed main part of a chassis structure. Options for the rear power take off and or a winch drive were available. Main and auxiliary gears were fully synchronized except the first and reverse gear. The new feature was unique 2-speed planetary overdrive system bolted between front and rear axles.The overdrive could only be selected manually whilst stationary. Auxiliary gearbox had a neutral position which allowed a winch and a power take off to use main gearbox gearing for variable speed operation. The final drives used Tatra gear differentials with locks, offset drive shafts and planetary <b>hub</b> <b>reductions.</b>|$|R

50|$|The trailer axle(s) {{are driven}} by an drive shaft exiting {{the rear of the}} {{transmission}} with splines and universal joints to accommodate the movements between them.

The usual twin back axles are combined in a separate frame that is can pivot in relation to the trailer frame, keeping all wheels on the ground, but until recently always unsprung. Likewise the occasional single back axle usually are unsprung, while the front axle have suspension to give the operator a better ride. The reinforced cab is sometimes also sprung, as is done in modern cab-over-engine trucks, as is the drivers seat.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} an analytical {{study of the}} helicopter rotor vibratory load reduction design optimization with aeroelastic stability constraints. The composite rotor blade is modeled by beam type finite elements, and warping deformation is taken into consideration for 2 dimension analysis, while the one-dimension nonlinear differential equations of blade motion are formulated via Hamilton's principle. The rotor hub vibratory loads is chosen as the objective function, while rotor blade section construction parameter, composite material ply structure and blade tip swept angle as the design variables, and autorotation inertia, natural frequency and aeroelastic stability as the constraints.

50|$|Fitted with {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} and drum brakes, the AML lacks hydraulic assist on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, {{the steering wheel}} requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion - while stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic <b>hub</b> <b>reduction</b> gears, also known as bevel boxes. The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, {{eliminating the need for}} a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the gearshift lever, which is located behind the driver's seat in the hull floor. The gearbox assembly consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive. There is a hydraulic dual-circuit handbrake operating on the gearbox output shaft.|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{addresses}} the design of the NMBU Mobile Agricultural Robot's drivetrain and steering assembly, while the second part discusses aspects related to controlling these systems. Part I: First, power requirements are calculated based on the expected worst case scenario. Second, the principle design of the systems is determined and parts are selected. For the drivetrain, a <b>hub</b> <b>reduction</b> system is used. The system comprises of four separate wheel modules, each with one brushless DC motor installed over the module's wheel. Power is transferred to an in-wheel planetary gearbox via a timing belt. For the steering assembly, brushless integrated servomotors with planetary gearboxes are used. The power distribution system is also discussed, and two designs are proposed, one for future and one for immediate implementation. All parts are selected based on availability, quality and cost. As a result, the components for the drivetrain are not perfectly matched. However, they allow for testing of the basic principle. Preliminary tests of the powertrain and steering assembly show promising results. Part II: Different components related to communication and control of the robot are presented, and the principle design of the motor control system is determined with interoperability between current and future systems in mind. ROS (Robotic Operating System) is selected to be used as the robotic framework, and the main computer and the various motor controllers are to communicate using the CANopen protocol. The process of configuring the propulsion motor controllers to match the propulsion motors is described, as is the process of setting up the servomotors. Problems were faced using the propulsion motors built in Hall sensors for feedback in closed loop speed mode, as the sensor assembly’s resolution proved to be too coarse. Alternative feedback sensors are then proposed. Nordic Association of Agricultural ScientistsM-MP...|$|E
40|$|Two main-rotor {{active control}} concepts, one {{incorporating}} multicyclic actuators located {{just below the}} swashplate, and the other providing for the actuators and power supplies to {{be located in the}} rotating frame are considered. Each design concept is integrated with cockpit controllers and displays appropriate to the actuation concept in each case. The benefits of applying the defined ACT/RCT concepts to rotorcraft are quantified by comparison to the baseline model 412 helicopter. These benefits include, in the case of one active control concept; (1) up to 91 % reduction in 4 /rev hub shears; (2) a flight safety failure rate of 1. 96 x 10 to the 8 th power failures per flight-hour; (3) rotating controls/rotor <b>hub</b> drag <b>reduction</b> of 40 %; (4) a 9 % reduction in control system weight; and (5) vibratory deicing.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} coupled rotor/flexible fuselage {{analysis has}} been developed and used to {{study the effects of}} higher harmonic blade pitch control on the vibratory hub loads and fuselage acceleration levels. Previous results, obtained with this model have shown that conventional higher harmonic control (HHC) inputs aimed at <b>hub</b> shear <b>reduction</b> cause an increase in the fuselage accelerations and vice-versa. It was also found that for simultaneous <b>reduction</b> of <b>hub</b> shears and fuselage accelerations, a pitch input representing a combination of two higher harmonic components of different frequencies was needed. Subsequently, it was found that this input could not be implemented through a conventional swashplate. This paper corrects a mistake originally made in the representation of the multiple frequency pitch input and shows that such a pitch input can be only implemented in the rotating reference frame. A rigorous mathematical solution is found, for the pitch input in the rotating reference frame, which produces simultaneous <b>reduction</b> of <b>hub</b> shears and fuselage acceleration. New insight on vibration reduction in coupled rotor/fuselage systems is obtained from the sensitivity of hub shears to the frequency and amplitude of the open loop HHC signal in the rotating reference frame. Finally the role of fuselage flexibility in this class of problems is determined...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} work, the {{application}} and advantages of multiple active trailing-edge flaps for helicopter vibration control in forward flight are investigated. Small active flaps {{of this type}} can be actuated using smart materials. A comprehensive aeroelastic analysis is used to model a helicopter with multiple trailing-edge flaps. The objective function containing the hub vibratory loads and flap control effort is minimized by an optimal controller. The control effort is differentially weighted for different flaps, such that all trailing-edge flaps are exploited to their full authority and limited to ± 2 degrees peak deflection. Numerical results are obtained for one, two and three flaps and their optimal locations identified. A reduction of 76 % in the hub vibration level is achieved at an advance ratio (nondimensional forward speed) of 0. 3 using three flaps. For the four-bladed, soft-inplane, hingeless rotor considered in this work, {{it is observed that}} the extent of <b>hub</b> vibration <b>reduction</b> {{is directly related to the}} effect of trailing-edge flap motion on the contribution of the second flapwise bending mode to blade motion. It is also shown that multiple flaps can effectively modify the participation of second flapwise bending mode at a much lower control power than is needed with single and dual flap configurations. Furthermore, multiple flaps are shown to allow redundancy in operation and are considerably more effective than single flaps in low speed transition flight regimes because of their capability in distributing the airloads...|$|R
40|$|With {{the volume}} of digital media {{available}} today, automatic music recommendation services have proven {{a useful tool for}} consumers, allowing them to better discover new and enjoyable music. Typically, this technology is based on collaborative filtering techniques, employing human-generated metadata to base recommendations. Recently, work in content-based recommendation systems have emerged in which the audio signal itself is analyzed for relevant musical information from which models are built that attempt to mimic human similarity judgments. 	The current state-of-the-art for content-based music recommendation uses a timbre model based on MFCCs calculated on short segments of tracks. These feature vectors are then modeled using GMMs (Gaussian mixture models). GMM modeling of frame-based MFCCs has been shown to perform fairly well on timbre similarity tasks. However, a common problem is that of hubs, in which a relative small number of songs falsely appear similar to many other songs, significantly decreasing the accuracy of similarity recommendations. 	In this thesis, we explore the origins of hubs in timbre-based modeling and propose several remedies. Specifically, we find that a process of model homogenization, in which certain components of a mixture model are systematically removed, improves performance as measured against several ground-truth similarity metrics. Extending the work of Aucouturier, we introduce several new methods of homogenization. 	On a subset of the uspop data set, model homogenization improves artist R-precision by a maximum of 3. 5 % and agreement to user collection co-occurrence data by 7. 4 %. We also find differences in the effectiveness of the various homogenization methods for <b>hub</b> <b>reduction,</b> with the proposed methods providing the best results. 	Further, we extend the modeling of frame-based MFCC features by using a kernel density estimation approach to non-parametric modeling. We find that such an approach significantly reduces the number of hubs (by 2. 6 % of the dataset) while improving agreement to ground-truth by 5 % and slightly improving artist R-precision as compared with the standard parametric model. 	Finally, to test whether these principles hold for all musical data, we introduce an entirely new data set consisting of Indian classical music. We find that our results generalize here as well, suggesting that hubness is a general feature of timbre-based similarity music modeling and that the techniques presented to improve this modeling are effective for diverse types of music.

40|$|The 'hydrid' is {{a fairly}} new serial {{hydraulic}} hybrid drive line concept. The term ‘hydrid’ is used for hydraulic drive lines in which four constant displacement Floating Cup (FC) wheel drive units are pressure controlled by means of two Innas Hydraulic Transformers (IHT). It {{has been shown in}} earlier publications that a four wheel drive hydrid drive line with wheel <b>hub</b> motors realises <b>reductions</b> of fuel consumption and CO 2 emission of more than 50 %. In modern passenger cars, there is a large gap between - on one hand - the engine power and wheel torque necessary to fulfil the maximum performance requirements and - on the other hand - the quite modest power and torque demand in normal, every-day use. This gap is the main reason for the rather bad energy efficiency of modern passenger cars. Contrary to other hybrid concepts, the hydrid can bridge this gap and achieve large reductions without compromising performance. This paper shows how the use of floating cup technology, the pressure amplification capability of the Innas hydraulic transformer (IHT) and a four wheel drive line topology, come together to realise this. After that a serial hydrid front wheel drive line is presented, which can realise similar reductions but uses only one IHT and two FC drive units, which attach to the front axle differential. Finally, some ideas for other serial hydrid drive lines are given...|$|R
40|$|Active {{integral}} twist {{control for}} vibration reduction of helicopter rotors during forward flight is investigated. The twist deformation is obtained using embedded anisotropic piezocomposite actuators. An analytical framework is developed to examine integrally-twisted blades and their aeroelastic response during different flight conditions: {{frequency domain analysis}} for hover, and time domain analysis for forward flight. Both stem from the same three-dimensional electroelastic beam formulation with geometrical-exactness, and are coupled with a finite-state dynamic inflow aerodynamics model. A prototype Active Twist Rotor blade was designed with this framework using Active Fiber Composites as the actuator. The ATR prototype blade was successfully tested under non-rotating conditions. Hover testing was conducted to evaluate structural integrity and dynamic response. In both conditions, a very good correlation was obtained against the analysis. Finally, a four-bladed ATR system is built and tested to demonstrate its concept in forward flight. This experiment was conducted at NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel and represents the first-of-a-kind Mach-scaled fully-active-twist rotor system to undergo forward flight test. In parallel, the impact upon the fixed- and rotating-system loads is estimated by the analysis. While discrepancies {{are found in the}} amplitude of the loads under actuation, the predicted trend of load variation with respect to its control phase correlates well. It was also shown, both experimentally and numerically, that the ATR blade design has the potential for <b>hub</b> vibratory load <b>reduction</b> of up to 90 % using individual blade control actuation. (cont.) Using the numerical framework, system identification is performed to estimate the harmonic transfer functions. The linear time-periodic system can be represented by a linear time-invariant system under the three modes of blade actuation: collective, longitudinal cyclic, and lateral cyclic. A vibration minimizing controller is designed based on this result, which implements classical disturbance rejection algorithm with some modifications. The controller is simulated numerically, and more than 90 % of the 4 P hub vibratory load is eliminated. By accomplishing the experimental and analytical steps described in this thesis, the present concept is found to be a viable candidate for future generation low-vibration helicopters. Also, the analytical framework is shown to be very appropriate for exploring active blade designs, aeroelastic behavior prediction, and as simulation tool for closed-loop controllers. by SangJoon Shin.
