5|$|Bethesda {{released}} a teaser trailer to promote gameplay being shown at E3 2015 on June 14, 2015; the trailer depicted the double-barreled shotgun and the Revenant, a monster {{returning to the}} game. On June 14, around 15 minutes of gameplay footage were shown at E3. Regarding the progression system, Marty Stratton thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> to allow players personalization and customization.|$|E

It is a few kilometres from the modern village of San José, in Guatemala's northern department of Petén. A medium-sized civic-ceremonial centre, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> political and economic centre during the Late Classic period (AD650950).|$|E
5|$|Nittany Furnace, known earlier as Valentine Furnace, was a {{hot blast}} iron furnace located in Spring Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. Placed in {{operation}} in 1888 {{on the site of}} an older furnace, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> feature of Bellefonte economic life until it closed in 1911, no longer able to compete with more modern steel producers.|$|E
5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> step toward creating such a device.|$|E

5|$|For the German side, {{the battle}} left the 18th Army very {{stretched}} and exhausted. Lacking sufficient reinforcements, {{the command of}} Army Group North {{made the decision to}} shorten the front line by evacuating the Demyansk Pocket salient. The salient had been held throughout 1942, despite being encircled for a few months, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> strategic bridgehead. Together with the Rzhev salient (which was also evacuated in spring 1943), it could potentially be used to encircle a large number of Soviet forces. However, in the situation that had developed, retaining it was no longer possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1754, the Stadt Huys was {{the site}} of the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania {{presented}} the Albany Plan of Union there. This was the first formal proposal to unite the British American colonies. The Plan of Union's original intention was to unite the colonies in defense against aggressions of the French to the north; it was not an attempt to become independent from the auspices of the British crown. Although it was never adopted by the British Parliament, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> precursor to the United States Constitution. A month prior to the meeting, Franklin published his Join, or Die political cartoon, an infamous graphical representation of the Plan of Union.|$|E
5|$|In Greece, copper {{was known}} by the name chalkos (χαλκός). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> {{resource}} for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as aes Cyprium, aes being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and Cyprium from Cyprus, where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to cuprum, hence the English copper. Aphrodite (Venus in Rome) represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors; Cyprus was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients {{were associated with the}} seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Somerton {{dates back to}} the Anglo-Saxon era, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> {{political}} and commercial centre. After the Norman conquest of England the importance of the town declined, despite being the county town of Somerset in the late thirteenth century and early fourteenth century. Having lost county town status, Somerton then became a market town in the Middle Ages, whose economy was supported by transport systems using the River Parrett, and later rail transport via the Great Western Railway, and by light industries including glove making and gypsum mining.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} this {{gathering}} agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> step in the gaelicisation of the lands east of Druim Alban. Others have proposed that the ceremony in some way endorsed Constantine's kingship, prefiguring later royal inaugurations at Scone. Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, {{it may be that}} the gathering was intended to heal a rift between king and church.|$|E
5|$|Various of Vermigli's {{writings}} {{were printed}} about 110 times between 1550 and 1650. The 1562 Loci Communes became a standard textbook in Reformed theological education. He was popular especially with English readers of theology {{in the seventeenth}} century. John Milton probably consulted his commentary on Genesis when writing Paradise Lost. The English edition of the Loci Communes {{was brought to the}} Massachusetts Bay Colony where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> textbook at Harvard College. More of Vermigli's works were found in the libraries of seventeenth-century Harvard divinity students than those of Calvin. Vermigli's works were highly regarded by New England Puritan theologians such as John Cotton and Cotton Mather.|$|E

5|$|By {{performing}} a blood compact, it preserves the bond of friendship between two tribes. This ceremony {{was the first}} treaty or bond of friendship between the natives, and the Spaniards. In honor of this ceremony, the former President of the Philippines Elpidio Quirino established the Order of Sikatuna, a presidential decoration conferred upon politicians. Juan Luna, a Filipino painter, depicted this event in his painting entitled The Blood Compact (Spanish: El Pacto de Sangre) in 1883. El Pacto de Sangre obtained the first prize in Paris in 1885 and at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of St. Louis in 1904. At that period, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> part for tribes to perform the sandugo {{as part of the}} peace process. A monument was constructed in Tagbilaran City by the Philippine Historical Committee and the National Historical Institute.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Devonport was the {{headquarters}} of Western Approaches Command until 1941, and Sunderland flying boats were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> embarkation point for US troops for D-Day. The city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe, {{in a series of}} 59 raids known as the Plymouth Blitz. Although the dockyards were the principal targets, much of the city centre and over 3,700 houses were completely destroyed and more than 1,000 civilians lost their lives. This was largely due to Plymouth's status as a major port. Charles Church was hit by incendiary bombs and partially destroyed in 1941 during the Blitz, but has not been demolished. It has been designated as an official permanent monument to the bombing of Plymouth during World War II.|$|E
5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

5|$|In 1754, {{representatives of}} seven British North American colonies {{met in the}} Stadt Huys, Albany's city hall, for the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania {{presented}} the Albany Plan of Union there, {{which was the first}} formal proposal to unite the colonies. Although it was never adopted by Parliament, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> precursor to the United States Constitution. The same year, the French and Indian War, the fourth in a series of wars dating back to 1689, began; it ended in 1763 with French defeat, resolving a situation that had been a constant threat to Albany and held back its growth. In 1775, with the colonies {{in the midst of the}} Revolutionary War, the Stadt Huys became home to the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the political arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of Albany's government and eventually expanded its power to control all of Albany County. Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in the Stadt Huys alongside common criminals. In 1776, Albany native Philip Livingston signed the Declaration of Independence at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{the only}} Soviet factory {{suitable}} for T-26 production was the Bolshevik Factory in Leningrad, which had had experience manufacturing the MS-1 (T-18) light tanks since 1927. It was also {{planned to use}} the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, which was under construction at that time. But {{the production of the}} T-26 proved to be much more complicated than the semi-handicraft assembly of the MS-1, so the planned production of 500 T-26s in 1931 proved to be impossible. The Bolshevik Factory needed to convert all tank drawings from imperial units into metric, in order to develop a production technology, special tools, and equipment. The first 10 T-26s were assembled in July 1931 – they were identical to British Vickers 6-Ton tanks except for their armament. Soviet tanks were armed with the 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) gun in the right turret and the 7.62mm DT tank machine gun in the left turret. These T-26s from the development batch were of low quality and made from mild steel, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> test of the new tank production technology.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{academic}} progress was unremarkable, and in July 1912 {{he became an}} apprentice to the carpenter at the mission. At Easter 1912, he professed his dedication to Christianity and began undergoing catechism. In 1913, he underwent the Kikuyu circumcision ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> aspect of Kikuyu tradition, allowing Kenyatta to be recognised as an adult. Asked to take a Christian name, he chose both John and Peter after the eponymous Apostles in the New Testament. The missionaries however insisted that he select only one, and so he chose Johnstone, the -stone being selected {{because it was a}} Biblical reference to Peter. Accordingly, he was baptised as Johnstone Kamau in August 1914. After his baptism, Kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends. Having completed his apprenticeship to a carpenter, Kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused. Kenyatta then requested that he be recommended for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an allegation of minor dishonesty.|$|E
