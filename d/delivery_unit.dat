Results The evaluation scores for all aspects of infection control were suboptimal; infection control program management 38. 1 % to 71. 4 %, healthcare workers post-exposure measures 58. 5 % to 92. 7 %, medical waste management 73. 9 % to 87. 0 % and infection control related standard infrastructures and equipments 55. 9 % to 82. 8 %. The midwives mean scores for attending infection control training courses and hand hygiene were less than 40 % of the maximum score, but the mean scores for normal vaginal deliveries scrub, and equipments and instruments hygiene practices were generally above 70 %. Conclusions The {{results of this study}} revealed a need for development of appropriate policies and protocols for infection control practices in labor and <b>delivery</b> <b>units</b> and also midwives training on clean delivery practices...|$|R

2500|$|Historically, {{the bulk}} of UPS' {{competition}} came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring RPS (originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations, a program that allows UPS to pick up mail & packages separately from the main Ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination <b>delivery</b> <b>unit</b> (DDU), for final distribution. This process {{is also known as}} zone skipping, long used by Parcel Consolidators. UPS also has a separate product called [...] "SurePost" [...] which uses the UPS Ground network to deliver packages to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for [...] "final mile" [...] delivery.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Clinical {{indicators}} are increasingly {{used to assess}} safety of patient care. In obstetrics, only a few indicators have been validated to date and none is used across specialties. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify and assess for face and content validity a group of safety indicators that could be used by anaesthetists, obstetricians and neonatologists involved in labour and <b>delivery</b> <b>units.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: We first conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify potential measures. Indicators were then validated by a panel of 30 experts representing all specialties working in labour and <b>delivery</b> <b>units.</b> We used the Delphi method, an iterative questionnaire-based consensus seeking technique. Experts determined on a 7 -point Likert scale (1 =most representative/ 7 =less representative) the soundness of each indicator as a measure of safety and their possible association with errors and complications caused by medical management. RESULTS: We identified 44 potential clinical indicators from the literature. Following the Delphi process, 13 indicators were considered as highly representative of safety during obstetrical care (mean score</= 2. 3). Experts ranked 6 of these indicators as being strongly associated to potential errors and complications. CONCLUSIONS: We identified and validated for face and content, a group of six clinical indicators to measure potentially preventable iatrogenic complications in labour and <b>delivery</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective of {{this article}} was to analyze whether the {{reporting}} of the 3 rd and 4 th degree obstetric anal sphincter injuries differ between the patient data recording systems. The study was retrospective. The setting included all six <b>delivery</b> <b>units</b> in the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS) comprising one third of all deliveries in Finland. Population was all deliveries in HUS in 2012 (n= 18099). The incidence of the sphincter injury was extracted from three electronic medical record (EMR) systems (Obstetrix, Opera and Oberon), using the national versions of International Classification of Diseases 10 th revision (ICD 10) and the Nordic Classification of Surgical Procedures (NOMESCO). All observed cases were studied carefully from the patient records and the reliability of different systems was analyzed and compared to the data reported to national registers (MBR Medical Birth Register and HDR Hospital Discharge Register). Main outcome measure was sphincter injury rate in <b>delivery</b> <b>units.</b> We found that the actual rate of sphincter injury in all the EMRs combined in HUS was higher (1. 8 %) than the rate delivered from any single reporting system (from 1. 5 % to 1. 7 %) and varied even more among single <b>delivery</b> <b>units.</b> The coverage in the MBR (88 %) was much higher than in the HDR (3 %). In conclusion the simultaneous use of several patient data recording systems is confusing and prone for systematic errors. One common database – preferably an EMR with a structured format - would clarify the registering and enable reliable quality reports creating a sustainable base for quality improvements...|$|R

25|$|The total uptake and {{delivery}} amount in COF-102 and COF-103 outperform other 2D and 3D-COFs at high pressure, even the benchmark MOF-177. In October 2011, new COFs with better delivery amount {{have been shown}} to be stable and overcome the DOE target in delivery basis. COF-103-Eth-trans and COF-102-Ant, are found to exceed the DOE target of 180 v(STP)/v at 35 bar for methane storage. Thus at 35 bar (in v(STP)/v <b>delivery</b> <b>units)</b> the best performers is COF-103-Eth-trans which stores 5.6 times as much as bulk CH4 at the same pressure (bulk CH4 reaches 34). All the designed COFs have superior performance to previously reported COFs and MOFs, such as COF-102 (137), MOF-177 (112), and MOF-200 (81 v(STP)/v <b>delivery</b> <b>units).</b> The new materials were designed for best performance at 35 bar. They reported that using thin vinyl bridging groups aid performance by minimizing the interaction methane-COF at low pressure. This can be extended to MOFs. This is a new feature that can be used to enhance loading in addition to the common practice of adding extra fused benzene rings.|$|R
