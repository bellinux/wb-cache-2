500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the <b>Democrats</b> <b>do</b> it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, {{or whatever you want to}} call it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Compared to Canadian {{political}} parties in general, and especially governing parties, {{there were very few}} restrictions regarding membership and regarding eligibility to vote in a leadership election in Alberta's PC Party. [...] First, Alberta PC party rules did not forbid members from holding [...] in rival parties. [...] Some other Alberta parties, notably the Liberals and New <b>Democrats</b> <b>do</b> forbid their members from being members of other parties although the Alberta Alliance removed a similar restriction, possibly in response to Ted Morton's PC leadership candidacy. [...] Second and perhaps more significantly, the Progressive Conservatives, as in 1992, allowed anyone who wished to vote in the leadership election to purchase a five-dollar membership right up to the polling daymemberships were even available for purchase at the polling stations. [...] This was very unusual in Canadain fact no other major federal or provincial party is known to allow leadership voters to buy memberships on polling day. [...] Even those parties that do not employ delegated leadership conventions and allow the general membership to vote for the leader usually have a deadline for purchasing memberships of no later than seven days prior to the vote.|$|E
2500|$|The {{night before}} the balloting Stevenson began working {{actively}} for the nomination, calling the leaders of several state delegations to ask for their support. The key call went to Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, {{the leader of the}} Illinois delegation. The delegation had already voted to give Kennedy 59.5 votes to Stevenson's 2, but Stevenson told Daley that he now wanted the Democratic nomination, and asked him if the [...] "delegates' vote might merely indicate they thought he was not a candidate." [...] Daley told Stevenson that he had no support in the delegation. Stevenson then [...] "asked if this meant no support in fact or no support because the delegates thought he was not a candidate. Daley replied that Stevenson had no support." [...] According to Stevenson biographer John Bartlow Martin, the phone conversation with Daley [...] "was the real end of the [...] Stevenson candidacy...if he could not get the support of his home state his candidacy was doomed." [...] However, Stevenson continued to work for the nomination the next day, fulfilling what he felt were obligations to old friends and supporters such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Agnes Meyer. Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota delivered an impassioned nominating speech for Stevenson, urging the convention to not [...] "reject the man who has made us proud to be <b>Democrats.</b> <b>Do</b> not leave this prophet without honor in his own party." [...] However, Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot with 806 delegate votes; Stevenson finished in fourth place with 79.5 votes.|$|E

"I really don't {{object to}} platitudes," [...] he told Ruth later; [...] "but {{what worries me}} into {{nervousness}} is the pompous, smugly complacent, superior certitude {{with which they are}} uttered and the time taken to do it. Why, I could give that man the whole history of the Reformation in the time he took to tell me that the Union-Labor Party had fused with the <b>Democrats.</b> <b>Do</b> you know, he skins his words as a professional poker-player skins the cards that are dealt out to him.

6000|$|By the way, {{since the}} Judge spoke, the Kansas {{election}} has come off. The Judge expressed his confidence {{that all the}} Democrats in Kansas would do their duty-including [...] "free-State Democrats," [...] of course. The returns received here as yet are very incomplete; but so far as they go, they indicate that only about one sixth of the registered voters have really voted; and this, too, when not more, perhaps, than {{one half of the}} rightful voters have been registered, thus showing the thing to have been altogether the most exquisite farce ever enacted. I am watching with considerable interest to ascertain what figure [...] "the free-State Democrats" [...] cut in the concern. Of course they voted,--all <b>Democrats</b> <b>do</b> their duty,--and of course they did not vote for slave-State candidates. We soon shall know how many delegates they elected, how many candidates they had pledged to a free State, and how many votes were cast for them.|$|E
