5|$|Until the 20th century, naval weapons {{had a short}} range, so {{camouflage}} was unimportant for ships, and for the men {{on board}} them. Paint schemes were {{selected on the basis}} of ease of maintenance or aesthetics, typically buff upperworks (with polished brass fittings) and white or black hulls. Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> the mist.|$|E
5|$|As a star's core shrinks, the {{intensity}} of radiation from that surface increases, creating such radiation pressure on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a planetary nebula. If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it shrinks to a relatively tiny object {{about the size of}} Earth, known as a white dwarf. White dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place. The electron-degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma, even though stars are generally referred to as being spheres of plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> black dwarfs over a very long period of time.|$|E

5|$|Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus (formerly Boletus plumbeoviolaceus), {{commonly}} known as the violet-grey bolete, is a fungus of the bolete family. First described in 1936, the mushroom has a disjunct distribution, and is distributed in eastern North America and Korea. The fruit bodies of the fungus are violet when young, but <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> a chocolate brown color when mature. They are solid and relatively large—cap diameter up to , with a white pore surface that later turns pink, and a white mycelium {{at the base of the}} stem. Like most boletes of genus Tylopilus, the mushroom is inedible due to its bitter taste. A number of natural products have been identified from the fruit bodies, including unique chemical derivatives of ergosterol, a fungal sterol.|$|E
5|$|Radical Dreamers {{features}} three protagonists—Serge, Kid, and Magil—who {{seek out}} treasure as venturesome, reputable thieves. The young adult narrator, Serge, is a drifting musician who met Kid by chance {{three years ago}} in a remote town. Serge enjoys adventure with a carefree attitude. Kid, only sixteen years old, is a renowned professional thief with a reputation for boisterous behavior. Possessing a turbulent history, Kid dubiously fancies herself as a kind of Robin Hood. Magil is an enigmatic, handsome masked man skilled in magic who rarely speaks and can <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> shadow at will. Crowned by flowing, blue hair, Magil accompanied Kid well before Serge joined the group. They seek the Frozen Flame, a mythic artifact capable of granting any wish. It is hidden in Viper Manor—the home of a terrible and powerful aristocrat named Lynx, who gained control of the estate after usurping power from and killing the Acacia Dragoons, a familial unit of warriors.|$|E
5|$|The album {{version of}} the song runs for 5:47. It begins with a low note played on an {{electric}} guitar with heavy delay and distortion. The note is sustained for ten seconds as its harmonics gradually feed back. A pulsing rhythm guitar part with muted staccato chords by the Edge then begins underneath. After a further ten seconds it is joined by lower-register guitar drones played by the Edge, and a repetition of four descending piano notes performed by the Edge and Bono. Forty-five seconds into the song, halfway through the introduction, Clayton's bass and percussion by drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> the song with producer Jacknife Lee's synthesizers, which play part of the melody line. The first verse begins at 1:20 and is accompanied by the bass, drums and rhythm guitar playing the chord progression A–E–D. This alters to B–D in the pre-chorus, with a short harmony vocal line leading to the E–D chorus.|$|E

For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% {{of the total}} enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the war. Throughout the South, losses of slaves were high, with many due to escapes. Slaves also escaped throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic, joining the British who had occupied New York.|$|E
25|$|Royal National Park {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of terrain. Roughly, landscapes in the park vary from coastal cliffs broken by beaches and small inlets to an ancient high plateau broken by extensive and deep river valleys. The river valleys drain from south to north where they run into Port Hacking, the extensive but generally shallow harbor inlet which forms the northern border of the park. When looking across the park from east to west (or vice versa) the rugged folds of valley after valley <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> the distance.|$|E

25|$|By early June, the {{original}} ADC site at Padong was being shelled by 85mm field guns; it could reply {{with only a}} single 4.2 inch mortar. At 1445 hours 6 June, the PAVN roared in from the north in a ground assault. The Hmong retreated, leaving behind hand grenade booby traps littering their path through a cornfield. As the Vietnamese tripped the booby traps, Hmong troopers began to <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> the jungle. CIA agent Jack Shirley, a White Star Team, and the PARUs were picked up on 7 June and transferred some 12km southwest to Pha Khao to resume training ADC.|$|E
25|$|The series six opening titles have {{cut-outs}} of each character, as they <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> {{the white}} screen and zoom {{in and out}} and eventually stop moving. The line-up {{from left to right}} is Abi, Michael, Susan, Ben, Janey and Roger. The titles remain the same for series seven and eight; the one difference is that Janey's clothes are changed. In series nine, the line-up changes due to Abi's departure {{at the end of the}} previous series. Her place is taken by Alfie, who has been a regular since series six but never appeared in the titles until the ninth series. Starting in the 2009 Christmas Special, Alfie has been replaced by Kenzo.|$|E
25|$|In {{the night}} of 29 October, 52 Indonesian volunteers sailed across the Straits of Malacca in commandeered fishing vessels, and landed {{on each side of}} the western mouth of the Kesang River. Their {{objective}} was to avoid being sighted initially by Malaysian security forces and slip quietly into the swampland, where they would attempt to blend in with the populace, begin sowing the seeds of rebellion, and launch guerrilla raids against Malaysian infrastructure. However, Malaysian fishermen spotted the raiders in the process of landing, and quickly informed the police. British troops of General Terence McMeekin's 28th Commonwealth Brigade were immediately directed to the scene, where they swept the region and killed or captured all but two of the invaders, who managed to <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> the wilderness. The remainder were swiftly shipped off to internment locations. The British were assisted by Australian troops of the Royal Australian Regiment's 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Bruce McDonald, who had also received similar tip-offs and assisted in the rout of the Indonesian force.|$|E

500|$|Negative {{opinions}} about the album stemmed from its lyrical content. Some critics {{have said that the}} serious nature of the lyrics are hard to digest. Others said Dreyer's lyrics and vocals still overshadow the instrumentation. Alex Andrews of Thrash Hits gave the album a four out of six rating, saying: [...] "The flipside of Dreyer's imposing presence is that it can be all too easy to let the rest of the band <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> the background. It's a shame, because for the most part, there are some interesting things happening".|$|E
500|$|This, Roosevelt writes, {{would be}} an {{extremely}} rare sight in nature. Worse, the female (the peahen) would, he argues, be conspicuous in those conditions. The Thayers have chosen a blue sky {{to argue that the}} peacock is camouflaged; but then they choose a white sky to allow the prongbuck's white rump to <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> that background. This, Roosevelt argues, is so dishonest that an engineer who constructed a report in that way would at once be dismissed, and the directors of a corporation who [...] "tried to float shares on the strength of such a report" [...] would be liable to [...] "prosecution for fraud".|$|E

Playwright Jenelle Riley wrote in 2005 that Azaria was [...] "by far" [...] her favorite actor, praising his [...] "versatility" [...] and [...] "tendency to take small roles that would normally <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> the background and to consistently create characters people care about", noting his roles in Shattered Glass, Mystery, Alaska and especially [...]|$|E
