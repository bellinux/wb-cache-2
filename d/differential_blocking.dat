40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) ~-encoded gene products are {{intimately involved in}} a variety of immune responses associated with both antigen recognition and alloreactivity. The class I molecules are 45, 000 mol wt membrane glycoproteins associated with a 12, 000 mol wt protein,/ 32 -microglobulin. These proteins are composed of three external domains (0 / 1, 0 ~ 2, and 0 / 3), a transmembrane portion, and an intracytoplasmic carboxyl terminus. The first two external domains are extremely polymorphic (1). These polymorphic regions are considered integral in immune response gene control and MHC restriction. A more precise understanding of the structure-function relationships of the MHC class I molecules is critical to understanding immune recognition. Several different approaches have been used to investigate the topographic and functional locations of these polymorphic determinants using cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and alloantibodies. These include: (a) the examination of in vivo (2 - 4) and in vitro (5, 6) derived class I mutants; (b) <b>differential</b> <b>blocking</b> of CTL activity with anti-H- 2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (7); and (c) most recently, gene transfe...|$|E

We {{have been able to}} subdivide these F 1 restricted T cell clones into two groups: one of which recognizes the A alpha k A beta b molecule and the other group which recognizes the A alpha b A beta k molecule. Using clones with defined reactivities, we could assign the reactivities of monoclonals to the A alpha or A beta chains. By immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional analysis of Ia molecules from F 1 spleen cells, we could independently map the reactivities of the mAb as being determined by the A alpha or A beta chain. To date, these two methods of chain localization of the antibody reactivity have agreed. Further, the <b>differential</b> <b>blocking</b> of the A alpha k A beta b restricted T cell clones suggests that there exists more than one restriction site per Ia molecule. Increasing the number of possible functional Ia restriction sites, either through combinatorial association of alpha and beta chains or by using more than one site per molecule, should increase the number of ways Ia molecules can function in antigen presentation...|$|E

A <b>differential</b> <b>blocking</b> effect on certain types of glutamatergic synapses [...] e. g., parallel and climbing fiber synaptic inputs to rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons [...] has been shown by using a synthetic analog of the spider toxin. By investigating the molecular basis of the JSTX action on the recombinant AMPA/KA receptors GluR 1 -GluR 4 and GluR 6 expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we found that submicromolar concentrations of JSTX exert a subunit-specific block. Thus, receptor subunits forming a receptor channel with a linear current-voltage (I-V) relationship (GluR 1 / 2, GluR 2 / 3, and GluR 6) were not affected, while receptor subunits with rectifying I-V relationships (GluR 1, GluR 3, GluR 4, and GluR 1 / 3) were reversibly blocked by JSTX. By using receptor-subunit mutants obtained by site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified a single amino acid position (glutamine in the proposed second transmembrane domain) that is critical for the JSTX block. Since this site has previously been shown to control the I-V relationship of the AMPA/KA receptor channel and to participate in the regulation of the channel's permeability for calcium ions, our findings suggest that JSTX binds close to the central pore region of the channel...|$|E

The receptors display complex desensitization kinetics, occurring on vastly different time scales. This is not only important in biology and pharmacology but might also be of technological significance since populations of receptors under microfluidic control can function analogously to DRAM memory circuits. Using a novel microfluidic method, and computer modeling of the receptor state distributions, we here demonstrate that GABA(A) receptor populations can be controlled to display high or low EC 50 values, depending on input function (i. e., the exact pattern of agonist application). The sensitivity of the receptors can be tuned up to 40 -fold (beta-alanine) by the particular agonist exposure pattern. By combining patch-clamp experiments with computer modeling of receptor state distributions, we can control the assembly of receptors in desensitized states. The technique described {{can be used as}} an analytical tool to study the effect of desensitization on the activity of ion channel effectors. We describe the <b>differential</b> <b>blocking</b> effect of the competitive antagonist bicuculline on the high- and low-EC 50 GABA(A) receptor preparations and conclude that the inhibition is dramatically dependent on how the different desensitized states are populated.

The {{addition}} of clonidine to local anesthetic improves the quality of peripheral nerve blocks. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of clonidine on characteristics of ropivacaine-induced supraclavicular brachial plexus block. Material and Methods: A total of 60 adult patients were randomly recruited to two groups of 30 each: Group I: 30 ml 0. 75 % ropivacaine + 1 ml normal saline. Group II: 30 ml 0. 75 % ropivacaine + 1 mcg/kg clonidine diluted to 1 ml with normal saline. Results: The onset of sensorimotor block was earlier in Group II (4. 36 ± 0. 81 min for sensory block and 9. 83 ± 1. 12 min for motor block) than in Group I (4. 84 ± 0. 65 min for sensory block and 10. 85 ± 0. 79 min for motor block). The duration of both sensory and motor block were significantly prolonged by clonidine (P < 0. 001). The duration of analgesia was also prolonged in patients receiving clonidine (613. 10 ± 51. 797 min vs. 878. 33 ± 89. 955 min). Although incidence of hypotension and bradycardia was higher in Group II when compared to Group I, it was not clinically significant. Conclusions: Ropivacaine 0. 75 % is well-tolerated and provides effective surgical anesthesia as well as relief of postoperative pain. Clonidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine significantly enhances the quality of supraclavicular brachial plexus block by faster onset, prolonged duration of sensory and motor block and improved postoperative analgesia, without associated adverse effects at the dose used...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the studies of}} the GABAA receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel, and the ligand- and temperature-gated ion channel TRPV 1. The desensitization behavior of both of these proteins has been studied for different conditions, using a microfluidic device for superfusion. Also, temperature control {{has been added to}} this system in order to enable studies of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of ion channels, as well as for studies of temperature-gated channels. We examine the effect of desensitization on dose-response curves for the GABAA receptor, and also compares two different GABAA receptor agonists, GABA and β-alanine, which display different affinities but similar efficacies and desensitization behavior. The results show that the dose-response curves depend greatly on the order of application, and computer simulations using a proposed kinetic model show that this is due to different distributions of the slow and fast desensitized states. This leads to a memory effect for the receptor population that can last up to minutes. We also describe the <b>differential</b> <b>blocking</b> effect of the competitive antagonist bicuculline on the different GABAA receptor state distributions and conclude that the inhibition is dramatically dependent on how the different desensitized states are populated. A concept for the post-production modification of commercially available microfluidic devices to incorporate local temperature control is presented and the resulting system characterized. This device was used to demonstrate that temperature affects the dose-response curves for the GABAA receptor in combination with GABA, but not with β-alanine, and this could be due to their different activation energies for binding and dissociation. The device was also used to characterize desensitization of the temperature-gated ion channel TRPV 1 in response to low pH. Our results indicate that temperature affects the rate of both TRPV 1 activation and desensitization, and that tachyphylaxis is both pH and temperature dependent. Also, if TRPV 1 is exposed several times to low pH, the desensitization becomes slower, whereas the activation rate is constant...|$|E

The signal provided by these T cell clones was antigen nonspecific, indicating that the TcR alpha beta/CD 3 or TcR gamma delta/CD 3 complexes {{were not involved in}} these T-B cell interactions. Activated TcR alpha beta+, CD 8 +, and TcR gamma delta+, CD 4 -CD 8 -, or resting CD 4 + T cell clones were ineffective. Intact TcR alpha beta+ or TcR gamma delta+, CD 4 + T cell clones could be replaced by plasma membrane-enriched fractions isolated from these activated CD 4 + T cell clones. In contrast, membranes isolated from resting TcR alpha beta+, CD 4 +, TcR gamma delta+, CD 4 + T cell clones or an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -transformed B cell line (EBV-LCL) failed to provide the costimulatory signal that, in addition to IL- 4, is required for induction of IgE synthesis. As described for intact CD 4 + T cells, CD 4 + T cell membranes induced purified surface IgM+ B cells to switch to IgG 4 - and IgE- but not to IgA-producing cells, excluding the possibility of a preferential outgrowth of IgG 4 - and IgE-committed B cells. The membrane activity was inhibited by protease or heat treatment. Induction of IgE synthesis by B cells co-cultured with both TcR alpha beta+, CD 4 + and TcR gamma delta+, CD 4 + T cell clones and membrane preparations of these cells was blocked by anti-class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) monoclonal antibodies (mAb), whereas various anti-CD 4 mAb had <b>differential</b> <b>blocking</b> effects. Murine L cells, or EBV-LCL transfected with CD 4 could not replace CD 4 + T cell clones.

Twelve patients had normal respiratory systems and eight had chronic bronchopulmonary disease. No patient developed any significant degree of respiratory acidosis and it is concluded that alveolar ventilation is unimpaired by epidural blockade as performed here. These results provide further evidence that epidural block can produce effective analgesia and muscular relaxation without impair-ing respiratory function. It is commonly held that a <b>differential</b> <b>block</b> affecting the sensory pathways while sparing the motor fibres can be achieved by epidural injection of local anaesthetic agents. In the opinion of Bonica (1958) the production of a <b>differential</b> <b>block</b> appears to depend upon the concentration of local anaesthetic drug and high concentrations of local anaesthetics may cause complete motor block. The drug most commonly used in Great Britain for epidural block is 1. 5 per cent ligno-caine, but there is no agreement in the literature concerning the concentration of lignocaine which results in a differential epidural block; the vary-ing opinions expressed do not always appear to have been based on objective measurements (Moir, 1963). Some aspects of ventilatory function during epidural analgesia have been previously studied. Bromage (1955) found that when epidural anal-gesia with 0. 8 per cent lignocaine and conven-tional analgesics such as pethidine and amidone were administered for the relief of postoperative pain the increase in vital capacity was assumed to be proportional to the degree of pain relief and was greatest after epidural block.

Because the receiver employs knowledges of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fading rate, we study mismatched cases when these parameters are not accurate. It is shown that the receiver is more sensitive to the mismatched parameters when the fading rate is high. Then, a union bound on the bit error probability is derived. The bounds show good agreement with the simulation results at high fading rate and at high SNR. Finally, a modified receiver, denoted as multistage receiver, is proposed to compensate the so-called intrablock interference caused by the time-varying characteristic of the channel within a transmission block.

A simple and general {{encoding}} procedure is presented, which differentially encodes the signal transmission matrix {{as a whole}} at the transmitter end. A novel power estimator is derived at the receiver {{to allow for the}} non-constant amplitude of the received signals. Simulation results show that our scheme has performance equal to the best full rate quasi-orthogonal schemes previously described, along with a simpler decoder...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The paper {{deals with}} {{transmitter}} diversity Antenna Selection Techniques (ASTs) for wireless channels utilizing <b>Differential</b> Space-Time <b>Block</b> Codes (DSTBCs). The proposed ASTs tend {{to maximize the}} Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of those channels. Particularly, we propose here the so-called general (M, N; K) AST/DSTBC scheme for such channels. Then, based on this AST, we propose two modified ASTs which are more amenable to practical implementation, namely the restricted (M, N; K) AST/DSTBC scheme and the (N + ¯ N, N; K) AST/DSTBC scheme. The restricted (M, N; K) AST/DSTBC scheme provides relatively good bit error performance using only one feedback bit for transmission diversity purpose, while the (N + ¯ N, N; K) AST/DSTBC scheme shortens {{the time required to}} process feedback information. These techniques remarkably improve Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of wireless channels using DSTBCs with a limited number (typically 1 or 2) of training symbols per each coherent duration of the channel. Simulations show that the proposed AST/DSTBC schemes outperform the DSTBCs without antenna selection even with only 1 training symbol.
