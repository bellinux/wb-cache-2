60|$|Nevertheless, {{there was}} one old gentleman, with whom I really made friends.

No matter who it was he might be talking to, he used to snap his <b>fingers</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in the most exciting fashion whenever we saw each other in the distance, and we often shared a quiet little talk together (I standing on a highish chair, perhaps, and he squatting beside me, his hands on his knees) in some corner of Mrs Monnerie's enormous drawing-room, well out of the mob.|$|R

I had it pretty tough, since I was the only Asian child at school. The kids used to call me names and point their <b>fingers</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> but after some time I'd managed to cope with them, and they stopped noticing my race. I used to be a very ambitious child, so at the time I'd been studying a lot. I'd been attending additional classes of English and arts. At age 11, I took part in my first charity action, and since then, my story of charity activity has been running. In the meantime, I had moved to the capital city, Warsaw, together with my parents. That is also when my journey with dancing had begun." ...|$|R

It's a queer thing, {{but there have been}} hundreds of times since when he needed scoldin' bad, and I've looked at the mountain and held my tongue. It was just as if I saw her with that half-whimsical, half-reproachful expression in her eyes, holding up her <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> And there were other mornings when she'd say, 'The mountain's lonesome today, he wants me.' And I vow, I'd look at the mountain and it would seem lonesome. That sounds like nonsense, don't it?" [...] Euphrasia demanded, with a sudden sharpness.|$|E
6000|$|Dawn brightened. The {{voice of}} a thrush pealed out of the orchard beyond the stone wall--wild and sweet as in Spring. I {{crouched}} on the ground, elbows on knees, and now kept steady watch upon those night-hung upper windows. At last a curtain was drawn aside. An invisible face within must have looked down upon us in the lane. The casement was unlatched and thrust open, and a grey, tousled head pushed out as if in alarm into the keen morning. At sight of it a violent hiccoughing seized me, so that when an old woman appeared at her door and hobbled out to the cart, I could not make myself understood. Her sleep-bleared, faded eyes surveyed me with horror and suspicion--as if in my smallness there I looked scarcely human. She shook her crooked <b>fingers</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> to scare me off; then stooping, put her head into the cart. I cried out, and ran---- ...|$|R

One of the robbed robbers came to me after dark, with facts, figures, and assertions. I knew I was ruined if I went to law. The judges were corrupt like everything else. But I did do one thing. In the dead of night I went to Ericson's house. I had the same revolver I've got now, and I made him stay in bed while I overhauled things. Nineteen hundred and odd francs was what I carried away with me. He never complained to the police, and he never came back on board. As {{for the rest of the}} gang, they laughed and snapped their <b>fingers</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> There were two Americans in the place, and they warned me to leave the law alone unless I wanted to leave the Miele behind as well.|$|R

But my mother, covetous always, sent to him in my name, told the true story of my case, and humbly prayed and petitioned for a small last gift--for not so many pounds as I have fingers on this hand. Who was it, do you think, who snapped his <b>fingers</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in my misery, lying, as he believed, at his feet, and left me without even this poor sign of remembrance; well satisfied that I should be sent abroad, beyond the reach of farther trouble to him, and should die, and rot there?

60|$|From {{the very}} outset {{suspicion}} pointed its <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{although there were}} no visible traces to connect me with the deed. Rumour, however, was astir, and as I had powerful friends, so, too, I had the powerful enemies which envy must always be breeding for men in high places such as mine. Escovedo's wife mistrusted me, though at first she seems equally to have suspected in this deed {{the hand of the}} Duke of Alva, who was hostile to Don John and all his creatures. Very soon, as a result of this, came the Court alcalde to visit and question me. His stated object was in the hope that I might give him information which would lead to the discovery of the assassin; but his real object, rendered apparent by the searching, insistent nature of his questions, was to lead me to incriminate myself. I presented a bold front. I pretended to see in this, perhaps, the work of the Flemish States. I deplored--that I might remind him of it--my absence from Madrid at the time.|$|E

[...] "We come next, to mere details of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used the term 'expectations' more than once, you are not endowed with expectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will please consider me your guardian. Oh!"

6000|$|He {{pointed a}} <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> He had struck {{to the heart}} of my shame. I made the only {{possible}} reply by a rush at him. [...] "Hello!" [...] he cried, at my blackavised attack. He dropped back into an attitude that had some style in it, parried my blow, got back at my cheek, and laughed with surprise and relief at his own success. Whereupon I became a thing of murderous rage. He could box as well or better than I--he had yet to realise I knew anything of that at all--but I had fought once or twice to a finish with bare fists. I was used to inflicting and enduring savage hurting, and I doubt if he had ever fought. I hadn't fought ten seconds before I felt this softness in him, realised all that quality of modern upper-class England that never goes to the quick, that hedges about rules and those petty points of honour that are the ultimate comminution of honour, that claims credit for things demonstrably half done. He seemed to think that first hit of his and one or two others were going to matter, that I ought to give in when presently my lip bled and dripped blood upon my clothes. So before we had been at it a minute he had ceased to be aggressive except in momentary spurts, and I was knocking him about almost as I wanted to do; and demanding breathlessly and fiercely, after our school manner, whether he had had enough, not knowing that by his high code and his soft training it was equally impossible for him to either buck-up and beat me, or give in.|$|E
60|$|The man {{gave me a}} keen look, muttered {{something}} between his teeth, and walked aft, whither he was proceeding when we met. I looked in {{the direction in which}} he went, and could see he was speaking in a surly way to Captain Rowley. The old gentleman cast a look forward, shook a <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> then smiled in his benevolent way, and turned, as I thought, to look for one of the midshipmen who acted as his aids. At that moment, the Frenchman went in stays, delivering his whole broadside, from aft forward, as the guns bore. The shot told on the British spars smartly, though only two hulled her. As a matter of course, this turned the thoughts of Captain Rowley to the main business in hand, and I was forgotten. As for Neb, he immediately made himself useful. A shot cut the main-spring-stay, just above his head; and before I had time to speak, the fellow seized a stopper, and caught one of the ends of the stay, applied the stopper, and was hard at work in bringing the rope into its proper place, and in preparing it again to bear a strain. The boatswain applauded his activity, sending two or three forecastle-men to help him. From that moment, Neb was as busy as a bee aloft, now appearing through openings in the smoke, on this yard-arm, now on that, his face on a broad grin, whenever business of more importance than common was to be done. The Briton might have had older and more experienced seamen at work in her rigging, that day, but not one that was more active, more ready when told what to do, or more athletic. The gaité de coeur with which this black exerted himself in the midst of that scene of strife, clamour and bloodshed, has always presented itself to my mind as truly wonderful.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{the time}} of the {{appearance}} of the famous tragedy drew near, and my friends canvassed the town to get a body of supporters for the opening night. I am ill at asking favours from the great; but when my Lord Wrotham came to London, I went, with Theo in my hand, to wait on his lordship, who received us kindly, out of regard for his old friend, her father--though he good-naturedly shook a <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> (at which my little wife hung down her head), for having stole a march on the good General. However, he would do his best for her father's daughter; hoped for a success; said he had heard great things of the piece; and engaged a number of places for himself and his friends. But this patron secured, I had no other. [...] "Mon cher, at my age," [...] says the Baroness, [...] "I should bore myself to death at a tragedy: but I will do my best; and I will certainly send my people to the boxes. Yes! Case in his best black looks like a nobleman; and Brett in one of my gowns has a faux air de moi which is quite distinguished. Put down my name for two in the front boxes. Good-bye, my dear. Bonne chance!" [...] The Dowager Countess presented compliments (on the back of the nine of clubs), had a card-party that night, and was quite sorry she and Fanny could not go to my tragedy. As for my uncle and Lady Warrington, they were out of the question. After the affair of the sedan-chair I might as well have asked Queen Elizabeth to go to Drury Lane. These were all my friends--that host of aristocratic connexions about whom poor Sampson had bragged; and on the strength of whom, the manager, as he said, had given Mr. Hagan his engagement! [...] "Where was my Lord Bute? Had I not promised his lordship should come?" [...] he asks, snappishly, taking snuff (how different from the brisk, and engaging, and obsequious little manager of six months ago!)--"I promised Lord Bute should come?" ...|$|E

'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are.

But the young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but said, 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost, it has been but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anemic. I have asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two questions, that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say. And yet there is cause. There is always cause for everything. I must go back home and think. You must send me the telegram every day, and if there be cause I shall come again. The disease, for not to be well is a disease, interest me, and the sweet, young dear, she interest me too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, horrible! A vision {{seemed to}} float {{suddenly}} before my eyes. The darkness faded away, {{to be replaced}} by a little whitewashed chamber in a distant land. I saw an old man dying, with his eyes fixed upon me full of mute reproach, his trembling <b>fingers</b> pointed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with scorn, and his lips framing a feeble curse. Suddenly his look changed, his arm fell, his face grew suddenly bright and joyful, and the curse changed into a fervent blessing. Then the room widened, and the little figure under that spotless coverlet faded away. It was a chamber in a palace, and I saw Lady St. Maurice, also on her death-bed. Her husband and her son knelt by her side with bared heads, and the air was laden and heavy with the sound of their sobs. She alone did not weep, and her pale, spiritualized face glowed like the face of a martyred saint. And as I watched I seemed to hear one word constantly escaping from those who watched by her side, and caught up and echoed a thousand times by the sad wailing wind until it rang in my ears unceasingly--and the word was [...] "Murderess!" ...|$|R
