The purpose of the project was twofold: (l) to assess the staff nurses' perceptions of their role in patient teaching to identify characteristics of the target group which could be useful in planning the manual contents and inservice program; and (2) to develop, implement, and evaluate a teaching manual and documentation record to promote <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program. The investigator conducted {{a review of the literature}} to assess the present status of hospital-based patient education programs. Significant areas of the literature review included: (1) the evolution of hospital-based patient education programs, (2) the role of the professional nurse in patient education, (3) barriers to patient teaching among <b>hospital</b> <b>staff</b> <b>nurses,</b> and (4) delivery systems in patient education. A survey questionnaire was employed to assess the staff nurses' (1) beliefs about their role in patient teaching, (2) feelings of competency in teaching specific health content, and (3) knowledge of standardized teaching plans. The investigator designed a teaching manual and documentation record which were implemented in conjunction with the initiation of a cardiac rehabilitation program. Evaluation processes included a questionnaire to elicit the staff nurses' perceptions of the usefulness of the teaching manual and documentation record. Further evaluation was accomplished through two retrospective medical record reviews to determine the percent of compliance with the documentation criteria developed in conjunction with this project. Results of the staff nurses' evaluations of the teaching manual and documentation indicated that a majority of the respondents had used the manual at least once. Teaching plans and medication sheets were identified as the part of the manual used most frequently Results of the medical record review conducted six months following implementation of the documentation record reflected improvement in both the quality and quantity of the nurses' entries in the patient's chart. Conclusions drawn from this project were: (1) a teaching manual with standardized subject matter, instructional objectives, evaluative criteria, teaching resource materials and patient handouts improved the staff nurses' ability to delivery patient education; (2) a standardized documentation record substantially increased the amount of teaching entries in the medical record by the target group...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hospital</b> <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> {{typically}} use a {{shift work}} model of scheduling {{to care for}} patients around-the-clock. Traditionally, nurses worked five 8 hour shifts per week, however, now most <b>hospital</b> <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> work three 12 hour shifts per week to achieve better work-life balance. The impact of working extended shifts on nurse or patient outcomes was not fully evaluated prior to widespread implementation of this shift pattern. While many nurses report being satisfied with working longer but fewer shifts, {{there is evidence to}} suggest patient safety may be suffering. The {{purpose of this study is}} to expand our understanding of the relationship between nurses 2 ̆ 7 shift length and nurse and patient outcomes. A cross sectional, secondary analysis was completed on nurse survey data, hospital administrative data, and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey data, collected in 2006 – 2007. A sample of 577 hospitals and 22, 275 registered nurses was analyzed. Outcomes of interest for the nurses were burnout, job dissatisfaction and intent to leave their employer in one year. Nurse reported patient outcomes (e. g. falls, infections) and patients 2 ̆ 7 assessments of hospital care were also examined. Regression models were built, adjusting for individual nurses 2 ̆ 7 demographics, nursing organizational features and hospital characteristics. A significant relationship was noted between shift length and nurse outcomes; nurses who reported working ≥ 12 hours or overtime on their last shift were associated with increased odds of burnout, job dissatisfaction and intent to leave. Nurses from hospitals with a high proportion of nurses working ≥ 12 hours or overtime were also associated with increased odds of intent to leave. Further, nurses from hospitals with a high proportion of shifts ≥ 12 hours or overtime were associated with a greater likelihood of reporting frequent central line infections. Finally, an increase in the proportion of nurses working ≥ 12 hour shifts was associated with an increase in patients who would not recommend the hospital to friends and family. These results suggest that shifts of ≥ 12 hours in length and overtime may impact patient care as well as nurses 2 ̆ 7 well-being, which is relevant to policy makers, administrators, nurses and patients. ...|$|R

This study continues the story of nursing and midwifery after registration and on into Ireland in the post-independence era. Further recognition was given to registered nurses in the way in which census enumerators counted nursing labour in Ireland. This period was also characterised by growing state preoccupation with nursing labour Â¿ particularly in the post-war period. Galway was recognised by the Department of Local Government and Public Health (later the Department of Health) as one of the main centres of nursing labour outside Dublin. This study looks at the different way nurses and midwives could be employed in Galway between 1922 and 1970 and the fortunes of <b>nursing</b> nuns, <b>hospital</b> <b>staff</b> <b>nurses,</b> student nurses, specialist nurses (tuberculosis, maternity and fever nurses) are examined.

A sample of 52 nurse managers and 52 <b>staff</b> <b>nurses,</b> all registered nurses employed in the three acute-care hospitals of a medium-sized midwestern city, were matched for site, age, and nursing experience. Nurses completed the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Work and Family Orientation Questionnaire (WOFO), the Problem Solving Inventory (PSI), and a demographic questionnaire. ^ Chi-square analyses using Selection Ratio Indices of MBTI preference scores indicated that the registered nurse sample preferred Sensing (over Intuition) significantly more frequently than did a composite sample of other women with college degrees. The <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> also preferred Feeling (over Thinking) significantly more frequently than did the composite of women with college degrees. The nurse managers reported a preference for Thinking (over Feeling) significantly more frequently than did the <b>staff</b> <b>nurses.</b> ^ A {{multivariate analysis of variance}} (MANOVA) using MBTI continuous scores showed the nurse managers to prefer Thinking (over Feeling) significantly more strongly than did the <b>staff</b> <b>nurses.</b> Another MANOVA, using WOFO factor scores, showed the nurse managers, as compared to the <b>staff</b> <b>nurses,</b> to report significantly higher levels of motivation for Mastery. On a t test for independent means the nurse managers, as compared to the <b>staff</b> <b>nurses,</b> reported significantly greater strength of problem-solving self-efficacy.

Using a social deviance/labeling theory framework, patient deviance was defined as patient behaviors and attitudes inconsistent with expected patient role behaviors as judged by <b>hospital</b> <b>staff</b> <b>nurses.</b> Empirical indicators for avoidance and distancing were a reduction in the number and duration of nursing contacts with patients, a reduction in the number of nurse-initiated patient contacts, and failure to meet the individualized needs of patients. ^ Fifty-two registered nurses on medical-surgical units used a card sort procedure to classify patients on their units into three study groups: ideal patient, neutral patient, and difficult (deviant) patient. The Psychosocial: Individual, Physical, and General subscales of the Slater Nursing Competencies Rating Scale (Wandelt 2 ̆ 6 Stewart, 1975) were used to measure nurses 2 ̆ 7 performance in meeting individualized psychosocial and physical patient needs during their provision of clinical care.

PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred forty-six <b>hospital</b> <b>staff</b> (<b>nursing</b> 76 %, physiotherapy 14 %, occupational therapy, 6 %) working on participating wards over a 24 -hour period.
