5000|$|The transitron oscillator, {{invented by}} Cledo Brunetti in 1939, (although {{a similar effect}} was {{observed}} in tetrodes by Balthasar van der Pol in 1926, and Edward Herold described a similar oscillator in 1935) is a negative resistance oscillator circuit using a pentode vacuum tube, in which, instead of the plate, the screen grid has negative resistance due to being coupled to the suppressor grid. [...] See the circuit at right. In the transitron, the screen <b>grid</b> is <b>biased</b> at a positive voltage (battery B1) above the plate voltage while the suppressor <b>grid</b> is <b>biased</b> negatively (<b>battery</b> B2), at or below the cathode voltage. Therefore, all the electrons will be reflected by the negative suppressor grid and none will get through to the plate. The reflected electrons will instead be attracted to the screen grid, so the screen current will be high while the plate current will be zero. However, if the suppressor grid voltage is increased, as it approaches zero (the cathode voltage) electrons will begin to pass through it and reach the plate, so the number diverted to the screen grid, and thus the screen current, will decrease. Since the other grids don't take significant current the cathode current [...] is split between the plate [...] and the screen grid : The division of current between the screen grid and plate {{is controlled by the}} suppressor voltage. This inverse relationship is indicated by saying the transconductance between the screen and suppressor grid (the change in screen current ΔIG2 divided by the change in suppressor voltage ΔVG3) is negative.|$|R

The PP4, PP5, PP6, PP10 and PP11 (this last battery was actually a 4.5+4.5 volt battery) sizes have long been obsolete. There was no PP2 size, and the PP1 and PP8 were 6 volt (the latter, still available, being designed for electric fence use).

40|$|Electronegative ion {{thrusters}} are {{a variation}} of traditional gridded ion thruster technology differentiated by the production and acceleration of {{both positive and negative}} ions. Benefits of electronegative ion thrusters include the elimination of lifetime-limiting cathodes from the thruster architecture and the ability to generate appreciable thrust from both charge species. While much {{progress has been made in}} the development of electronegative ion thruster technology, direct thrust measurements are required to unambiguously demonstrate the efficacy of the concept and support continued development. In the present work, direct thrust measurements of the thrust produced by the MINT (Marshall's Ion-ioN Thruster) are performed using an inverted-pendulum thrust stand in the High-Power Electric Propulsion Laboratory's Vacuum Test Facility- 1 at the Georgia Institute of Technology with operating pressures ranging from 4. 8 x 10 (exp - 5) and 5. 7 x 10 (exp - 5) torr. Thrust is recorded while operating with a propellant volumetric mixture ratio of 5 : 1 argon to nitrogen with total volumetric flow rates of 6, 12, and 24 sccm (0. 17, 0. 34, and 0. 68 mg/s). Plasma is generated using a helical antenna at 13. 56 MHz and radio frequency (RF) power levels of 150 and 350 W. The acceleration grid assembly is operated using both sinusoidal and square waveform biases of +/- 350 V at frequencies of 4, 10, 25, 125, and 225 kHz. Thrust is recorded for two separate thruster configurations: with and without the magnetic filter. No thrust is discernable during thruster operation without the magnetic filter for any volumetric flow rate, RF forward Power level, or acceleration <b>grid</b> <b>biasing</b> scheme. For the full thruster configuration, with the magnetic filter installed, a brief burst of thrust of approximately 3. 75 mN +/- 3 mN of error is observed at the start of grid operation for a volumetric flow rate of 24 sccm at 350 W RF power using a sinusoidal waveform <b>grid</b> <b>bias</b> at 125 kHz and +/- 350 V. Similar bursts in thrust are observed using a square waveform <b>grid</b> <b>bias</b> at 10 kHz and +/- 350 V for volumetric flow rates of 6, 10, and 12 sccm at 150, 350, and 350 W respectively. The only operating condition that exhibits repeated thrust spikes throughout thruster operation is the 24 sccm condition with a 5 : 1 mixture ratio at 150 W RF power using the 10 kHz square waveform acceleration <b>grid</b> <b>bias.</b> Thrust spikes for this condition measure 3 mN with an error of +/- 2. 5 mN.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, space charge was useful in some tube {{applications}} because it generates a negative EMF within the tube's envelope, {{which could be}} used to create a negative bias on the tube's <b>grid.</b> <b>Grid</b> <b>bias</b> could also be achieved by using an applied grid voltage in addition to the control voltage.

The resultant radio receiver required a 90 volt HT plus a 4 volt LT (A and B) battery (the HT battery provided not only 82.5 volts for the HT but also two <b>grid</b> <b>bias</b> supplies at -1.5 volts and -7.5 volts).|$|R
