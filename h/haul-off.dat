50|$|Heavy ropes were {{attached}} to the carriage, {{and a team of}} 30 or more men would haul her into the waves at launch times. She was then rowed out through the surf, but if this was not possible then the lifeboat was pulled out to sea using a <b>haul-off</b> warp (a windlass), by use of a thick rope anchored some 200 metres off shore and fixed at the beach end to a post by the lifeboat house. There was a large manually operated winch situated {{at the back of the}} boathouse to assist in recovering the boat after launch.|$|E
50|$|One notable rescue {{was carried}} out on 15 August 1961. the Lucy was herself a {{converted}} ship's lifeboat and {{she was on her}} maiden voyage from Peterborough to Southwold. There was a north west wind blowing, bitterly cold and sea conditions were described as short steep sea.The Lucy sprung a leak at the stern and started to take on water rapidly. Her four crew became concerned and started to send up distress signals. The signals were spotted and The Manchester Unity of Oddfellows made what {{was going to be a}} difficult launched. Because of the conditions of the tide, <b>haul-off</b> rope had to be used to prevent the lifeboat from being washed broadsides onto the beach. Just as the boat left the carriage the mast holding the <b>haul-off</b> rope snapped and it was only by skilful handling by coxwain Henry 'Downtide' West that tragedy was averted. The lifeboat found the Lucy 5 mi north east of Sheringham. Three lifeboatmen were put aboard the Lucy to help transfer the boat owner's unconscious wife and young son to The Manchester Unity of Oddfellows. The owner was transferred next, while the fourth member of the crew remained on board with the lifeboatmen while a tow was attempted. In the fierce swell the tow rope snapped and the coxwain decided to evacuate the four men remaining on board. The casualties were landed at Sheringham and all made a full recovery.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1942, the Post Office {{cable ship}} Iris laid lengths of both Siemens' and Henleys' cable in the Clyde. Both {{pipelines}} were completely successful, and PLUTO was formally {{brought into the}} plans for the invasion of Europe. The project was deemed [...] "strategically important, tactically adventurous, and, from the industrial point of view, strenuous". The Clyde trials showed that it was necessary to maintain an internal pressure of about [...] in the pipeline at all times, even during manufacture. Existing cable ships were not large enough, nor were their loading and laying gear sufficiently powerful and robust. Consequently, a number of merchant ships were converted to pipe laying by stripping the interiors, and building in large cylindrical steel tanks, fitting special hauling gear and suitable sheaves and guides. The Petroleum Warfare Department turned to Johnson and Phillips company for special gear to handle and lay the pipe. As the pipe could not be bent to a radius less than five feet, a new <b>haul-off</b> drum of ten foot diameter and fleeting ring, together with roller type bow and stern gear, were produced. The final equipment was fitted to [...]|$|E

40|$|The in-line {{development}} of crystalline morphology and orientation during melt extrusion of {{low density polyethylene}} (LDPE) tape at nil and low <b>haul-off</b> speeds has been investigated using Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS). The processing parameters, namely <b>haul-off</b> speed and distance down the tape-line have been varied and the resulting crystalline morphology is described from {{detailed analysis of the}} SAXS data. Increasing <b>haul-off</b> speed increased orientation in the polymer tape and the resulting morphology could be described in terms of regular lamellar stacking perpendicular to the elongation direction. In contrast, under nil <b>haul-off</b> conditions the tape still showed some orientation down the tape-line, but a shish-kebab structure prevails. The final lamellae thickness (~ 50 Ã…) and bulk crystallinity (~ 20 %), were low for all processing conditions investigated, which is attributed to the significant short-chain branching in the polymer acting as point defects limiting lamellae crystal growth...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the modular {{integrated}} utility systems (MIUS) concept (combining the utility services of electrical power, heating and cooling, water supply and waste water treatment, and solid waste management into a single local plant) {{can be applied to}} community-size developments with major benefits of energy (fossil fuels) savings, reduction in solid waste <b>haul-off</b> quantity, and reduction in fresh water demand. Compared to a conventional utilities system, MIUS energy and water savings are found to reach 38 and 17 %, respectively. Effluent and solid waste load reduction attain 17 and 80 %, respectively. These benefits are obtainable through use of commercially available hardware and at costs competitive with conventional utilities...|$|E
40|$|A Masters Dissertation, {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the award of Master of Science of Loughborough University. Melt capillary flow has been employed to characterise some low density polyethylene grades, differing in degree of an incorporated slip agent (Olemide Commercial). The same grades were processed into blown film under different extrusion conditions by varying screw speed, blow-up ratio and <b>haul-off</b> rate. The rheological properties affected by the slip agent were, namely, the melt viscosity and the critical shear-rate, after which fracture (turbulence) of the given extrudate occurred. Ease of draw-down property was found to be lower for the low slip grades and increased significantly with increasing degree of slip. (ASTM) and (B. S.) methods were used to test the mechanical properties of the films produced from the film-blowing process under the same above extrusion variables. The effect of these variables on tensile, tear and impact strengths of each grade were analysed. Orientation of the molecular structure, during its passage through the die and immediately after extrusion, as a result of longitudinal or transverse direction drawing strongly affected these properties. Increasing the extrusion variables, generally, resulted in a balanced orientation in both machine and transverse directions (balanced film) and an optimum blow-up ratio was found for a film of balanced strength properties. An attempt was made to correlate characteristics of flow of the different polyethylenes with the above extrusion variables and, hence, with the mechanical properties of the consequent films...|$|E
