5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was to believe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> the reversibility of history – {{a form of}} idealism which according to Spengler {{was at that time}} shared by both sides of the political spectrum – Cato had sought to turn back the clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to austerity.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{first became}} {{interested}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> an eruption at Mount St. Helens in March 1980, when {{a series of}} earthquakes rocked the volcano. Having already climbed the mountain, he was intrigued by the situation and was eventually assigned to document {{the activity of the}} volcano for his outdoor skills and his meticulousness. By May, he had begun camping out at the volcano as a joint project to take pictures of the volcanic phenomena for The Columbian, National Geographic, and the United States Geological Survey.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final, {{both teams}} entered the final <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> winning the treble of {{domestic}} league, domestic cup and Champions League titles. Juventus were crowned {{champions of the}} 2014–15 Serie A on 2 May, and won the 2015 Coppa Italia Final eighteen days later. Barcelona were crowned champions of the 2014–15 La Liga on 17 May, and won the 2015 Copa del Rey Final thirteen days later. While {{it would have been}} the first treble for Juventus, Barcelona had previously won the treble in 2008–09.|$|E

60|$|Then {{presently}} Bert got a cyclist's suit, cap, badge, and all; {{and to see}} him and Grubb {{going down}} to Brighton (and back)--heads down, handle-bars down, backbones curved--was a revelation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Smallways blood.|$|R
5|$|The first Home Army {{structure}} designed {{primarily to}} deal with the Soviet threat had been NIE, formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how {{to deal with}} the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 NIE ("NO") was disbanded and transformed into an Armed Forces Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.|$|E
5|$|In June 1869, Meessen and {{his wife}} {{returned}} to Batavia, and the following year they returned to Utrecht. There, in late 1870, Meessen partnered with Abraham Adrianus Vermeulen {{to open a new}} studio, named A.A. Vermeulen & Company. They signed a contract for five years, but this collaboration collapsed in March 1873. Boom and Wachlin suggest that Vermeulen– best known for portraits– had been interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> expanding his range with landscapes, whereas Meessen required a place to print and market his images of the Indies. Indeed, in February 1871 Meessen gifted an album of his better-executed photographs from his time in Java and Sumatra to King William III. This album of 153images was lavishly decorated with silver and gold, and featured the names of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and Nias in the corners. In the center were silver coconut and banana trees surrounding Dutch and Batavian weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} only {{successful}} in raising rigging, some guns and other items. At {{least two other}} salvage teams in 1547 and 1549 received payment for raising more guns from the wreck. Despite {{the failure of the}} first salvage operation, there was still lingering belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> retrieving the Mary Rose at least until 1546, when she was presented as part of the illustrated list of English warships called the Anthony Roll. When all hope of raising the complete ship was finally abandoned is not known. It could have been after Henry VIII's death in January 1547 or even as late as 1549, when the last guns were brought up. The Mary Rose was remembered well into the reign of ElizabethI, and according to one of the queen's admirals, William Monson (1569–1643), the wreck was visible from the surface at low tide in the late 16th century.|$|E

50|$|Pauwels and Bergier {{collaborated on}} two later books <b>of</b> essays, Impossible <b>Possibilities</b> and <b>The</b> Eternal Man.

5|$|Sir Tom Farmer {{took control}} of Hibs in 1991, but the club was still faced {{with the need to}} develop a stadium that would meet the {{requirements}} of the Taylor Report. Hibs entered talks with Edinburgh District Council about sharing a new stadium with Hearts, but the proposed site of Ingliston was in the wrong part of the city for Hibs. The club was more interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> playing at Meadowbank Stadium, only a few hundred yards from Easter Road, but there were planning difficulties with adapting Meadowbank into a large football stadium. The reorganisation of the club after Farmer took control meant that there was no real pressure to move, as he also owned Easter Road. The Hibs board made an assessment, however, that the ground could not be renovated in a cost-effective fashion before the August 1994 deadline set by the Taylor Report. Hibs proposed in January 1992 to sell Easter Road and move to a site owned by Farmer in Straiton. Hibs also invited Hearts to share this stadium, as their proposal for a site in Millerhill had been rejected by planners. Those plans were scaled down in 1993 when Lothian Regional Council refused to allow the rest of the Straiton site to be used for commercial development. The Hibs board continued to back the Straiton proposal and they insisted the installation of bucket seats in the uncovered South Terrace was merely to comply with the Taylor Report deadline. This measure also reduced the capacity of Easter Road to 13,500.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} works where the {{boundary}} between fantasy and other works is not clear; {{the question of whether}} <b>the</b> writers believed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marvels <b>in</b> A Midsummer Night's Dream or Sir Gawain and the Green Knight makes it difficult to distinguish when fantasy, in its modern sense, first began.|$|R
25|$|There then arose the {{question}} of where the opera would eventually be presented. Verdi had turned down an offer from Naples, but became concerned about the availability of his preferred Azucena, Rita Gabussi-De Bassini.

25|$|In 2013, {{according}} to the independent power transmission operator in Greece (ΑΔΜΗΕ) more than 20% of the electricity in Greece has been produced from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric powerplants. This percentage in April reached 42%. Greece currently {{does not have any}} nuclear power plants in operation; however, in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> Greek nuclear power plants begin.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} realities of new reservoirs in western countries, economic limitations {{in the third}} world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas, result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> developing 25% of the remaining potential before 2050, with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area. A few countries are highly developed and have very little room for growth, Switzerland 12% and Mexico 20%.|$|E

They believe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> eternal life, and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die. One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to go through a process of reincarnation, with an individual's identity remaining throughout each of their incarnations.|$|E
25|$|Tun Abdul Razak was {{initially}} interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> a benevolent dictatorship, but was reportedly dissuaded by Ismail, {{who wanted to}} restore power to Parliament as soon as possible.

25|$|In Greco-Roman thought, {{the concept}} of metempsychosis {{disappeared}} {{with the rise of}} Early Christianity, reincarnation being incompatible with the Christian core doctrine of salvation of the faithful after death. It has been suggested that some of the early Church Fathers, especially Origen, still entertained a belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> reincarnation, but evidence is tenuous, and the writings of Origen as they have come down to us speak explicitly against it.|$|E
25|$|Despite having herbivorous diets {{similar to}} {{ruminants}} such as cattle, which release {{large quantities of}} methane through exhaling and eructation (burping), kangaroos release virtually none. The hydrogen byproduct of fermentation is instead converted into acetate, which is then used to provide further energy. Scientists are interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> transferring the bacteria responsible from kangaroos to cattle, since the greenhouse gas effect of methane is 23 times {{greater than that of}} carbon dioxide, per molecule.|$|E

However, the sixth sphere placed in this way will render the structure inconsistent with any regular arrangement. This results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> a random close packing of spheres which is stable against compression.|$|E
