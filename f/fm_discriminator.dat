In addition, the output SNR above threshold is computed. It is shown that the output noise consists of two terms: the first being the expected output gaussian noise having a parabolic power spectral density and the second being a quantization noise produced by the finite-level detection process used in the receiver...|$|E

An area efficient, all-digital building block generates multitone FM stimulus signals without compromising the perfor-mance of the RF transmitter itself. The RF signal is demodulated and digitized in a on-chip digital <b>FM</b> <b>discriminator.</b> Both blocks are fully testable using standard scan chain methods and consume a chip area of only 0. 03 mm 2 in a 130 nm CMOS technology.

40|$|Phase-locked or APC loops {{have found}} {{increasing}} applications {{in recent years}} as tracking filters, synchronizing devices, and narrowband <b>FM</b> <b>discriminators.</b> Considerable work has been performed to determine the noise-squelching properties of the loop when it is operating in or near phase lock and is functioning as a linear coherent detector. However, insufficient consideration has been devoted to the non-linear behavior of the loop when it is out of lock and in the process of pulling in. Experimental evidence has indicated that there is a strong tendency for phase-locked loops to achieve lock under most circumstances. However, the analysis which has appeared in the literature iis limited to the acquisition of a constant frequency reference signal with only one phase-locked loop filter configuration. This work represents an investigation of frequency acquisition properties of phase-locked loops for a variety of reference-signal behavior and loop configuration...|$|R
40|$|The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a {{tracking}} system used on ships {{for several decades}} to improve traffic monitoring and safety at sea in a short range. The modulation technique used is Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK). Recently, the idea of receiving AIS signals from space arose. This presents mainly two challenges. The first one is that received signals present a large Doppler range due to the satellite speed. The second one is the simultaneous reception of signals from ships because of the broad satellite coverage. In this paper, a novel non-coherent GMSK demodulator is proposed to handle the large Doppler shift problem based on several <b>FM</b> <b>discriminators</b> in parallel. A frame collision detection algorithm is presented but the collision problem is not addressed. In addition, computer simulated and real signals are used to study the receiver performance on an AWGN channel...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{vibration}} sensing {{provides a}} sensitive non-contact means of measuring vibrations of objects. These measurements {{are used in}} industrial quality control and wear monitoring {{as well as the}} analysis of the vibrational characteristics of objects. In laser vibrometry, the surface motion is monitored by heterodyne laser Doppler velocimetry, and the received heterodyne signal is sampled to produce a time-series which is processed to obtain a vibrational spectrum of the object under test. Laser vibrometry data has been processed with a traditional <b>FM</b> <b>discriminator</b> approach and by spectrogram and time-frequency distribution processing techniques. The latter techniques have demonstrated improved performance over the <b>FM</b> <b>discriminator</b> method, but do not take full advantage of the prior knowledge one has about the signal of interest. We consider here a statistical signal processing approach to laser vibrometry data. In this approach the quantities of interest are the frequencies of vibration, while the phase and quadrature amplitudes are considered nuisance parameters. Because of the optimal use of prior knowledge about the laser vibrometry signal, the frequencies can be determined with much greater precision and greater noise immunity than using Fourier- or time-frequency-based approaches. Furthermore, the statistical approach is known to have superior performance when the data extends over a small number of vibrational periods. We illustrate the method with data from a beroptic laser Doppler velocimeter. Our results show that while the choice of processing method for determining the instantaneous velocity is relatively unimportant, the Bayesian method exhibits superior performance in determining the vibrational frequency...|$|E

Automation of phase noise measurements has been developed with satisfactory results using two techniques referred to as the two-oscillator technique and the singleoscillator technique. Measurements are performed in the frequency domain using a spectrum analyzer which provides a frequency window following the phase or frequency detector.

In PSK, a carrier recovery technique must be used for signal demodulation. Costas loop is a well known method and is the basis {{in the design of}} the BPSK demodulation. A new design approach employing digital Box Car arm filters is used to improve receiver performance and flexibility. Detail design and performance of the digital Costas loop will be explored in a later section. A classical technique is employed for Phase demodulation with the use of tracking Phase Lock Loop.

40|$|Abstract—A {{frequency}} modulated (FM) analog {{optical link}} using an <b>FM</b> <b>discriminator</b> is analyzed. Figures-of-merit are derived, including expressions for the second-order (OIP 2) and third-order intercept points (OIP 3), {{spurious-free dynamic range}} (SFDR) and noise figure (NF). It is found that a discriminator with linear field transmission and constant group delay will produce no third-order or higher-order distortions, and balanced detec-tion will suppress the remaining second-order distortion. Low biasing the discriminator is found not to improve the NF of the link. Residual intensity modulation (IM) of the laser is shown to significantly increase the link’s distortion. A discriminator using tenth-order finite-impulse response (FIR) filters implemented in planar lightwave circuits (PLC) is proposed and shown to improve OIP 3 by 31 dB over a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) discriminator.

40|$|Laser {{vibration}} sensing {{has traditionally}} relied on limiters and &equencymodulation (FM) discriminators to process frequency-modulated laser radar returns. The performance ofthe traditional FM-discriminator {{approach can be}} limited by laser signature characteristics; both the temporal coherence ofthe laser and t~'get speckle can degrade the performance ofan FM-discriminatorbased laser vibration sensor. We investigate a spectrogram-based frequencydemodulation technique that outperforms the traditional <b>FM</b> <b>discriminator</b> {{in the presence of}} both target speckle and limited laser temporal coherence. We compare the spectrogram and FM-discriminator techniques and present both theoretical and computer-simulation results for a vibrating diffuse or glint target with simple or complex piston motion that gives rise to FM-modulated return signals with speckle fading. Processed laser radar measurement data are used to add credibility to the results. These data include vibration signatures ofthe Low-Power Atmospheric Compensation Experiment (LACE) satellite.

Multi-tone FM test signals with a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 60 dB are generated without compromising {{the performance of the}} RF transmitter itself.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 02 - 04, 1967 / Marriott Motor Hotel, Washington, D. C. The {{calculation}} of the error rate resulting from the detection of PCM/FM is described. Emphasis is placed on characterizing {{the effect of the}} FM demodulator (FMD). The works of Schilling(l), Salz(2), and Klapper(3), are summarized and extended to yield error rate expressions when using an <b>FM</b> <b>discriminator,</b> Phase Locked Loop, or Frequency Demodulator Using Feedback (FCF). The "Integrate-and-Dump" and the Filter Detector are compared. The results indicate that in certain regions the error rate is due primarily to "smooth noise", and the FM demodulator followed by a PCM detector yields an error rate comparable to that obtained with a Matched-Filter (MF) detector. In other regions the error rate is shown to be due primarily to the spikes present at the FM demodulator output. The use of "Spike Detection and Correction" is discussed. It is shown that this technique results in reduced error rate in the "spike regions"...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1970 / International Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe Digital <b>FM</b> <b>Discriminator</b> {{described}} in this paper is used to demodulate FM signals with a high percentage (± 40 %) deviations. When contrasted to the conventional constant pulse width or the phase locked loop discriminators, the digital system has advantages of improved linearity and distortion performance. Additionally, because of the digital nature of the circuit, it requires no adjustment during setup or manufacture. The digital discriminator can be operated at any center frequency {{within the range of}} the integrated circuits used, provided that the proper ratio of the FM carrier center frequency and the clock frequency of the discriminator is maintained. In other words, the center frequency of the discriminator can be altered by altering the clock frequency. The digital discriminator provides an analog output which is a step-by-step reconstruction of the original modulating signal. In addition a digital word for each cycle of the FM carrier is generated corresponding to the amplitude of the modulating signal at that instant. The digital output is available in parallel as well as serial format...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} pi/ 4 -quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) receiver {{that incorporates}} a simple nonredundant error correction (NEC) structure is proposed for satellite and land-mobile digital broadcasting. The bit-error-rate (BER) {{performance of the}} pi/ 4 -QPSK with NEC is analyzed and evaluated in a fast Rician fading and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) environment using computer simulation. It is demonstrated that with simple electronics {{the performance of a}} noncoherently detected pi/ 4 -QPSK signal in both AWGN and fast Rician fading can be improved. When the K-factor (a ratio of average power of multipath signal to direct path power) of the Rician channel decreases, the improvement increases. An improvement of 1. 2 dB could be obtained at a BER of 0. 0001 in the AWGN channel. This performance gain is achieved without requiring any signal redundancy and additional bandwidth. Three types of noncoherent detection schemes of pi/ 4 -QPSK with NEC structure, such as IF band differential detection, baseband differential detection, and <b>FM</b> <b>discriminator,</b> are discussed. It is concluded that the pi/ 4 -QPSK with NEC is an attractive scheme for power-limited satellite land-mobile broadcasting systems...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 08 - 11, 1968 / Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaA {{new method}} is {{presented}} for finding the expected number of spikes in a {{phase locked loop}} of any order, with or without modulation. The procedure can also be employed to determine the threshold of FMFB, FM discriminators and the Maximum Likelihood Estimator. The low pass equivalent gaussian noises x(t), y(t) in the differential equation describing the system (PLL or FMFB) are replaced by the deterministic time functions (Conditional Expectations) 1) E[x(t) /x(0), ẋ(0) ] 2) E[y(t) /y(0), ẏ(0) ] and solved on a digital computer. The mid spike time (t= 0) is taken to be the time when x(0) (quadrature noise) = 0, and a surface or surfaces in ẋ(0), y(0), ẏ(0) space are determined which indicates the region A where spikes in the demodulator are obtained. From this the expected number of spikes per second is calculated. Results are presented for the first, second, and third order phase locked loops, and for an ordinary <b>FM</b> <b>discriminator</b> (which can {{be shown to be}} equivalent to a PLL of infinite gain).

40|$|A bandwidth-efficient constant-envelope Proof-of-Concept (POC) modem is described. The modem was {{developed}} on an Advanced Modulation Techniques Development {{contract for the}} NASA/Lewis Research Center. The POC modem employs 16 -ary Continuous Phase Frequency Shift Keying (16 -CPFSK) modulation. The 16 frequencies are spaced every 1 / 16 th baud rate which produces a compact spectrum allowing 2 bits/sec/Hz operation. The modem is designed for 200 mb/s Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) application with 100 MHz adjacent channel spacing. Overall rate 3. 4 convolutional coding is incorporated. The demodulator differs significantly from typical quadrature phase detector approaches in that phase is coherently measured by processing the baseband output of a frequency discriminator. Baud rate phase samples for the baseband processor are subsequently decoded to yield the original data stream. The method of encoding onto the 16 -ary symbol-ending phase nodes, together with convolutional coding gain, results in near Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) theoretical performance. The modulated signal is of constant envelope; thus the power amplifier can be saturated for peak performance. The spectrum is inherently bandlimited and requires no RF filter for sidelobe containment. Two novel theoretical techniques are used in this 16 -CPFSK modem: (1) coherent phase measurements are obtained by processing an <b>FM</b> <b>discriminator</b> baseband output; and (2) modulation is accomplished via a closed-loop-linearized voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) ...|$|E
