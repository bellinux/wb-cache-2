500|$|Born in Morristown, New Jersey, {{and raised}} in Brookside, Dinklage is a dwarf (achondroplasia) and stands [...] tall. He began acting {{as a child in}} a fifth-grade {{production}} of The Velveteen Rabbit. He studied acting at Bennington College, starring in a number of amateur stage productions.

When asked in an interview what people would {{be surprised to find}} out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would be surprised to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. [...] Boring, huh?"

500|$|Anne's {{stepmother}} {{gave birth}} to a son, James Francis Edward, on 10 June 1688, and a Catholic succession became more likely. Anne was still at Bath, so she did not witness the birth, which fed the belief that the child was spurious. Anne may have left the capital deliberately to avoid being present, or because she was genuinely ill, but {{it is also possible that}} James desired the exclusion of all Protestants, including his daughter, from affairs of state. [...] "I shall never now be satisfied", Anne wrote to her sister Mary, [...] "whether the child be true or false. It may be it is our brother, but God only knows... one cannot help having a thousand fears and melancholy thoughts, but whatever changes may happen you shall ever <b>find</b> <b>me</b> firm to my religion and faithfully yours." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{second game}} {{received}} mixed to positive reviews, with a reviewer from PC Gamer commenting {{that what he}} had hoped for in the sequel [...] "was more mind games and more uncertainty.

I wanted working legs", and that [...] "what I got was a horror game dipping heavily into deception and subtlety". However, {{he also noted that}} [...] "enjoying the good parts, though, comes with a cost of a frustratingly steep difficulty". Destructoid also gave the game a positive review, saying that [...] "It's absolutely terrifying to know that you could be attacked at any moment from multiple avenues" [...] and also praised the introduction of new animatronics and mechanics, but also criticizing the jumpscares and calling the game [...] "too hard for its own good".|$|E

500|$|No {{lingering}} {{about was}} allowed, no gossiping {{with the other}} actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were {{on one side of}} the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases– sheep rigorously separated from the goats! [...] Once, when my mother came to see me in London, expecting to <b>find</b> <b>me</b> dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience.

500|$|By 1566, Nostradamus's gout, {{which had}} plagued him painfully {{for many years}} and made {{movement}} very difficult, turned into edema, or dropsy. In late June he summoned his lawyer to draw up an extensive will bequeathing his property plus 3,444 crowns (around $300,000 US today), minus a few debts, to his wife pending her remarriage, in trust for her sons pending their twenty-fifth birthdays and her daughters pending their marriages. This was followed by a much shorter codicil. On the evening of 1 July, he is alleged to have told his secretary Jean de Chavigny, [...] "You will not <b>find</b> <b>me</b> alive at sunrise." [...] The next morning he was reportedly found dead, lying {{on the floor next to}} his bed and a bench (Presage 141 [...] for November 1567, as posthumously edited by Chavigny to fit what happened).

After staying in Paris for a week, Marie accepted King George V and Queen Mary's invitation and crossed the English Channel, lodging at Buckingham Palace. Hoping to acquire as much goodwill for Romania as possible, Marie became acquainted with many important political figures of the time, including Lord Curzon, Winston Churchill and Waldorf and Nancy Astor.

Marie was elated to have returned to England after so much time, writing that [...] "it was a tremendous emotion to arrive in London, and to be greeted at the station by George and May." ...|$|E
