25|$|Within a {{death toll}} {{often viewed as}} ranging between as low as five and as high as seven million, Hilberg's own {{detailed}} breakdown in The Destruction reveals a total estimated death toll of 5.1 million Jews. Only for the death toll at Belzec does Hilberg provide a precise figure, all the others are rounded. When these rounding factors {{are taken into account}} a range of 4.9 million to 5.4 million deaths emerges. It <b>is</b> <b>instructive</b> to note that the discrepancy in total figures among Holocaust researchers is often overshadowed by that between Soviet and Western scholarship. One striking example {{can be seen in the}} Auschwitz State Museum's significant reduction of the estimated death toll in Auschwitz.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{definition}} of distributions exhibits {{them as a}} subspace {{of a very large}} space, namely the topological dual of D(U) (or S(Rd) for tempered distributions). It is not immediately clear from the definition how exotic a distribution might be. To answer this question, it <b>is</b> <b>instructive</b> to see distributions built up from a smaller space, namely the space of continuous functions. Roughly, any distribution is locally a (multiple) derivative of a continuous function. A precise version of this result, given below, holds for distributions of compact support, tempered distributions, and general distributions. Generally speaking, no proper subset of the space of distributions contains all continuous functions and is closed under differentiation. This says that distributions are not particularly exotic objects; they are only as complicated as necessary.|$|E
25|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has {{determined}} that coal tar creosote is probably carcinogenic to humans, based on adequate animal evidence and limited human evidence. It <b>is</b> <b>instructive</b> {{to note that the}} animal testing relied upon by IARC involved the continuous application of creosote to the shaved skin of rodents. After weeks of creosote application, the animals developed cancerous skin lesions and in one test, lesions of the lung. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has stated that coal tar creosote is a probable human carcinogen based on both human and animal studies. As a result, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a permissible exposure limit of 0.2 milligrams of coal tar creosote per cubic meter of air (0.2mg/m3) in the workplace during an 8-hour day, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that spills or accidental releases into the environment of one pound (0.454kg) or more of creosote be reported to them.|$|E

25|$|After the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, Congress {{passed the}} Flood Control Act of 1928 which {{authorized}} the Corps of Engineers {{to design and}} construct flood control structures, along with levees, on the Mississippi River to protect populated areas from floods. It also affirmed the principle of local participation in federally funded projects but acknowledged that the $292 million already spent by local interests was sufficient to cover local participatory costs. It <b>is</b> <b>instructive</b> to note that, in addition, sovereign immunity {{was given to the}} Corps of Engineers under Section 3 of the Flood Control Act of 1928, which states “no liability of any kind would attach or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place, provided that if on any stretch of the banks of the Mississippi River it was impracticable to construct levees.” 33 U.S.C. § 702c.

500|$|The modern {{reassessment}} of Jones Very {{as an author}} of literary importance can be dated to a 1936 essay by Yvor Winters who wrote of the poet, “In {{the past two decades}} two major American writers have been rediscovered and established securely in their rightful places in literary history. I refer to Emily Dickinson and Herman Melville. I am proposing the establishment of a third.” Winters, in speaking of Very’s relations with Emerson and his circle, concluded, “The attitude of the Transcendentalists toward Very <b>is</b> <b>instructive</b> and amusing, and it proves beyond cavil how remote he was from them. In respect to the doctrine of the submission of the will, he agreed with them in principle; but whereas they recommended the surrender, he practised it, and they regarded him with amazement.” Subsequently, William Irving Bartlett, in 1942, outlined the basic biographical facts of Very’s life in Jones Very, Emerson’s “Brave Saint.” [...] A complete scholarly edition of Very’s poetic works belatedly appeared, over a century after the poet’s death, in 1993.|$|E
