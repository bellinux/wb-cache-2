50|$|In late 1906 Peter Brotherhood {{withdrew from}} the car venture and the former Brotherhood cars bore just the Sheffield-Simplex name. In 1908, the first proper Sheffield-Simplex cars {{appeared}} designed by managing director Percy Richardson, formerly of Daimler and Peter Brotherhood. The 45 hp LA1 had a six-cylinder 6978 cc engine and three-speed gearbox. It was joined in 1908 by the LA2, intended for lighter open bodies which did without a conventional gear system, having one forward gear and an emergency low and reverse gear in a small gearbox attached to the <b>front</b> of the <b>differential</b> <b>housing.</b> The only remaining example of a 45 hp LA2 is in private ownership and is seen frequently on rallies in Britain, Ireland and Belgium.|$|R
5000|$|Both IFS 100 and Live-axle 105 {{models have}} been {{reported}} as suffering from broken <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> centres when driven in harsh conditions. The most common <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> failures in IFS models are reported in vehicles produced between mid-1997 and mid-1999 (i.e. the model years 1998 and 1999), when Toyota fitted the 100 Series IFS with a 2-pinion <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> (the pinion gear would flex away from the ring gear under shock loads). In 1999 (model year 2000) the IFS Landcruiser received a 4-pinion <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> that was more robust - fewer failures were reported.|$|R
50|$|The All-Trac {{system had}} five main parts: the <b>front</b> <b>differential,</b> rear differential, center differential, the transmission, and the {{transfer}} case. The transmission, <b>front</b> <b>differential,</b> center differential and transfer case are all one large assembly and {{are connected to}} the transversely mounted engine. The transmission bell <b>housing,</b> <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> and center differential can be separated from the transfer case sub assembly. The transmission output shaft feeds power into the front/center differential assembly (the center differential is contained within the <b>front</b> <b>differential).</b> The <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> distributes the power to the front wheels, while the center differential distributes power to the transfer case that will send power to the rear differential. In most of the models, when the transfer case is not locked the majority of the power is routed to the front wheels as would be in a Toyota FWD automobile.|$|R

The material they provide is a welcome antidote to the misinformation and disinformation that has been coming out of Washington in recent years and they are essential tools in assembling a counter-narrative that more honestly addresses the crises we face." [...] In his acknowledgements to <b>House</b> of <b>Bush,</b> <b>House</b> of Saud, Unger wrote: [...] "The Center for Cooperative Research is another valuable Internet tool. Because I made a practice of citing original sources, it does not appear in my notes nearly as often as it might. However, its timelines about 911 and related issues often helped me find exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend it to anyone doing research on 9/11 and I encourage its support." ...|$|R
