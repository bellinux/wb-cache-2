6000|$|Charley Dodge, a bright, manly boy of fifteen, laid <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rifle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> in <b>the</b> {{shooting}} gallery and smiled quietly.

60|$|He drew eight one-hundred-dollar {{bills from}} his money belt and planked them <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> Mr. Cooly {{showed signs of}} future promise, for he already had the deed spread out, and was {{reaching}} across the counter for the ink bottle.

60|$|It {{was in the}} shop. Mr Verloc made no comment. He made no retort, and yet the retort was obvious. But he {{refrained from}} {{pointing}} out to his wife {{that the idea of}} making Stevie the companion of his walks was her own, and nobody else’s. At that moment, to an impartial observer, Mr Verloc would have appeared more than human in his magnanimity. He took down a small cardboard box from a shelf, peeped in to see that the contents were all right, and put it <b>down</b> gently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> Not till that was done did he break the silence, to the effect that most likely Stevie would profit greatly by being sent out of town for a while; only he supposed his wife could not get on without him.|$|R

50|$|An {{odometer}} {{driven by}} a vane anemometer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nose determined when the target area had been reached, accurately enough for area bombing. Before launch, <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> was set to a value that would reach zero upon arrival at the target in the prevailing wind conditions. As the missile flew, the airflow turned the propeller, and every 30 rotations of the propeller counted <b>down</b> one number <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> This <b>counter</b> triggered <b>the</b> arming of the warhead after about 60 km. When the count reached zero, two detonating bolts were fired. Two spoilers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> elevator were released, the linkage between the elevator and servo was jammed and a guillotine device cut off the control hoses to the rudder servo, setting the rudder in neutral. These actions put the V-1 into a steep dive. While this was originally {{intended to be a}} power dive, in practice the dive caused the fuel flow to cease, which stopped the engine. The sudden silence after the buzzing alerted listeners of the impending impact. The fuel problem was quickly fixed, and when the last V-1s fell, the majority hit with power.|$|R
60|$|Lem sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> {{and laughed}} {{until he was}} forced to brush the tears from his cheeks at the idea of Chester Perkins being Jethro's candidate.

60|$|One of the many, {{and often}} humorous, {{incidents}} that served {{to bring about}} this realization of a former aimlessness happened on their second Sunday excursion. This time he had not chosen the Kingsbury Tavern, but another automobilists' haunt, an enlightening indication of established habits involving a wide choice of resorts. While he was paying for luncheon and chatting with the proprietor, Ditmar snatched from the change he had flung <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> a five dollar gold coin.|$|E

We want a gun and ammunition; it need not be a new one. I see you have got half a dozen standing over there in the corner. What do you charge your customers for those? I see they are all old single barrels and flint-locks." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{not half}} a minute {{from the time that}} Mulford sprang to Rose's succour, ere he had her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vessel's bottom. In another half minute, he had waded <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> schooner's <b>counter,</b> where Jack Tier was lustily calling to him for [...] "help!" [...] and {{assisted}} the widow to her feet, and supported her until she stood at Rose's side. Leaving the last in her aunt's arms, half distracted between dread and joy, he turned to the assistance of Biddy. The rope at which the Irish woman had caught, was a straggling end that had been made fast to the main channels of the schooner, for the support of a fender, and had been hauled partly in-board to keep it out of the water. Biddy had found no difficulty in dragging herself up to the chains, therefore; and had she been content to sustain herself by the rope, leaving as much of her body submerged as comported with breathing, her task would have been easy. But, like most persons who {{do not know how to}} swim, the good woman was fast exhausting her strength, by vain efforts to walk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of an element that was never made to sustain her. Unpractised persons, in such situations, cannot be taught to believe that their greatest safety is in leaving as much of their bodies as possible beneath the water, keeping the mouth and nose alone free for breath. But we have seen even instances in which men, who were in danger of drowning, seemed to believe it might be possible for them to craw! over <b>the</b> waves <b>on</b> their hands and knees. The philosophy of the contrary course is so very simple, that one would fancy a very child might be made to comprehend it; yet, it is rare to find one unaccustomed to the water, and who is suddenly exposed to its dangers, that does not resort, under the pressure of present alarm, to the very reverse of the true means to save his or her life.|$|R
50|$|In the morning, Marshall {{wakes up}} to music {{coming from a}} car and meets Amy's ex-boyfriend Uri Romanov (Valery Nikolaev) outside. Uri grabs Marshall by the nose and orders him to leave. Marshall tries to stop him, but Uri leaves him {{unconscious}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. When Amy wakes up, she sees lizards hatching inside the closet and crushes them with a shoe. When she {{runs out of the}} bedroom, she finds Uri and grabs a kitchen knife, attempting to kill him. Uri grabs her, and forces her <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>counter,</b> asking where is his money. Suddenly Marshall shows up with the rifle in his hands. Uri pulls out a pistol and tells him Amy's real name is Alex Langdon. Amy tells Uri that the money is in the bedroom closet, but when he goes into bedroom, he discovers that she tricked him. He forces them to the bed, and prevents them from leaving. Suddenly, lizards attack but Uri kills them with his guns. He again asks Amy where is the money; she replies that it is in the attic. Marshall goes up to fetch the money belt and throws it down to the floor. Uri picks it up, complaining it as wet and a bit light. Amy sprays him in the face with insect spray. They shove him into the fireplace and eggs fall on his head. A lizard breaks out of his mouth, and Amy shoots him in the face repeatedly. She gives Marshall the pistol for protection while he goes to pour gasoline in the bedroom and kitchen, where more lizards appear. When Amy looks in the money belt, a lizard pops out and she screams. Marshall throws the gas can into <b>the</b> oven and, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third shot hits the can. His clothes catch on fire; Amy extinguishes his flaming clothes but the money also burns. They both escape in Uri's car as the cabin burns. The car starts to breaks down and Marshall goes to look under the hood, where he finds eggs hatching in it. Suddenly, lizards start pop out of various places inside the car, attacking Amy. Marshall tells her to unlock the door after she accidentally locked it in her panic. He takes the cigar she had lit while he was looking under the hood and throws it into the gas tank, blowing up the car while simultaneously killing the lizards.|$|R

6000|$|Jos's London {{agents had}} orders to pay {{one hundred and}} twenty pounds yearly to his parents at Fulham. It was the chief support of the old couple; for Mr. Sedley's speculations in life {{subsequent}} to his bankruptcy did {{not by any means}} retrieve the broken old gentleman's fortune. He tried to be a wine-merchant, a coal-merchant, a commission lottery agent, &c., &c. He sent round prospectuses to his friends whenever he took a new trade, and ordered a new brass plate for the door, and talked pompously about making his fortune still. But Fortune never came back to the feeble and stricken old man. One by one his friends dropped off, and were weary of buying dear coals and bad wine from him; and there was only his wife in all the world who fancied, when he tottered off to the City of a morning, that he was still doing any business there. At evening he crawled slowly back; and he used to go of nights to a little club at a tavern, where he disposed of the finances of the nation. It was wonderful to hear him talk about millions, and agios, and discounts, and what Rothschild was doing, and Baring Brothers. He talked of such vast sums that the gentlemen of the club (the apothecary, the undertaker, the great carpenter and builder, the parish clerk, who was allowed to come stealthily, and Mr. Clapp, our old acquaintance,) respected the old gentleman. [...] "I was better off once, sir," [...] he did not fail to tell everybody who [...] "used the room." [...] "My son, sir, is at this minute chief magistrate of Ramgunge in the Presidency of Bengal, and touching his four thousand rupees per mensem. My daughter might be a Colonel's lady if she liked. I might draw upon my son, the first magistrate, sir, for two thousand pounds to-morrow, and Alexander would cash my bill, down sir, <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> sir. But the Sedleys were always a proud family." [...] You and I, my dear reader, may drop into this condition one day: for have not many of our friends attained it? Our luck may fail: our powers forsake us: our place on the boards be taken by better and younger mimes--the chance of life roll away and leave us shattered and stranded. Then men will walk across the road when they meet you--or, worse still, hold you out a couple of fingers and patronize you in a pitying way--then you will know, as soon as your back is turned, that your friend begins with a [...] "Poor devil, what imprudences he has committed, what chances that chap has thrown away!" [...] Well, well--a carriage and three thousand a year is not the summit of the reward nor the end of God's judgment of men.

5000|$|When the Chinaman {{arrives in}} the country and {{proceeds}} to the Island mines, let him be treated exactly as the white man; let him pay his license and other fees, and be protected in the same manner. It is the non-collection of licenses which has created so violent an antipathy against him in the neighbouring colony.The mining bill at present before the House of Assembly makes, however, the taking out of a mining license compulsory on every person under a penalty of $50, and it only requires a little vigilance {{on the part of the}} Gold Commissioner to have every Chinamen at Sooke an acceptable contributor to the Crown Revenue. Any remission by which the Chinese are allowed to work without paying their share to the Government will, while injuring the Crown receipts, create a great deal of hostile feeling against them by the other miners. This should by all possible means by avoided.We have given what we conceive to be the principal objections against the celestials; but there is the other side of the picture. Of all classes of our population the Chinese are the most orderly and the most sober. They cost the country less in the police and judicial department. When they buy from the white population, they put the money <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> and what is probably the best appreciated of all their characteristics by their lighter skinned brethren-they never “skedaddle.” Infamous Chinese head tax got off to a slow start in British Columbia, ...|$|E

40|$|Here {{are four}} vignettes of children’s {{economic}} activities: 1. Studying children’s vital labor contributions {{to their parents}} ’ Chinese take-away family businesses in Britain, Miri Song reports how children carefully differentiated ‘helping out ’ from formal employment. Parents ’ pay-ments, for instance, were seldom treated as ordinary wages. As Anna, one of Song’s respondents, recalled: We never asked for more. ’Cause it {{was seen as a}} bonus, ’cause we worked any-way. And it was just like a little token gesture to buy yourself a record or some-thing nice to read. (Song, 1999 : 85) 2. Elizabeth Chin’s ethnographic account of 10 -year-old, poor and working-class black children’s consumption practices in Newhallville, New Haven, documents, among other patterns, children’s contrasting relationships to shopkeepers in local neighborhood stores and downtown shops. Asia, one of Chin’s young informants, tells her about her experience at Claire’s, a popular jewelry shop in the downtown mall: ‘Last time I was in there the lady was laughing because I didn’t have enough money. The other day I went in, and I bought all this stuff and the lady said, ‘that will be forty dollars. ’ I pulled out a fifty-dollar bill and said, “Here”. ’ Asia demonstrated how she slapped the bill <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> and {{the look on her face}} was both self-satisfied and challenging. ‘I swear I was about to say “keep the change ” until my grandmother came up. ’ (Chin, 2001 : 103...|$|E
