50|$|Increases in {{opportunities}} for male coaches, however, {{have resulted from}} Title IX legislation. Before Title IX, 90 percent of women's intercollegiate teams were coached by women. By 1978, when all educational institutions were required to comply with Title IX, the percentage of same-sex coaching had plunged to 58 percent. Although {{the actual number of}} <b>female</b> <b>coaches</b> increased between 1979 and 1986, the percentage of <b>female</b> <b>coaches</b> continued to decline over that same period. The all-time low of 47 percent of women coaching female sports was achieved in 1990. In addition, although men have broken into coaching female athletes, <b>female</b> <b>coaches</b> have not experienced the same opportunities to coach male athletes. In 1972, 99 percent of collegiate men's teams were coached by men, and the same is true today.|$|E
