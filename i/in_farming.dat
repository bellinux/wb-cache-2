40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether milk urea nitrogen concentration could be used as an easy monitoring tool for assessing protein nutritional status of dairy cows. Data collected (Questionnaire) from 5 <b>farms</b> located <b>in</b> Khartoum north were used in this study. Feed samples were collected from each farm and proximate analysis was carried out. Milk samples were collected separately from eight cows from each farm. Milk urea nitrogen concentration was measured. The results showed that the lowest CP content (19. 9 %) was reported <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> C, while the highest value (24. 5 %) was reported for farm A. The mean MUN concentrations was higher <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> A (35. 6 mg/dl) compared to 20. 1 17. 0, 13. 1 and 11. 4 mg/dl <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> D, E, B, and C, respectively. The variation in MU concentration within the farm ranged from 29. 6 to 45. 5 mg/dl <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> A, 7. 0 to 21. 0 mg/dl <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> B, 7. 0 to 14. 0 mg/dl <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> C, 10. 5 to 31. 5 mg/dl <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> D and 7. 0 to 35. 0 mg/dl <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> E. Difference <b>in</b> MUN concentration were observed within and between farms. A significant (P< 0. 05) Positive correlation (r: 0. 8) was found between CP and MUN.

5|$|An {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>farming</b> came {{naturally to}} William Halliday. Besides teaching, his father, Samuel, farmed successfully in Scotland {{and in the}} United States. Halliday owned a prosperous cotton plantation in Arkansas in addition to several thousand cultivated acres not connected with the model town. The 3500 cultivated acres surrounding the village provided important staples for the town. Forage for the mine mules as well as food for mining families came from company farms. In order to process its own meat, the company operated a slaughterhouse. By using this system the store was able to sell fresh meat at affordable prices.|$|E

40|$|Use of {{antimicrobials}} {{in animals}} poses a potential risk {{for public health}} as it contributes to the selection and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Although knowledge of {{the negative consequences of}} extensive antimicrobial use in humans and animals accumulated over the decades, total therapeutic antimicrobial use <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> animals <b>in</b> the Netherlands doubled between 1990 and 2007. A series of facts and events formed a window of opportunity to reduce antimicrobial use <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> animals. The recent discovery of significant reservoirs of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (ESBL) <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> animals, with potential public health implications, combined with an increasing lack of confidence of the public in intensive livestock industries, and discrepancy between the very low antimicrobial use in humans and high use in animals, resulted in intensive collaboration between the government, veterinary professional organizations and important stakeholders within the livestock sector. A combination of compulsory and voluntary actions with clear reduction goals resulted in a 56 % reduction in antimicrobial use <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> animals <b>in</b> the Netherlands between 2007 and 2012 and aims at accomplishing a 70 % reduction target in 2015.
