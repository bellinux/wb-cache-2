The proposed methodology is an attempt to link traditional qualitative methods with modern textual statistics. Results show that the hypergeometric, chi 2 and bootstrap tests are effective in identifying distinctive words among presidents ('between' perspective) and among addresses delivered by the same president ('within' perspective) and that individual characteristic features and personal traits are more important than other factors in the <b>End</b> <b>of</b> Year <b>Addresses</b> topics...|$|R
