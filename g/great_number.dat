5|$|After his death, Gaudí's works {{suffered}} {{a period of}} neglect and were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and excessively imaginative. In his homeland he was equally disdained by Noucentisme, the new movement which took the place of Modernisme. In 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Gaudí's workshop in the Sagrada Família was ransacked, and a <b>great</b> <b>number</b> of his documents, plans and scale models were destroyed.|$|E

Native states, notably Msiri's Yeke Kingdom, the Zande Federation, and Swahili-speaking territory in the eastern Congo under Tippu Tip, refused to recognise colonial authority and were defeated by the Force Publique with great brutality, during the Congo Arab war. In 1895, a military mutiny broke out among the Batetela in Kasai, leading to a 4-year insurgency. The conflict was particularly brutal and caused a <b>great</b> <b>number</b> of casualties.|$|E

On 7 July 1307, before Edmund had turned six, King Edward I died, leaving Edmund's half-brother Edward to succeed as King Edward II.|$|E

5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against this move, but he insisted on this presence of this <b>great</b> <b>number</b> of artillery.|$|E

He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices.|$|E
