It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E

I couldn't see myself playing in an 11 piece salsa band. It was only a minute in my life. I enjoyed the band and enjoyed the tour but I {{realised}} I didn't have my friends behind me anymore. I had to start again. Then I reunited with half the band at the start of what became The Black Sorrows. – Camilleri ...|$|E
2500|$|On lap 146, Matt Kenseth {{took the}} lead from Sadler a lap after the action resumed. Almirola was then spun by Kasey Kahne after Almirola made contact with Sam Hornish, Jr. on the backstretch. At this time, rain began to fall on the track under the yellow. On lap 152, the cars came into pit road under the red flag. Some drivers exited their cars while others, {{including}} Kenseth, remained in theirs. During the red flag period, asked what happened with Brian Vickers, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. said, [...] "I got a run on him and (Vickers) saw me coming. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> old run on him and I went to the inside. I didn't try to make no late move and {{make some kind of}} surprise or anything. I just kind of ease on over and he went to block me and hit me in the fender sending us both off, sent me down into the grass and I tried to recover my car. I got back into him coming back into the racetrack." [...] When asked what happened was accidental, Earnhardt, Jr. was unrepentant and said, [...] "Yeah, it was accidental. I didn't want to wreck the field." [...] The drivers and fans did not buy Earnhardt Jr.'s excuse and to this day Vickers, the drivers, and fans {{do not believe that the}} crash was accidental. Later that week, Earnhardt Jr. gave a public apology for the incident and decided that he should have thought before he made his move that obviously would have crashed Vickers.|$|E

2500|$|Scouting for a {{supporting}} cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, {{was asked to}} read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind {{man who wants to}} be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh. Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brook's spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: [...] "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey." [...] Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: [...] "The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> mouth then -— still do. I said, 'I think he’s more the woman. I think he's more out there.' So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'" [...] Another actor who was originally cast for a guest shot which led to becoming a series regular was choreographer Joseph Malone. [...] The show now had its cast.|$|E

No {{one seems to be}} able to pin him down to a {{definite}} programme and yet day by day his influence grows. The Labour Party is disintegrated. The best of all its factions are joining the Democrats. He is practically leader of the Opposition Party to-day and I don't see how they are going to stop his being Prime Minister whenever he chooses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{there was}} another one that went for almost as much with me. I shot down Faulkner {{because he was a}} curse to us all. He had imprisoned several of my pals, and done a lot of damage to the trade, and was likely to break it up altogether, besides which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> grudge against him on my own account. But I should not have liked to shoot down this fellow in cold blood. I had no feeling against him; he has done me no harm; I did not even know who he was. If he had {{overtaken}} me in the open, you may be sure that I should have made a fight of it, for it would have been my life against his. I don't pretend to be soft; there is little enough of that about me, and I have fought hard several times in the old days when we were surprised; but I could not have shot down that fellow without giving him a chance of his life. If there had not been the trap-door to escape by I should have stood up, given him fair warning, and fought it out man to man. As it was--" [...] at this point the conversation had been arrested by the sudden entrance of Julian.|$|E
6000|$|Rilla was writhing. Hadn't Susan any {{realization}} {{that she was}} addressing {{an officer of the}} Canadian Army? Apparently she had not. Oh, what would Ken think? [...] "I suppose you do not remember the time your mother spanked you either," [...] continued Susan, who seemed to be bent on reviving tender reminiscences that evening. [...] "I shall never, no never, forget it. She was up here one night with you when you were about three, and you and Walter were playing out in the kitchen yard with a kitten. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> puncheon of rainwater by the spout which I was reserving for making soap. And you and Walter began quarrelling over the kitten. Walter was at one side of the puncheon standing on a chair, holding the kitten, and you were standing on a chair at the other side. You leaned across that puncheon and grabbed the kitten and pulled. You were always a great hand for taking what you wanted without too much ceremony. Walter held on tight and the poor kitten yelled but you dragged Walter and the kitten half over and then you both lost your balance and tumbled into that puncheon, kitten and all. If I had not been on the spot you would both have been drowned. I flew to the rescue and hauled you all three out before much harm was done, and your mother, who had seen it all from the upstairs window, came down and picked you up, dripping as you were, and gave you a beautiful spanking. Ah," [...] said Susan with a sigh, [...] "those were happy old days at Ingleside." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now I {{stood and}} took some long, deep breaths; then, having made {{everything}} ready, I jerked {{myself out of}} that diving-suit in a very few seconds, and, standing free, I gave a great leap upward, and {{went straight to the}} surface. I am a good swimmer, and with a few strokes I caught the chains. Stealthily I clambered up, making not the least noise, and peeped over the rail. There was nobody forward. The whole ship's company seemed to be crowded aft, where there was a great stir and confusion. I slipped quietly over the rail and, without being seen by anybody, made my way into the forecastle. I hurried to my sea-chest. I took off my wet things and dressed myself in an almost new suit of shore clothes which I had never worn on the brig. I did not lose any more time than I could help, but I took unusual care in dressing myself. I put on a new pair of yellow shoes, and turned up the bottom of my trousers so as to show my red socks. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> felt hat which I had bought in Mexico, with a little feather in it; and this I put on, pulling it rakishly over on one side. I put around my neck a long blue silk cravat with white spots, which I tied in the biggest bow I could make. Then, feeling that I ought to have something in my hands, I picked up a capstan-bar, and laying it across my arm after the manner of a cutlass, I went boldly on deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ain't he a dear little man?" [...] said Captain Jim gloatingly. [...] "I do love {{to watch}} a little child asleep, Mistress Blythe. It's the most {{beautiful}} sight in the world, I reckon. Joe does love to get down here for a night, because I have him sleep with me. At home he has to sleep {{with the other two}} boys, and he doesn't like it. Why can't I sleep with father, Uncle Jim?" [...] says he. 'Everybody in the Bible slept with their fathers.' As for the questions he asks, the minister himself couldn't answer them. They fair swamp me. 'Uncle Jim, if I wasn't ME who'd I be?' and, 'Uncle Jim, what would happen if God died?' He fired them two off at me tonight, afore he went to sleep. As for his imagination, it sails away from everything. He makes up the most remarkable yarns--and then his mother shuts him up in the closet for telling stories. And he sits down and makes up another one, and has it ready to relate to her when she lets him out. He had one for me when he come down tonight. 'Uncle Jim,' says he, solemn as a tombstone, 'I had a 'venture in the Glen today.' 'Yes, what was it?' says I, expecting something quite startling, but nowise prepared for what I really got. 'I met a wolf in the street,' says he, 'a 'normous wolf with a big, red mouf and AWFUL long teeth, Uncle Jim.' 'I didn't know there was any wolves up at the Glen,' says I. 'Oh, he comed there from far, far away,' says Joe, 'and I fought he was going to eat me up, Uncle Jim.' 'Were you scared?' says I. 'No, 'cause <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> gun,' says Joe, 'and I shot the wolf dead, Uncle Jim,--solid dead--and then he went up to heaven and bit God,' says he. Well, I was fair staggered, Mistress Blythe." ...|$|E
5000|$|Womack told The Mirror, [...] "This is {{the kind}} of stuff I grew up {{listening}} to. How true is this song? Even if you haven't been in that situation, we all know somebody who has. It's just honest." [...] In an interview with The Mirror Womack said, [...] "I was kind of languishing, not really sure what I wanted to do or what I needed to do. But then I heard I May Hate Myself in the Morning, and that was my answer. To put it in visual terms, it was like <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> question mark over my head, and then all of the sudden, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> light bulb over my head. That song made me want {{to get back in the}} studio and make music again. I knew from the beginning that I wanted Hate Myself to be the first single. That song was not really like the other things that were happening on radio at the time, but at some point, you just have to stand up and say, 'This is who I am." ...|$|E

5000|$|Cote de Pablo divulged, [...] "Stuff {{is going}} to be blowing up, and not only that, but it was a crazy episode to shoot because there were sooo many stunts for me.
