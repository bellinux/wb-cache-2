50|$|Flash trading, {{otherwise}} known as a <b>flash</b> <b>order,</b> is a marketable order sent to a market center that is not quoting the industry's best price or that cannot fill that order in its entirety. The order is then flashed to recipients of the venue's proprietary data feed {{to see if any}} of those firms wants to take {{the other side of the}} order.|$|E

40|$|We use the {{introduction}} {{and the subsequent}} removal of the <b>flash</b> <b>order</b> facility (an actionable indication of interest, IOI) from the NASDAQ as a natural experiment to investigate the impact of voluntary disclosure of trading intent on market quality. We find that flash orders significantly improve liquidity in the NASDAQ. In addition, overall market quality improves substantially when the flash functionality is introduced and deteriorates when it is removed. One explanation for our findings is that flash orders are placed by less informed traders and fulfill their role as an advertisement of uninformed liquidity needs. They successfully attract responses from liquidity providers immediately after the announcement is placed, thus lowering the risk-bearing cost for the overall market. Our study is important in understanding the impact of voluntary disclosure, in guiding future market design choices, and in the current debate on dark pools and IOIs...|$|E
50|$|In 2009 Sang Lee, {{managing}} partner at Aite Group, an independent {{research firm in}} Boston, saw the debate about <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> as more philosophical than practical. Since the total market volume that goes through <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> accounted for only 2% to 3% of daily volume in 2009, {{there would not be}} a big change in trade volume among major players if those orders disappeared.|$|R
50|$|In {{high-frequency}} trading <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> {{for small}} amounts are utilised to find large orders {{so that the}} high frequency trader can buy or sell all available stock before the large order reaches {{the rest of the}} market. This may be done within a dark pool or over a number of electronic exchanges where the speed of the order routing is {{critical to the success of}} the strategy. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by 2009 this practice had become controversial, with some market participants saying that high frequency traders could use <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> to unfairly exploit others and that it is akin to front running.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> gained {{popularity}} in the options markets, where as early as 2000 the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) began using the particular type of order to help improve the speed of trade executions for its clients.|$|R

50|$|In 2006, Direct Edge began {{offering}} customers {{the ability to}} <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> in the equities market. Direct Edge quickly captured market share from their rivals as their share of matched trades soared from 1% of the industry's volume to 12%. Direct Edge became a U.S. exchange in July 2010. Nasdaq and BATS (U.S. exchanges) created their own flash market in early 2009 {{in response to the}} Direct Edge market. Both voluntarily discontinued the practice in August 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Direct Edge's {{response}} to the [...] "two-tiered market" [...] criticism is as follows:First {{it is difficult to}} address concerns that may result, particularly when there is no empirical data to support such as result. Furthermore, we do not view technology that instantaneously aggregates passive and aggressive liquidity as creating a two-tier market. Rather, flash technology democratizes access to the non-displayed market and in this regard, removes different [...] "tiers" [...] in market access. Additionally, any subscriber of Direct Edge can be a recipient of <b>flashed</b> <b>orders.</b>|$|R
40|$|An intermarket sweep order (ISO) is a {{limit order}} that {{automatically}} executes in a designated market center even if another market center is publishing a better quotation. An investor submitting an ISO must satisfy order-protection rules by concurrently submitting orders to the markets with better prices. We find that ISOs represent 46 % of trades and 41 % of volume in our sample. ISO trades have significantly larger information share despite their small trade size relative to non-ISO trades. Post trade return analysis suggests that informed institutions are the main users of ISO trades. Regulation NMS, Market Quality, Sweep <b>Order,</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>orders...</b>|$|R

40|$|The article {{discusses}} selected {{market abuse}} activities that manifested in several financial markets {{during the recent}} global financial crisis. In relation to this, market abuse activities such as front running and quote stuffing, dark pools and <b>flash</b> <b>orders,</b> hedge funds insider trading and high yield securities investment fraud, high frequency trading, credit default swaps and short selling will be briefly analysed. This is done to investigate whether the current South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework is robust enough to effectively combat these activities. This is further aimed at exposing certain challenges embedded in the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework {{in relation to the}} prevention and combating of the aforementioned practices in the financial markets in South Africa. To this end, the article seeks to explore these challenges by, first, examining the adequacy of the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework with regard to the combating of front running and quote stuffing. Secondly, the adequacy of the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework with regard to the curbing of dark pools and <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> will be discussed. Thirdly, the adequacy of the aforesaid enforcement framework will be examined in relation to the combating of hedge funds insider trading and high yield securities investment fraud. Fourthly, a similar examination will be done in respect of high frequency trading. Fifthly, the adequacy of the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework with regard to the curbing of credit default swaps will be discussed. Lastly, a similar discussion regarding short selling will be undertaken...|$|R
5000|$|Direct Edge's {{response}} to this in 2009 was that the data that flash trading used reduced market impact, increased average size of executed orders, reduced trading latency, and provided additional liquidity. Direct Edge also allowed all of its subscribers {{to determine whether they}} want their orders to participate in flash trading or not so brokers have the option to opt out of <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> on behalf of their clients if they choose to. Because market participants can choose to utilize it for additional liquidity or not participate in it at all Direct Edge believes the controversy was overstated stating: [...] "Misconceptions respecting flash technology have, to date, stirred a passionate but ill informed debate."

5000|$|In 2009 {{critics of}} the {{practice}} (notably high-frequency trading firm GETCO [...] ) contended this creates a two-tiered market in which a certain class of traders can unfairly exploit others, akin to front running. Exchanges in 2009 claimed that the procedure benefits all traders by creating more market liquidity and the opportunity for price improvement. However, a December 2009 article in The Banker noted: {{in a bid to}} fuel the controversy and fill column space, however, several commentators and pundits have complained bitterly that flashes expose information that may allow traders to ‘front-run’ orders. The widespread perception, meanwhile, that <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> are the preserve of hyper-sophisticated high-frequency traders has further cemented the misguided notion that the lay retail investor is in turn being cheated.|$|R

40|$|We model a {{financial}} market where traders have access both to a fully transparent limit order book (LOB) {{and to an}} opaque Dark Pool (DP). When a DP is introduced to a LOB market,orders migrate to the DP from the LOB, but overall trading volume increases. Moreover, inside quoted depth in the LOB decreases, but quoted spreads tend to narrow in deep books and widen in shallow ones. DP market share is higher when LOB depth is high, when LOB spread is narrow, when the tick size is large and when traders seek protection from price impact. When depth decreases {{on one side of}} the LOB, liquidity is drained from the DP. When <b>Flash</b> <b>orders</b> provide select traders with information about the state of the DP, more orders migrate from the LOB to the DP but overall market quality improves. ...|$|R
50|$|This {{practice}} {{enables the}} market center {{to try to}} keep the trade since the firm that is seeking to buy or sell shares or stock posts the information only on a specific stock exchange before sending the trade information out on the broader public markets, and making it available to all potential investors. If a deal can be struck between recipients of the flash trade, the result is a locked market with guaranteed pricing on the order. On some trades, it also results in better profits for the firms making the trades, as the firms often get rebates or lower fees for flash trades when the deal completes on the home exchange and doesn't get posted on rival stock exchanges. In 2009 in the United States under an exception to Rule 602 of Regulation NMS <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> were allowed.|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to supporting studies of HFT’s impact on financial markets, such as Brogaard et al. (2014), Hendershott et al. (2011), Zhang (2010), and Jarrow and Protter (2012), regulators have {{taken steps to}} increase their regulatory authority over HFT activities. Some {{of the problems that}} arose in the mid- 2000 s led to regulatory hearings in the United States Senate (2009) on dark pools, <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> and HFT practices in 2009, and the discussions continued into 2012 (Brooks 2012). Another example occurred after the Facebook IPO problem. This led the SEC to call for a limit up-limit down mechanism at the exchanges to prevent trades in individual securities from occurring outside of a specified price range so that market volatility will be under better control (Pisani 2013). These regulatory actions put stricter requirements on HFT practices, aiming to minimize the market disturbance when many fast trading orders occur within a day. Similar regulatory actions have occurred in Europe as well. For example, in September 2013, Italy became the first country to levy fees HFT trading to discourage its usage (Stafford 2013).|$|R

40|$|We model {{a dynamic}} {{financial}} market where traders submit orders either to a limit order book (LOB) or to a Dark Pool (DP). We {{show that there}} is a positive liquidity externality in the DP, that orders migrate from the LOB to the DP, but that overall trading volume increases when a DP is introduced. We also demonstrate that DP market share is higher when LOB depth is high, when LOB spread is narrow, when the tick size is large and when traders seek protection from price impact. Further, while inside quoted depth in the LOB always decreases when a DP is introduced, quoted spreads can narrow for liquid stocks and widen for illiquid ones. We also show that traders' interaction with both LOB and DP generates interesting systematic patterns in order ?ow: di¤erently from Parlour (1998), the probability of a continuation is greater than that of a reversal only for liquid stocks. In addition, when depth decreases on one side of LOB, liquidity is drained from DP. When a DP is added to a LOB, total welfare as well as institutional traders' welfare increase but only for liquid stocks; retail traders' welfare instead always decreases. Finally, when <b>flash</b> <b>orders</b> provide select traders with information {{about the state of the}} DP, we show that more orders migrate from the LOB to the DP, and DP welfare effects are enhanced. ...|$|R
