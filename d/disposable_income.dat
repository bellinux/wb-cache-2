5|$|The soldier's sole {{substantial}} <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> {{came from}} the donativa, or cash bonuses handed out periodically by the emperors, as these were paid in gold solidi (which were never debased), or in pure silver. There was a regular donative of 5 solidi every five years of an Augustus reign (i.e. one solidus p.a.) Also, on the accession of a new Augustus, 5 solidi plus a pound of silver (worth 4 solidi, totaling 9 solidi) were paid. The 12 Augusti that ruled the West between 284 and 395 averaged about nine years per reign. Thus the accession donatives would have averaged about 1 solidus p.a. The late soldier's <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> would thus have averaged at least 2 solidi per annum. It is also possible, but undocumented, that the accession bonus was paid for each Augustus and/or a bonus for each Caesar. The documented income of 2 solidi was {{only a quarter of}} the <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> of a 2nd-century legionary (which was the equivalent of c. 8 solidi). The late soldier's discharge package (which included a small plot of land) was also minuscule compared with a 2nd-century legionary's, worth just a tenth of the latter's.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, the {{unemployment}} rate in Canberra was 3.4% which was lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.1%. As a result of low unemployment and substantial levels of public sector and commercial employment, Canberra has the highest average level of <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> of any Australian capital city.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} effect of formal {{political}} institutions (electoral systems, fiscal decentralization, presidential and parliamentary regimes) on the extent and direction of income (re-) distribution. Empirical evidence is presented for a large sample of 70 economies and a panel of 13 OECD countries between 1981 and 1998. The evidence indicates that presidential regimes {{are associated with a}} less equal distribution of <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes,</b> while electoral systems have no significant effects. Fiscal competition is associated with less income redistribution and a less equal distribution of <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes,</b> but also with a more equal primary income distribution. Our evidence also is in line with earlier empirical contributions that find a positive relationship between trade openness and equality in primary and <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes,</b> as well as the overall redistributive effort...|$|R

Tax cuts would place pressure on public finances, but the benefits are self-evident. Increased competitiveness of firms and increased <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes</b> of households would gradually push up revenues while driving economic growth.|$|R

This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E
5|$|Other key {{sectors of}} the Turkish economy are banking, construction, home appliances, electronics, textiles, oil refining, {{petrochemical}} products, food, mining, iron and steel, and machine industry. In 2010, the agricultural sector accounted for 9 percent of GDP, while the industrial sector accounted for 26 percent and the services sector for 65 percent. However, agriculture still accounted {{for a quarter of}} employment. In 2004, it was estimated that 46 percent of total <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> was received by the top 20 percent of income earners, while the lowest 20 percent received only 6 percent. The rate of female employment in Turkey was 30 percent in 2012, the lowest among all OECD countries.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases.

While this often means that moviegoers have less <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> afterwards, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E

5|$|Gross {{salary was}} subject to {{deductions}} for food, clothing, boots and hay (probably for the company mules). It is unclear whether the cost of armour and weapons was also deducted, or borne by the army. Deductions left the soldier with a net salary of 78 denarii. This sum was sufficient, {{on the basis of}} the food deduction, to amply feed an adult for a year. In 84AD Domitian increased basic legionary pay by 33% (from 225 to 300 denarii): a similar increase was presumably accorded to auxiliaries, boosting their net income to 140 denarii, i.e. more than two food allowances. It was entirely disposable, as the soldier was exempt from the poll tax (capitatio), did not pay rent (he was housed in fort barracks) and his food, clothing and equipment were already deducted. It should be borne in mind that most recruits came from peasant families living at subsistence level. To such persons, any <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> would appear attractive. It could be spent on leisure activities, sent to relatives or simply saved for retirement.|$|E

40|$|Tax {{and benefit}} changes {{implemented}} by Labour since 1997 {{will have a}} net cost to the exchequer of around £ 2. 2 billion in 2005 - 06. The average (mean) impact of this small net giveaway is to raise household <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes</b> by £ 1. 69 a week or 0. 4 %. The biggest proportionate gains are in the 2 nd poorest tenth of the population, whose <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes</b> are increased by 11. 4 %, while the richest tenth fare worst, with a cut in income of 3. 7 %. * Tax and benefit reforms since 1997 have clearly been progressive, benefiting the less well-off relative to the better-off.

This outweighs the giveaway by central government, and leaves households overall £ 2. 85 a week worse off on average, equivalent to 0. 6 % of their <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes.</b> The increase in council tax is regressive, except for the poorest fifth of the population, who are partially protected from the rises by council tax benefit. ...|$|R

25|$|Between 1964 and 1968, {{benefits}} in kind were significantly progressive, in that over the period those in {{the lower half of}} the income scale benefited more than those in the upper half.
