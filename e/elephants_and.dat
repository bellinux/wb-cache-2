5|$|Killer {{whales are}} notable for their complex societies. Only <b>elephants</b> <b>and</b> higher primates, such as humans, live in comparably complex social structures.

5|$|Le Règne Animal was {{influential}} in being widely read, and in presenting accurate descriptions of groups of related animals, {{such as the}} living <b>elephants</b> <b>and</b> the extinct mammoths, providing convincing evidence for evolutionary change to readers including Charles Darwin, although Cuvier himself rejected the possibility of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The ox and the ass, as well {{as other}} animals, became a part of nativity scene tradition.

5|$|Although adult lions have {{no natural}} predators, {{evidence}} suggests that the majority die violently from humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries on each other, either members of different prides encountering each other in territorial disputes, or members of the same pride fighting at a kill. Crippled lions and lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or <b>elephants,</b> <b>and</b> careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain is}} the largest known of any modern or extinct animal, {{weighing}} on average about , {{more than five times}} heavier than a human's, and has a volume of about 8,000cm3. Although larger brains generally correlate with higher intelligence, {{it is not the only}} factor. <b>Elephants</b> <b>and</b> dolphins also have larger brains than humans. The sperm whale has a lower encephalization quotient than many other whale and dolphin species, lower than that of non-human anthropoid apes, and much lower than humans'.|$|E
5|$|The conservationists, governments, and {{non-governmental}} organizations that endorse the strategy {{argue that it}} fosters {{public support for the}} protection of <b>elephants</b> <b>and</b> that it sends a message to poachers their work is futile. Critics contend that the technique may increase poaching by creating a perception of scarcity that increases ivory's value on the black market, and that evidence for the technique's effectiveness is insufficient to justify the opportunity cost for countries struggling with poverty.|$|E
5|$|When {{faced with}} opponents who used {{unfamiliar}} fighting techniques, {{such as in}} Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in Bactria and Sogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center. In India, confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the <b>elephants</b> <b>and</b> used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.|$|E

5|$|Both Titus and Domitian were fond of gladiatorial games, and {{realised}} {{its importance}} {{to appease the}} citizens of Rome. In the newly constructed Colosseum, the Flavians provided for spectacular entertainments. The Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre lasted for a hundred days and {{were said to be}} extremely elaborate, including gladiatorial combat, fights between wild animals (<b>elephants</b> <b>and</b> cranes), mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded, horse races and chariot races. During the games, wooden balls were dropped into the audience, inscribed with various prizes (clothing, gold, or even slaves), which could then be traded for the designated item.|$|E
5|$|In August 1802, Gia Long retaliated {{against the}} {{captured}} Tây Sơn leadership who had executed {{his family in}} the 1770s. The surviving {{members of the family}} and its leading generals and their families were executed. The remains of Quang Trung and his queen were exhumed and desecrated, and his son, the last Tây Sơn monarch Quang Toản was bound to four <b>elephants</b> <b>and</b> torn apart. Gia Long repealed the changes enacted by Quang Trung and reverted to the prior Confucian orthodoxy. This included restoring the civil service to the forefront of decision making, ahead of the army, and reversed Quang Trung's education reforms, which put science before the study of Confucian literature.|$|E
5|$|In Hoysala art Hardy {{identifies}} two conspicuous {{departures from}} the more austere Western (Later) Chalukya art:ornamental elaboration and a profusion of iconography with figure sculptures, {{both of which are}} found in abundance even on the superstructure over the shrine. Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as yalli, kirtimukha (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, makara (aquatic monster), birds (hamsa), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, <b>elephants</b> <b>and</b> horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.|$|E

5|$|India— This civilization has no {{villager}} {{cards at}} the Home City, but they receive one villager with almost every shipment. All villagers {{that are not}} shipped from the Home City cost wood instead of food. Villagers are also not allowed to harvest livestock for food, but instead can build a structure called a Sacred Field which generates experience points whenever livestock are tasked to it. Sepoys (Musketeers), Gurkha (Skirmishers) and Rajputs (much like Rodeleros) are the primary infantry units, and India has several types of camel and elephant cavalry. Both of India's Brahmin monks ride atop <b>elephants</b> <b>and</b> can heal other units {{from the start of}} the game. Their Home City is Delhi and their leader is Akbar the Great.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than the}} {{numbered}} caves, Badami {{is home to}} many other cave monuments and medieval era temples. On {{the other side of}} the lake, near the Bhutanatha temple, is a 7th-8th century Chalukya period cave of small dimensions. Inside, there is a carved statue seated over a sculpted throne with reliefs showing people holding chauris (fans), a Pipal tree, <b>elephants,</b> <b>and</b> lions in an attacking pose. On one side of the statue is a chakra, on the other a conch shell. The statue wears abundant jewelry and a thread over its chest. The face of this statue is damaged and missing its face.|$|E
5|$|Other {{threats to}} {{elephants}} include habitat destruction and fragmentation. The Asian elephant lives {{in areas with}} some of the highest human populations. Because they need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals, they are the first to be affected by human encroachment. In extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both <b>elephants</b> <b>and</b> humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation. One proposed solution is the provision of ‘urban corridors’ which allow the animals access to key areas.|$|E

5|$|Seventy-three bais, or forest clearings, {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Nki National Park. In April 2006, while looking for elephant groups, a WWF team discovered the largest bai in the region, Ikwa Bai. Dr. Mike Loomis, {{a member of the}} group, confirmed that this bai is slightly larger than Dzanga Sangha Bai (Central African Republic), which had previously held the record. He also reported little human development adjacent to the bai, and noticed 21 <b>elephants</b> <b>and</b> 16 buffaloes in it simultaneously. The bai has a small creek running through its center, which sits atop a bed of rocks and sand. A large mineral pit is located next to the stream. It is the habitat of several wildlife species, the largest-numbering being chimpanzees, elephants, buffaloes, and gorillas.|$|E

In the 2012 national wildlife survey, 25 tigers were recorded.

5|$|The Sirenia, {{commonly}} referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The Sirenia currently comprise the families Dugongidae (the dugong) and Trichechidae (manatees) with a total of four species. The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the <b>elephants</b> <b>and</b> the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene.|$|E
