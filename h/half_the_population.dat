5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, Irish {{people began to}} arrive in large numbers in Coatbridge. The 1851 UK Census {{recorded}} that Irish people constituted 35.8% of the local population.

By 1901 UK Census, the percentage of Irish-born people in Coatbridge had fallen to around 15%, but remained the highest of all the major towns in Scotland. In the 2001 UK Census, Irish ethnicity was recorded at just over 1%, although just over <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> claimed their religious denomination as Roman Catholicism.

5|$|English, Māori and New Zealand Sign Language are the {{official}} languages, with English predominant. New Zealand English is mostly non-rhotic and sounds similar to Australian English, {{with a common}} exception being the centralisation of the short i. The Māori language has undergone a process of revitalisation and is spoken by 3.7percent of the population. New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99percent and {{over half of the}} population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification. In the adult population 14.2 percent have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4 percent have no formal qualification. As of the 2013 census, just under <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> identify as Christians, with Hinduism and Buddhism being the most significant minority religions. New Zealand has no state religion and just over 40percent of the population does not have a religion.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} Jiajing reforms to {{document}} migrant workers and merchants, {{by the late}} Ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population. Gazetteers across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the Ming, some guessing that it had doubled, tripled, or even grown fivefold since 1368. Fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps 160 million in the late Ming dynasty, while Brook estimates 175 million, and Ebrey states perhaps as large as 200 million. However, a great epidemic that entered China through the northwest in 1641 ravaged the densely populated areas along the Grand Canal; a gazetteer in northern Zhejiang noted more than <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> fell ill that year and that 90% of the local populace in one area was dead by 1642.|$|E

There were 1,977,534 households in Jordan in 2015, {{with an average}} of 4.8 persons per household (compared to 6.7 persons per household for the census of 1979). The vast majority of Jordanians are Arabs, accounting for 98% of the population. The rest is attributed to Circassians, Chechens and Armenians. As the population has increased, it has become more settled and urban. In 1922 almost <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> (around 103,000) were nomadic, whereas nomads made up only 6% of the population in 2015.

It repeated its success overseas, and was a sensational hit during the Blitz in London, opening in April 1940 and playing for four years.

5|$|Attempt {{to retake}} {{the town was}} made under the {{leadership}} of the new Swedish Governor-General of Finland Carl Nieroth with 10 000 men strong army supported by naval squadron led by Admiral Olof Wernfelt consisting of 6 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 brigantines. Swedish light infantry had started the harassing operations already in the spring of 1711 and naval blockade had been place for most of the summer. Swedish manpower had been sapped by a plague which had struck Finland in late 1710 killing amongst others nearly a thousand in Helsinki alone - <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> at the time. Same plague had struck Karlskrona making it difficult for the Swedish to equip their naval squadron Finland and it took until late June before it was able to sail delaying all Swedish operations. Actual siege by land forces was started in the autumn. However, as king refused to release more troops and supplies from Sweden for the besieging forces the siege was doomed to fail. On 2 December 1711 freezing waters and harsh weather forced the naval force to retire and by the Christmas also the land forces had to withdraw. Nieroth who had invigorated the whole of Finland perished suddenly on 25 January 1712 and was succeeded by weak Georg Henrik Lybecker.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century, {{most of the}} town's {{inhabitants}} and {{the local}} elite were Saxons, largely descended from settlers brought in by the Kings of Hungary in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to develop and defend the southern borders of the province. By {{the middle of the}} next century roughly <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> had Hungarian names. In Transylvania as a whole, the Reformation sharpened ethnic divisions: Saxons became Lutheran while Hungarians either remained Catholic or became Calvinist or Unitarian. In Kolozsvár, however, the religious lines were blurred. Isolated both geographically from the main areas of German settlement in southern Transylvania and institutionally because of their distinctive religious trajectory, many Saxons eventually assimilated to the Hungarian majority over several generations. New settlers to the town largely spoke Hungarian, a language that many Saxons gradually adopted. (In the seventeenth century, out of more than thirty royal free towns, only seven had a Hungarian majority, with Kolozsvár/Klausenburg being one of them; the rest were largely German-dominated.) In this manner Kolozsvár became largely Hungarian speaking and would remain so through the mid-20th century, though 4.8% of its residents identified as German as late as 1880.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia has {{its origins}} in the Malay kingdoms present in the area which, from the 18th century, became subject to the British Empire. The first British territories were known as the Straits Settlements, whose {{establishment}} {{was followed by the}} Malay kingdoms becoming British protectorates. The territories on Peninsular Malaysia were first unified as the Malayan Union in 1946. Malaya was restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948, and achieved independence on 31 August 1957. Malaya united with North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore on 16 September 1963 to become Malaysia. Less than two years later in 1965, Singapore was expelled from the federation. The country is multi-ethnic and multi-cultural, which plays a large role in politics. About <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> is ethnically Malay, with large minorities of Malaysian Chinese which also form the second largest community of Overseas Chinese in the world, Malaysian Indians, and indigenous peoples. The constitution grants freedom of religion but recognised Islam as the established religion of the state. Despite being a majority Muslim country, Malaysia has been widely regarded as a rather moderate Muslim majority country. The government system is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system and the legal system is based on common law. The head of state is the king, known as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. He is an elected monarch chosen from the hereditary rulers of the nine Malay states every five years. The head of government is the prime minister. The country official language is Bahasa Malaysia or commonly known as Malay language. English remains as an active second language. English proficiency in Malaysia has been highly ranked as the second best in Asia after Singapore and 13th best in the world as of 2017.|$|E
