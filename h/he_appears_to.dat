5|$|Almost {{certainly}} {{a native of}} Angus, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be a descendant of David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of King William I of Scotland, through an illegitimate son whom Earl David settled {{in the area around}} Brechin.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 The New York Times {{reported}} that MacDougall {{was hoping to}} run experiments to take photos of souls, but <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> not have continued any further research into the area and died in 1920. His experiment has not been repeated.|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E
5000|$|Jesus {{took them}} all by stealth, for <b>he</b> did not <b>appear</b> as <b>he</b> was, {{but in the}} manner in which they would be able <b>to</b> see him. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> them all. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> the great as great. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> the small as small. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> the angels as an angel, and to men as a man.|$|R
5000|$|For I {{delivered}} {{to you as}} of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins {{in accordance with the}} Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> Cephas, then to the twelve. Then <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> also <b>to</b> me.|$|R
5000|$|In the Pauline epistles, the {{description}} of the conversion experience is brief. The First Epistle to the Corinthians describes Paul as having seen the risen Christ: For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> Cephas, and then to the Twelve. After that, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> James, then to all the apostles, and last of all <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> me also, as to one abnormally born. 1 Cor. 15:3-8, NIV ...|$|R
5|$|Another figure, to {{the right}} of Małachowski, is being carried; he is Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha (5), marshal of the Lithuanian {{confederation}} and the second Sejm marshal. He is dressed in more traditional Polish clothing. Between Małachowski and Sapieha, the head of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz (6), a well-known writer, is visible. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be carrying Sapieha. The other figure carrying Sapieha, to his right, is Michał Zabiełło (7).|$|E
5|$|Details on Buffalo's {{early life}} are sparse. Although <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been favored by British traders and {{decorated}} by British authorities, few Ojibwa from Lake Superior fought {{in either the}} American Revolution or the War of 1812. There is no record of Buffalo participating.|$|E
5|$|Historian Brian Jones concludes in The Emperor Domitian that {{assessing}} {{the true nature}} of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources. Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humour, and often communicated in cryptic ways.|$|E
60|$|The child smiled. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} these matters unimportant.|$|R

5|$|Ruisdael's {{teacher is}} also unknown. It is often assumed Ruisdael studied {{with his father}} and uncle, but there is no archival {{evidence}} for this. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been strongly influenced by other contemporary local Haarlem landscapists, most notably Cornelis Vroom and Allaert van Everdingen.|$|E
5|$|The third ealdorman, Æthelweard, today {{best known}} for his Latin history, ruled in the west. Æthelweard was a {{descendant}} of King Æthelred of Wessex and probably the brother of King Eadwig's wife. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been a supporter of Edward rather than of either faction.|$|E
5|$|A son of King Harald Hardrada, Magnus was in 1058 {{appointed}} nominal {{leader of}} an expedition into the Irish Sea while still only a child. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have assisted Welsh ruler Gruffydd ap Llywelyn and Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia in their struggles against the English, although his primary objective {{may have been}} to assert control over Orkney. He later accompanied his father in Harald's campaign against Denmark in 1062, and was appointed regent and made king before Harald's fatal invasion of England in 1066. Magnus briefly ruled Norway alone thereafter, until his younger brother Olaf returned from England in 1067.|$|E
60|$|The child looked puzzled. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> {{be trying}} to {{recollect}} something.|$|R

5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} sixteen, {{he found}} work as a factor's clerk in a {{warehouse}} at Horseley Fields, Wolverhampton, until the early 1880s {{when he left the}} warehouse after failing to repay a loan. He then worked for a lock manufacturer called Osborne in Lord Street, Wolverhampton, until he was dismissed for theft in either 1884 or 1885. For the next few years, his whereabouts are not known for certain, but <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have lived an unsettled life in the English Midlands and Yorkshire. In 1887, he was making a living as a hawker, selling small items such as pencils and key rings on the streets of Snow Hill, Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|Carroon, gravely ill, is {{cared for}} by the Rocket Group's doctor, Briscoe (John Glen), who has been having a secret affair with Carroon's wife, Judith (Isabel Dean). It is not just Quatermass who is {{interested}} in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted {{by a group of}} foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space. It is clear that there is something critically wrong: <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have absorbed the consciousness of the other two crew members, and is slowly mutating into a plant-like alien organism.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "James" [...] is {{mentioned}} in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians, as one <b>to</b> whom Jesus <b>appeared</b> after his resurrection: Then <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> James, then {{to all the}} apostles.

5|$|During Æthelwig's abbacy, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> {{have acted}} as the deputy for Ealdred, as bishop of Worcester. In 1062, {{he was one}} of the {{candidates}} to succeed Ealdred as bishop, when Ealdred was promoted to Archbishop of York, but Wulfstan was chosen instead. Æthelwig also served as a judge for King Edward the Confessor, at one point hearing a case at the royal court along with Wulfstan and Regenbald, the chancellor. The abbot also led military forces in battle, and served King Edward as an advisor.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald and Ymme had a daughter, Eanswith (who {{founded the}} very first nunnery on English soil at Folkestone, 15 miles from Canterbury), and two sons, Eorcenberht and Eormenred. Eormenred was the older of the two, and may have held the title of regulus, perhaps {{implying}} that he held the junior kingship of Kent. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have died before his father, leaving Eorcenberht to inherit the throne. An additional son, Ecgfrith, is mentioned in a charter of Eadbald's, but the charter is a forgery, probably dating from the eleventh century.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach first {{appears on}} record in about 1031, {{when he was}} one of three kings in {{northern}} Britain who submitted to Knútr Sveinnsson, ruler of the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire. Echmarcach is recorded to have ruled over Dublin in 10361038 and 10461052. After losing Dublin for the final time, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been seated in the Isles on Mann. In 1061, about a decade after his final defeat in Dublin, Echmarcach appears to have been expelled from the Isles, and may have then fallen back into Galloway.|$|E

5|$|Eyre {{returned}} to Britain, arriving at Spithead on 10 December 1826, and was almost immediately offered command of a squadron fitting out for Lisbon. The changes in climate had brought on {{an attack of}} gout, and on being informed that as Sir Thomas Hardy's squadron {{was already on the}} spot, he was at liberty to refuse the offer. Eyre did so, and retired ashore. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have had no further commands, and was advanced to vice-admiral in 1830. He had married Georgiana Cooke, the daughter of Sir George Cooke, 7th Baronet, at Doncaster on 1 November 1800, with whom he had a family of eight children, including two sons named George-Hardolf and William. Sir George Eyre died on 15 February 1839 at the rectory, Carlton, Derbyshire.|$|E
5|$|Francis's disciple, {{secretary}} and confessor Brother Leo acts as eyewitness. He {{is dressed in}} sombre colours and rendered in a more compact manner than Francis; crouched as if sunk into the pictorial space in the far right of the panel. His form is highly geometric and voluminous. His cord belt curves down to end next to that of Francis, symbolising the continuity between the Order's founder and his successors. Leo's posture seems to indicate mourning, although <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be resting or asleep.|$|E
5|$|General Eusebio Canales (alias Chamarrita or Prince of Arms) {{is forced}} into exile after {{being accused of}} the murder of Colonel José Parrales Sonriente. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be {{organizing}} a guerrilla attack on the President, but dies of a broken heart after reading a false news report detailing his daughter's wedding to Miguel Angel Face, at which the President was apparently present. The character of the General comes into clearer focus while he is on the road to exile. Canales's road to exile also introduces readers to the desperate financial situation of three sisters who are being taken advantage of by a doctor who visited their ailing mother. This episode demonstrates that corruption and malice exist not just in the capital city but also in rural villages.|$|E
