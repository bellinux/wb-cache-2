40|$|A simple {{procedure}} for rapid identification of Clostridium botulinum type A and B colonies from cultures and stool samples from <b>infants</b> with <b>botulism</b> was devised. The stool samples were directly streaked on C. botulinum isolation medium containing selective inhibitory agents. Typical lipase-positive colonies that appeared within 24 to 48 h were examined {{for the presence}} of botulinal toxin by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and conventional mouse toxicity test. The amount of toxin associated with 48 -h colonies of stock strains was comparable to that of 96 -h broth culture. The quantity of toxin present in a single colony or combination of two was shown to be sufficient for toxin detection by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of 42 additional stock strains tested in this manner, 41 (97. 5 %) were identified as toxigenic C. botulinum type A or B. The remaining one strain also proved to be toxigenic when it was tested as a concentrated cell suspension. This procedure should prove useful for large-scale serological screening of food and clinical specimens...|$|R
40|$|The toxin of Clostridium butyricum strains {{isolated}} from two <b>infants</b> with <b>botulism</b> is neutralized by antitoxin for type E botulinum toxin. This toxin {{and that of}} a C. botulinum type E strain were purified by the same protocol. Both toxins were Mr 145, 000 proteins which, when activated with trypsin, were composed of an H subunit of Mr 105, 000 and an L subunit of Mr 50, 000. The activated specific toxicity of purified butyricum toxin based on an intravenous assay was 2 X 10 (8) mouse 50 % lethal doses (LD 50 s) /mg of protein, but that based on an intraperitoneal assay was 7 X 10 (7) LD 50 s/mg, compared with 6 X 10 (7) LD 50 s/mg for type E toxin as determined by both methods. Immunodiffusion tests with antitoxin raised with type E toxin indicated that the two toxins were serologically very similar except for a spur formed by type E toxin. The close similarities of the two toxins suggest that toxigenic C. butyricum could arise when a wild-type strain, which is normally nontoxigenic, acquires the toxin gene of a C. botulinum type E strain...|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} form in Western {{countries}} is <b>infant</b> <b>botulism.</b> This occurs in infants who are colonized with the bacterium in the small intestine {{during the early stages}} of their lives. The bacterium then produces the toxin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. The consumption of honey {{during the first year of}} life has been identified as a risk factor for infant botulism; it is a factor in a fifth of all cases. The adult form of <b>infant</b> <b>botulism</b> is termed adult intestinal toxemia, and is exceedingly rare.|$|E
25|$|In adults, {{botulism}} can {{be treated}} by passive immunization with a horse-derived antitoxin, which blocks {{the action of the}} toxin circulating in the blood. A trivalent antitoxin containing antibodies raised against botulinum toxin types A, B, and E is used most commonly, however a heptavalent botulism antitoxin has also been developed and was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2013. In infants, horse-derived antitoxin is sometimes avoided for fear of infants developing serum sickness or lasting hypersensitivity to horse-derived proteins.

40|$|Botulism is a neuroparalytic {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} an acute, afebrile, symmetric descending flaccid paralysis. Although rare, botulism is a serious illness caused by a nerve toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. There are three kinds of botulism: 1 -Foodborne botulism is caused by eating foods that contain the botulism toxin. 2 -Wound botulism is caused by toxin produced from a wound infected with Clostridium botulinum. 3 -Infant botulism is caused by consuming the spores of the botulinum bacteria, which then grow in the intestines and release toxin. All forms of botulism can be fatal and are considered medical emergencies. The classic symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. <b>Infants</b> with <b>botulism</b> appear lethargic, feed poorly, are constipated, and have a weak cry and poor muscle tone. Agent • Toxicosis is due to botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, a grampositive bacillus which is a spore-forming obligate anaerobe. The toxin irreversibly blocks presynaptic release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction causing flaccid paralysis and cranial nerve dysfunction. There are many different toxin serotypes with different species and geographic distributions: type A causes the majority of foodborne cases in the western U. S.; type B causes {{the majority of cases}} in the eastern U. S.; type E causes most cases of foodborne botulism in Canada and Alaska which are associated with native foods; and type F causes rare foodborne cases in the U. S...|$|R
40|$|During 1985 - 2005, a {{total of}} 91 laboratory-confirmed {{outbreaks}} of foodborne botulism occurred in Canada; these outbreaks involved 205 cases and 11 deaths. Of the outbreaks, 75 (86. 2 %) were caused by Clostridium botulinum type E, followed by types A (7, 8. 1 %) and B (5, 5. 7 %). Approximately 85 % of the outbreaks occurred in Alaska Native communities, particularly the Inuit of Nunavik in northern Quebec and the First Nations population of the Pacific coast of British Columbia. These populations were predominantly exposed to type E botulinum toxin through the consumption of traditionally prepared marine mammal and fish products. Two botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (MAbs) {{were prepared}} against the putative binding domain of botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A), a nontoxic 50 -kDa fragment. Initially, all fusion products were screened against the holotoxin BoNT/A {{and against the}} binding fragment, BoNT/A HC. Eleven neutralizing hybridomas were cloned, and their specific binding to BoNT/A HC was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance, with dissociation constants ranging from 0. 9 to < 0. 06 nM. Epitope mapping by real-time surface plasmon resonance showed that the an-tibodies bound to at least two distinct regions of the BoNT/A HC fragment. These MAbs will be useful tools for studying BoNT/A interactions with its receptor, and they have potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum produces seven immunologically distinct but structurally similar neuro-toxins designated BoNT/A to BoNT/G {{that are associated with}} food-borne, <b>infant,</b> and wound <b>botulism</b> (12, 15, 16).

25|$|A {{recommended}} {{prevention measure}} for <b>infant</b> <b>botulism</b> {{is to avoid}} giving honey to infants less than 12 months of age, as botulinum spores are often present. In older children and adults the normal intestinal bacteria suppress development of C. botulinum.|$|E

2500|$|Botulism can {{be spread}} in several {{different}} ways. [...] The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. <b>Infant</b> <b>botulism</b> happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children {{less than six months}} old, as protective mechanisms develop after that time. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs.
