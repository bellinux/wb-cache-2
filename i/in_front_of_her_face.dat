5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears at a vanity, putting Curious on and {{earrings}} by Bulgari. She is then seen holding a top hat <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> while doves {{fly out of}} another hat. Spears starts singing in the vanity but stands up and puts on a ringmaster jacket. She walks through an aisle while dancing suggestively with several circus dancers. Throughout the video, there are interspersed scenes of different circus performers, including ribbon dancers, contortionists, clowns and a mime on stilts. There are also scenes of Spears singing with the top hat, wearing a nude body stocking {{in front of a}} red curtain, with a spotlight on her. This is followed by a group dance scene {{in the middle of a}} circus ring, where Spears wears the ringmaster jacket, sequined hot pants and a feathered top hat. In the second verse, she dances with a chair and a whip wearing a nude bra covered in leaves. The video continues with a series of intercut scenes, such as Spears in slow motion in front of a shower of sparks, her surrounded by a pair of lions and in front of an elephant. During the bridge, Spears and her dancers perform a routine in front of flames. In the last chorus, Spears returns to the circus ring, surrounded by two elephants, many more circus performers, dancers and fire breathers. The video ends with Spears in the spotlight, laughing with the top hat over her head.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} Stan {{and some of}} her male back-up dancers being {{presented}} in a dark white room. Subsequently, the room becomes enlightened and Stan is seen wearing transparent sunglasses, a white sweatband and a silver jacket. Following this, she retrieves a tennis racket from one of her background dancers and holds it <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> before returning the racket to a nearby dancer. Next, Stan performs the pre-refrain of the song, while two female performers clutch a hair dryer in their hands. For the refrain, she and ten other female background dancers are performing synchronized dances, with them having wigs on, and dressing white clothing and red accessories. Following this, Stan is presented standing on a yellow plate which is kept in the air by two threads. She wears a silver leotard and a multicolored wig. Next, Stan is shown walking into a tennis field, whereon she plays a tennis match against herself. For the breakdown of [...] "Cherry Pop", the video gets introduced into a dark-lighted room. There, [...] her previously shown male background dancers are presented; the video continues with Stan dancing accompanied by her dancers. The clip finally ends with a pink tennis ball dropping out of the ceiling, while the screen becomes black.|$|E

50|$|After dinner has ended, {{the mother}} {{gets up from}} the table and {{retrieves}} a trifle from a cabinet, which she holds up <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The camera then gets distorted and jerky, the view filling up with a variety of colorful, loud filters applied to the film. The family looks at the mother with a mixture of apprehension and excitement as the film gets more distorted and layered with effects.

50|$|Fairest {{explores the}} themes of self-image, self-acceptance, and {{societies}} beauty constructs {{within the framework of}} a fairy tale setting. Aza is described as unattractive—ugly even, and one can see the effects this label has on Aza. Her self-conscious demeanor and self-loathing are evident in her voice as a character. The way she holds her hand <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> out of habit and her anger when she is mocked show how other’s judgments are affecting her. Throughout the text we watch her begin to improve and respect herself, especially when Prince Ijori shows that he loves Aza despite her looks.|$|E

Jay swings his arm and Pamela's hair whips <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> that seems to imply he struck her, though she seems otherwise unaffected.|$|E

You know, I was really never anything to write home about. I was a plain girl. But Life magazine ran a picture calling me Gorgeous Gussie, and the British {{picked it up and}} did a real job with it. Then people would see me and I'd hear them say, 'I've seen better-looking waitresses at the hot-dog stand.' I just went to pieces. Emotionally, I couldn't handle it." ...|$|E

50|$|In A Beginner (1894) Broughton devises a young {{writer who}} has her work {{secretly}} published and then later torn apart by unknowing people right <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The novel deals with the moral issues of writing and whether it is appropriate for a young woman to write romantic or even erotic fiction. Scylla or Charybdis? (1895) has a mother hiding her infamous past from her son and obsessing about his love even {{to the extent of}} being jealous of other women, a plot to some extent anticipating Lawrence's Sons and Lovers (1913). The novel questions social conventions in revealing how destructive they can be to quiet people who might have once stepped aside from the proper path. In a different way the same criticism is being made in Foes in Law (1900), where the main question is which lifestyle is the one productive of the highest degree of happiness: the conventional one or one that accordings with private needs.|$|E
