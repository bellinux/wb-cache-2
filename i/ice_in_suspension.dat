40|$|We {{present a}} model for the growth of frazil ice {{crystals}} and their accumulation as marine ice at the base of Antarctic ice shelves. The model describes the flow of buoyant water upward along the ice shelf base and includes the differential growth of a range of crystal sizes. Frazil ice formation starts when the rising plume becomes supercooled. Initially, the majority of crystals have a radius of ∼ 0. 3 mm and concentrations are below 0. 1 g/L. Depending on the ice shelf slope, which controls the plume speed, frazil crystals increase in size and number. Typically, crystals up to 1. 0 mm in radius are kept in suspension, and concentrations reach a maximum of 0. 4 g/L. The frazil <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> decreases the plume density and thus increases the plume speed. Larger crystals precipitate upward onto the ice shelf base first, with smaller crystals following as the plume slows down. In this way, marine ice is formed at rates of up to 4 m/yr in some places, consistent with areas of observed basal accumulation on Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. The plume continues below the ice shelf {{as long as it is}} buoyant. If the plume reaches the ice front, its rapid rise produces high supercooling and the ice crystals attain a radius of several millimeters before reaching the surface. Similar ice crystals have been trawled at depth north of Antarctic ice shelves, but otherwise no observations exist to verify these first predictions of ice crystal sizes and volumes...|$|E

The present study investigated a possible association between principal attitudes toward zero tolerance and racial disparities <b>in</b> Virginia <b>suspension</b> practices. High school principals (n= 306) completed a state-mandated survey that included a Zero Tolerance Attitudes scale. Statistical analyses demonstrated significant differences between White and Black short-and long-term suspension rates.

Rationale There has been a national rise <b>in</b> school <b>suspensions,</b> a disciplinary practice associated with a host of negative outcomes (Skiba & Rausch, 2006).

40|$|First-year land-fast sea <b>ice</b> growth <b>in</b> {{both the}} Arctic and the Antarctic is characterised by the {{formation}} of an initial ice cover, followed by the direct freezing of seawater at the ice-water interface. Such growth usually results, through geometric selection, <b>in</b> congelation <b>ice.</b> This is, <b>in</b> general, the typical crystal structure observed <b>in</b> first-year <b>ice</b> growth <b>in</b> the Arctic. However, in certain regions of the Antarctic, platelet crystals are observed to contribute significantly to the ice growth, beyond a depth of 1 m. This thesis will investigate a number of ideas as to why the platelet crystals only appear <b>in</b> the <b>ice</b> after a significant amount of congelation growth has occurred. One of the key premises will be that platelet ice forms when smaller frazil crystals, beneath the ice, rise up and attach to the interface. They are then incorporated into the ice cover and become the platelets seen <b>in</b> <b>ice</b> cores. The Shields criterion is used to find the strength of turbulence, associated with tidal flow, required to keep a frazil crystal from adhering to the interface. It is shown that the sub-ice flow is sufficient to keep most crystals in motion. However, this turbulence may weaken or dissipate completely as the tide turns. The velocity associated with brine rejection is suggested as an alternative to keep the crystals <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> during these periods of low shear turbulence. Brine rejection occurs as the sea ice grows, rejecting salt into the seawater below. By comparing this velocity with a model for the frazil rise velocity it is shown that brine rejection has sufficient strength to keep crystals <b>in</b> <b>suspension.</b> This effect weakens as the ice gets thicker, allowing larger frazil crystals to rise to the interface. The early work in this thesis shows that a flow can keep a single crystal from adhering to the interface. This can be regarded as the competence of a flow to keep a crystal <b>in</b> <b>suspension.</b> However, of equal importance is the capacity of a flow to keep a mass of crystals <b>in</b> <b>suspension.</b> It is shown that, given a sufficiently large mass of crystals beneath the ice, the same flow that can hold a single crystal <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> {{will not be able to}} keep all the crystals in motion. The deposition of crystals is predicted to occur in a gradual manner if there is a steady build-up of crystals beneath the ice. The largest crystals, close to the interface, will settle against the ice as the flow is unable to support the entire mass of crystals Also considered is whether frazil crystals may be similar to cohesive sediments. If this is the case, a sudden influx of crystals from outside of the system may lead to {{the formation of}} a layer of unattached crystals beside the ice-water interface. This can cause a critical collapse of the turbulent field, resulting in the settling of a large quantity of frazil crystals. Though the emphasis of much of this thesis is on the effect of the flow on the crystals, it is also found that a mass of crystals can have a stabilising effect on the flow. The change in the density profile induced by an increase in the frazil concentration towards the ice-water interface (and hence a decrease in the density of the ice-water mixture) damps the turbulence produced by shear. The mass and size of crystals <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> play major roles in the strength of stabilisation. Measurements of turbulence and the suspension of frazil crystals beneath sea ice are difficult to make. This thesis aims to present and analyse a number of models which may explain the platelet puzzle - the delayed appearance of the platelet crystals <b>in</b> <b>ice</b> cores. These are compared with the observations which are available, and conclusions made on the validity of the theories presented...|$|R

Methods. The study of dielectric relaxation frequency of the water molecules in solutions of erythrocytes and erythrocyte ghosts was carried out with the method of measurements of an actual (ε′) and imaginary (ε′′) parts of complex dielectric permeability. The value of dielectric constant ε′ was defined by the measurement of the resonance frequency (Δf) of resonator with pattern relative to an empty resonator and the value ε′′ - by the value of damping of power of UHF field {{as a result of}} introduction of dielectric in resonator.

The samples were taken after 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours after elicitor treatment. The highest content of taxifolin production (0. 02 %) <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> culture of Silybum marianum L. (Gaertn.) after silver nitrate (5. 887. 10 - 4 mol/l) treatment and 72 h sampling was detected. The highest content of genistin (0. 05 %) <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> culture of Genista tinctoria L. was found after silver nitrate (5. 887. 10 - 4 mol/l) treatment and 48 h sampling. The highest content of daidzein (0. 09 %) was detected after elicitor (5. 887. 10 - 4 mol/l) treatment and 168 h sampling...|$|R
