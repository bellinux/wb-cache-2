5|$|The {{migration}} of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, {{has generally been}} described as occurring mainly in response to external environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> However, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{has been found to}} have a broad range of characteristics that are more often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. These are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic, solar and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.|$|E
5|$|With {{the many}} uncharted shoals and reefs, and {{frequent}} storms, the South China Seas remain {{some of the}} most dangerous waters in the world. Despite the continual use of a sounding lead, on 18 February 1817, Alceste grounded on one of the many hidden reefs in the Java Sea. Maxwell ordered the anchor dropped to prevent the ship from slipping into deeper water, an undesirable situation if the hull had been breached, {{which turned out to be}} the case. The pumps were unable to cope with the <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and the ship's carpenter, Cheffy, reported that Alceste was beyond repair.|$|E
25|$|San Diego–Tijuana is also {{subject to}} El Niño weather events. In extreme cases, the {{overwhelming}} fall of rain creates mudslides and greatly increases {{the flow of}} urban rivers.

5000|$|In {{the stage}} called a flad, the bay {{is still in}} {{continuous}} contact with the sea, but the <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> sea <b>water</b> is very slow and the impact <b>of</b> fresh <b>water</b> becomes more important. Often reeds and other water plants make the <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> sea <b>water</b> even slower. In its natural state a flad functions as a refugium for species of the order Charales that are seemingly endangered in more open waters. At this stage human beings often interfere by dredging the threshold or cutting down reeds to prevent the bay from becoming a flad.|$|R
40|$|Measurements <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{properties}} in the Great South Channel (GSC) made on 35 surveys between 1977 and 1985 indicate an intrusion <b>of</b> high salinity <b>water</b> {{in the autumn of}} most years. The intrusion represents an <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> slope <b>water.</b> It is most evident near bottom, but high salinity values are found throughout the water column. In some years the intrusion can be traced through the channel to the north side of Georges Bank. Larvae of offshore, warm-water fish species found in the high salinity intrusion support reports that the presence of these larvae is associated with an <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> slope <b>water</b> through the channel. The influx is likely {{to be associated with the}} seasonal shelfward movement of the shelf/slope front during the autumn. While the extent <b>of</b> the <b>influx</b> may be modified by Gulf Stream rings located south of the channel region, the phenomenon does not appear to be caused by rings. The <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> slope <b>water</b> across the shelf and to GSC suggests a seasonal reduction in the transport <b>of</b> Georges Bank <b>water</b> westward past Nantucket Shoals...|$|R
25|$|Elasmobranchs' {{ability to}} enter fresh water is limited because their blood is {{normally}} {{at least as}} salty (in terms of osmotic strength) as seawater through the accumulation of urea and trimethylamine oxide, but bull sharks living in fresh water show a significantly reduced concentration of urea within their blood. Despite this, the solute composition (i.e. osmolarity) of a bull shark in fresh water is still much {{higher than that of}} the external environment. This results in a large <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> across the gills due to osmosis and loss of sodium and chloride from the shark's body. However, bull sharks in fresh water possess several organs with which to maintain appropriate salt and water balance; these are the rectal gland, kidneys, liver, and gills. All elasmobranchs have a rectal gland which functions in the excretion of excess salts accumulated as a consequence of living in seawater. Bull sharks in freshwater environments decrease the salt-excretory activity of the rectal gland, thereby conserving sodium and chloride./K+-ATPase activity in gill, rectal gland, kidney and intestine|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B|year=2005|volume=175 |issue=1 |pages=37–44 |pmid=15565307|url=http://www.sciencecollege.com/sharklab/courses/elasmobiology/readings/pillans.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00360-004-0460-2}} The kidneys produce large amounts of dilute urine, but also {{play an important role in}} the active reabsorption of solutes into the blood. The gills of bull sharks are likely to be involved in the uptake of sodium and chloride from the surrounding fresh water, whereas urea is produced in the liver as required with changes in environmental salinity. Recent work also shows that the differences in density of fresh water to that of marine waters result in significantly greater negative buoyancies in sharks occupying fresh water, resulting in increasing costs of living in fresh water. Bull sharks caught in freshwater have subsequently been shown to have lower liver densities than sharks living in marine waters. This may reduce the added cost of greater negative buoyancy.|$|E

500|$|Now {{clear of}} the {{immediate}} danger of the ice, Riou {{found himself in a}} desperate situation. There was two feet of water in the hold and more was rushing in, while the sea was rising and a gale had sprung up. The pumps were manned, but could not keep up with the <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and by midnight there was 6 feet of water in the hold. At dawn on Christmas Day, an attempt was made to fother the hull, which involved lowering an oakum-packed studding sail over the side to cover the gash in the hull and slow the flooding. This was temporarily successful and by 11 o'clock the pumps had been able to reduce the water to a level of 19inches. The respite was short-lived, as the sail split under the pressure of the water and the water level began to rise again. [...] A number of seaman requested permission to take to the ship's boats. Riou convinced them to stay, but another attempt to fother the hull with another sail failed when the sail immediately ripped. By nightfall on 25 December, the water in the hold had risen to 7 feet, and the ship was rolling violently, allowing water to pour over the ship's side. Riou ordered the stores, guns and livestock to be thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten the ship, but was injured when his hand was crushed by a falling cask while trying to clear the bread-room. By morning the next day, the ship was settling by the stern, while the sails had been torn away in the gale. Again the seamen, this time joined by the convicts, requested to be allowed to take to the boats. Riou at last agreed to this, well aware that there were not enough boats for everyone, and announced 'As for me, I have determined to remain in the ship, and shall endeavour to make my presence useful {{as long as there is}} any occasion for it.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In Vegetable Staticks, Hales studied {{transpiration}} – {{the loss}} {{of water from the}} leaves of plants. He estimated the surface area of the leaves of the plant and the length and surface area of the roots. This allowed Hales to compare the calculated <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> into the plant with the amount of water leaving the plant by transpiration through the leaves. He also measured 'the force of the sap' or root pressure. Hales commented that [...] "plants very probably draw through their leaves some part of their nourishment from the air". In Vegetable Staticks Hales prefigured the cohesion theory of water movement in plants, although his ideas were not understood at the time, so he did not influence the debate on water transport in plants in the 19th century. He also speculated that plants might use light as a source of energy for growth (i.e. photosynthesis), based on Isaac Newton’s suggestion that [...] "gross bodies and light" [...] might be interconvertible.|$|E
