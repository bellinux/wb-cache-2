25|$|The very {{existence}} of the outer world seemed a base mockery, a cruel sham of some remembered possibility which had been glorious with a speechless beauty. I hated flowers, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen the enameled meads of Paradise; I cursed the rocks because they were mute stone, the sky because it rang with no music; and the earth and sky seemed to throw back my curse....|$|E
500|$|Coffin {{was born}} into a wealthy upper-class family in Scarborough, New York but grew up almost penniless, due to her father's death from {{complications}} of malaria when Marian was seven. During her childhood years, Coffin and her mother lived with relatives in Geneva, New York. She found the beautiful scenery of the area, set in the Finger Lakes of upper New York state, an inspiration; she later wrote, [...] "even as a small girl, I loved the country, not so much gardens and growing things, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no experience with these [...] [...] [...] but simply the great outdoor world." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1623, Charles I (then Prince of Wales) {{returned}} to Portsmouth from his travels in France and Spain. Five years later, Charles' unpopular military adviser, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, was {{stabbed to death}} in an Old Portsmouth pub by war veteran John Felton. Felton never attempted to escape and was caught walking through the streets when soldiers confronted him, to which he responded: [...] "I {{know that he is}} dead, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the force of forty men when I struck the blow". Felton was then hanged, and his body was chained to a gibbet on Southsea Common as a warning to others. The murder took place in the Greyhound public house on High Street, which is now private and called Buckingham House; it bears a commemorative plaque.|$|E

500|$|In {{the middle}} of the impasse Newman's health failed, and he died in November 1926 after a brief illness. Wood wrote, [...] "I feared {{everything}} would come to a standstill, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never so much as engaged an extra player without having discussed it with him first". Newman's assistant, W. W. Thompson, took over as manager of the orchestra and the concerts, but at this crucial point Chappells withdrew financial support for the Proms. After lengthy negotiations, the BBC took over from Chappells in 1927 as sponsor. The Proms were saved, and the hall continued to play host to celebrity concerts {{throughout the rest of the}} 1920s and the '30s, some promoted by the BBC, and others as hitherto by a range of choral societies, impresarios and orchestras. As Chappells owned the title [...] "New Queen's Hall Orchestra", the resident orchestra had to change its name once again and was now known as Sir Henry J. Wood's Symphony Orchestra.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, their {{relationship}} grew, as Augustine wrote, [...] "And I began to love him, of course, {{not at the}} first as a teacher of the truth, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> entirely despaired of finding that in thy Church—but as a friendly man." [...] Augustine visited Ambrose {{in order to see}} if Ambrose {{was one of the greatest}} speakers and rhetoricians in the world. More interested in his speaking skills than the topic of speech, Augustine quickly discovered that Ambrose was a spectacular orator. Eventually, Augustine says that he was spiritually led into the faith of Christianity.|$|E
2500|$|One author criticizes {{this theory}} as being [...] "problematic" [...] because [...] "Moroni {{makes it clear}} that he buried the plates in the {{vicinity}} of the Nephites' destruction, not [...] away in some remote region." [...] To support this assumption, it is postulated that Moroni buried the plates near the scene of the final battle and then returned 20 years later to retrieve them and add information to them before his final farewell, in which he states that his intention to [...] "seal up these records" [...] The assumption that Moroni hid the plates at the time of the final battle is based upon , in which Moroni states [...] "Therefore I will write and hide up the records in the earth; and whither I go it mattereth not." [...] Continued reading of the text reveals that Moroni abridged the Book of Ether and added it to the record after making this statement. Moroni later writes [...] "wherefore, I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life. Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I had supposed; <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> supposed not to have written any more." [...] (...) There is no explicit mention in the Book of Mormon of Moroni either having hidden the plates at the time of the final battle or having returned to this location to add more to them years later.|$|E
