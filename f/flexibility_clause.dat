40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} and analyse the use of <b>flexibility</b> <b>clauses</b> instead of overtime to adapt work time to demand in the automotive industry in continental Europe. Flexibility to adapt to demand has become critical in the automobile manufacturing industry. Variability {{of the number of}} hours worked by existing staff is an indispensable component of manufacturing flexibility. Outside continental Europe, work time flexibility is obtains basically by using overtime. In continental Europe, the desire of governments and unions to maintain staff, and even to distribute the work more, strongly limits the possible accumulation of work time by the same workers. Due to the global nature of the automotive industry, this disadvantage has to be compensated. This has been achieved by the simultaneous used of several <b>flexibility</b> <b>clauses,</b> particularly average working time accounted and working time accounts. These clauses are designed to respect and even favour the interest of workers. National collective agreements of two outstanding cases, Volkswagen in Germany and Renault in France are analysed. Numerical internal variability generated by the combination of clauses is calculated. Equal or greater flexibility is seen than with the use of overtime, considering intervals of one or several years, depending on the case. It is concluded that the <b>flexibility</b> <b>clauses</b> are effective substitutes for overtime...|$|R

50|$|An IFA {{is part of}} the Fair Work Act. Specifically, it is an {{agreement}} made between a single employer and an individual employee. This agreement alters some of the terms of an award or agreement and must leave the single employee “Better Off Overall” if signed. The power to make an IFA comes from the <b>flexibility</b> <b>clause</b> in the modern award. The Fair Work Act requires every Modern Award and Enterprise Agreement to include a <b>flexibility</b> <b>clause.</b> In theory this clause enables an employer and employee to agree on an IFA which varies the effect of the Modern Award or Enterprise Agreement so that it can “meet the genuine needs of the employer and that individual employee” in an individual context. To provide some level of protection, and differentiate them from the AWAs of the previous legislation, the IFA must satisfy the “Better Off Overall Test” and is limited in what conditions of employment it can alter. Under the Fair Work Act 2009 employers are prohibited from using undue influence or pressure, coercion, threats, discrimination or taking adverse action against an employee to make them sign. Nor can employers insist upon an employee agreeing to an IFA as a condition of employment or lose out on opportunities such as overtime or shifts with increased penalty rates attached.|$|E

40|$|Summary: With {{an eye on}} {{the changes}} of immense if not radical {{proportions}} that European integration has undergone in the past five years, are there any grounds for revisiting the process of flexible integration and using some of its potentials for the benefit of integration in the future? This is the main question of this article, the purpose of which, in contrast to the bulk of the literature in this field, is not so much to describe or conduct a textual analysis of the <b>flexibility</b> <b>clauses</b> of various treaties, but to understand the deeper or background reasons why flexibility in the EU has developed as it has. The article consists of three parts. The first part traces the historical development of flexible integration. This is followed by a study of the reasons why flexibility has remained on the margins of the integration process. Finally, having examined the EU’s relatively non-flexible past and the reasons for this, the focus moves to its present and future...|$|R
40|$|This article starts by {{summarising}} major theoretical debates regarding European polity and governance. It {{highlights the}} role of statehood in those debates and suggests moving beyond the constraints of institutionalist and constructivist perspectives by adopting specific notions from the theory of autopoietic social systems. The following part describes the EU political system as self-referential, functionally differentiated from the system of European law, and internally differentiated between European institutions and Member State governments. Although the Union transgresses its nation-state segmentation, the notions of statehood and democratic legitimacy continue to inform legal and political semantics of the EU and specific responses to the Union's systemic tensions, such as the policy of differentiated integration legislated by the <b>flexibility</b> <b>clauses.</b> The democratic deficit of instrumental legitimation justified by outcomes, the most recent example {{of which is the}} Lisbon Treaty, subsequently reveals the level of EU functional differentiation and the impossibility of fostering the ultimate construction of a normatively integrated and culturally united European polity. It shows a much more profound social dynamics of differentiation at the level of emerging European society—dynamics which do not adopt the concept of the European polity as an encompassing metaphor of this society, but makes it part of self-referential and self-limiting semantics of the functionally differentiated European political system...|$|R
40|$|Resumé The thesis {{deals with}} the {{exclusive}} powers of the European Union {{with a focus on}} legislative competencies. It is composed of four chapters; while deriving from Czech and foreign literature it contains theoretical view enriched by decisions of The European Court of Justice/The Court of Justice of The European Union. The first chapter focuses on the powers of the EU generally; it explains the term power and includes also the origin of the powers from historical and constitutional point of view. Corresponding with the principle of conferral explained in the chapter 1. 3, the will of the member states could be considered {{as the basis for the}} powers of the EU. The thesis deals also with the theory of implied powers and the <b>flexibility</b> <b>clause.</b> These are the ways to avoid the rigidity which might be represented by strict obeying the principle of conferral. The following chapter offers an overview of other types of powers and hints to their particularities in comparison to the group of exclusive powers. We are finding out that in case of shared competencies the member states can take action unless the blocking effect of the European regulations is applied while in other cases the EU has only a supporting function. The last two chapters which could be considered as the most important ones focus specifically on [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission’s recent {{proposal}} for a common European sales law was made in a political climate of rising nationalism. The Commission makes a solid economic and constitutional (legal basis) case for its proposal. However, its argument, which focuses exclusively on the internal market, {{is not likely to}} fully convince the opposition. The reason is that it fails to address the widespread notion, underlying also many technical arguments, that Member States should remain sovereign in matters of general private law for the reason that private law is a matter of national identity. In this paper, I address that argument head on. I do this by first identifying the nationalist undertone in many technical arguments raised against the Europeanisation of private law and by then defending the CESL as an expression of another identity that many Europeans share, ie their European identity. I argue, in particular, that the proposed CESL should be welcomed as a common European model of justice between private parties, as rules of just conduct for the internal market. Since most people in Europe identify with both their nation-state and Europe, albeit in different degrees, it makes sense to offer them the choices between national and European contract law. Although the question whether to opt into a CESL should be a matter of private autonomy, the question which legal options will be available is matter of the public autonomy of citizens and requires a full democratic legitimation. Therefore, Article 352 TFEU, the <b>flexibility</b> <b>clause</b> that bypasses the ordinary legislative procedure, would be unacceptable as a legal basis...|$|E
40|$|With {{the growing}} trend of {{privatisation}} and commercialisation of space activities, states have deemed {{the adoption of}} national space legislation the most suitable way to regulate and control private space initiatives {{in order to ensure}} compliance with international space law principles. Several states have thus far enacted national space laws, which diverge in their substances. Considering these differences in national space laws, the idea of regulatory competition is discussed and is contrasted with harmonisation of national space legislation. While harmonisation is explicitly excluded in the European Union’s space competence, there seem to be other ways to provide a more centralised approach to space legislation in Europe. These include the use of different legal bases, non-binding measures, the ‘enhanced cooperation’ mechanism, the ‘approximation of laws’ basis, the <b>flexibility</b> <b>clause</b> ex article 352 TFEU, and the ‘open method of coordination’. Harmonisation in this context can be desirable when keeping objectives such as the prevention of ‘flags of convenience’ and ‘forum shopping’ phenomena, increased technical safety through the harmonisation of quality standards, mutual cross-border recognition of authorisations, and increased consistency in the interpretation of international space law, in mind. The harmonisation of the registration of space objects should be encouraged as to ensure that all necessary information about space activities is transparently available. On the other hand, aspects like the national political sensitivity of space activities and the diversity in market characteristics in the space sector, contradict harmonisation. Current discretionary powers of states with regard to licensing, export control, and other regulatory aspects could make these states more reluctant to opt for harmonisation in these areas. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This Policy Brief {{offers an}} {{in-depth}} {{review of the}} Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and looks at whether the margins of flexibility within existing rules are sufficient in the current climate of low growth, or {{whether there is a}} need to broaden them. The issue is especially relevant as the changing economic environment is raising fresh questions about whether the EU’s current common economic policies are able to manage dismal growth and low inflation. The fragile state of confidence in financial markets and the unresolved but inevitable questions of moral hazard linked to lax fiscal policies mean that no large-scale fiscal expansion to support the recovery of economic activity is feasible. The discussion may therefore only concern the scope within the SGP to accommodate an unexpected drop in economic activity and to provide room for the implementation of structural reforms. Here, we analyse the <b>flexibility</b> <b>clauses</b> of the Stability and Growth Pact under three headings; namely “exceptional circumstances”, “structural reforms and other relevant factors”, and the “investment clause”. Recommendation: Our main conclusion is that the SGP contains sufficient flexibility to accommodate an unexpected drop in economic activity and has the margins needed to finance structural reforms during the transition to the new regime. We therefore see no need to change the existing rules of the SGP. We believe that the ongoing debate about a fresh growth strategy for the eurozone and the European Union would greatly benefit from removing from the Council table ill-formulated and unnecessary demands for greater flexibility in the SGP...|$|R
40|$|Cet article vise à appréhender la réalité québécoise en matière d'évolution des modes de rémunération et des {{structures}} de salaire négociés par les syndicats et les employeurs en mettant en évidence les changements qui se sont produits dans les conventions collectives depuis 1980. This {{article examines}} the evolution of compensation and wage structures in unionized Quebec workplaces. Drawing on a study of 200 collective agreements, the article investigates changes to wage and compensation clauses since 1980. Assuming that employers in unionized settings {{are looking for ways}} of increasing financial and functional flexibility, the author puts forward three hypotheses : 1 - Financial (pay) flexibility induces union-management bargaining over compensation Systems. Compensation moves away from seniority-based determination and towards individualized pattems based on organizational performance. 2 - Financial flexibility also accelerates bargaining over wage determination and progression structures, the costs of which are spread over longer periods of time than previously. 3 - Functional flexibility promotes negotiation and review of wage structures with a decline in salary grades and in employment levels. The author concludes that financial flexibility has not led to bargaining over compensation Systems. To the contrary, wage structures are remarkably stable and only rarely are individual financial incentives agreed upon and made part of collective agreements. Moreover, wages remain tied to specifie job contents rather than to individual abilities, performance and know-how. Collective bargaining over wages in Quebec thus remains within the scientific management model and has not moved towards a humanistic vision of work, still less towards strategie compensation. Many factors explain these conclusions. On the one hand, the research hypothesis rests on the postulate that employers are pursuing organizational flexibility as a means to remain competitive. This may, however, not be the case for unionized segments of the workforce. Consequently, we would not find financial flexibility structures in collective agreements. On the other hand, Quebec unions have strategies in this regard which may prevent the growth of <b>flexibility</b> <b>clauses</b> in collective agreements. The two major labour organizations in the province, the CSN and the FTQ, have clear policies over workplace flexibility. Both favour wage structures tied to job definition and content rather than to the attributes of individual workers. Such a strategy is consistent with rules designed for tightly defined jobs supported by the seniority principle for progression in wage scales. In short, union strategy remains wedded the goal of wage security and Quebec unions appear more willing to accept a decline in real wages than to support changes to the structure of wage determination. These findings suggest a tendency for unions and management to change wage scales {{in such a way that}} the cost of compensation is spread over a longer period of time than previously. Employers' obvious rationale is to lower labour costs in the short and in the long term. In those workplaces where wage and compensation structures have been the object of review by the parties, these do not seem to be part of a process of increasing functional flexibility. Job enlargement and multiskilling are not part of the redesign of salary structures. The author finds little evidence of change in the number of occupational and job classifications. Rules setting boundaries between tasks and barriers between trades remain dominant features of Quebec collective agreements. The author points out two limitations of this study. First, the analysis is restricted to those collective agreements registered with the Bureau du Commissaire general du travall and thus excludes flexible arrangements made by the parties outside the realm of collective bargaining (functional, gain-sharing, profit-sharing, so on). Second, the sample of agreements excludes workplaces for which no collective agreement existed in 1980. First collective agreements concluded in the last 3 or 6 years may include such financial and functional flexibility provisions. A study of these union management agreements could best measure if age-history of collective relationships is a significant determinant of changes in work rules towards more flexibility...|$|R

40|$|The Treaty of Amsterdam {{allows for}} the first time a smaller group of European Union Member States to move ahead on their own towards closer {{integration}} leaving others in their wake. This opens up for a new EU developing at different speeds inside one broad institutional framework. The concept of flexibility was designed to simplify EU decision making as it prepares for enlargement implicitly assuming that it would be even more difficult to reach agreements with 30 countries, than with the current 15. Yet, the final provision on "closer co-operation" turned out a hybrid legal construction, complex in reading and even more difficult to apply in practice. How come the EU crafted an incomprehensible legal tool in order to facilitate EU-business? To shed light on this paradox, my thesis raises two key questions. Firstly, why did the concept of flexibility come into existence and secondly, why did the concept get its complex shape? In the search of plausible answers to the first question, I draw upon two different theoretical frameworks; Multi-Level Governance (MLG) and Liberal intergovernmentalism (LI). The former claims that supranational actors notably the Commission was a key-architect behind flexibility either to enhance its own influence in Community decision making or to guard a shared set of European values and norms. The LI-perspective, on the other hand, suggests that flexibility is a result of efforts of Member States more precisely; a means to accommodate domestically defined preferences. I also apply two distinct theoretical frameworks on my second question; the garbage can-perspective and LI-ideas of rational bargaining theory. The former points to the importance of learning throughout the process of bargaining in other words that the stances of different actors with regards to flexibility were shaped as the 1996 - 97 intergovernmental negotiations proceeded. The latter, on the other hand, claims that the complex legal system of flexibility was a predictable outcome given the multitude of interests and asymmetrical interdependence inside and between the major Member States. From this angle, the <b>flexibility</b> <b>clause</b> reflect a search of all governments involved for the most efficient means of identifying and realising their own stable sets of preferences defined domestically prior to the flexibility process culminating at Amsterdam. With regards to the first question, my empirical findings discredit the MLG-perspective suggesting that the Commission was a key architect behind flexibility. On the contrary, its role came out as extremely cautious and it hesitated as long as it could before it hesitantly gave the concept a modest support. The major reason was that it was in two minds about flexibility; on one hand, it sympathised with those countries that wanted to move ahead faster than the rest, on the other, it did not want to disrupt the Community principle of unity. Accordingly, it stepped aside and left the floor to the Member States. This observation confirms yet again the applicability of liberal intergovernmentalist ideas rather suggesting that the major Community members triggered the emerging claim of institutionalised flexibility. In line with their distinct national preferences, notably Germany, France and Britain started calling for differentiated integration as part of general Community law. Accordingly, the controversial subject appeared on the agenda for the 1996 - 97 IGC. Yet, and also in line with their distinct national preferences, the major Member States claimed very different variants of flexibility. This would prove to affect the outcome strongly as the flexibility process went from agenda setting to decision-shaping stage and the actual clause was being formed. Therefore, and in search for answers to my second major question, I ask whether the complex <b>flexibility</b> <b>clause</b> was the result of a learning process, where the major players modified their position as the negotiations proceeded. My empirical observations indicate that the answer is no. Instead, the complex web of rules in the provision on closer co-operation was a predictable outcome, a lowest common denominator reflecting at the outset conflictual domestically defined preferences. This confirms LI-ideas of rational bargaining theory, developed by Andrew Moravcsik...|$|E
40|$|FROM EUROPEAN POLITICAL CO-OPERATION TO A COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY. TOWARDS A COMMON EUROPEAN SECURITY COMPLEX? A {{study of}} the EU s foreign and {{security}} policy. A neofunctionalist perspective The study focuses on two research questions: 1) To what extent will {{the absence of a}} bipolar structure have implications for the EU s development of a common foreign and security policy? 2) To what extent will the EU in a post-cold war era play {{a leading role in the}} creation of a new security system in Europe? In respect to the security interests in a bipolar international structure it was almost impossible for the Western European countries to create a potent European security arrangement. The Western European countries had to defend their interests within an Atlantic framework, particularly through NATO. However, already in the 1970 s the member states of the European Union started to redefine their security interests in order to act as a single actor in international politics. The creation of the European Political Co-operation (EPC) in 1970 must be regarded as an expression of the growing dissatisfaction with the hegemonic role of the US in the Euro-Atlantic relationship. Several proposals and initiatives, such as the Copenhagen reports (1973), the Tindemanns report (1975) and the London report (1981), indicated a movement towards a new security complex. The institutional change, seen in the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty incorporated high politics on the same level as low politics within a single Community framework. In the light of the revolutionary changes of the past ten years, the idea of a common European foreign and security policy is no longer a taboo. In a transformative period towards a new security arrangement, the European Union will play an essential role, according to its soft-power capabilities. In the new international system the concept of security have to be defined by criteria different from traditional military capabilities. The EU role as the chief provider of further integration is crucial for such a new concept of security. As a theoretical framework I have conceptualised the "new" Europe as a set of "concentric circles" picturing Europe encompassing subsets of states on different levels of integration. The "circle of shared law" includes the EU Member States while the "adjacent circles" include the applicant countries outside the Union or countries with different co-operation agreements with the EU. In this new Europe both the Member States of the Union and the peripheral countries will define the EU as the primary security and defence institution in Europe. In the process leading up to a new security arrangement in Europe, it is important to clarify the division of labour between the existing security institutions; the EU, NATO and WEU. Which institutions are best suited to build a genuine European security and defence identity in order to constitute a new security complex? Diverging national interests have so far prevented any agreement on this point. Whereas France and Germany stress the importance of a operational security and defence capacity within the EU, Great Britain defines its security interests within the traditional Atlantic framework. As a consequence, the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) is still at the bottom of a learning curve. If European foreign policy is to achieve greater effectiveness, several features of the present arrangements would need to be altered. In the Maastricht Treaty, Article J. 4 provides for the extension of the CFSP to all questions relating to security, including the possible evolution of a common defence policy and a common defence. The United States and its continued role in Europe through NATO and the OSCE will have cociderable impact on the attainment of this goal. In respect to the new security challenges, NATO had to be internally transformed. The concept of Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTF) was a major contribution towards this end, although the question of leadership in the new Atlantic relationship remains unsettled. European demands for more equality have been met with reluctance from the US government. Likewise, the realisation of Article J 4 will depend on the EU member states conception of success and failure, in meeting existing challenges on and out of their own continent. The Gulf war and the Bosnian-conflict showed the EU incapable of reaching common position or common action in high politics. The objective of a European foreign policy has always been expressed on paper in grandiose terms, and Maastricht is no exception. Yet the procedures followed this far have been designed to co-ordinate the policies of the member states rather than forming a truly integrated European policy. The substantial national differences regarding the EUs role in foreign and security politics, caused French and German demands for major reforms to intensify the integration process. In order to constitute a new security complex, I have argued that further integration is crucial. Otherwise the new system could lead to a renationalisation of the Member States foreign and security policy. The different national policies have raised the question of differentiated integration in order to improve the effectiveness of EU foreign policy. As argued in this thesis, the possibility of a multi-speed or inner core EU raises questions as to whether the outer core members will catch up and join the inner core, how the process of decision-making will operate, and what relations should be between the inner and outer core. The 1996 - 97 Intergovernmental Conference included, as an agenda item, a set of proposals for "enhanced co-operation". In the Amsterdam Draft Treaty, a <b>flexibility</b> <b>clause</b> is to be incorporated as a new Title in the Common Provisions of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU). However, the integration process, regardless of its form, has to take into consideration the concept of legitimacy. Whether an inner core Europe would be desirable is a matter of debate. Without legitimacy from the Member States not included and the other peripheral states, the multi-speed Europe might have a divisive and fragmenting effect on the future development of the EU, rather than acting as a force for dynamism and cohesion...|$|E
