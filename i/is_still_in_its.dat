Mulder and Tskany hurry to the Parker ranch. After firing on the creature which escapes unharmed, Mulder finds Scully hiding upstairs. They search for the creature, and as it lunges to attack them, Tskany shoots it. Scully expresses disbelief on seeing Parker’s body, saying that Parker was in the bathroom, sick, {{and then they were}} attacked by the mountain lion. But Tskany says that the lion <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> cage.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{findings}} correlating mirror neuron {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans exhibit {{an alarm}} response, {{typical of many}} higher level eusocial Hymenoptera. Although it has been {{previously}} indicated that nest mates may alarm {{the rest of the}} nest through jerky movement and buzzing of wings, Polistes exclamans is capable of alarming the rest of the nest and attracting attacking wasps through chemical means by releasing a non-species-specific venomous alarm pheromone. Although a chemical signal to warn against attack would be evolutionarily adaptive, the Polistes exclamans only releases a response post the initial attack from and on the predator, as the venom is only released during the sting. This venom is capable of warning and coordinating a response from the nest and attracting nearby heterospecific or conspecific females from nearby colonies to attack the predator. This helps deter the predator from further attacking and is especially adaptive for the defense of the nest. Although certain other insects have been able to adapt the release of the pheromone to other means of communicating alarm, Polistes exclamans has yet to do so, indicating that it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> “primitive state in evolution of the complex systems of communication of alarm seen in higher social insects.” In one experiment, pheromones were extracted from female glands and sacs and were spread onto venom paper. It was then found that females were attracted upwind of the venom paper and some even attempted to sting it. This also had a heterospecific response where others also reacted to it. While it was found that one wasp couldn’t release enough pheromones to elicit a response, if many individuals were alarmed they would elicit a response {{from the rest of the}} nest. However, this scent is not strong enough to reach other nests, and so neighboring nests must be alarmed by physical movements and wing flapping.|$|E
5|$|The Anthony Roll was {{originally}} {{a set of}} three separate vellum rolls. It exists today {{in the form of}} a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of 70cm (27 ½ inches) and a height varying from 79 to 96cm (31 to 37 ¾ inches). After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as Pepys 2991. The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the rolls. This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the Henry Grace à Dieu, Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls. The second roll, British Library Additional MS 22047, <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing.|$|E
