5|$|Ambulance {{services}} that have historical origins {{such as the}} Order of St John, the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps and Malteser International often use the Maltese cross to identify their ambulances.

5|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{was formerly}} the second-most common {{mode of transmission}} for Chagas disease, but {{the development and implementation}} of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century. Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding <b>in</b> <b>countries,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.|$|E
5|$|Child {{marriage}} (including {{union or}} cohabitation) {{is defined as}} marriage {{under the age of}} eighteen and is an ancient custom. In 2010 it was estimated that 67 million women, then, in their twenties had been married before they turned eighteen, and that 150 million would be in the next decade, equivalent to 15 million per year. This number had increased to 70 million by 2012. In developing countries one third of girls are married under age, and 1:9 before 15. The practice is commonest in South Asia (48% of women), Africa (42%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (29%). The highest prevalence is in Western and Sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of girls married before the age of eighteen is as high as 75% <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Niger (Nour, Table I). Most child marriage involves girls. For instance in Mali the ratio of girls to boys is 72:1, while <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the United States the ratio is 8:1. Marriage may occur as early as birth, with the girl being sent to her husbands home as early as age seven.|$|E

5|$|Dengue {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} via infected blood products and through organ donation. <b>In</b> <b>countries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Singapore, where dengue is endemic, the risk {{is estimated to be}} between 1.6 and 6 per 10,000 transfusions. Vertical transmission (from mother to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported. Other person-to-person modes of transmission have also been reported, but are very unusual. The genetic variation in dengue viruses is region specific, suggestive that establishment into new territories is relatively infrequent, despite dengue emerging in new regions in recent decades.|$|E
5|$|Fire or Police Linked Service – <b>In</b> <b>countries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and France {{ambulances}} can {{be operated}} by the local fire or police service, more commonly the fire service due to overlapping calls. This is particularly common in rural areas, where maintaining a separate service is not necessarily cost effective, or by service preference such as in LA where the LAFD prefers to handle all parts of emergency medicine in-house. In some cases {{this can lead to}} an illness or injury being attended by a vehicle other than an ambulance, such as a fire truck.|$|E
5|$|Following its ratings success, What Not to Wear was {{promoted}} from BBC Two to BBC One in 2004, and secured even larger audiences.

5|$|Government Ambulance Service – Operating {{separately}} from (although alongside) {{the fire and}} police service of the area, these ambulances are funded by local or national government.

In Canada ambulance services are normally operated by local municipalities or provincial health agencies as a separate entity from fire or police services.|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} The Shock Doctrine, author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedman's {{economic}} liberalism, identifying {{it with the}} principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Chile and Argentina. Based on their assessments {{of the extent to}} which what she describes as neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality, both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) {{lists the}} serval as least concern; {{the animal is}} also {{included}} in CITES Appendix II.

Pastoralists often kill servals to protect their animals, though servals generally do not prey upon livestock.|$|E

5|$|With the {{republic}} suffering heavy losses after the war, Stalin allowed an open immigration policy in Armenia; the diaspora {{were invited to}} repatriate to Armenia (nergaght) and revitalize the country's population and bolster its workforce.
