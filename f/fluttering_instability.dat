40|$|The {{coupling}} {{between the}} motion of a solid body and {{the dynamics of the}} surrounding flow is essential to the understanding {{of a large number of}} engineering and physical problems, from the stability of a slender structure exposed to the wind to the locomotion of insects, birds and fishes. Because of the strong coupling on a moving boundary of the equations for the solid and fluid, the simulation of such problems is computationally challenging and expensive. This justifies the development of simplified models for the fluid-solid interactions to study their physical properties and behavior. This dissertation proposes a reduced-order model for the interaction of a sharp-edged solid body with a strongly unsteady high Reynolds number flow. In such a case, viscous forces in the fluid are often negligible compared to the fluid inertia or the pressure forces, and the thin boundary layers separate from the solid at the edges, leading to the shedding of large and persistent vortices in the solid's wake. A general two-dimensional framework is presented based on complex potential flow theory. The formation of the solid's vortical wake is accounted for by the shedding of point vortices with unsteady intensity from the solid's sharp edges, and the fluid-solid problem is reformulated exclusively as a solid-vortex interaction problem. In the case of a rigid solid body, the coupled problem is shown to reduce to a set of non-linear ordinary differential equations. This model is used to study the effect of vortex shedding on the stability of falling objects. The solid-vortex model is then generalized to study the <b>fluttering</b> <b>instability</b> and non-linear flapping dynamics of flexible plates or flags. The <b>fluttering</b> <b>instability</b> and resulting flapping motion result from the competing effects of the fluid forcing and of the solid's flexural rigidity and inertia. Finally, the solid-vortex model is applied to the study of the fundamental effect of bending rigidity on the flapping performance of flapping appendages such as insect wings or fish fin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{different}} types of instabilities of free cylinders (diameter D, length L) have been studied in a viscous flow (velocity U) between parallel vertical walls of horizontal width W at a distance H: {{the influence of the}} confinement parameters D/H and L/W has been investigated. As D/H increases, there is a transition from stable flow to oscillations transverse to the walls and then to a fluttering motion with oscillations of the angle of the axis with respect to the horizontal. The two types of oscillations may be superimposed in the transition domain. The frequency f of the transverse oscillations is independent of the lateral confinement L/W in the range: 0. 055 < L/W < 0. 94 for a given cylinder velocity V_cx and increases only weakly with V_cx. These results are accounted for by assuming a 2 D local flow over the cylinder with a characteristic velocity independent of L/W for a given V_cx value.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new {{numerical}} scheme for the simulation of deformable objects {{immersed in a}} viscous incompressible fluid. The two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are discretized with an efficient Fourier pseudo-spectral scheme. Using the volume penalization method arbitrary inflow conditions can be enforced, together with the no-slip conditions at the boundary of the immersed flexible object. With respect to Kolomenskiy and Schneider (2009) [1], where rigid moving obstacles have been considered, the present work extends the volume penalization method to account for moving deformable objects while avoiding numerical oscillations in the hydrodynamic forces. For the solid part, a simple and accurate one-dimensional model, the non-linear beam equation, is employed. The coupling between the fluid and solid parts is realized with a fast explicit staggered scheme. The method {{is applied to the}} <b>fluttering</b> <b>instability</b> of a slender structure immersed in a free stream. This coupled non-linear system can enter three distinct states: stability of the initial condition or maintenance of an either periodic or chaotic fluttering motion. We present a detailed parameter study for different Reynolds numbers and reduced free-stream velocities. The dynamics of the transition from a periodic to a chaotic state is investigated. The results are compared with those obtained by an inviscid vortex shedding method [2] and by a viscous linear stability analysis [3], yielding for both satisfactory agreement.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the reduced}} {{separation}} between vertical and torsional natural modes, bridges with central spans beyond 1000 - 1500 m {{have to be}} designed with sophisticated aero-dynamic criteria, so that <b>flutter</b> <b>instability</b> happens at appropriately high wind speed. In order to obtain decks with adequate behavior under wind loads, refined metallic carpentries (e. g. boxes with curved shapes) have to be adopted. In fact, although streamlined decks {{are known to be}} an effective solution against classical <b>flutter</b> <b>instabilities,</b> sophisticated numerical and ex-perimental techniques to obtain an adequate aerodynamic optimization are often necessary, increasing the unit cost of the deck elements. The aim of the research proposed in this paper is to present some preliminary bridge designs, for which it is possible to obtain a total inhibi-tion of the classical <b>flutter</b> <b>instability</b> mechanism in the wind speed range of interest. The ba-sic idea is to avoid classical flutter by inverting the vertical bending and the torsional natural frequencies of the lower modes with similar shapes, that is to obtain torsional-to-vertical bending frequency ratios lower than one. This can be done by modifying the mass distribution over the deck with respect to the position of the suspension cables.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two fluid-structure {{interaction}} effects in thin, flexible disks: the aeroelastic <b>flutter</b> <b>instability</b> of rotating disks in an unbounded fluid, and the hydrodynamic impedances for small vibrations of stationary disks. ^ Rotating disks experience the aeroelastic <b>flutter</b> <b>instability</b> beyond a threshold rotation speed called the flutter speed. To predict the <b>flutter</b> <b>instability,</b> a stability {{analysis of a}} rotating Kirchhoff plate coupled to a compressible inviscid fluid is performed, via an eigenvalue perturbation technique combined with a semi-analytical/boundary element solution for the fluid flow. The analysis predicts that a structurally un-damped disk destabilizes at its lowest critical speed. With material damping, the flutter speeds become supercritical and increase with decreasing fluid density. The competing effects of ground-fixed radiation damping into the surrounding fluid and co-rotating disk material damping control the onset of flutter. ^ Experiments on the post-flutter behavior of disks rotating in an unbounded fluid are presented next. The existence of a primary <b>instability</b> at the <b>flutter</b> speed of a reflected traveling wave, followed by secondary instabilities and complicated nonlinear behavior, is observed. A rotating von Kármán plate coupled to a linear rotating damping is employed to quantitatively capture the primary instability branch. ^ This thesis also presents the hydrodynamics of stationary disks vibrating with small amplitudes. A three-dimensional finite element model predicts the viscous impedances, whereas a boundary element method predicts the acoustic impedances. The computed nondimensional impedances, consisting of damping and added mass, encompass disks spanning multiple length scales, operating frequencies and fluidic environments. For a given clamping ratio and vibration mode, the nondimensional viscous impedance depends on the ratio of unsteady fluid inertia to viscous fluid stresses, while the nondimensional acoustic impedance depends on the ratio of structural to acoustic wavelengths. Typically, viscous effects dominate at low frequencies. This suggests that for the low frequency wave destabilized at the flutter speed of a rotating disk, viscous rather than acoustic damping is the dominating fluidic influence causing <b>flutter</b> <b>instability.</b> An alternative spectral solution for the fluid flow around a non-rotating disk is developed.
