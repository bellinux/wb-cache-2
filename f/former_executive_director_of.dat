Elsa Maxwell was given the primary responsibility in organizing it. It was initially held annually in April, but according to Ann Vaccaro, <b>former</b> <b>executive</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> the ball, it was changed to October because [...] "Mr. Philippe decided that {{because there are so many}} balls in the spring he would make it in October".

The ball was designed to cater for [...] "very, very high-class people" [...] according to Vaccaro. Raffle tickets cost US$100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US$5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes and even cars. It attracted many of the most famous people of the day, including Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich. By the mid 1970s his balls were charging $185 per person; the 1974 ball netted roughly $175,000. During his career at the Waldorf Astoria it has been estimated that Philippe was responsible for his clients spending $150 million alone on banquets.|$|E
