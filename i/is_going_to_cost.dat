6000|$|... "The thing's not {{big enough}} to worry over, but I have been {{thinking}} some. We have struck no gold in the adit, and now when we're waiting for the props the Englishman has dropped the rope into the ca√±on. That little contract <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> him considerable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{get into}} a rage," [...] he said. [...] "If I'm {{willing to put up}} with it, I suppose you needn't cry out. All I meant was that when you tell me a thing <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> so much, I like to--well, in fact, I--like to know where I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, look here, Rectus," [...] said I; [...] "this thing <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> {{too much}} money. That rope was expensive, and the grapnel cost {{a good deal}} more than we thought it would; and now you want a big pot of black paint. We mustn't spend our money too fast, and if we've got to economize, let's begin on black paint. You can write your {{proclamation}} on paper, and stick it on the door with tacks. They could send that easier to the President than they could send a whole door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These two wells <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> {{us about}} seventy {{thousand}} dollars," [...] Jack's father confided to him. [...] "It's a mint of money, isn't it?" [...] {{and he smiled}} slightly.|$|R

We have got to take supplies for at least a month, if not two months. And I don't {{want to live in a}} tent when it gets good and cold. We've got to build a shack of some sort. There will be a hundred and one things to do before we are ready to start. And it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> something, too." ...|$|E
60|$|In German streets {{you must}} not shoot with a crossbow. The German law- maker does not content himself with the misdeeds of the average man--the crime one feels one wants to do, but must not: he worries himself imagining all the things a {{wandering}} maniac might do. In Germany {{there is no law}} against a man standing on his head {{in the middle of the}} road; the idea has not occurred to them. One of these days a German statesman, visiting a circus and seeing acrobats, will reflect upon this omission. Then he will straightway set to work and frame a clause forbidding people from standing on their heads in the middle of the road, and fixing a fine. This is the charm of German law: misdemeanour in Germany has its fixed price. You are not kept awake all night, as in England, wondering whether you will get off with a caution, be fined forty shillings, or, catching the magistrate in an unhappy moment for yourself, get seven days. You know exactly what your fun <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> you. You can spread out your money on the table, open your Police Guide, and plan out your holiday to a fifty pfennig piece. For a really cheap evening, I would recommend walking on the wrong side of the pavement after being cautioned not to do so. I calculate that by choosing your district and keeping to the quiet side streets you could walk for a whole evening on the wrong side of the pavement at a cost of little over three marks.|$|E

5000|$|A year later, the MHRD {{announced}} that the low-cost computer would be launched in six weeks. Nine weeks later, the MHRD showcased a tablet named [...] "Aakash", not nearly what had been projected and at US$60 rather than the projected $35.

5000|$|An outspoken {{advocate}} for metro-area schools, White helped filibuster a state aid reduction {{bill that would}} have disproportionately impacted his constituents.

Even though he continues {{to remain in the}} idol agency's employ, he continues to worry about it to extreme lengths, even developing a song of his own called [...] "The Worry Blues" [...] as a running gag.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{believed}} that before delivering his dissenting opinion, Justice Khanna had mentioned to his sister: [...] "I have prepared my judgment, which <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> me the Chief Justice-ship of India."In January 1977, Justice Khanna was superseded despite being the most senior judge {{at the time and}} thereby Government broke the convention of appointing only the senior most judge to the position of Chief Justice of India.Justice Khanna remains a legendary figure among the legal fraternity in India for this decision.|$|E

It had great plans for a {{downtown}} campus that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> around $1 billion. I think we missed some great opportunities to invest in our post-secondary education systems; instead, we frittered away our money.

So it is hardly to be wondered at if the sight of it did not reconcile him to the joys of early rising.|$|R
5000|$|... "The A-12 I did terminate. It {{was not an}} easy {{decision}} to make because it's an important requirement that we're trying to fulfill.

And data that had been presented at one point a few months ago turned out to be invalid and inaccurate." [...] Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, 1991.|$|R
50|$|At Powers' trial, {{the defense}} springs June as a {{surprise}} witness, forcing her {{to admit that she}} could see the killer but didn't see the murder and didn't recognize Powers. Shocking his assistants, Cardigan decides not to cross-examine her. Powers laughs heartily, stopping Cardigan in his tracks. The Attorney General then withdraws his waiver, whispering ‚Äúthat laugh <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> you your neck‚Äù to Powers and promptly badgers and confuses June so that she blurts out an identification of Powers as the killer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{members of}} Parliament [...] "felt {{the greatness of}} the price that a peace so {{desirable}} <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> France, their dignity absolutely dedicated {{to the defense of}} the order venerable for its antiquity and still more respectable by its wisdom, which for so many centuries, defers the crown to a single and necessary heir, that their feelings were suspended at first between the desire for peace and the fear of violating {{for the first time the}} law to which France owes a large line of kings and the longest monarchy which the world had ever seen." ...|$|E

When {{the time came to}} actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only nod in assent, unable to verbalize the order. The assault, known as Pickett's Charge, suffered the heavy casualties that Longstreet anticipated. It was the decisive point in the Confederate loss at Gettysburg and Lee ordered a retreat back to Virginia the following day.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Owre and his wife, Katherine, were {{concerned}} that the house would come in over its budget.
