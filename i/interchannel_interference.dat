In this paper, a simple frequency-domain equalization technique which can compensate for the effect of ICI in a multipath fading channel is proposed. In this technique, the equalization of the received OFDM signal is achieved by using the assumption that the channel impulse response (CIR) varies in a linear fashion during a block period and by compensating for the ICI terms that significantly affect the bit-error rate (BER) performance.

However, unless the filters are ideal (bandlimited and with a square-root Nyquist-shape) and the carriers are properly chosen, the noises of different branches are correlated even in the presence of an ideal channel. Hence a vector estimate method should be used instead of the classical scalar threshold detectors. Furthermore, the intersymbol interference and <b>interchannel</b> <b>interference</b> impulse responses have been evaluated.

40|$|On the <b>interchannel</b> <b>interference</b> {{in digital}} {{communication}} systems, its impulsive nature, and its mitigation Alexei V Nikitin 1, 2 A strong digital communication transmitter located in close physical proximity to a receiver of a weak signal can noticeably {{interfere with the}} latter even when the respective channels are tens or hundreds of megahertz apart. When time domain observations {{are made in the}} signal chain of the receiver between the first mixer and the baseband, this interference is likely to appear impulsive. Understanding the mechanism of this interference is important for its effective mitigation. In this article, we show that impulsiveness, or a high degree of peakedness, of <b>interchannel</b> <b>interference</b> in communication systems results from the non-smooth nature of any physically realizable modulation scheme for transmission of a digital (discontinuous) message. Even modulation schemes designed to be ‘smooth’, e. g., continuous-phase modulation, are, in fact, not smooth because their higher order time derivatives still contain discontinuities. When observed by an out-of-band receiver, the transmissions from these discontinuities may appear as strong transients with the peak power noticeably exceeding the average power, and the received signal will have a high degree of peakedness. This impulsive nature of the interference provides an opportunity to reduce its power by nonlinear filtering, thus improving quality of the receiver channel...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY With {{the growing}} demand for mobile communications, {{multicarrier}} (MC) schemes are receiving an increasing amount of attention, primarily because they handle frequency selective channels better than ordinary single-carrier schemes. However, despite offering several advantages, MC systems have certain weak points. One is their high sensitivity to <b>interchannel</b> <b>interference</b> (ICI). The influence of Doppler shift and ICI {{are the focus of}} this paper. Newly proposed B 3 G/ 4 G systems are developed for data transmission rates higher than those of the IEEE 801. 11. It is then necessary that the bandwidth of the subcarrier be small. Moreover, for a higher carrier frequency and mobile speed, the influence of the Doppler shift will be large; therefore, the influence of ICI becomes severer. Using a Markov chain approach, we synthesized a turbo equalizer (TE) that minimizes ICI when interference affects the arbitrary number M of adjacent subchannels. This approach shows the complexity of the proposed algorithm exhibits linear growth with respect to M and independence with respect to the total number of subchannels in the multicarrier system. The proposed ICI cancellation scheme can also be effective in the case of multiple Doppler frequency offsets. This makes the proposed approach attractive for practical implementations. key words: OFDM, DMT, multicarrier system, <b>interchannel</b> <b>interference,</b> turbo-equalizer, frequency offset 1...|$|E
