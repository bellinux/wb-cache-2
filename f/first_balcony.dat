5|$|There {{were two}} key {{catalysts}} beyond Radama's affinity for Creole architecture that inspired Gros to innovate so far beyond traditional construction norms: the recent {{construction of a}} two-storey house with a balcony in the neighbourhood of Andohalo by a British missionary (the <b>first</b> <b>balcony</b> in highland Madagascar), and the 1823 arrival of Princess Rasalimo to the Rova, necessitating the redesign of Bevato as her residence. Rasalimo, whose marriage to Radama secured the peace between the Merina Kingdom and that of her Sakalava people on the west coast, was made Radama's principal wife and reportedly demanded an exceptional palace for her home. This request led Radama to employ a Creole architect named Jean Julien to design the unprecedented two-storey house. Although historic sources are divided on whether Tranovola, Bevato or Marivolanitra was the first two-storey house at the Rova, the innovations embodied in these buildings and particularly in Tranovola underscore the rising influence of foreign architectural norms in Imerina. Tranovola is widely represented by historians as the first true example of the hybridisation of Merina architectural norms and those of Europe, and its design served {{as a model for}} the larger Manjakamiadana palace some years later. The innovative features of this building and the Manjakamiadana it inspired—particularly the verandas supported by exterior columns—became the new norm in highlands architecture, especially upon the adoption of brick as the principal building material.|$|E

25|$|Named for donors Michael and Sonja Koerner, Koerner Hall {{opened in}} September 2009 and houses 1,135 seats. It was {{designed}} by KPMB Architects, theatre consultant Anne Minors Performance Consultants, and acoustics company Sound Space Design. It features two balcony tiers above the main orchestra level {{as well as a}} third technical balcony. Koerner Hall's signature element is an acoustically transparent veil of twisting oak strings that forms the backdrop for the chorus at the <b>first</b> <b>balcony</b> level, then hovers over the stage below the fixed acoustic canopy, extending into and over the hall at the technical balcony level. Completion of the project also includes three tiers of glass fronted lobbies overlooking Philosopher’s Walk, back-of-house areas for performers, a ground-floor café, and installation of a unique collection of antique musical instruments donated by the Koerner family and valued at $1 million. Each level is also equipped to host a variety of private functions.|$|E

2500|$|Belle Cora (1827? –1862), {{also known}} as Arabella Ryan, was a {{successful}} Madam of the Barbary Coast during the mid-nineteenth century. She rose to public attention in 1855 when her lover, Charles Cora, killed US Marshall William H. Richardson. The fight between Charles and Richardson started at the American Theatre. Richardson's wife complained that Belle Cora, a well-known parlor house owner, and Charles Cora, a frequent gambler [...] were seated in the same balcony as her. She stated {{that they should be}} in the general admission pit seats rather than the more expensive areas reserved for more respectable guests.. As a result, Richardson went to ask the manager of the theatre to remove the couple, but the manager refused saying that they were regular customers of the <b>first</b> <b>balcony.</b> Richardson left swearing vengeance upon Charles Cora, and two days [...] later the confrontation led to his death.|$|E
2500|$|The {{opera house}} on the Rue Le Peletier could seat 1800 spectators. There were three {{performances}} a week, scheduled {{so as not to}} compete with the other major opera house in the city, the Théâtre-Italien. [...] The best seats were in the forty boxes, which could each hold four or six persons on the <b>first</b> <b>balcony.</b> [...] One of the boxes could be rented for the entire season for 7500 francs. [...] One of the major functions of the opera house was to be a meeting place for Paris society, and for this reason the performances were generally very long, with as many as five intermissions. [...] Ballets were generally added in the middle of operas to create additional opportunities for intermissions. [...] Operas by the major composers of the time, notably Giacomo Meyerbeer and Richard Wagner, had their first French performances in this theater.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the reign}} of Emperor Napoleon III (1852-1870), {{the top of the}} {{hierarchy}} of Paris theaters was the Académie Imperial, or Imperial Opera Theatre, in the Salle Peletier. [...] The opera house on Rue le Peletier could seat 1800 spectators. There were three performances a week, scheduled so as not to compete with the other major opera house in the city, Les Italiens. The best seats were in the forty boxes, which could each hold four or six persons, on the <b>first</b> <b>balcony.</b> One of the boxes could be rented for the entire season for 7500 francs. One of the major functions of the opera house was to be a meeting place for Paris society, and for this reason the performances were generally very long, with as many as five intermissions. Ballets were generally added in the middle of operas, to create additional opportunities for intermissions. [...] The Salle Peletier had one infamous moment in its history; [...] on 14 January 1858, a group of Italian extreme nationalists attempted to kill Napoleon III at the entrance of the opera house; they set off several bombs, which killed eight people and injured one hundred and fifty persons, and splattered the Empress Eugénie de Montijo with blood, though the Emperor was unharmed.|$|E

60|$|The gallery, less {{sensitive}} or more genuinely patriotic, thundered on, applauding the lines {{as well as}} the growing power of Helen's impersonation. Royleston was at last beginning to play, the fumes of his heavy dinner having cleared away. He began to grip his lines, and that gave the star her first opportunity to forget his weakness and throw herself into her part. All in all, only a very discriminating ear could have detected a falling-off of favor in this act. The curtain was lifted four times, and a few feeble cries for the author were heard, chiefly from the <b>first</b> <b>balcony.</b>|$|E
60|$|Poor as I was, I {{visited the}} old Museum night after night, paying thirty-five cents which {{admitted}} me to a standing {{place in the}} <b>first</b> <b>balcony,</b> and there on my feet and in complete absorption, I saw in wondrous procession Hamlet, Lear, Othello, Petruchio, Sir Giles Overreach, Macbeth, Iago, and Richelieu emerge from the shadow and re-enact their tragic lives before my eyes. These were my purple, splendid hours. From the light of this glorious mimic world I stumbled down the stairs out into the night, careless of wind or snow, my brain in a tumult of revolt, my soul surging with high resolves.|$|E

50|$|On {{many of his}} concerts Hayes {{would attempt}} to abandon the use of {{segregated}} seating. At a concert in Atlanta, Georgia Hayes had the main floor of the auditorium {{as well as the}} boxes and <b>first</b> <b>balcony</b> halved between the races. The galleries were reserved for colored students at a special rate. No whites were allowed in them except the ones chaperoning the students.|$|E
50|$|The <b>first</b> floor <b>balcony,</b> {{along the}} {{southern}} elevation, has been divided by both timber and plywood partitioning. Weathering has occurred to some balustrades and floor boards on the verandah. Two air-conditioning motors have been installed below the balcony to service ground floor areas. Some damage, including missing balusters, has occurred at {{the eastern end of}} the balcony.|$|R
50|$|In 1903 William Effy {{signed a}} ten-year lease which covered the basement, ground floor and <b>first</b> floor <b>balcony</b> of the site.

50|$|After {{restoring}} the exterior, the original Corinthian columns, balustrades, urns, and trellises {{of the auditorium}} were repaired and repainted. 23K gold leaf was reapplied to the extensive interior decorative accents. New seats were installed, {{and the number of}} seats was reduced from 2,400 to 1,570, to allow for an enlarged orchestra pit, the conversion of the second balcony to house advanced sound and lighting systems, and the division of the <b>first</b> <b>balcony</b> into box seating. The stage was given a resilient floor suitable for dance performances and Backstage space was expanded.|$|E
5000|$|The Six Flags Over Texas Oil Derrick is a [...] tall {{observation}} tower, and {{an attraction}} at the theme park Six Flags Over Texas.
