His King Lear overture, written when he was 22, is not a symphonic poem in the vein of Liszt but actually more {{along the lines of}} Beethoven's concert overtures, relying more on the dramatic qualities of sonata form than on extramusical content.|$|E

Through his mother he had gained a love of literature and this would do much to direct his choice of acquaintances in later life when he was to become firm friends with authors (most notably to Thomas Hardy) and a mentor to the poet Siegfried Sassoon. This passion was also to initiate another, as in literature he and his future wife Ruth (a writer in her own right) were to find common ground.|$|E

We will propose {{that the answer to}} this question is yes and that the kinds of things <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> may provide important clues as <b>to</b> how intentional <b>forgetting</b> occurs. Such efforts are timely because there has been increasing interest in directed forgetting as part of a broader trend toward investigating inhibitory abilities.

25|$|Due to the {{overwhelming}} impact, influence and enduring legacy of The Grammar of Ornament, {{it can be}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> that Jones was, during his lifetime, well known {{to the public for}} his work as an architect. This skew in our contemporary perception of Jones's work is made particularly acute because many of Jones's built projects have since been demolished or otherwise destroyed – most notably the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, which was lost forever due to a fire in 1936. His most important building was St James's Hall, which was located between Piccadilly and Regent Street and for almost fifty years was London's principal concert hall. Jones was also responsible for two grand shopping emporiums: the Crystal Palace Bazaar and a showroom for Osler’s, the glassware manufacturer, both in the West End. These three buildings all opened within a few years of each other, between 1858 and 1860, but had all been demolished by 1926. Their sumptuous polychromed interiors of cast iron, plaster and stained glass were breathtaking monuments to leisure and consumption.|$|E

5000|$|Science {{progresses}} in a {{much more}} muddled fashion than is often pictured in history books. This is especially true of theoretical physics, partly because history is written by the victorious. Consequently, historians of science often ignore the many alternate paths that people wandered down, the many false clues they followed, the many misconceptions they had. These alternate points of view are less clearly developed than the final theories, harder <b>to</b> understand and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget,</b> especially as these are viewed years later, when it all really does make sense. Thus reading history one rarely gets the feeling of the true nature of scientific development, in which the element of farce is as great as the element of triumph.|$|R
25|$|Different {{emotions}} {{have been}} shown to affect memory. Life events that have stronger emotions attached will be remembered more vividly. In studies looking at emotional events and the reminiscence bump, older adults tend to remember more positive events than younger adults. Typically, during the reminiscence bump only happy memories and memories of important events are recalled. It is postulated that sad events are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> because there may be an increased motivation <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> them. Conversely, individuals are more likely to recall and relive happy events because they produced pleasurable memories. A second explanation suggests that remembering positive events can help regulate emotions and even enhance moods. It is also possible to regulate emotions through remembering negative events and comparing these events to present positive events. Positive or negative events {{can also be used to}} share life experiences with others and compare life events.|$|R

He also criticized the lack of a large player pool and dedicated servers. Evans-Thirlwell of GamesRadar thought that the game's co-operative multiplayer were fun to play, but the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget.</b> In contrast, GameZone's Splechta thought that the competitive multiplayer mode was [...] "a surprise" [...] for him.

Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine had initially considered it as the least memorable song among the six tracks released for pre-order, however in another review for the album he explained, [...] "A decade of disco-Madonna makes it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> that she's a skilled balladeer, and the post-apocalyptic 'Ghosttown' takes a generic, contemporary-pop template (think 'Halo') and stamps it with her singular style a la 1994's Babyface-penned 'Take a Bow'."

40|$|It {{could be}} argued that {{theories}} about gender are something that should be a part of every upper secondary school teachers agenda (knowledge base), because the Swedish curriculum specifically says that schools must encourage and work for equal rights between men and women. The students are supposed tobe encouraged to develop their interest, without judgment, about what femininity and masculinity is. This essay is aiming to find out how gender is used in the teacher program at Södertörns Högskola. The main focus of the essay is to see the possible differences between the curriculum of 2010 and 2013. Using quantitative and qualitative content analysis this essay is aiming to examine how gender words are used in the syllabus, study manuals and literature lists for Educational science A (2010) and Educational science I (2013). In what way are gendered terms, like boy, girl heterosexuality and man, part of the text material? Who is represented in the material? And are there any differences between 2010 and 2013 ? The results show that there is a difference. In the earlier education more gender words are used than in the later. When gender words are explicit in the texts is it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> work with, the texts has the power to judge what´s included and excluded in the program. When gender words are in ordered in bigger terms, like Interkulturalitet, is it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> discuss gender...|$|R

A tile committee {{would be able to}} prove that in Kosovo the poisoning truly happened among the Albanian students who were affected with symptoms which cannot be caused by mass hysteria. No other committee had the chance to testify some of the other factors that spoke about poisoning. A good measure of this handicap was the fact that Radovanović article was unknown to the Albanian doctors as late as 2008. Therefore, he never subjected to criticism, and mass hysteria hypothesis was confirmed. During further 1990s ended up poisoning in 1990 {{in the shadow of the}} burnt villages, massacres and expulsion of one million people.

She said of the nomination, [...] "It's far beyond what I ever dreamed for – that would have been too far fetched". She also was nominated for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, as well as many other nominations and acclaim. The New York Times praised her: [...] "Because Ms. Watts reinvents herself with each performance, it's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> how brilliant she is. She has a boldness that comes from a lack of overemphasis, something actresses sometimes do to keep up with Mr. Penn".

Upon its release, Close Encounters had a huge impact on society and became a certified box office success, grossing $116.39million in North America and $171.7million in foreign countries, totaling $288million. It became Columbia Pictures' most successful film at that time. Jonathan Rosenbaum refers to the film as [...] "the best expression of Spielberg's benign, dreamy-eyed vision." [...] A.D. Murphy of Variety gave a positive review but felt [...] "Close Encounters lacks the warmth and humanity of George Lucas's Star Wars". Murphy found most of the film slow-paced, but praised the film's climax. Pauline Kael called it [...] "a kid's film in the best sense." [...] Jean Renoir compared Spielberg's storytelling to Jules Verne and Georges Méliès. Ray Bradbury declared it the greatest science fiction film ever made. Based on 46 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 96% ("Certified Fresh") of the reviewers have enjoyed the film and the site's consensus states [...] "Close Encounters most iconic bits (the theme, the mashed-potato sculpture, etc.) have been so thoroughly absorbed into the culture that it's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> that its treatment of aliens as peaceful beings rather than warmongering monsters was somewhat groundbreaking in 1977." ...|$|E

[...] Some of the lyrics use double entendre, with the duo referring to themselves as [...] "rejects" [...] and [...] "jerks" [...] on [...] "Dot Com", which The Los Angeles Times called [...] "both a double-entendre for the dance moves spurring the craze, and illustrative of their generation’s reclamation of formerly nerdy archetypes." ...|$|E
