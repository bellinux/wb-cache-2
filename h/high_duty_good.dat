40|$|Recently, {{and due to}} Arab {{spring and}} {{terrorism}} around the globe, pushing and driving most governments potentially to harmonize their border measures particularly the regional and an international transit trade within and among Customs Unions. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate and provide an insight for monitoring and controlling the trade supply chain within and among different countries by using technological advancement (i. e. an electronic tracking system, etc.); furthermore, facilitate the local and intra-regional trade among countries through reviewing the recent trends and practical implementation of an electronic transit traffic and cargo that related to customs measures by introducing and supporting some case studies of several international and landlocked transit trade countries. The research methodology employed in this study was described as qualitative by conducting few interviews with managers, transit truck drivers, and traders and reviewing the related literature to collect qualitative data from secondary sources such as statistical reports, previous studies, etc. The results in this study show that Jordan and other countries around the globe that used an electronic tracking system for monitoring transit trade has led to a significant reduction in cost, effort and time in physical movement of goods internally and crossing through other countries. Therefore, there is no need to escort transit trucks by customs staff; hence, the rate of escort transit trucks is reduced by more than ninety percent, except the bulky and <b>high</b> <b>duty</b> <b>goods.</b> Electronic transit traffic has been increased; the average transit time journey has been reduced by more than seventy percent and has led to decrease in rates of smuggling up to fifty percent. The researcher recommends considering Jordan as regional and international office for tracking electronically and monitoring the transit trade for many considerations...|$|R
50|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries {{there was}} {{extensive}} smuggling by sea from the continent to Britain {{because of the}} <b>high</b> <b>duty</b> on luxury <b>goods.</b> The later was to finance the wars with France and the United States. Silks, spirits and tobacco came from France while gin came from the Netherlands. Revenue cutters were used to try and intercept the smugglers but with little success. After the Napoleonic Wars there was surplus manpower {{that was used to}} try and suppress smuggling. In certain areas (such as in Kent and Cornwall) smuggling was for many communities more economically significant than legal activities such as farming or fishing.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION A. Motivation The {{creation}} of accelerated beams of radioactive nuclides far from stability {{is an area}} of significant interest in nuclear physics [1, 2]. Several laboratories around the world are currently developing methods for the production of high quality radioactive beams based on the extensive experience accumulated in recent years at Isotope Separator On-Line (ISOL) facilities such as ISOLDE [3]. Isotopes of many elements are available with high efficiencies and excellent emittances and energy spreads in 1 + charge states [4, 5]. However, the acceleration of radioactive nuclides in the mass 120 - 240 range with <b>high</b> <b>duty</b> factor and <b>good</b> beam quality from 1 + charge states requires some development, especially at {{the front end of the}} post accelerator [6, 7, 8]. An ionizer capable of efficiently increasing the charge states of very low velocity heavy ions, even if only to 2 +, 3 +, or 4 +, would be of great value in simplifying this process. B. Background It has been shown t...|$|R
5000|$|Support for {{the bill}} {{did not come from}} any {{political}} or geographic bloc as a whole, but was driven primarily by local economic interests - for example, Northeastern wool processors supported the bill, as they had been suffering under <b>high</b> <b>duties</b> on their <b>goods,</b> while Northern manufacturers advocated high protectionist tariffs. Southern agricultural interests generally supported the lower tariffs, as they had long felt that tariffs advocated by Northern industry led to unfairly high by high costs of the goods farmers consumed. [...] According to historian Kenneth M. Stampp, the bill [...] "was possible because it did not represent a victory of one section over the other; nor did it produce a clear division between parties. Its supporters included Democrats, Republicans, and Americans; representatives of northern merchants, manufacturers, and railroad interests; and spokesmen for southern farmers and planters. Opposition came largely from two economic groups: the iron manufacturers of Pennsylvania and the wool growers of New England and the West." ...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Jefferson offered {{one of the}} {{earliest}} formulations of the sentiment, although not of the phrase. In 1803, Jefferson's ambassadors to France arranged the purchase of the Louisiana territory in conflict with Jefferson's personal belief that the Constitution did not bestow upon the federal government the right to acquire or possess foreign territory. Due to political considerations, however, Jefferson disregarded his constitutional doubts, signed the proposed treaty, and sent it to the Senate for ratification. In justifying his actions, he later wrote: [...] "A strict observance of the written law is doubtless one of the <b>high</b> <b>duties</b> of a <b>good</b> citizen, {{but it is not the}} highest. The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation. To lose our country by a scrupulous adherence to the written law, would be to lose the law itself, with life, liberty, property and all those who are enjoying them with us; thus absurdly sacrificing the ends to the means." ...|$|R
