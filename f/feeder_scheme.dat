40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the result of}} pilot project that creates an intelligent outage management System which accurately locates faults in real-time and send fault details to the relevant maintenance crew. Several measures of reliability indices have been developed by the electric utility industry to measure system performance. The reliability of supply is governed by the frequency and the duration of interruptions to supply {{and the number of}} customers affected by interruption. An Outage Management System (OMS) will certainly help utilities identify and restore outages sooner and more efficiently. A fault affected zone in the distribution network can be isolated from the healthy part of the network by disconnecting the affected sector using Air Break Switches, Drift down Lift Off switches, (D. D. L. O) or Autoreclosers. That equipment can be used to optimize the restoring process by isolating smallest possible section of the network affected by fault. Without confining merely to an Outage Management System (OMS), this can be further developed to a supervisory control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA) that facilitate distribution automation function with communications, help to strengthen existing distribution systems and provide a strong foundation for building a fully implemented <b>feeder</b> <b>scheme.</b> But presently Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) which is the national utility responsible for the major portion of distribution of electrical power in Sri Lanka is not taking maximum usage of automation facility of currently available equipment. There is no proper coordination between automated equipment. Also proper automatic reporting and recording system is not available. As a result of this, expected level of reliability improvement couldn't be achieved. Hence the automatic outage program can be used to overcome above shortage. Main objective of the project is to develop automatic outage reporting and controlling system for the North Western Province Branch of CEB, integrating all switching facilities like Auto recloses, GSM fault indicators, Non GSM fault indicators and Load break switch to improve distribution network reliability. The proposed outage management system has modern features such as Data acquisitioning from GSM fault indicators, storing the data for future analysis, indicating the fault location in network diagram, Generating the massage automatically and sending to nearest crew, and Capable of handling data base files. Since North Western Province has very complicated electrical network, Thulhiriya - Kuliyapitiy feeder which has large number of transformers and having long length is selected as pilot project considering distribution indices such as System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) using past outage data of year 2008 and 2009. Based on SynerGEE software reliability data, the locations to install new GSM type fault indicators, Non GSM type fault indicators were identified. So 10 number of GSM type fault indicators, 20 number of Non GSM type fault indicators, 08 number of DDLOs, were installed. The outage management system was developed using Visual Basic 6 for usage of at the Distribution Control Centre. Then program was installed in the control centre and executed for six months. Then the reported break down was compared with break down history of the feeder and Financial Feasibility Analysis was done. It was observed that the initial investment is paid back within first four years which indicates the implement of the Outage Management system is financially feasible. Also the significant improvement of reliability could be observed...|$|E

40|$|There is renewed {{interest}} in Europe in the potential role of new automated technologies for urban transport. Such systems include personal rapid transit (PRT), cybercars and high-tech buses, which have been studied in the European programme CityMobil. In the absence of empirical evidence on their performance, a common predictive modelling method {{has been used to}} predict the impacts of three comparable applications of these technologies in four case study cities. The design of the applications and the modelling assumptions were based on earlier research in the programme. The model results and a business case tool have been used to assess the contributions such systems make and their financial justification. Impacts on car use were often small, but were greater for city centre PRT <b>schemes</b> and cybercar <b>feeder</b> <b>schemes.</b> However, these schemes also attracted patronage from conventional public transport and from walking and cycling. Financial benefit cost ratios were often positive, reflecting the low costs of operation, and were particularly high in cities with high fare regimes and in areas with previously poorer levels of service. These results suggest appropriate conditions for a full scale trial of such technologies. May, Muir, Shepherd, Jeffery, & Levin...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{analytical}} {{models for}} optimizing {{a bus and}} rail transit system with feeder bus services under different market regimes. The market regimes concerned include: monopoly (with profit maximization), social optimum (with social welfare maximization), and oligopoly. In the proposed models, transit operator aims to optimize the frequencies and fares of the bus, rail and feeder bus services, while accounting for the responses from transit passengers (in terms of travel mode choice as well as demand elasticity) {{to the level of}} transit services and fares. A solution algorithm is developed to solve the proposed models. Numerical results show that a single implementation of the <b>feeder</b> bus service <b>scheme</b> may not be most cost-effective. A joint implementation of the <b>feeder</b> bus service <b>scheme</b> and other schemes, such as transfer coordination between transit modes and integrated fare scheme, can significantly improve the performance of the multimodal transit system in terms of total social welfare...|$|R

40|$|The digital {{substation}} and {{the implementation}} of IEC 61850 are fundamental {{to the future of}} protection relays. The IBC 61850 standard, "Communication Networks and Systems in Substation", provides the basis for the communication system for the digital sub-station's protection and control schemes. Section 9 - 2 defines the Ethernet based communication network providing data transfer between primary equipment and bay level IEDs, the process bus. This paper describes the background for the choice of bus architecture for the process bus for use in an EHV transmission sub-station. It reports on the results of performance tests on a <b>feeder</b> protection <b>scheme</b> using both an IEC 61850 and a conventional relay. Further tests have examined the performance of the IEC 61850 relay when the data transfer traffic on the process bus exceeds its capability and data packets are therefore lost...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to determine <b>feeder</b> reconfiguration <b>scheme</b> considering variable load profile. The objective function consists of system losses, reliability costs and also switching costs. In {{order to achieve}} an optimal solution the proposed method compares these costs dynamically and determines when {{and how it is}} reasonable to have a switching operation. The proposed method divides a year into several equal time periods, then using particle swarm optimization (PSO), optimal candidate configurations for each period are obtained. System losses and customer interruption cost of each configuration during each period is also calculated. Then, considering switching cost from a configuration to another one, dynamic programming algorithm (DPA) is used to determine the annual reconfiguration scheme. Several test systems were used to validate the proposed method. The obtained results denote that to have an optimum solution it is necessary to compare operation costs dynamically...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} hybrid {{technology}} {{to solve the}} distribution system reconfiguration problem. The technology with the mixture of Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm (PGSA), Greedy and heuristic based fuzzy operation has been proposed. The optimization approach based on PGSA provides detailed description on switch states for calculation. The inclusion of Greedy with PGSA improves the efficiency of optimization by identifying the best loop sequence. Furthermore, the heuristic fuzzy has been introduced with PGSA and Greedy for handling constraints amid optimization. With the use of proposed algorithm, the system loss has been reduced convincingly without compromising the power flow constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by employing the <b>feeder</b> switching operation <b>scheme</b> to IEEE 33 bus distribution system and 83 bus Distribution system of Taiwan Power Company...|$|R
40|$|The use of process-bus technology, {{designed}} {{in accordance with}} the IEC 61850 standard, introduces new opportunities for protection and control. However, before the technology can be deployed, adequate tests are required to prove use of the process bus does not have a detrimental impact on the operating performance of future protection, as expressed in terms of dependability, security and operating speed. The paper will describe an overview of the concepts and benefits of the process bus, and how it affects the design of prototype protection scheme suitable for the mesh-corner of a transmission substation. The operating characteristics of conventional hardwired relays and IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 LE relays applied within a <b>feeder</b> protection <b>scheme,</b> were compared and assessed against conventional type-test results. The scheme includes Ethernet Switches from different manufacturers, configured to allow the assessment of different process-bus architectures. The effect of interchangeability and time offsets were investigated both experimentally and using the OPNET simulator. The scheme includes Merging Units (MU), tested to assess the magnitude of their time offset and how they drift with time and temperature. Causes of incorrect operation were recognized and recommendations presented to avoid the degradation of system performance. Given an appropriate configuration, the performance of a process bus based protection scheme is comparable to a conventional hardwired scheme. The presented results provides a fundamental reference for all the participating parties to create a roadmap for the efficient application and deployment of protection and control systems based on IEC 61850 process bus and digital Ethernet communications...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to investigate}} alternative, more reliable and cost effective ways of improving the reliability performance of medium voltage networks. Customers are mainly affected by faults on the distribution MV network, to which, consequently, {{we have to pay}} particular attention. A major requirement on electricity supply systems is high supply reliability for the customer which is mainly determined by the distribution networks. Power system reliability is an essential factor in the quality of supply and {{is directly related to the}} number and duration of outages. By analysing the power system properly, the weaknesses will then be identified and improvements can be introduced to minimise the occurrence of outages. A decrease in the outage rate will result in an improvement in reliability and quality of supply of the distribution MV network. The dissertation focuses on improving the network management by increasing the level of network automation and control which improves the operating efficiency of medium voltage distribution networks. Steps are shown how to equip the network according to progressive investment capability, from Fault Path Indicators (FPIs) and remote control Pulseclosing technologies to automatic FuseSavers and Tripsavers used in a <b>feeder</b> automation <b>scheme</b> to minimise the number of disturbances and the outage durations experienced when they occur. The results of a study analysing the impact of different intelligent automation solutions on the reliability performance of Medium Voltage distribution networks are presented in the dissertation. The respective system topologies are modelled and the resulting system reliability performance is determined by reliability calculations such as the SAIDI and SAIFI values. The results show that the distribution automation technologies can have a very significant impact on both the SAIDI and SAIFI performance of the systems. Further, selected details related to the implementation of such intelligent automation schemes are presented in this dissertation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{computer vision system}} for measuring the weight of gobs during a glass forming process, and a control strategy to correct automatically any weight deviation from a given set-point. During the formation of molten glass gobs, several noise sources can cause a deviation in the weight from a predefined reference value. Among them, there is a random white-noise disturbance caused {{by the lack of}} synchronisation of mechanical devices, the periodic disturbances due to changes in the spinning direction of the tube inside the feeder, and some long-term drifts caused by variations in temperature and viscosity of the raw glass material. The gob weight measurement system developed is based on a monochrome CCD high-resolution camera and photo-detector for synchronising the frame acquisition. The molten glass provides the illumination, so a high contrast image is obtained with a bright object and dark background. Several image-processing algorithms are presented for reliable area estimation. Assuming that the gob is a symmetric geometry of revolution and uniform mass density, the proposed system estimates the weight of gobs with accuracy better than ± 0. 75 %. A learning weight control strategy is proposed based on a PI-repetitive control scheme. The weight deviation from a set point is used as a control signal to adjust the glass flow into the <b>feeder.</b> This regulation <b>scheme</b> allows effective weight control, cancelling mid and long-term effects. The tracking error, ± 1. 5 %, means a reduction of 40 % when compared with a traditional PI controller...|$|R
