5|$|As {{a popular}} and {{acceptable}} activity, botany {{had been taken}} up by many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence. On the recommendation of John Lindley, Darwin wrote to Lady Dorothy Nevill, who responded generously by sending numerous exotic orchids, and requested a signed photograph of him to hang in <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> room next to portraits of her other notable friends, including Hooker.|$|E
5|$|The seven-minute long video depicts Beyoncé {{playing a}} beauty pageant contest {{representing}} Third Ward, Houston, {{the area in}} which she grew up. It opens with the sound of a poignant piano and shots of Beyoncé sporting short hair, looking at herself in the mirror. It transitions to a segment of her fellow contestants preparing for the pageant backstage, combing their hair, fitting their dresses and analyzing their bodies; one scene during the preparations shows Beyoncé arguing with another contestant over a hair dryer. Multiple shots of the singer follow, of which depict <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> on a floor and leaving a bathroom after vomiting. The clip then sees contestants looking tired and distressed backstage.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, aged 101, she {{fractured}} her pelvis in a fall. Even so, {{she insisted}} on standing for the National Anthem during the memorial service for her husband on 6 February the following year. Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On 13 February 2002, the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> room at Sandringham House; an ambulance and doctor were called, and the wound was dressed. She was still determined to attend Margaret's funeral at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, two days later on the Friday of that week, even though the Queen {{and the rest of}} the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor; she was also rumoured to be hardly eating. Nevertheless, she flew to Windsor by helicopter, and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken—she insisted that she be shielded from the press—she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blacked–out windows, which had been previously used by Margaret.|$|E

50|$|The death {{certificate}} issued for Alexa Wilding records her death on 25 April 1884, aged 37. The {{cause of death}} was peritonitis for six days and eventual exhaustion; sixteen months earlier she had been diagnosed with a splenic tumor. This may be the disease that had previously caused Rossetti to think her ill, and prevented her sometimes from keeping <b>her</b> <b>sittings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mercer {{talks to}} Kate while driving, imagining <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> {{in the back}} seat of the car, but she hangs up in jealousy when he {{mentions}} Joely for the first time. He arrives in Sacramento and finds the pet store where Arlen worked. The owner (Maura Tierney) asks Mercer to sing in her children's band, for which she plays as part of her probation. When he returns to the car, he finds somebody trying to break into it, only to discover that it is Kate. They spend the night at a hotel, but he leaves without her the next morning and catches a train to Los Angeles, California. With the help of a translator, he phones Arlen's last residence and learns from a Hispanic woman that Arlen is working at a hotel in Ensenada, Mexico. Mercer finally meets Arlen (Jsu Garcia) at the hotel in Ensenada, but Arlen assumes Mercer is just there for money. Enraged, Mercer tackles his brother to the ground and gets kicked off the premises. Kate later finds a bloody Mercer sitting on the side of a road and takes him to a hotel. She tells him that she let him take her car because she was attracted to him, and they have sex. The next day Mercer meets with Arlen again, more amicably, and tells him that he and Kate are driving to Louisiana to spread his mother's ashes.|$|E
25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E

500|$|The Prince Albert {{sapphire}} brooch {{was given}} by Prince Albert to Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace on 9 February 1840. It was the day before their wedding, and Victoria wrote in her diary that Albert came to <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> room and gave her [...] "a beautiful sapphire and diamond brooch". The centre stone is a large oblong sapphire surrounded by 12 round diamonds. It passed from Victoria to the queen consorts, Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary and the Queen Mother, then passed to Elizabeth on her accession to the throne.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] {{was shot by}} Tom Boxer in a club in Neptun, Romania. It was filmed {{in the period of}} Alessia's and Croitoru's argument over compensation, with Inna initially not appearing in it, before another version was released on 7 November 2009 incorporating footage of the singer in Turkey. The visual opens with a glass falling down in front of a black backdrop, with it breaking, and then sees Taylor mixing in a club. Following this, the focus alternates on female strippers and a group of partying people. Subsequently, a girl sporting an orange dress walks around the club, eventually drawing the attention of a male, with <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> at the bar and watching a man mixing drinks. After the group of people—including masked men—further perform to the track, the clip ends with a shot of one's white T-shirt with an unknown blue figure on it. Scenes interspersed through the main clip portray Inna posing in swimsuit during a ship trip, footage of loudspeakers or two topless men fighting sporting yellow pants.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Hair" [...] on The Paul O'Grady Show on June 17,2011. The {{song was}} the first of the four performances planned, and Gaga opened the show with <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> on the piano. She appeared bald but wore a teal colored fringed dress, and sang an acoustic version of [...] "Hair", while staring at a teal colored wig placed in front of her. The piano on which she sang was covered with brown, curly hair and she was surrounded by flames. Halfway through the performance, Gaga took the wig and placed it on her head. Ryan Love of Digital Spy had a preview of the recording of the show, and commented that when [...] "it's just GaGa [...] on the piano, you can't help but be impressed." [...] Cynthia Robinson from The Huffington Post theorized that Gaga pretending to be bald was not a [...] "fashion statement", instead she was [...] "saying something about shedding that skin, that costume, that barrier that she created with all of her vaunted costumes—at least so that people know what she is inside before putting it back on." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ugly" [...] {{was directed by}} Toby Tremlett and filmed on 1 November 2005. It {{is set in a}} warehouse in New York City that is used for people who are taking part in an audition. It begins with a yellow taxi driving on a New York City road with apartment complexes. As the song begins, Buena sings her verse while looking into a mirror, and other people in the warehouse begin to hold up signs of the song's lyrics. During the chorus, they begin to showcase their talents such as dancing and juggling. Buchanan's chorus features <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> on a staircase; during this part, a child holds up a sign reading [...] "short" [...] while a woman carries a sign saying [...] "loneliness". As Range sings the bridge, she is leaning on a wall in the warehouse while more people begin dancing. When Sugababes sing the chorus again, they dance with the people who also begin to show other talents, including instrumentation and magic tricks. As the video ends, a row of people hold up signs containing one word from the song's lyrics, [...] "people are all the same".|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} the view of a city {{populated}} with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears {{on the back of}} a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love?" [...] This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pour incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on February 7, 2009 on CMT. The video commences with a close-ups of Swift's and Colletti's mouths as {{they speak}} via telephone. He begins, [...] "All I want is you. Do you love me?" [...] She affirms, and {{he asks for}} another chance. The video {{transitions}} to Swift sitting {{on the living room}} floor, next to a fireplace. She performs as she flashbacks to memories with Colletti. The two frolic on a brown couch and play with a deck of cards. The video then transitions to Swift and her friend having lunch at a restaurant, where Swift's friend informs her of Colletti's betrayal. The two converse and, then, Swift is seen walking on the streets during nighttime. She sees Colletti arriving at a house with groceries and, after staring at each other, a redheaded woman walks out of the house. In a panic, Swift runs away and the video transcends to the phone call, which commenced {{in the beginning of the}} video, with Colletti repeating, [...] "Will you give me another chance?" [...] A rapid flashback of cut-scenes is played and, after its conclusion, Swift denies his request, hangs up, and cries. Cut-scenes feature Swift and Colletti frolicking, Swift walking in the streets, and <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> beside the fireplace. To date, the video has over 124 million views on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Shaun Silva, was filmed in Paris, London, and Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The Union Station hotel is featured as {{a train station}} in the video. Kelley explained that the director decided to shoot parts of the music video in Europe because he wanted the video to be [...] "as authentic as possible". The video begins with a young woman, Joy, played by actress Danielle Donn, entering a train and discovering an iPad in her backpack. The iPad has a video of her lover with a sign written in French words that mean [...] "Don't forget about me," [...] and also some videos of the couple's travels throughout London, Paris, and Berlin, after which the couple bid each other farewell. A subsequent scene shows Joy's boyfriend finding <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> on a train seat and they share a kiss. Joy is then seen awoken from sleep as a man named Brady, who looks exactly like the boyfriend in Joy's dream, sits next to her. Brady apologizes for waking her and asks if she minds if he sits next to her. The two make introductions, and Joy mentions her dream. Brady then takes out his iPad case (exactly the same case as the one Joy had in her dream), and smiles at her. Joy smiles back, having experienced this deja vu moment. The group members are seen singing at a Tennessee train station, and on the train itself.|$|E
500|$|Tricky {{eventually}} grew {{frustrated with}} {{his role in}} Massive Attack, finding it limiting, and wanted to record an album with a female vocalist whose singing would offer another dimension to his lyrics and their meaning. In 1993, he discovered Martina Topley-Bird, then a teenager at Clifton College, when he saw <b>her</b> <b>sitting</b> against a wall near his house, singing to herself. [...] "That's really how it happened," [...] she recalled. [...] "A few weeks later, I went around to his house with some friends. We'd been drinking cider after our GCSEs. We were banging on his door, but he wasn't in. Then Mark Stewart, who lived there, came up to us and said: 'Yeah, this is Tricky's house, jump in through the window.'" [...] Tricky, whose lyrics had matured from raps about street violence and sex to more personal and introspective writing, said Topley-Bird found his songs [...] "quite depressing", which he believed was because of her more privileged background: [...] "It's just reality. She's been a student all her life, grew up in Somerset, and I don't think she's ever faced the real world. She finds it all a bit weird. But she's my best mate." [...] They would form a musical and romantic partnership over subsequent years, and their first recording together, [...] "Aftermath", later appeared on Maxinquaye. After offering the song to Massive Attack, who {{were not interested in}} including it on their 1991 album Blue Lines, Tricky released [...] "Aftermath" [...] independently to local record stores in September 1993 before he signed a record deal with 4th & B'way.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the total image was left, according to Metzinger, to 'creative intuition' of the observer.
