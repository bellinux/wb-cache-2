50|$|These {{transmissions}} have a <b>governor</b> <b>gear.</b> Unlike the A140E counterpart {{which is}} electronically controlled, the A140L uses a plastic <b>governor</b> <b>gear</b> to select which gear to go into. Over time and wear, this plastic gear's teeth shred and eventually {{cease to be}} able to control gears. This results in a transmission that can only shift to first and reverse, but not to any further forward gears. Replacement of this <b>governor</b> <b>gear</b> is relatively inexpensive compared to a replacement transmission as it can be serviced without taking the transmission out of the car.|$|E
5000|$|After {{his term}} as Governor ended Briggs {{returned}} to his residence and businesses in Jackson County, Iowa. He became involved in parts farther west in the country: in 1860, he made a trip to Colorado during the mining excitement {{of the time and}} in 1863, Briggs with his son John Shannon Briggs and a large group went to the state of Montana, where he remained involved in mining until 1865 when he returned to Iowa. In 1870 he moved to Council Bluffs, Iowa and later was {{one of the founders of}} the town of Florence, Nebraska. In 1881 after a very brief illness Briggs died at his son John's residence in Omaha, Nebraska due to ulceration of the stomach. His death was greatly mourned all over Iowa. <b>Governor</b> <b>Gear</b> issued a proclamation reciting his services to the State, and ordering half-hour guns to be fired and the national flag on the State capitol to be put at half-mast during the day of the funeral. In 1909, the General Assembly of Iowa voted to erect a monument in Andrew, Iowa to [...] "the stage driver who became Governor." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{comprehensive}} approach to simulate the propulsion system behaviour of a ship during transients and off design conditions {{is presented in the}} paper. The system behaviour is described by a numerical model, developed in MATLABSIMULINK ® environment, already tested and validated with reference to different ship types and operating situations. The model may be simply adapted to different applications because of its modular architecture, allowing an extremely easy and gradual growth in complexity, for instance including accurate (thermodynamic) engine modules and ship manoeuvrability modules. A library of ‘blocks’ already available is used to represent the propulsion plant elements (engine, <b>governor,</b> <b>gear,</b> shaftline, propeller, hull, etc.) with a different degree of accuracy in relation to the concerned application. The system of algebraic and differential equations linking together the selected modules and representing the propulsion system mathematical model, is solved in the time domain by means of different available MATLAB® solvers. The application presented in this paper concerns a small naval vessel, a corvette of 1500 tons displacement, whose propulsion plant consists of a twin shaft arrangement with controllable pitch propellers. Each shaft is driven, through reduction gears, by a sequentially-turbocharged medium speed diesel engine. The presented model has been validated by comparing the simulation results with steady state manufacturer experimental data, for the diesel engine, and with ‘ad-hoc’ full scale measurements of propulsion plant and ship parameters, relative to off-design and transient operating conditions...|$|E

50|$|About 7.6 metres {{south of}} the boiler is the Marshall steam engine. There is no manufacturer's name on the engine, but it has the {{characteristics}} of a Marshall, Sons & Co.

5000|$|Early engines {{were of the}} [...] "open-crank" [...] style, that is, {{there was}} no {{enclosed}} crankcase. The crankshaft, connecting rod, camshaft, <b>gears,</b> <b>governor,</b> etc. were all completely exposed and could be viewed in operation when the engine was running. This made for a messy environment, as oil was thrown from the engine and could run on the ground. Another disadvantage was that dirt and dust could get on moving engine parts, causing excessive wear and possible malfunction of the engine. Frequent cleaning of the engine was required {{to keep it in}} normal working order.|$|R

5000|$|The {{alternative}} approach was {{to design a}} new engine and increase the displacement from the existing 71 cubic inches to 110 cubic inches, or roughly a 50% increase. This resulted in the model 6-110, with 660 cubic inches total displacement, that produced a continuous rating of [...] at 1800 rpm. While the basic engine components (block, crankshaft, pistons, etc.) were all new, many of the additional components (injectors, <b>governors,</b> accessories, marine <b>gears)</b> were simply shared with the Series 71 engines. Since the 6-110 was designed from the outset for heavy-duty high-horsepower applications, it was never produced in a four-cylinder version (that would have displaced 440 cubic inches, {{very close to the}} 426 ci displaced by the 6-71).|$|R
25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal <b>governor</b> connected by <b>gears</b> {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, Smith {{left the}} city council {{and ran for the}} Louisiana State Senate against the {{incumbent}} Cecil R. Blair of Lecompte in south Rapides Parish. Arnold Jack Rosenthal, an Alexandria businessman and attorney, also entered the race. Smith ran sufficiently strong to force Blair into a runoff, and the third-place candidate, Rosenthal, thereafter endorsed Smith. Blair still prevailed by some two thousand votes and then ran without Republican opposition in the general election held on February 1, 1972. Thereafter, Smith was named executive assistant to Rosenthal, who was elected as the last finance and utilities commissioner in the city of Alexandria prior to the adoption of a new city charter that established the current mayor-council form of municipal government. Smith remained as the assistant to the commissioner until 1975, when Mayor John K. Snyder and Streets and Parks Commissioner Malcolm P. Hebert dismissed him from the position in a 2-1 vote, which Rosenthal considered to have been invalid and unfair. After his Pineville and Alexandria years, Smith lived for a time in Houston, Texas, where he sold automobiles. He returned to Winn Parish where he engaged in the sale of timber and land through his company called TLMS, Inc. In 1983, Smith ran for <b>governor,</b> having <b>geared</b> his campaign toward drawing attention to the poor condition of many Louisiana highways. He polled only 2,314 votes, as Edwin Washington Edwards handily reclaimed the office from the Republican incumbent David C. Treen.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 79 - 92 A rotordynamics {{analysis}} of an 8000 hp steam turbine which drives an ethylene compressor is presented. This machine characteristically exhibited increasing vibration levels with increasing speed, {{in the upper}} portion of the speed range. It was suspected that this ramping vibration was due to operation near a critical speed. The purpose of this analysis was to identify {{the source of this}} high vibration with the present rotor and hearings and then to determine the best solution to the problem. The computer analysis determined that the original rotor/bearing system was operating near the second critical speed. The predicted peaks were within nine percent to thirteen percent of miming speed (8400 cpm). The optimum solution was to shorten the shaft at the governor end and replace the bearings. The shaft modification consisted of cutting off the <b>governor</b> worm <b>gear</b> assembly and replacing it with an electronic governor disk. This new bearing design was also a four-shoe tilting pad journal bearing, but it had longer pads and higher preload than the existing design. Because there was concern about coupling gear tooth lock-up in the original design, a dry, flexible-element coupling design was evaluated. The coupling change was also of interest because of its potential effect on moving the second critical speed. However, in this ease, the analysis determined that the rotor vibration characteristics were very close with either the existing gear coupling or the dry coupling. Therefore, the justification fo r changing couplings would be that the dry coupling would not be susceptible to drive tooth lockup and unbalance eccentricity due to tooth wear...|$|R
