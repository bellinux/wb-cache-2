The {{artificial insemination}} {{was introduced in}} animal husbandry research Stations of the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques of Burundi (ISABU) in 1974. Deep-frozen semen in medium strew was imported from Kenya. The inseminated females were of the Ankole breed, Ankole x Sahiwal and Ankole x Sahiwal x Jersey crosses; they were managed on semi-extensive system in the lower and higher altitude regions of Burundi. Four hundred and thirty two inseminations are reported : 293 first inseminations, 108 second and 31 third inseminations. On average 2. 8 inseminations were needed for every calf born in the lower altitude regions and 3. 2 for the high altitude regions.

Artificial insemination with <b>deep</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>semen</b> of exotic breeds was the means of breeding. Veterinary assistances were taken if and when necessary during parturition and newly born calves were fed colostrum ad libitum immediately after birth. Calf mortality was found highest in monsoon (36. 4 %) followed by winter (34. 6 %) and summer (29. 0 %). Mortality was higher in male calves (55. 6 %) than female (44. 4 %). Calf mortality rate was decreased with the increase in age of the calves and it was found highest in first month of life (35. 2 %). On the other hand, mortality decreased with the increase in birth weight. The predominant causes of calf mortality were pneumonia, foot and mouth disease (FMD), dystocia, calf scours etc. Among 162 expired calves, maximum 14. 8 % calves were died by pneumonia, followed by FMD (12. 3 %), dystocia (11. 7 %), calf scours (8. 6 %), black quarter (8. 0 %) etc. On an average 1012. 39 kg of milk was lost for lose of each calf...|$|E

Uterine contractility and the inflammatory reaction after <b>frozen</b> <b>semen</b> insemination were studied in two groups of mares: the abnormal group comprised of 6 old barren mares categorized in biopsy category IIB or III, and the control group including 6  reproductively normal young maiden mares in biopsy category I or IIA. All 12 mares were inseminated in the first cycle with 2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and in their second cycle with 2 mL of <b>frozen</b> <b>semen</b> containing 800 × 106 spermatozoa. Before and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 20 to 24 h after this treatment, all mares were examined by ultrasonography for intrauterine fluid accumulations (IUFA). The examinations were videotaped to {{count the number of}} uterine contractions later. Uterine fluid was obtained by tampon before treatment, and by the tampon method followed by uterine lavage after the last examination. Fluids were cultured bacteriologically, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were counted. Trypsin-inhibitor capacity (TIC), lysozyme concentration, and β-glucuronidase (BGase) and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) activities were determined in frozen-thawed tampon and lavage fluids. Both treatments induced significant neutrophilia in the uterine lumen.

The PTM influenced by liquid N 2 storage, equilibration temperature and handling straw. The {{purpose of this}} research to compare the effect of thawing duration to <b>frozen</b> <b>semen</b> quality of Limousin and Brahman. This research was done in BIBD, Agriculture Official of Blora, Central Java and Laboratory of Beef Cattle Station Research, Grati. As semen source is bull of Limousin and Brahman with age 2 - 3 years, body weight + 1200 kg. The data was observed such as: (1) pH, (2) Motility, (3) Live sperm, (4) Abnormality. The research use Randomized Complete Design (RCD) one way there are time of thawing 0, 15, 30, 45 minutes with 10 time repetition. The result of this research showed that the highest motility and live sperm (P< 0, 05) at the treatment with the duration of thawing 0 minute, there are 41, 50 % and 66, 50 % (Limousin frozen semen); 40, 00 % and 39, 58 % (Brahman <b>frozen</b> <b>semen).</b> It was concluded that shortening the time of thawing could be repairing the PTM and S/C value.

40|$|The {{productivity}} of local goat is still relatively lower {{compared to that}} of other breed for sub-tropic area. Efforts for increasing its productivity through crossbreeding with genotypes goat could be approached by technological application of artificial insemination (AI). In supporting this technology, the viability of semen for both quality and quantity is needed. Evaluation of Indonesian goat semen characterisation shows a potency for <b>frozen</b> <b>semen.</b> The survive ability of sperm in fresh semen is very limited therefore reducing the temperature to - 5 °C (chilled semen) or - 196 °C (<b>frozen</b> <b>semen)</b> could be done to maintain its survive ability. Optimalization of <b>frozen</b> <b>semen</b> could be done by diluting in Tris extender with 6 % glycerol, equilibrating for 4 hours and cooling for 4 – 5 minutes above surface of LN 2 before stored in LN 2 (- 196 °C). Thawing at > 7 °C for 30 seconds resulted in the highest percentage of mortility (52. 0 %) and survivability (65. 03 %). Chilled semen is the best alternative for artificial insemination (AI) in the field condition where the supply of container and liquid nitrogen are limited. The survivability of chilled semen could be maintained for 8 days and the highest percentage of pregnancy resulted from chilled semen stored up to 24 – 48 hours...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{transport}} of fresh and frozen spermatozoa through the genital tract of the ewe was studied in four experiments. 1. Extremely low numbers of spermatozoa were {{recovered from the}} Fallopian tubes of ewes after insemination with either fresh (diluted) or frozen spermatozoa when both were used at a concentration of 0 - 4 xlO 9 motile spermatozoa/ml, but the fertilization rate was higher with the fresh semen. High doses of oxytocin did not affect sperm transport, but significantly depressed the fertilization rate. 2. Concentrating the thawed semen before insemination resulted in increased numbers of spermatozoa recovered from the Fallopian tubes. Fresh semen resulted in even higher numbers in the tubes and an increa¬ sed proportion ofova recovered with spermatozoa on the zona pellucida. 3. Ewes were slaughtered 30 min after insemination with either fresh or <b>frozen</b> <b>semen</b> of varying concentration. The number of spermatozoa recovered from the cervix after insemination with <b>frozen</b> <b>semen</b> was dependent upon the concentration of motile spermatozoa in the in¬ seminate. At equal concentration, fresh semen was superior to <b>frozen</b> <b>semen.</b> 4. Uterine insemination at varying periods before ovulation showed that a proportion of the pellet-frozen spermatozoa survived in the genital tract with retention of fertilizing ability for 18 to 35 hr...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the frequency of}} spontaneous abortions in pregnancies achieved by artificial inseminations with donor semen (AID), with special respect {{to the use of}} cryopreserved semen and ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate. The abortion rate was found to be similar in AID series using <b>frozen</b> <b>semen</b> to those using fresh semen, nor was the rate increased in composite AID series (both fresh and <b>frozen</b> <b>semen)</b> when compared with the rate of spontaneous abortions in the general population. When clomiphene was used, the abortion rate was increased only in groups of anovulatory and irregularly ovulating women. Those AID series where all women treated are given clomiphene show no increase in abortion rates. The discussion is focused on factors that influence the abortion rate and on possible etiological factors...|$|R
