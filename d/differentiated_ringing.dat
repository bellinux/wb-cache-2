40|$|Background: Early {{recurrence}} is a {{major problem}} after hepatic resection of colorectal hepatic metastasis (CHM). Our aim was to investigate the relationship between time to recurrence after CHM resection and overall survival. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for 101 consecutive patients who underwent hepatic resection for CHM and have been followed more than 5 years. Results: Among 101 patients, 82 (81 %) had a recurrence. Overall survival of patients with recurrence within 6 months after CHM resection was significantly worse than that of patients with recurrence after more than 6 months (P < 0. 01). Overall survival was poorer when time to recurrence was shorter. One of the reasons for poor prognosis of patients with recurrence within 6 months was that only a few patients could undergo a second resection for recurrence after CHM resection. Histological type, including poorly <b>differentiated</b> signet <b>ring</b> cell or mucinous adenocarcinoma in the primary tumor, bilobar metastases, microscopic positive surgical margin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) above 15 ng/ml had predictive value for decreased recurrence-free survival after CHM resection. Conclusion: Short time to recurrence after CHM resection correlates with a poor prognosis. Histological type of poorly <b>differentiated</b> signet <b>ring</b> cell or mucinous adenocarcinoma in the primary tumor might be a predictor for early recurrence after CHM resection.

40|$|MUC 4 is a large, heavily glycosylated transmembrane mucin, that is {{implicated in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of various types of cancers. To date, no extensive study {{has been done to}} check the expression and functional significance of MUC 4 in different types of gastric adenocarcinomas. Here, we report the expression profile of MUC 4 in gastric adenocarcinomas and its function in poorly <b>differentiated</b> gastric non-signet <b>ring</b> cell carcinoma (non-SRCC) type cells. Immunohistochemical analysis using tissue microarray (TMA) showed a significant difference in MUC 4 expression between normal adjacent (n= 45) and gastric adenocarcinoma (n= 83; P< 0. 001). MUC 4 expression was not associated with tumour type, stage or with the degree of differentiation. To gain further insight into the significance of MUC 4 expression in gastric non-SRCC cells, MUC 4 was ectopically expressed in AGS, a poorly <b>differentiated</b> gastric non-signet <b>ring</b> cell line. The MUC 4 overexpressing cells (AGS-MUC 4) showed a significant increase (P< 0. 005) in cell motility and a decrease in cellular aggregation as compared with the vector-transfected cells. Furthermore, in vivo tumorigenicity analysis revealed that animals transplanted with the MUC 4 overexpressing cells (AGS-MUC 4) had a greater incidence of tumours (83 %) in comparison to empty vector control (17 %). In addition, the expression of MUC 4 resulted in enhanced expression of total cellular ErbB 2 and phosphorylated ErbB 2. In conclusion, our results showed that MUC 4 is overexpressed in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues, and that it has a role in promoting aggressive properties in poorly differentiated gastric non-SRCC cells through the activation of the ErbB 2 oncoprotein...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relationships}} between the cortex functional organization and genetic expression (as provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas). Previous work suggests that functional cortical networks (resting state and task based) are organized as two large networks (differentiated by their preferred information processing mode) shaped like two rings. The first ring [...] Visual-Sensorimotor-Auditory (VSA) [...] comprises visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor cortices that process real time world interactions. The second ring [...] Parieto-Temporo-Frontal (PTF) [...] comprises parietal, temporal, and frontal regions with networks dedicated to cognitive functions, emotions, biological needs, and internally driven rhythms. We found [...] with correspondence analysis [...] that the patterns of expression of the 938 genes most differentially expressed across the cortex organized the cortex into two sets of regions that match the two rings. We confirmed this result using discriminant correspondence analysis by showing that the genetic profiles of cortical regions can reliably predict to what ring these regions belong. We found that several of the proteins [...] coded by genes that most <b>differentiate</b> the <b>rings</b> [...] were involved in neuronal information processing such as ionic channels and neurotransmitter release. The systematic study of families of genes revealed specific proteins within families preferentially expressed in each ring. The results showed strong congruence between the preferential expression of subsets of genes, temporal properties of the proteins they code, and the preferred processing modes of the rings. Ionic channels and release-related proteins more expressed in the VSA ring favor temporal precision of fast evoked neural transmission (Sodium channels SCNA 1, SCNB 1 potassium channel KCNA 1, calcium channel CACNA 2 D 2, Synaptotagmin SYT 2, Complexin CPLX 1, Synaptobrevin VAMP 1). Conversely, genes expressed in the PTF ring favor slower, sustained, or rhythmic activation (Sodium channels SCNA 3, SCNB 3, SCN 9 A potassium channels KCNF 1, KCNG 1) and facilitate spontaneous transmitter release (calcium channel CACNA 1 H, Synaptotagmins SYT 5, Complexin CPLX 3, and synaptobrevin VAMP 2) ...|$|R

Results: A total of 289 baseline scans were performed in this 55 month period. Of these, 171 (59 %) were males. The mean age was 52. 6 years (standard deviation SD +/- 12. 4 years). On histological review, 214 were squamous cell carcinomas (SCCa) and 75 were adenocarcinomas. Of the SCCa, 15. 9 % were poorly differentiated, 70. 6 % were moderately differentiated, and 13. 5 % were well differentiated.

40|$|Very {{little is}} known of the {{precursors}} of the dipicolinic acid (pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarboxylic acid) in bacterial spores. C' 4 - 2, 6 -diaminopimelic acid was shown {{to contribute to the}} formation of dipicolinic acid in Bacillus cereus var. mycoides (Perry and Foster, 1955; Foster, 1956) but the efficiency of the conversion was low, possibly because of a slow penetration of the cells by the exogenously supplied, labeled compound. Also, the data did not <b>differentiate</b> between a <b>ring</b> closure of the intact carbon chain and a break-down to smaller precursors of dipicolinic acid. In other organisms, the related a-picolinic acid (pyridine- 2 -carboxylic acid) and nicotinic acid (pyridine- 3 -carboxylic acid) are produced from 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid by steps that are still unclarified (Mehler, 1956; Meister, 1957; Yanof-sky, 1955). A nonenzymatic reaction of an inter-mediate may occur to form quinolinic acid (pyridine- 2, 3 -dicarboxylic acid) (Mehler, 1956). Presently available information on the biosyn-thesis of pyridine rings does not permit a decision as to whether an identical mechanism is operative {{in the formation of the}} above pyridine derivatives. The present study was designed to reveal the extent to which several common metabolites contribute carbon to the biosynthesis of dipico-linic acid in sporulating bacteria. Two types of experiments were used.

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} the clinical features and outcomes of infrequently reported leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) of gastric cancer. METHODS: We analyzed 54 cases of cytologically confirmed gastric LMC at four institutions from 1994 to 2007. RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 32 : 22, and the patients {{ranged in age}} from 28 to 78 years (median, 48. 5 years). The majority of patients had advanced disease at initial diagnosis of gastric cancer. The clinical or pathologic tumor, node and metastasis stage of the primary gastric cancer was IV in 38 patients (70 %). The median interval from diagnosis of the primary malignancy to the diagnosis of LMC was 6. 3 mo, ranging between 0 and 73. 1 mo. Of the initial endoscopic findings for the 45 available patients, 23 (51 %) of the patients were Bormann type III and 15 (33 %) patients were Bormann type IV. Pathologically, 94 % of cases proved to be poorly <b>differentiated</b> adenocarcinomas. Signet <b>ring</b> cell component was also observed in 40 % of patients. Headache (85 %) and nausea/vomiting (58 %) were the most common presenting symptoms of LMC. A gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was conducted in 51 patients. Leptomeningeal enhancement was noted in 45 cases (82 %). Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy was administered to 36 patients-primarily methotrexate alone (61 %), but also in combination with hydrocortisone/± Ara-C (39 %). The median number of IT treatments was 7 (range, 1 - 18). Concomitant radiotherapy was administered to 18 patients, and concomitant chemotherapy to seven patients. Seventeen patients (46 %) achieved cytological negative conversion. Median overall survival duration from the diagnosis of LMC was 6. 7 wk (95 % CI: 4. 3 - 9. 1 wk). In the univariate analysis of survival duration, hemoglobin, IT chemotherapy, and cytological negative conversion showed superior survival duration (P = 0. 038, P = 0. 010, and P = 0. 002, respectively). However, in our multivariate analysis, only cytological negative conversion was predictive of relatively longer survival duration (3. 6, 6. 7 and 14. 6 wk, P = 0. 030, RR: 0. 415, 95 % CI: 0. 188 - 0. 918). CONCLUSION: Although these patients had a fatal clinical course, cytologic negative conversion by IT chemotherapy may improve survival...|$|R
40|$|Background: Colon {{cancer is}} a common {{malignancy}} with its incidence reportedly rising in Asian countries, including Pakistan. There are no comprehensive data available from Pakistan which focus on associations of various factors with long-term survival of colon cancer. We therefore present an analysis of findings from our centre. Methodology: In this retrospective study adult Patients with colon cancer diagnosed through 2000 - 2003 were included. A comprehensive questionnaire was filled for each individual through review medical and pathology reports. Long term survival data was collected from contactable Patients or their relatives. Results: A total of 93 Patients were assessed, 57 males and 36 females (M: F= 1. 58 : 1). Mean age of diagnosis was 54 years. Of the total, 49. 5 % of the Patients had right sided (mortality rate 51. 6 %), 10. 8 % had transverse colon, (mortality rate 37. 5 %), 7. 5 % had descending colon (mortality rate 66. 7 %) and 32. 2 % had sigmoid colon (mortality rate 40. 9 %) cancers. Stage I disease on diagnosis was found in 16 %, stage II in 42. 7 (mortality 40 %) and stage III in 41. 3 % (mortality 70 %). Tumors were well differentiated in 20. 2 % (mortality 42. 9 %), moderately differentiated in 61. 9 % (mortality 43 %) and poorly differentiated in 17. 9 % (mortality 70 %). In 36. 3 % of the Patients less than 12 lymph nodes were removed (mortality 55 % Vs 43 % in Patients with removed). Margins were free in most Patients but a radial margin was reported in only 44 %. Most Patients had pure adenocarcinoma while a mucinous type differentiation was seen in 19. 7 %, 3 % had signet ring morphology, 1. 5 % adeno-squamous carcinoma and similar number with neuroendocrine differentiation. Overall 5 year all cause mortality for all stages combined was 46. 9 %. Conclusion: Colon cancer in Pakistan commonly presents at an advanced stage, there is a male preponderance, and relatively mean younger age at presentation for males is seen. Advanced stage and lymph node involvement along with poorly <b>differentiated</b> pathology, signet <b>ring</b> or mucinous morphology, location in descending colon, positive surgical margins and removal of less than twelve lymph nodes are factors associated with poor long term survival.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Polyamide drugs, such as netropsin, distamycin {{and their}} lexitropsin derivatives, can be {{inserted}} {{into a narrow}} B-DNA minor groove to form 1 : 1 complexes that can distinguish AT base pairs from GC, but cannot detect end-for-end base-pair reversals such as TA for AT. In contrast, 2 : 1 side-by-side polyamide drug complexes potentially are capable of such discrimination. Imidazole (Im) and pyrrole (Py) rings side-by-side read a GC base pair with the Im ring recognizing the guanine side. But {{the reason for this}} specific G–Im association is unclear because the guanine NH 2 group sits {{in the center of the}} groove. A 2 : 1 drug:DNA complex that presents Im at both ends of a GC base pair should help unscramble the issue of imidazole reading specificity. Results: We have determined the crystal structure of a 2 : 1 complex of a di-imidazole lexitropsin (DIM), an analogue of distamycin, and a DNA decamer with the sequence C-A-T-G-G-C-C-A-T-G. The two DIM molecules sit antiparallel to one another in a broad minor groove, with their cationic tails widely separated. Im rings of one drug molecule stack against amide groups of the other. DIM 1 rests against nucleotides C 7 A 8 T 9 G 10 of strand 1 of the helix, whereas DIM 2 rests against G 14 G 15 C 16 C 17 on strand 2. All DIM amide nitrogens donate hydrogen bonds to N and O atoms on the floor of the DNA groove and, in addition, the two Im rings on DIM 2 accept hydrogen bonds from guanine N 2 amines, thereby providing specific reading. The guanine N 2 amine can bond to Im on its own side of the groove, but not on the cytosine side, because of limits on close approach of the two Im rings and the geometry of sp 2 hybridization about the amide nitrogen. Conclusions: Im and Py rings distinguish AT from GC base pairs because of steric factors involving the bulk of the guanine amine, and the ability of Im to form a hydrogen bond with the amine. Side-by-side Im and Py <b>rings</b> <b>differentiate</b> GC from CG base pairs because of tight steric contacts and sp 2 hybridization at the amine nitrogen atom, with the favored conformations being G/Im,Py/C and C/Py,Im/G. Discrimination between AT and TA base pairs may be possible using bulkier rings, such as thiazole to select the A end of the base pair...|$|R
