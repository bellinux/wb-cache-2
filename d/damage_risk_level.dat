40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 45 - 47) A {{study was}} undertaken {{to measure and}} describe noise levels in which food service workers function. A General Radio Company precision sound-level meter {{was used to measure}} noise levels in ten volume feeding operations ranging in output from 1, 000 to 9, 000 meals per day. Sound pressure levels (SPL's) were taken on the A weighing scale of the sound-level meter at slow response for background noise and at fast response for impact noise, noting the rate per minute at which the impacts occurred. Sound pressure levels were taken at all work stations and in areas where communication, supervisory or clerical work took place at times of maximum operation, and in dining areas at or near capacity occupation. The results are compared to governmental codes for permissible noise exposure and to speech interference levels. At only one work station in one operation was the background noise SPL in excess of the <b>damage</b> <b>risk</b> <b>level</b> of 90 dBA. The station had a SPL of 99 dB, to which a worker can only be exposed {{for two and a half}} hours without being in violation of Walsh-Healey Act and the Noise Control Safety Orders for the State of California and without risking hearing loss. All pot and dish machine operations had background noise levels averaging 82 dBA and impact noise here was highest and most frequent in terms of occurrence per minute. A large battery of steam equipment also produced a high SPL of 81 dBA. Using 65 dB as a maximum background noise level for a successful and reliable conversation face-to-face and by telephone, open food production areas at maximum operation are in most instances too noisy for satisfactory communication. Using 65 dB as a maximum background noise level for successful and reliable conversation face-to-face and by telephone, open food production areas at maximum operation are in most instances too noisy for satisfactory communication. Enclosed areas create a good environment for communication with levels between 52 and 59 dBA. The fourteen partially enclosed areas measured had noise levels of 57 to 72 dBA. Impact noise higher than background noise occurred in all work stations with the rate of occurrence per minute increasing as the activity increased, Measurements indicated that most impact noises ranged from 4 to 22 dB higher than the background noise and occurred at a rate of from eight to forty-five per minute. Dining areas near capacity had noise levels from 65 to 75 dBA, with the principal noise source being conversation of the diners and movement of people...|$|E

The study target was set to reduce the Lead PPM for a test machine by simulating the proposed preventive maintenance plan. The simulation optimization approach based on evolutionary algorithms was employed for the preventive maintenance technique selection process to select the PM interval that gave the best total cost and Lead PPM values. The research methodology includes procedures such as following the priority of critical components in test machine, analyzing the <b>damage</b> and <b>risk</b> <b>level</b> by using Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), calculating the suitable replacement period through reliability estimation, and optimizing the preventive maintenance plan.

40|$|The flood {{damage of}} {{engineering}} structures in rivers because of scour near pumping stations, bridge structures – abutments, guide banks, dams, etc. leads to considerable environmental and economical losses. The reason of scour is multiple floods and therefore scour hole parameters near structures under clear-water conditions are summed up and increase from flood to flood. When depth of scour hole reaches critical value for foundations, structure usually is destroyed. To estimate the engineering structures safety and stability the flood <b>damage</b> <b>risk</b> assessment {{should be performed}} and in necessary cases protection measures {{should be used to}} prevent engineering structures from failure. A method for flood <b>damage</b> <b>risk</b> assessment at abutments is presented.

The theoretical analysis of the equilibrium depth of scour calculation method is made. The flood <b>damage</b> <b>risk</b> factor of abutment can be calculated as a ratio between hs, the scour depth during/after the multiple floods of certain probability, and hequil., the equilibrium depth of scour hole at the abutments of the same probability.

We have used building simulation models to calculate the expected indoor climate in historic buildings subjected to a varying outdoor climate.

40|$|Quantification {{of frost}} <b>damage</b> <b>risk</b> is {{important}} in planning {{the development of new}} orchard areas and for decision-making on design and installation of frost control systems. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a comprehensive method to quantify frost <b>damage</b> <b>risk</b> in different sweet cherry production areas of South Patagonia and to estimate the potential impact of frost control systems on risk reduction. Lack of historical weather data required a theoretical-empirical approach. Frost damage for any specific day of the season was assumed to occur when the minimum temperature on that day was below the specific lethal temperature for the phenological stage predicted at that moment (based on phenological models). Frost damage probability was estimated for each production location of South Patagonia as the frequency of seasons in which at least one damaging frost (damaging 90 % of the reproductive organs) occurs, at any time during the growing season until harvest. Frost <b>damage</b> <b>risk</b> was compared among cultivars and locations. Finally, the effect of active frost control methods on frost <b>damage</b> <b>risk</b> reduction was analyzed. There was very little difference in frost <b>damage</b> <b>risk</b> among cultivars, although 'Sunburst' was the cultivar with the lowest risk. The most risky locations were Los Antiguos and Esquel, while Comodoro Rivadavia was the safest location. The frequency of years with at least one killing frost decreased dramatically when the minimum temperature was increased by 3 °C, using active frost control systems. The methodology presented appears useful to identify the main and secondary variables affecting frost <b>damage</b> <b>risk.</b> Thus, this type of quantitative analysis can support growers in decision-making on required investments and operational costs of the equipment for frost control, on the basis of potential impact of a particular control system on mean yields and yield stability.

This {{problem can be}} reduced by using risk reduction strategies that continuously guide activities toward lowest possible risk.

It was a challenge for the method to secure robustness against unavoidable high uncertainty and to secure flexibility that embraced multiple indicators for different aspects governing the <b>risk</b> <b>level.</b> This methodology was to protect real existing targets, denoted Protection Units (PU), against adverse effects and applied knowledge about all PUs, or a representative fraction of those.
