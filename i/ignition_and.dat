40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> of wood is {{of great}} importance to understand the initial stage of combustion, helping control the occurrence and spread of unwanted building and forestry fires. The development of a thermal-balanced model is introduced for examining the analytical relationship between the <b>ignition</b> time <b>and</b> external heat flux. The critical heat flux, {{one of the important}} fire-retardant characteristics of combustible solid, is determined from a correlation study between the <b>ignition</b> time <b>and</b> external heat flux. One of the thermal-balanced integral models, considering the effect of surface heat losses, average absorptivity and moisture content, is employed to give the prediction of surface temperature rise, <b>ignition</b> time <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature of the Aspen. The results show that the model readily <b>and</b> satisfactorily predicts <b>ignition</b> temperature <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> time of wood with different moisture contents.

40|$|Fire, {{being both}} {{a natural and}} {{cultural}} phenomenon, presents problems in disentangling the historical effect of humans from that of climate change. Here, we investigate {{the potential impact of}} humans on boreal fire regimes from a perspective of fuels, <b>ignitions</b> <b>and</b> culture. Two ways for a low technology culture to impact the fire regime are as follows: (i) by altering the number of <b>ignitions</b> <b>and</b> their spatial distribution and timing and (ii) by hindering fire spread. Different cultures should be expected to have quite different impacts on the fire regimes. In northern Fennoscandia, there is evidence for fire regime changes associated with the following: a reindeer herding culture associated with few ignitions above the natural; an era of cattle husbandry with dramatically increased <b>ignitions</b> <b>and</b> somewhat higher fire frequency; and a timber exploitation era with decreasing fire sizes and diminishing fire frequency. In other regions of the boreal zone, such schemes can look quite different, but we suggest that {{a close look at the}} resource extraction and land use of different cultures should be part of any analysis of past fire regimes...|$|R
25|$|Development of {{automotive}} technology was rapid, {{due in part}} to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric <b>ignition</b> <b>and</b> the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910–1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.|$|E
25|$|A revised grille {{with fewer}} {{vertical}} bars and revised taillight lenses marked the 1975 Grand Prix. Changes included {{the addition of}} GM's High Energy electronic <b>ignition</b> <b>and</b> a catalytic converter that mandated the use of unleaded gasoline. Radial tires became standard on all models.|$|E
25|$|Also in April 2008, Epitaph Records {{announced}} that the label would be reissuing <b>Ignition</b> <b>and</b> Smash; both albums were remastered, and Smash contained a new 24-page booklet.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} for a risk analysis for leakages of flammable refrigerants into a poorly ventilated three-dimensional space. It also presents several test cases of risk analyses on flammability <b>and</b> <b>ignitions</b> to a leaked refrigerant. Concentration of a leaked flammable refrigerant at a leakage window, Cin, {{is determined by}} mass balance, providing information on the capacity of an air-refrigerant mixture, and the leakage rate. Five flammable refrigerants, 2, 3, 3, 3 -tetrafluoropropene (R- 1234 yf), difluoromethane (R- 32), 1, 1 -difluoroethane (R- 152 a), propane (R- 290), and ammonia (R- 717) {{have been used to}} analyze risk of <b>ignitions</b> <b>and</b> flammability. A computational fluid mechanics (CFD) technique has been applied to the present risk analyses, and temporal development of velocity, concentration, and temperature profiles of an air-refrigerant mixture in a three-dimensional space are computed. The obtained concentration profiles are compared with the lower flammability limits to analyze detailed risk of <b>ignitions</b> <b>and</b> flammability. The results of this study demonstrate that risk of ignitions can be investigated successfully based on the current CFD technique. This study furthermore shows that risk of <b>ignitions</b> <b>and</b> flammability is different depending on the flammability characteristics of each refrigerant. This study proposes an indicator, the Safety Index, to evaluate risk of ignitions in individual cases easily as screening of flammability without performing threedimensional calculations based on a CFD technique...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is a key}} step of {{quantitative}} risk analysis (QRA) to estimate ignition probability of flammable materials after leakage accidents. This paper reviews the available literature and expert opinion on how to evaluate <b>and</b> determine <b>ignition</b> probability value, <b>and</b> it was detailedly discussed on the main influencing factors of ignition probability, including flammable material properties, mass flow rate of flammable materials spillage, <b>ignition</b> resources <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> controls. Moreover, the operational <b>and</b> practical <b>ignition</b> probability value could be estimated from the all way of classifications of flammable material, mass flow rate, ignition resources, hazardous areas <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> prevention <b>and</b> control measure. Furthermore, the more practical ignition probability model was put forward that the ignition probability was the maximum value of the probability decided by material properties (PMP), mass flow rate(PQ) <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> resources(PIS) with the factor of preventing <b>and</b> controlling <b>ignition</b> (KIC). Finally, the further research was proposed to assign some feasible weigh factors of the ignition probability for flammable materials after leakage accidents...|$|R
25|$|Cadillac was {{the first}} volume {{manufacturer}} of a fully enclosed car in 1906. Cadillac participated in the 1908 interchangeability test in the United Kingdom, and was awarded the Dewar Trophy for the most important advancement {{of the year in}} the automobile industry. In 1912, Cadillac {{was the first}} automobile manufacturer to incorporate an electrical system enabling starting, <b>ignition,</b> <b>and</b> lighting.|$|E
25|$|With the {{universal}} adoption of electrical starting for automobiles, {{and the availability}} of a large battery to provide a constant source of electricity, magneto systems were abandoned for systems which interrupted current at battery voltage, using an ignition coil to step the voltage up {{to the needs of the}} <b>ignition,</b> <b>and</b> a distributor to route the ensuing pulse to the correct spark plug at the correct time.|$|E
25|$|Its {{cancellation}} in the early-1980s {{signaled the}} decline and eventual close of All Star Pro-Wrestling {{by the end}} of the decade. Apart from the short run of The Main Event made for TV3 in 1990, locally produced and televised professional wrestling would remain absent in New Zealand until the appearance of Impact Pro Wrestling's IPW <b>Ignition</b> <b>and</b> Kiwi Pro Wrestling's Off the Ropes in the mid-2000s.|$|E

25|$|A flare {{goes through}} three main stages: <b>ignition,</b> deployment, <b>and</b> decoying.|$|R
25|$|Development resumed, {{to improve}} {{emissions}} durability and ready the engine for more stringent 1975 standards. The fuel injection was redesigned for better air distribution. High-energy electronic <b>ignition</b> <b>and</b> mandatory catalytic converter were added; also a Pulse Air system, functionally {{the same as}} an air pump but without the pump's six-horsepower loss. A larger catalytic converter further guarded against power loss. More advanced ignition timing, and the lead-free fuel required with the converter, prevented exhaust-valve failure.|$|E
25|$|Later {{investigation}} by Captain John H Iarrobino of Oriskany and {{analysis by the}} Naval Ammunition Depot in Crane, Indiana, showed that one in every thousand flares could ignite accidentally if jarred. Five crew members were court-martialed {{as a result of}} the incident but were acquitted. After this incident and others, the flare design used by the Navy was changed to a safer design immune to accidental <b>ignition,</b> <b>and</b> crews were increased to stabilize numbers so all activities could be properly supervised.|$|E
25|$|To {{compete with}} Volkswagen's Golf GTI, a hot hatch {{version of the}} Mark III was developed– the XR3. Initially this {{featured}} a tuned version of the 1.6L CVH engine fitted with a twin-choke Weber carburettor, uprated suspension and numerous cosmetic alterations. It lacked a five-speed transmission and fuel injection. Fuel injection finally arrived in October 1982 (creating the XR3i), eight months behind the limited edition (8,659 examples), racetrack-influenced RS1600i. The Cologne-developed RS received a more powerful engine with , thanks to computerized <b>ignition</b> <b>and</b> a modified head {{as well as the}} fuel injection.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} {{steering lock}} <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> key was fitted to the steering column, which replaced the dashboard mounted <b>ignition</b> switch <b>and</b> charismatic push button starter.

25|$|This is an {{experimental}} method that employs {{a number of}} vertical air injection wells above a horizontal production well located {{at the base of}} the bitumen pay zone. An initial Steam Cycle similar to CSS is used to prepare the bitumen for <b>ignition</b> <b>and</b> mobility. Following that cycle, air is injected into the vertical wells, igniting the upper bitumen and mobilizing (through heating) the lower bitumen to flow into the production well. It is expected that COGD will result in water savings of 80% compared to SAGD.|$|E
25|$|A {{great debate}} {{broke out in}} the ICF {{establishment}} as a result. One group suggested that they attempt to build a laser of this power; Leonardo Mascheroni and Claude Phipps designed a new type of hydrogen fluoride laser that was pumped by high-energy electrons that would be able to reach the 100MJ limit. Others used the same data and new versions of their computer simulations based on these experiments that suggested that careful shaping of the laser pulse and using more beams spread more evenly showed that <b>ignition</b> <b>and</b> net energy gains could be achieved with a laser between 5 and 10MJ.|$|E
25|$|Like any {{magnetic}} device, compasses {{are affected}} by nearby ferrous materials, {{as well as by}} strong local electromagnetic forces. Compasses used for wilderness land navigation should not be used in proximity to ferrous metal objects or electromagnetic fields (car electrical systems, automobile engines, steel pitons, etc.) as that can affect their accuracy. Compasses are particularly difficult to use accurately in or near trucks, cars or other mechanized vehicles even when corrected for deviation by the use of built-in magnets or other devices. Large amounts of ferrous metal combined with the on-and-off electrical fields caused by the vehicle's <b>ignition</b> <b>and</b> charging systems generally result in significant compass errors.|$|E

25|$|Rocketry in the Soviet Union {{also began}} with amateur societies, {{foremost}} was the Group for the Study of Reactive Propulsion (GIRD) headed by Friedrich Zander and Sergei Korolev. From 1931 to 1937 in the Soviet Union, extensive scientific work on rocket engine design {{occurred at the}} Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL) in Leningrad, which was merged with GIRD in 1933 bringing rocketry fully under government control. The well-funded and -staffed laboratory built over 100 experimental engines {{under the direction of}} Valentin Glushko. The work included regenerative cooling, hypergolic propellant <b>ignition,</b> <b>and</b> fuel injector designs that included swirling and bi-propellant mixing injectors. However, Glushko's arrest during Stalinist purges in 1938 curtailed the development.|$|E
25|$|The launch {{came very}} close to failure—a postflight {{examination}} of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at <b>ignition</b> <b>and</b> the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2° six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.|$|E
25|$|In {{this form}} {{it is often}} mixed with small amounts of {{hydrogen}} sulfide and mercaptans which will give the unburned gas an offensive smell easily detected by the human nose. In this way, butane leaks can easily be identified. While hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans are toxic, they are present in levels so low that suffocation and fire hazard by the butane becomes a concern far before toxicity. Most commercially available butane also contains {{a certain amount of}} contaminant oil which can be removed through filtration but which will otherwise leave a deposit at the point of <b>ignition</b> <b>and</b> may eventually block the uniform flow of gas. Contaminants are not used in fragrance extraction and butane gasses can cause gas explosions in poorly ventilated areas if leaks go unnoticed and are ignited by spark or flame.|$|E
