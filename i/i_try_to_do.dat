"For me, it's {{really easy}} to write {{depressive}} songs and that's why I never do that. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> songs {{that are a}} bit happier and a bit more complicated.

I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it. I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit of}} melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E

Doyle said the band had wanted it to happen [...] "for ages" [...] and that people would {{see it as a}} {{surprise}} collaboration. Taylor said, [...] "I crave confusion and quite like people to be surprised. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that in the words and music and try to be what people don't think we are. Robert is someone we have liked for much longer than people realise. We feel closer to people in a different field, age or era." [...] The album features Emma Smith, who had previously joined with Hot Chip to play violin and saxophone on their first two albums.|$|E

500|$|Michele bases Rachel {{on herself}} {{when she was}} younger, and also draws {{inspiration}} from the film Election, and the Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester). She has explained, [...] " [...] is shady, but you still love her. She's still vulnerable. That's what <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't considered beautiful, and when I {{was in high school}} it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be. And in four years, high school will be over and all of that crap won't matter anyway." ...|$|E

Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro stated: [...] "I was very careful how I built the movie. One {{of the other things}} I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's {{not going to be a}} sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character." [...] Noting that the other actors were exhausted and [...] "destroyed physically" [...] by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: [...] "The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained… I asked Rinko her secret and she said 'I think of gummi bears and flowers.' <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that in my life now."

500|$|Motivated {{by her own}} {{battle to}} gain {{credibility}} as {{a woman in a}} field dominated by male astronomers, [...] Rubin encouraged girls interested in investigating the universe to pursue their dreams. She faced discouraging comments on her choice of study throughout her life, but persevered, supported by family and colleagues. In addition to astronomy, Rubin was a force for greater recognition of women in the sciences and for scientific literacy. She and Burbidge advocated together for more women in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on review panels, and in academic searches. She said that despite her struggles with the NAS, she continued to be dissatisfied with the number of women who are elected each year, and called it [...] "the saddest part of [...] life". Rubin was Jewish, and saw no conflict between science and religion. In an interview, she stated: [...] "In my own life, my science and my religion are separate. I'm Jewish, and so religion to me is a kind of moral code and a kind of history. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> my science in a moral way, and, I believe that, ideally, science should be looked upon as something that helps us understand our role in the universe." ...|$|E

500|$|From a {{historical}} NBA perspective, the rivalry between Chamberlain and his perennial nemesis Bill Russell is {{cited as the}} greatest on-court rivalry of all time. There were three NBA Finals matchups in the rivalry between Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, but they played different positions and did not guard each other. Russell's Celtics won seven of eight playoff series against Chamberlain's Warriors, 76ers, and Lakers teams, and went 57–37 against them {{in the regular season}} and 29–20 in the playoffs. Russell's teams won all four seventh games against Chamberlain's—the combined margin was nine points. Chamberlain outscored Russell 30 to 14.2 per game and outrebounded him 28.2 to 22.9 in the regular season, and also in the playoffs, he outscored him 25.7 to 14.9 and outrebounded him 28 to 24.7. The comparison between the two is often simplified to a great player (Chamberlain) versus a player who makes his team great (Russell), an individualist against a team player. In [...] when Chamberlain averaged 50.4 points per game, he noted that Boston did not rely on Russell's scoring, and he could concentrate on defense and rebounding. He wished people would understand that their roles were different. Chamberlain said, [...] "I've got to hit forty points or so, or this team is in trouble. I must score—understand? After that I play defense and get the ball off the boards. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them all, best I can, but scoring comes first." [...] Russell won 11 NBA titles in his career while Chamberlain won two. Chamberlain was named All-NBA first team seven times to Russell's three, but Russell was named league MVP—then selected by players and not the press—five times against Chamberlain's four. Russell and Chamberlain were friends in private life. Russell never considered Chamberlain his rival and disliked the term, instead pointing out that they rarely talked about basketball when they were alone. When Chamberlain died in 1999, Chamberlain's nephew stated that Russell was the second person he was ordered to break the news to. The two did not speak for two decades after Russell criticized Chamberlain after Game 7 of the 1969 Finals. Russell apologized privately to Chamberlain and later publicly.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Huang {{stood by}} her advice, saying, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is give advice from experience, {{and to give}} the advice that would serve the writer well into the {{long-term}} future.

2500|$|Bourdieu {{also played}} a crucial role in the popularisation of {{correspondence}} analysis and particularly multiple correspondence analysis. Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are, like his sociology, inherently relational. [...] "I use Correspondence Analysis very much, because I think that it is essentially a relational procedure whose philosophy fully expresses what in my view constitutes social reality. It is a procedure that 'thinks' in relations, as <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with the concept of field," [...] Bourdieu said, in the preface to The Craft of Sociology.|$|E

2500|$|Ledley {{was played}} in an {{unfamiliar}} role at left-back during his first month at Celtic, a position he had only previously played in once or twice.

2500|$|Bjelland {{has been}} noted by music critics for her unique {{screaming}} vocals. Journalist Richard Cromelin noted in a 1992 Los Angeles Times profile that [...] "She retches her enraged lyrics, her screams skid across the beat and collide with the blunt riffs. Her voice erupts into laughs and gargles, then croons down low with eerie detachment." [...] Commenting on her musical aspirations, Bjelland said: [...] "It should sound like nothing that you've heard before. That's my intention... Like my singing, all <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is I just push myself into things where I think I can't reach notes and stuff.

[...] In Babes in Toyland, Bjelland's instrumentation and songwriting have been described as [...] "ugly, crunching post-punk," [...] supplemented by [...] "rudimentary" [...] guitar chords.|$|E
2500|$|Scarry {{borrowed}} Paul Brown's coaching techniques at Western Reserve, instituting well-organized practices there.

[...] With no good passer or runner and a lack of depth, Reserve's Red Cats performed poorly in Scarry's first season, but he was praised for making the most out of a thin squad. In his second year in 1949, the Red Cats improved to a 4–5–1 record, and Scarry was expected to stay on for a third season. The following year, however, he resigned to take an assistant coaching position at Santa Clara University in California under former Browns assistant Dick Gallagher.|$|E
