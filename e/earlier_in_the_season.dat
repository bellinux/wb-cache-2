5|$|On July 11, 2014, Allen re-signed {{with the}} Pacers. He was most {{effective}} <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> due to injuries of other players. He missed a January 31, 2015 {{game against the}} Sacramento Kings due to a sore knee. Allen mainly played as a backup power forward and averaged 5.0 points and 5.1 rebounds in his first full season with the Pacers.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton had a {{prolific}} 1933–34 Australian {{season in which}} he scored 655 runs at 59.54 with two centuries and four fifties. He scored 105 in the Test trial for Richardson's XI and then struck 145 against arch-rivals Victoria in the last match of the season; New South Wales were unable to force a victory and thus ceded the Sheffield Shield to their southern neighbours.

5|$|In Division I and Division III National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) hockey, {{the fighters}} {{are given a}} Game Disqualification, which is an {{ejection}} from the game and a suspension for as many games as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications {{during the course of}} a season. For example, if a player engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> he is ejected from that game and suspended for his team's next two games. This automatic suspension has made fighting in college hockey relatively rare.|$|E
5|$|In week 12 of the 2008 season, Maryland {{possessed a}} 7–3 record and stood atop the ACC Atlantic Division. However, the Terps lost their final two regular season games and slid to a four-way tie for {{third place in}} the division. <b>Earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> Maryland {{defeated}} four ranked opponents, a feat surpassed only by the two teams that played in the BCS National Championship Game, Florida and Oklahoma—and those each played an extra game with their conference championships. Maryland spent three weeks ranked in the top-25 of the Associated Press Poll.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had {{finished}} fifth during the 1980–81 Football League, thus {{they needed to}} win the final {{to ensure that they}} would compete in the European Cup the following season. Despite this, Liverpool had won the Football League Cup for the first time <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> defeating West Ham United 2–1 in a replay after the final finished 1–1. Real Madrid {{had finished}} second in the 1980–81 La Liga, they had qualified for the UEFA Cup as a result, but victory would enable them to compete in the European Cup the following season.|$|E
50|$|Another {{potential}} buffer is {{to plant}} warm-season perennial grasses such as switchgrass, {{which do not}} grow <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> This reduces <b>the</b> area that the livestock can use <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> {{making it easier for}} them {{to keep up with the}} cool-season grasses. The animals then use the warm-season grasses during the heat of the summer, and the cool-season grasses recover for fall grazing.|$|R

5|$|Originally to air on CBS with a {{start time}} of 2:30p.m. CST, CBS reassigned the game for primetime {{television}} at 7:00p.m. CST {{as part of a}} trade announced October 23.

5|$|Prior to the match, Queen's Park and Blackburn Rovers had met {{on three}} occasions; {{each time the}} game ended in a draw. Queen's went into the match as the favourites, being the most {{successful}} club in Scotland at that point and having developed a style of play involving short passing which was not in use in England. They had been awarded the Scottish Cup <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> after Vale of Leven declined {{to participate in the}} final due to illnesses suffered by a number of their players.|$|E
5|$|The Boston College drive {{began on}} its own 35-yard line. With little time remaining, Boston College would have to {{complete}} one or more Hail Mary passes. Although the odds of completing one such pass, let alone several, were very low, many Virginia Tech fans remained worried, as Boston College had previously beaten the Hokies in similar circumstances <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> Matt Ryan's first two passes fell incomplete, and his third was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi and returned 40yards for a Virginia Tech touchdown.|$|E
