She also explained that the theme of {{the song was}} freedom, saying that the song's lyric [...] "Remember who you really are" [...] was [...] "exactly everything you could assume it means". Another inspiration for the song came from Lee's life, [...] "That song is me talking to myself about not being afraid and coming back to this thing and living the life I was born to live. Sometimes, it takes a lot to do this. And <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>love</b> it very much, but there is always that fear of putting yourself under the microscope." ...|$|E

The song's title alludes to the American proverb [...] "When in Rome, do as the Romans do", [...] and Chris Thile, the song's author, said [...] "The idea behind the song– and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>love</b> it! - is if there is {{something}} better, it's worth leaning towards just a little bit because you'll have a great time here regardless." [...] Critics commented on the song favorably, with George Graham saying that [...] "When in Rome" [...] has [...] "rock energy level and some sonic manipulation, with hints of old-time Appalachian music in the fiddle, while the lyrics are definitely in the rock mode." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1945 British general election, Churchill's Conservative {{party was}} soundly {{defeated}} by the Labour party of Clement Attlee. Elizabeth's political views were rarely disclosed, but a letter she wrote in 1947 described Attlee's [...] "high hopes of a socialist heaven on earth" [...] as fading and presumably describes those who voted for him as [...] "poor people, so many half-educated and bemused. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>love</b> them." [...] Woodrow Wyatt thought her [...] "much more pro-Conservative" [...] than {{other members of the}} royal family, but she later told him, [...] "I like the dear old Labour Party."

500|$|To {{escape his}} persecutors Pinfold disembarks at Alexandria and flies on to Colombo, but the voices pursue him. Pinfold has now {{reconciled}} himself to their presence {{and is able}} to ignore them, or even converse rationally with them. After a brief stay in Colombo he returns to England. On the flight home he is told by [...] "Angel" [...] that the whole episode was a scientific experiment that got out of hand; if Pinfold will keep silent about his experiences, he is told, he will never be bothered by the voices again. Pinfold refuses, declaring Angel to be a menace that must be exposed. Back in England, Mrs Pinfold convinces him that Angel had never left the country and the voices are imaginary. Pinfold hears Margaret faintly say,"I don't exist, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>love</b> you", before the voices disappear forever. Pinfold's doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral. Pinfold views his courage in the battle against the voices as a significant victory in the battle with his personal demons, and he begins to write an account of his experiences: [...] "The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold".|$|E

500|$|From late 1910 {{to early}} 1912, Cerna {{was at the}} University of Leipzig, where he {{attended}} courses held by the philosophers and psychologists Wilhelm Wundt, Eduard Spranger and Hans Volkelt. Wundt left an enduring impression on his Romanian student. In a letter home, Cerna described his modest appearance, which he claimed recalled that of [...] "decrepit" [...] Orthodox members of the Romanian Jewish community, adding: [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>love</b> this decrepit exterior beyond measure..." [...] Volkelt guided Cerna's research in the scientific field, and coordinated his PhD thesis of 1913, Die Gedankenlyrik (German for [...] "Contemplative Poetry"). According to Călinescu, Cerna's work stated the primacy of [...] "natural ideas" [...] over reasoning, and concluded that [...] "ideas have the purpose of signaling the problematic tensions of the soul." [...] Zarifopol wrote that Cerna was upset over having himself parted with writing poetry, and came to be preoccupied by Maiorescu's German-language dictum: In der Poesie ist der Gedanke ein verfluchtes Ding ("An idea is a damned thing {{when it comes to}} poetry"). Panait Cerna's first volume of collected poetry was published at home in 1910, and, two years later, resulted in the author being made a co-recipient of the Romanian Academy's Vasile Adamachi Award. Some of his new poems were still being published by Convorbiri Literare in 1911.|$|E
500|$|Although Howarth was {{familiar}} with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew. [...] When asked about his roles, {{he was unable to}} explain why he was consistently cast as a bad guy, but said that he enjoyed it. [...] "I would never want to come in now and play a nice guy for three months. That would be dreadfully boring. This suits me fine. It's just as easy to pretend I'm a bad guy as it is to pretend I'm a good guy," [...] Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because [...] " [...] it's all make-believe". He was perplexed by writers' need to redeem villains. [...] "Todd's a pretty interesting character just the way he is," [...] Howarth said in late 1994. [...] "There's no need to fix it if it's not broken. I don't know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People used to say to me, 'I hope you get redeemed so you can stay on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been redeemed, and he's still on the show." [...] He added, [...] "I don't love the character I play. If I met Todd on the street, I wouldn't say 'Hi' to him, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>love</b> playing this character." ...|$|E

When Jackson received his Living Legend award—presented to him by Janet Jackson—at the 1993 Grammys, he said, [...] "I don't read all the things written about me, I wasn't aware the world thought I was so weird and bizarre.

And it doesn't mean they're going to be homosexual, but unfortunately they hear about some of the sexual activities of the homosexual, and they're being told that it's safe and so forth and healthy, and it isn't.” He claimed “parents have complained to the schools, and administrators have told them that there's nothing they can do because of state law.” Lindner co-authored a bill to repeal this provision and worked to get it a hearing by a House committee. Meeting with homosexuals opposed to his bill Lindner stressed “I don't hate any of those people. I know they accuse me of hating and wanting all kind of terrible things to happen to them, but I don't hate any of them. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>love</b> them. Actually this would benefit them if they were to leave that lifestyle or if they would maybe be more faithful to one partner, if it's got to be that way.
