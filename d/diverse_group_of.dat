Influenced by the musical works of the 1980s and artists like Prince and Scritti Politti, Body Language musically differs from Minogue's previous albums, which mainly featured disco-oriented dance-pop tracks, and instead explores genres like synthpop, electroclash, R, and hip hop. Many tracks in Body Language contain references to songs from the 1980s and lyrically, the album touches upon themes of enjoyment, flirting, and sex.|$|E

Singh et al. subsequently cloned and characterized the CASS4 gene, originally assigning the name HEPL (HEF1-EFS-p130Cas-like) for similarity to the other three defined CAS genes. The official name was subsequently changed to CASS4 by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC).|$|E

They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, {{a three-part}} body (head, thorax and abdomen), {{three pairs of}} jointed legs, {{compound}} eyes and one pair of antennae.

The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth.

5|$|Lipids are {{the most}} <b>diverse</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> biochemicals. Their main {{structural}} uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or {{as a source of}} energy. Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform. The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.|$|E
5|$|Measurement of {{antioxidant}} {{content in}} food {{is not a}} straightforward process, as antioxidants collectively are a <b>diverse</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> compounds with different reactivities to various reactive oxygen species. In food science, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) was once an industry standard for antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives. However, the United States Department of Agriculture withdrew these ratings in 2012 as biologically invalid, stating that no physiological proof in vivo existed to support the free-radical theory or roles for ingested phytochemicals, especially for polyphenols. Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from in vitro experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or biology.|$|E

5|$|The order Squamata, {{which is}} {{represented}} today by lizards, including snakes and amphisbaenians (worm lizards), radiated into various ecological niches during the Jurassic and was successful throughout the Cretaceous. They survived through the K–Pg boundary and are currently {{the most successful}} and <b>diverse</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> living reptiles, with more than 6,000 extant species. Many families of terrestrial squamates became extinct at the boundary, such as monstersaurians and polyglyphanodonts, and fossil evidence indicates they suffered very heavy losses in the KT event, only recovering 10 million years after it. Giant non-archosaurian aquatic reptiles such as mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, which were the top marine predators of their time, became extinct {{by the end of}} the Cretaceous. The ichthyosaurs had disappeared from fossil records before the mass extinction occurred.|$|E
