25|$|From November 1940, a {{decision}} was taken that Supermarine would start producing light-alloy covered ailerons which would replace the original <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> versions. However, seven months after the decision was taken to install them on all marks, Spitfires were still being delivered with the original <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> ailerons. From May 1941 metal ailerons were fitted to all Spitfires coming off the production lines.|$|R

50|$|Construction of the SK-1 was of light-alloy {{stressed}} skin, {{with single}} plate web spar wings skinned with light-alloy sheet, smoothed to mirror finish accurate profiles using marquisette fabric, cork dust, open weave and adhesive as filler. Initially the wing was of NACA 23014.5 profile with slotted Vlasov style flaps, and <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> ailerons. The tail-unit also had <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> control surfaces, and trim tabs, with all controls 100% mass balanced.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{process begins}} with {{the making of the}} helmet shell using a vacuum forming machine and a metal mould. A sheet of black {{fortified}} plastic is heated and then lowered over the mould, where a vacuum pulls the plastic into shape over the mould. Once hardened instantly, a rubber mallet is used to release the plastic from the mould so that the excess plastic around brim of the helmet can be trimmed with a bandsaw and sanded. The helmet's <b>fabric</b> <b>covers</b> are made out of water-repellent wool that are cut in halves and stitched together to give the helmet a distinctive centred, front-to-back seam. Moving down the line of production, glue is applied to both the inside of the <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> and the outside surface of the helmet shell, the <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> is then steamed and stretched tightly over the shell to prevent buckling. A wooden tool is carefully used to smooth away any air bubbles as well as to ensure the <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> is in full contact with the helmet shell; excess fabric is cut away.|$|R
50|$|The San Francesco is a {{conventionally}} arranged single-engine, high-wing light aircraft. It has {{constant chord}} wings with rounded tips, built of wood with plywood leading edges and <b>fabric</b> <b>covered.</b> Each wing has a V-shaped pair of lift struts {{attached to the}} lower fuselage longerons and assisted by a single subsidiary strut from each lift strut upwards to the wing. The flat sided, <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> fuselage is a steel tube structure with wooden formers. The square tipped fin has a swept leading edge and a curved fillet; it carries a deep rudder with a straight trailing edge, which extends between the elevators {{to the bottom of}} the fuselage. The tailplane, with swept leading edges is wire-braced to the fin. All tail surfaces are <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> steel tube structures.|$|R
25|$|The {{fuselage}} is {{a mostly}} <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> welded tube structure with wooden formers, though the upper decking is plywood.|$|R
50|$|The Féré F.3 {{is almost}} entirely wooden in {{structure}} and skinning, though some areas are <b>fabric</b> <b>covered.</b> The one piece, low set wing is built around a single box spar, with its leading edge covered in okoumé plywood under an overall fabric covering. The inner sections of the wings have no dihedral but the outer panels are set at 5.80°. There are plain, <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> ailerons on the outer panels but no flaps.|$|R
50|$|The Albatros was {{a wooden}} glider with a {{cantilever}} mid-set wing. The wings had a root chord of 1.60 m (5 ft 3 in), tapering to 0.66 m (2 ft 2 in) {{at the tip}} and carried 1.50° of dihedral. They were built around a single spar with a plywood covered leading edge torsion box {{in front of it}} and <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> behind. The wing carried wooden, <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> ailerons and airbrakes.|$|R
50|$|The Baby was {{a single}} bay biplane with stagger. The wings were wooden {{structures}} with two spars and fabric covering; the upper wing had 1° of dihedral and the lower one 3°. There were ailerons on both wings, with aluminium frames and again <b>fabric</b> <b>covered.</b> The fuselage and empennage were <b>fabric</b> <b>covered,</b> welded steel structures. It had fixed conventional landing gear with rubber sprung main legs, aluminium wheels with brakes and a sprung tailwheel.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} with <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> 4130 steel tube structure and spruce wing spars. Ribs are plywood with cap strips.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} around a rectangular steel tube structure. This was aluminium skinned around the engine, upper decking and extreme tail, and <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> over plywood elsewhere. The single cockpit was well aft of the wings and could be open or enclosed. The tailplane was wooden and plywood plus <b>fabric</b> <b>covered,</b> but the fin and control surfaces were <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> steel frames. The control surfaces were horn balanced and the tail plane incidence could be trimmed in flight. The fin, too, was directionally adjustable, but only on the ground. The undercarriage was fixed, with semi-cantilever faired legs from the leading edge stubs braced high up the legs and inwards to the fuselage bottom with faired struts. The optionally spatted wheels were oleo damped and had differential brakes. There was a sprung tailskid.|$|R
