500|$|As an International Bird Area, Quehanna's {{forests are}} {{recognized}} as a [...] "large, unfragmented tract with exceptional diversity of woodland species" [...] and are home to 102species of birds. Common birds include American crow, black-capped chickadee, blue jay, broad-winged hawk, common raven, hermit thrush, house sparrow, northern waterthrush, starling, whip-poor-will, and wild turkey. Quehanna Wild Area includes a variety of forest, riparian, and wetland habitats that support a diversity of animals. The shrub and scrubland areas left by the 1985 tornado and cleared for elk to feed in are home to indigo bunting and prairie warbler, while ponds and wetlands attract waterfowl such as hooded merganser and wood duck, and wading birds like great blue heron. The birch forest of Marion Brooks Natural Area is home to downy, hairy, and pileated woodpeckers, the oak forest of Wykoff Run Natural Area has black-throated <b>green</b> <b>warbler,</b> red-eyed vireo, and white-breasted nuthatch, and its aspen groves have woodcock.

500|$|Ricketts Glen State Park has {{extensive}} acreage of [...] "interior forest" [...] that is {{far from}} open space; several bird species that are area-sensitive are found within these forests in the park, including the black-throated <b>green</b> <b>warbler,</b> red-eyed vireo, dark-eyed junco and black-capped chickadee. Two species of owl, barred and northern saw-whet, inhabit the deep forests. The hemlock forests of the glens are home to the Louisiana waterthrush, Acadian flycatcher, Blackburnian warbler, blue-headed vireo, magnolia warbler, brown creeper, golden-crowned kinglet and winter wren. Wood thrush {{are found in the}} lower elevations of the park and are replaced within the ecosystem by hermit thrush at the higher elevations. The Canada warbler and black-throated blue warbler are on several watchlists, but are common within the park. The Canada warbler inhabits blueberry thickets with white-throated sparrow, while the black-throated blue warbler is found in the forests atop the plateau with the least flycatcher. Common raven are regularly seen soaring over the forests of the park looking for carrion. Canada goose are present in the park and have been classified as a [...] "pest" [...] due to their high numbers and the large amount of fecal waste they leave on the shores of Lake Jean.

40|$|Climate change {{coupled with}} land-use change will likely alter {{habitats}} and affect state {{parameters of the}} animal populations that dwell in them. Affected parameters are anticipated to include site occupancy and abundance, population range, and phenophase cycles (e. g., arrival dates on breeding grounds for migrant bird species). Detecting these changes will require monitoring many sites for many years, {{a process that is}} well suited for an automated system. We developed and tested monitoR, an R package that is designed for long-term, multi-taxa automated passive acoustic monitoring programs. monitoR correctly identified presence for black-throated <b>green</b> <b>warbler</b> and ovenbird in 64 % and 72 % of the 52 surveys using binary point matching, respectively, and 73 % and 72 % of the 52 surveys using spectrogram cross-correlation, respectively. Of individual black-throated <b>green</b> <b>warbler</b> song events, 73 % of 166 black-throated <b>green</b> <b>warbler</b> songs and 69 % of 502 ovenbird songs were identified by binary point matching.

False positive rates were We describe a method to identify the probability of survey presence in a template-based automated detection system using known false positive rates for each template. True and false positive detection rates were observed in 146 training surveys. These probabilities were used in a Bayesian approach that discriminates between detections in occupied surveys and unoccupied surveys. We evaluated this approach in 146 test surveys. A total of 1142 Black-throated <b>green</b> <b>warbler</b> (Setophaga virens) songs were observed in the training surveys and test surveys, which we attempted to locate with 3 different binary point matching templates. When only posterior probabilities greater than 0. 5 were considered detections, the average ratio of accurate identifications of survey presence to false positive identifications in 500 bootstrapped samples improved from 1. 2 : 1 using a standard score cutoff approach to 2. 8 : 1 using all 3 templates and a likelihood-based discriminator. With the selected score cutoffs the average true positive and false positive rates for the combined three templates were 0. 18 and 0. 002, respectively. Automated detection methods are increasingly being used for identification and monitoring of landscape-scale responses to climate change and land-use change. Skepticism of automated acoustic monitoring software is largely due to higher false positive and negative error rates than those in traditional human surveys, but the false positive multiple method occupancy model is capable of estimating detection parameters and occupancy state when one method has occasional false positive detections. We test the accuracy of the model when automated detection of black-throated <b>green</b> <b>warbler</b> is mixed with human detection in 4 recorded surveys at 60 sites. Precision and accuracy are evaluated by simulation, and we use the results to optimize future sampling. In simulation, parameter estimates by the multiple method occupancy model are close to those we computed manually when two surveys are manually analyzed. Our results support the use of the multiple method false positive occupancy model to track detection rates in automated monitoring programs...|$|E

40|$|The hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) is {{currently}} decimating eastern hemlock stands throughout the northeastern United States. Recent {{studies have demonstrated}} that several species of songbirds, including the black-throated <b>green</b> <b>warbler</b> (Dendroica virens), Blackburnian warbler (Dendroica fusca) and blue-headed vireo (Vireo solitarius), are hemlock-dependent species during the breeding season (Benzinger 1994, Howe and Mossman 1996, Tingley et al. 2002, Ross et al. 2004). In this study, line transect detection frequencies and resulting densities for these species were compared among hemlock stands differing in degree of infestation and hemlock condition in order to determine effects of infestation level on breeding populations. Correlation of several measures of infestation level with detection frequency and density estimates varied considerably and was, for the most part, not significant. Measures of infestation utilizing height of the lowest live branch and distance from first dead to first live branch (lower height and smaller distance, respectively, equate to better health as lower branches tend to die off first) were significantly correlated with blue-headed vireo detection frequency (P < 0. 05) and with black-throated <b>green</b> <b>warbler</b> detection frequency and density estimation (P < 0. 05) using Spearmanâ€™s rho correlations.

40|$|Silvicultural {{treatments}} {{have been}} shown to alter the composition of species assemblages in numerous taxa. However, the intensity and persistence of these effects have rarely been documented. We used a before-after, control-impact (BACI) paired design, i. e., five pairs of 25 -ha study plots, 1 -control and 1 -treated plot, to quantify changes in the density of eight forest bird species in response to selection harvesting over six breeding seasons, one year pre- and five years postharvest. Focal species included mature forest associates, i. e., Northern Parula (Setophaga americana) and Black-throated <b>Green</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Setophaga virens), forest generalists, i. e., Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius) and Swainson&# 8217;s Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), early-seral specialists, i. e., Mourning Warbler (Geothlypis philadelphia) and Chestnut-sided Warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica), species associated with shrubby forest gaps, i. e., Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens), and mid-seral species, i. e., American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla). As predicted, we found a negative numerical response to the treatment in the Black-throated <b>Green</b> <b>Warbler,</b> no treatment effect in the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, and a positive treatment effect in early-seral specialists. We only detected a year effect in the Northern Parula and the American Redstart. There was evidence for a positive treatment effect on the Swainson&# 8217;s Thrush when the regeneration started to reach the pole stage, i. e., fifth year postharvest. These findings suggest that selection harvesting has the potential to maintain diverse avian assemblages while allowing sustainable management of timber supply, but future studies should determine whether mature-forest associates can sustain second- and third-entry selection harvest treatments...|$|E
40|$|Evaluating bird {{population}} trends requires baseline data. In North America the earliest population data available are {{those from the}} late 1960 s. Forest conditions in the northern Great Lake states (U. S. A.), however, have undergone succession since the region was originally cut over {{around the turn of}} the twentieth century, and it is expected that {{bird population}}s have undergone concomitant change. We propose pre-Euro-American settlement as an alternative baseline for assessing changes in bird populations. We evaluated the amount, quality, and distribution of breeding bird habitat during the mid- 1800 s and early 1990 s for three forest birds: the Pine Warbler (Dendroica pinus), Blackburnian Warbler (D. fusca), and Black-throated <b>Green</b> <b>Warbler</b> (D. virens). We constructed models of bird and habitat relationships based on literature review and regional data sets of bird abundance and applied these models to widely available vegetation data. Original public-land survey records represented historical habitat conditions, and a combination of forest inventory and national land-cover data represented current conditions. We assessed model robustness by comparing current habitat distribution to actual breeding bird locations from the Wisconsin Breeding Bird Atlas. The model showed little change in the overall amount of Pine Warbler habitat, whereas both the Blackburnian Warber and the Black-throated <b>Green</b> <b>Warbler</b> have experienced substantial habitat losses. For the species we examined, habitat quality has degraded since presettlement and the spatial distribution of habitat shifted among ecoregions, with range expansion accompanying forest incursion into previously open habitats or the replacement of native forests with pine plantations. Sources of habitat loss and degradation include loss of conifers and loss of large trees. Using widely available data sources in a habitat suitability model framework, our method provides a long-term analysis of change in bird habitat and a presettlement baseline for assessing current conservation priority...|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that habitat fragmentation during the Pleistocene initiated speciation events in many songbird genera. One such vicariance model for avian speciation in the Pleistocene was developed by R. M. Mengel for North American birds. This model suggests that the first Pleistocene glacial advance reduced the area of an extensive, eastern North American deciduous forest, forcing adaptation by some species to boreal forest. This, in turn, facilitated the development of transcontinental range expansions during interglacials. Subsequent glacial advances repeatedly fragmented the ranges of these species into eastern and western populations; western isolates speciated to form the multispecies groups observed among various North American birds. We used mtDNA restriction site data to reconstruct the phylogeny of the black-throated <b>green</b> <b>warbler</b> complex-the group that Mengel considered the best fit to his model. Contrary to Mengel's model, the phylogeny indicates that not all western endemics were derived from an eastern ancestor. Instead, our results imply a mix, wherein some western endemics were budded off an eastern source, as Mengel posits, while others probably resulted from intermontane isolations in the west...|$|E
40|$|Avian assemblages were {{investigated}} in natural (uncut) and mature second-growth balsam fir (Abies balsamea) forests in western Newfoundland. Within these forest classes, {{there were four}} forest types varying in site richness. Birds were studied to determine if assemblages differed between forest classes and among forest types, and to determine if differences in avian assemblages were associated with vegetation structure and composition. The IPA (lndice Ponctuel d'Abondance) version of the point-count method was used to census birds. [...] The result indicated avian species richness, diversity and total abundance (IPA) did not differ between natural growth and second growth forest. Three species were more abundant in natural growth. Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) were found exclusively in natural growth. Five species and one guild (seed-eating) were more abundant in second growth forests. [...] A trend toward increased abundance with increased forest type richness was evident for Black-throated <b>Green</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Dendroica virens), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) and Mourning Warblers (Oporomis philadelphia) and the seed-eating guild {{as well as for}} species richness and IPA. The foliage-gleaning guild was least abundant in moss forest types, where foliage height diversity and habitat diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) were lowest. [...] Twelve bird species and three guilds had significant multiple regression models in the analyses using principal components from analyses of vegetation variables from all stands. Of these, Black-backed Woodpecker, Yellow-bellied Flycatcher (Empidonax minimus) and Yellow-romped Warbler (Dendroica coronata) and the flycatching guild were indicated to avoid dense fir with canopy cover and snags (PC 1), while Boreal Chickadees (Parus hudsonicus) and Black-throated <b>Green</b> <b>Warbler,</b> and the generalists guild preferred such areas. Seven species and two guilds (foliage-gleaning and generalists) strongly preferred rich forests with ferns, and forbs (PC 2). Seven species and one guild (flycatching) avoided older forests lacking deciduous litter (PC 3). Deciduous litter was highly correlated with Ovenbird abundance. Principal Component 2 and PC 3 explained most of the variance associated with species richness and IPA. Both second-growth and natural growth forests seemed to provide adequate breeding habitat for most species. It is important to maintain stand diversity in order to promote avian biodiversity and increased abundance. Important structural components to maintain are: snags, for bark foragers and cavity nesters, particularly Black-backed Woodpeckers; some deciduous trees, for some ground foraging species, especially Ovenbirds; and a portion of canopy trees, as a source for future snags...|$|E
