5|$|About 1 in 1000 adults {{per year}} has DVT, {{but as of}} 2011, {{available}} data are dominated by North American and European populations. VTE is rare in children, with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 a year. From childhood to old age, incidence increases {{by a factor of}} about 1000, with almost 1% of the elderly experiencing VTE yearly. During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs about once per 1000 deliveries. After surgery with preventative treatment, VTE develops <b>in</b> <b>about</b> 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and <b>in</b> <b>about</b> 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement. About 300,000–600,000 Americans develop VTE each year, with about 60,000–100,000 deaths attributable to PE. In England, an estimated 25,000 a year die from hospital-related VTE. For unclear reasons, people of Asian descent have a lower VTE risk than whites.|$|E

40|$|Aspect-oriented {{programming}} (AOP) {{has become}} increasingly popular {{over the last few}} years.

We show that some of the key problems encountered <b>in</b> reasoning <b>about</b> aspect-oriented programs are similar to those encountered <b>in</b> reasoning <b>about</b> concurrent programs; and that the rely-guarantee approach, appropriately modified, helps address these problems.
