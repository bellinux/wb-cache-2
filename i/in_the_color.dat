5|$|Isolated vacancy is {{the most}} studied defect in diamond, both {{experimentally}} and theoretically. Its most important practical property is optical absorption, like <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> centers, which gives diamond green, or sometimes even green–blue color (in pure diamond). The characteristic feature of this absorption {{is a series of}} sharp lines called GR1-8, where GR1 line at 741nm {{is the most}} prominent and important.|$|E
5|$|The idea to {{have the}} episode in flashbacks was {{originally}} thought up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> screening stage of production. This is the first episode directed by Rich Moore. This {{is the first time}} Jebediah Springfield is mentioned, as well as the first time the Simpsons go to church. The announcer of the football game Homer is listening to at church is based on Keith Jackson.|$|E
5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} (Sitta carolinensis) {{is a small}} songbird of the nuthatch family which breeds in old-growth woodland {{across much}} of temperate North America. It is a stocky bird, with a large head, short tail, powerful bill, and strong feet. The upperparts are pale blue-gray, and the face and underparts are white. It has a black cap and a chestnut lower belly. The nine subspecies differ mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the body plumage.|$|E

5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also {{be heard over the}} lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its celebrity guests and its contributions to political parlance, the Blackstone has a place in popular culture. Among its uses in cinema, it hosted the banquet where Al Capone smashes a guest's head {{with a baseball bat}} in the Brian De Palma film The Untouchables, a party in The Hudsucker Proxy, and Tom Cruise's pre-pool tourney stay <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Color</b> of Money. Also, the 1996–2000 television series Early Edition was set in this building, featuring a man (Kyle Chandler) who lives in the hotel and receives the newspaper a day in advance.|$|E
5|$|It {{contained}} a mihrab ("niche indicating direction towards Mecca.") The maqam was noted by Guérin in 1863. Its eastern dome was {{constructed by the}} residents of Deir Ghassaneh, while local legend holds the western dome was completed by angels. The interior of the domes were simple and typical of most maqamat domes, lacking cross-vault roofing which was a common feature for most of Deir Ghassaneh's buildings. The sanctuary had a two-door entrance on its northern end. The interior walls were whitewashed, reflecting the Muslim tradition of heavenly light and spirit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> white. A few verses from the Qur'an were written on parts of the walls. The tomb of al-Khawwas was covered in white cloth. A small niche on the western wall was fitted for an oil lamp.|$|E

5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae. It is a {{monotypic}} genus {{and consists of}} the single mushroom species Rhodotus palmatus, known in the vernacular as the netted rhodotus, the rosy veincap, or the wrinkled peach. This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs of rotting hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive ridged and veined surface of their rubbery caps; variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> and quantity of light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{releases}} of System 6 were unstable; many third party software developers {{did not receive}} copies before its release, resulting in widespread compatibility problems. At first, many common software programs such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Works and 4th Dimension were not fully compatible with System 6. There were also software bugs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Color</b> Manager, Script Manager, and Sound Manager extension files. Apple announced that 66 bugs were fixed when the 6.0.1 update was released in September 1988. However, a major bug involving text spacing of screen fonts was found in 6.0.1 after distribution began. This led to the quick release of 6.0.2, which solved this problem. Some customers waited longer until moving to System 6 because of the poor reputation already gained.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{physical}} indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal liver function tests, jaundice (yellowing {{of the eyes}} and skin occurring when bile ducts are blocked by tumor), abdominal pain (30%–50%), generalized itching (66%), weight loss (30%–50%), fever (up to 20%), and changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of stool or urine. To some extent, the symptoms depend upon {{the location of the}} tumor: patients with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver) {{are more likely to have}} jaundice, while those with tumors of the bile ducts within the liver more often have pain without jaundice.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it grows {{on the ground in}} {{deciduous}} or mixed woods, usually in association with pine trees. It is closely related, and physically similar, to the more common Albatrellus ovinus, from which it may be distinguished macroscopically by differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> when bruised, and microscopically by the amyloid (staining bluish-black to black with Melzer's reagent) walls of the spores. The fruit bodies of A.subrubescens contain scutigeral, a bioactive chemical that has antibiotic activity. A.subrubescens mushrooms are mildly poisonous, and consuming them will result in a short-term gastrointestinal illness.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1870, flags {{were created}} for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and for {{other members of the}} {{imperial}} family. At first, the Emperor's flag was ornate, with a sun resting {{in the center of a}}n artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage. The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag). The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed in the center of a monocolored background. These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag. With minor changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.|$|E

25|$|The {{signature}} {{colors for}} In-N-Out are white, red, and yellow. The white {{is used for}} the buildings' exterior walls and the employees' basic uniform. Red {{is used for the}} buildings' roofs and the employees' aprons and hats. Yellow is used for the decorative band on the roof and iconic zig-zag in the logo. However, variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> scheme do occur.|$|E

25|$|Over-saturated {{colors were}} used to reflect scenes of rural Thailand, which the {{director}} saw as bright and colorful. Walls on the sets and locations were painted pink or green, and lighting was used to achieve the saturation. The film was treated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> grading process by transferring it to digital Betacam tape {{and then back to}} 35mm film. Oxide Pang, working as a telecine colorist, won a special effects award in Thailand for his work.|$|E
25|$|Each photographed color component, {{initially}} just a colorless {{record of}} the luminous intensities {{in the part of}} the spectrum that it captured, is processed to produce a transparent dye image <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> complementary to the color of the light that it recorded. The superimposed dye images combine to synthesize the original colors by the subtractive color method. In some early color processes (e.g., Kinemacolor), the component images remained in black-and-white form and were projected through color filters to synthesize the original colors by the additive color method.|$|E
