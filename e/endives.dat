25|$|Brussels {{is known}} as the birthplace of the Belgian Endive (Dutch: witloof or witlof ("white leaf"), French: chicon). The {{technique}} for growing blanched <b>endives</b> was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Belgium.|$|E
500|$|The {{staple foods}} were {{generally}} consumed around 11 o'clock, {{and consisted of}} bread, lettuce, cheese, fruits, nuts, and cold meat {{left over from the}} dinner the night before. [...] The Roman poet Horace mentions another Roman favorite, the olive, in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: [...] "As for me, olives, <b>endives,</b> and smooth mallows provide sustenance." [...] The family ate together, sitting on stools around a table. Fingers were used to eat solid foods and spoons were used for soups.|$|E
5000|$|Common chicory is {{also known}} as blue daisy, blue dandelion, blue sailors, blue weed, bunk, coffeeweed, cornflower, hendibeh, horseweed, ragged sailors, succory, wild bachelor's buttons, and wild <b>endive.</b> (Note: [...] "Cornflower" [...] is {{commonly}} applied to Centaurea cyanus.)

5000|$|<b>Endive</b> ( [...] or [...] ) is a leaf {{vegetable}} {{belonging to}} the genus Cichorium, which includes several similar bitter leafed vegetables. Species include Cichorium endivia (also called <b>endive),</b> Cichorium pumilum (also called wild <b>endive),</b> and Cichorium intybus (also called common chicory). Common chicory includes types such as radicchio, puntarelle, and Belgian <b>endive.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Escarole, or {{broad-leaved}} <b>endive</b> (var latifolia), has broad, {{pale green}} leaves and is less bitter {{than the other}} varieties.

It is eaten like other greens, sauteed, chopped into soups and stews, {{or as part of}} a green salad.|$|R
2500|$|According to Pliny the Elder, a vine, a fig tree, and {{an olive}} tree {{grew in the}} middle of the Roman Forum; the latter was planted to provide shade (the garden plot was recreated in the 20th century). The Roman poet Horace {{mentions}} it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: [...] "As for me, olives, <b>endives,</b> and smooth mallows provide sustenance." [...] Lord Monboddo comments on the olive in 1779 as one of the foods preferred by the ancients and as one of the most perfect foods.|$|E
60|$|That {{might have}} been because it was near the market where we {{experienced}} almost the only mercantile zeal we had known in Spain. Women with ropes and garlands of onions round their necks invited us to buy, and we had hopeful advances from the stalls of salads and fruits, {{where there was a}} brave and beautiful show of lettuces and <b>endives,</b> grapes, medlars, and heaps of melons, but no oranges; I do not know why, though there were shining masses of red peppers and green, peppers, and vast earthen bowls with yellow peas soaking in them. The flowers were every gay autumnal sort, especially dahlias, sometimes made into stiff bouquets, perhaps for church offerings. There were mounds of chestnuts, four or five feet high and wide; and these flowers and fruits filled the interior of the market, while the stalls for the flesh and fish were on the outside. There seemed more sellers than buyers; here and there were ladies buying, but it is said that the mistresses commonly send their maids for the daily provision.|$|E

2500|$|Ms. <b>Endive</b> (voiced by Mindy Sterling): An obese, intelligent, and {{somewhat}} snobbish female chef who teaches cooking to Panini with strict discipline. She's also occasionally portrayed as the show's main antagonist or villain. She is usually depicted as gargantuan in size. This {{is shown in}} the episode [...] "The Apprentice Games" [...] where Mung Daal and Chowder enter the games by riding on <b>Endive's</b> posterior. She regularly berates Mung Daal, whom she considers a rival. In the episode [...] "Chowder's Girlfriend", it is revealed she despises boys and boyfriends because her fiancé did not show up on their wedding day. Ms. <b>Endive</b> is first seen in the second episode with Panini, [...] "Chowder's Girlfriend". The creator describes her as Martha Stewart with Oompa-Loompa colors. Greenblatt chose to name her after the <b>endive</b> since <b>endive</b> is bitter and Belgian <b>endive</b> is fancy; hence the character is bitter and fancy. <b>Endive's</b> character stayed constant throughout the initial development. The long nose, which changed from a rectangular shape to a triangle shape for the final version, represents how <b>Endive</b> looks down at other characters. It was revealed in later episodes that Ms. <b>Endive</b> is in love with Shnitzel. Greenblatt said that he felt that her evolution throughout the series was fun to observe, especially when William Reiss wrote plots involving <b>Endive.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the cold}} chain {{and its impact}} on food stuff {{microbiology}} was evaluated for fresh-cut <b>endive.</b> A survey was carried out to analyze <b>endive</b> temperature throughout the supply chain from producer, via processor and distributor to the restaurant. Data loggers accompanying the <b>endive</b> on its route provided a temperature profile of the <b>endive.</b> The effect of the outdoor temperature on initial cooling was evaluated and critical points regarding cold chain management in the supply chain were identified. Our experiments indicate that the cold chain is generally properly maintained. In parallel with temperature monitoring, indicator microorganisms were assessed at different points in the supply chain {{to examine the effects of}} <b>endive</b> temperature, temperature fluctuations, and the outdoor temperature on microbial food safety. Small temperature fluctuations in the supply chain had a small effect on the total level of aerobic mesophilic bacteria. However, at the best before-date, total coliforms and Enterobacteriaceae levels were significantly higher in <b>endive</b> samples subject to temperature fluctuations in the supply chain, compared to <b>endive</b> stored in optimal conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first study that combines microbiological analysis with the temperature profile of fresh-cut produce in a realistic food supply chain. status: publishe...|$|R
