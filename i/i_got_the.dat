5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E
5|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> call , I was like, 'I don't know if that's me. She was like, 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna {{do it with}} you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me {{and kept}} it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E
