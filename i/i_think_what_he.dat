In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It {{never occurred to me}} in a million years that I would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ... So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing myself when young at my own age, having played myself previously when 100-and-I-don't-know-what." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{his return}} to New York from his last film assignment, in London, in January 2008, while he was {{apparently}} suffering from some kind of respiratory illness, he reportedly complained to his co-star from The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Christopher Plummer, that he was continuing to have difficulty sleeping and taking pills to help with that problem: [...] "Confirming earlier reports that Ledger hadn't been feeling well on set, Plummer says, 'we all caught colds because we were shooting outside on horrible, damp nights. But Heath's went on and I don't think he dealt with it immediately with the antibiotics.... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did have was the walking pneumonia.' [...] On top of that, 'He was saying all the time, 'dammit, I can't sleep'... and he was taking all these pills to help him.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|A typical Hal Roach joke is as follows: [...] "He {{told me that}} I have a cult following, {{at least}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. I {{believe that}} he foresaw some danger, or else {{he would not have}} talked so. And then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> foresaw happened." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a long}} tedious journey, and {{my heart}} beats with {{gratitude}} to him when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> undertook for me, and how dreary {{it must have been}} for him, while I was too dead and dull to thank him, though I hope my love and confidence evinced my gratitude in after life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you! Clarence {{was not in}} a {{condition}} to notice anything very clearly during his journey, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> suffered blunted his recollection. Besides, the subject is a distressing one to him, and it is seldom he can be induced to speak about it. Perhaps that is a pity; I find it does not always save one trouble in the end to avoid a little immediate pain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing--but feel {{kindly to}} Gilbert,' said Albinia. 'I can't do so yet. I don't {{feel as if}} I ever could again, when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing with Maurice. Yes, and how easily he could have brought poor Lucy to her senses, {{if he had been}} good for anything! Oh! Maurice, this is sickening work! You should be {{grateful}} to me for not scolding you for having taken me from home!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} chatting {{with him a}} bit," [...] Ralph said. [...] "He has never been to school, but has been brought up at home, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said he is the heir to an estate. He seemed rather to look down upon schools." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{done for}} our union!" [...] exclaimed a thick-set man, plainly a steel worker. [...] "He's just wore himself out, {{fighting}} that crooked gang." [...] He stared with sudden aggressiveness at me. [...] "Haven't I seen you some-wheres?" [...] he demanded.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see how {{you could}} have been more so!" [...] she retorted, in tender indignation with him against himself. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said was terrible. It was bad enough for him to pretend to believe {{that he was not going}} to live again, but for him to tell you that he was afraid he was!" [...] An image {{sufficiently}} monstrous to typify Hilbrook's wickedness failed to present itself to Mrs. Ewbert, and she went out to give the maid instructions for something unusually nourishing for Ewbert at their mid-day dinner. [...] "You look fairly fagged out, Clarence," [...] she said, when she came back; [...] "and I insist upon your not going up to that dreadful old man's again,--at least, not till you've got over this shock." ...|$|E
6000|$|How {{delightful}} to {{hear from}} you in this generously appreciative way!--it makes me very grateful to Logan for having reported to you of my pleasure in your beautiful disclosure of young Dolben--which seems to me such a happy chance for you to have had, in so effective conditions, after so many years--I mean as by the production of cards from up your sleeve. My impression of your volume was indeed a very lively one--it gave me a really acute emotion to thank you for: which is a luxury of the spirit quite rare and refreshing at my time of day. Your picture of your extraordinary young friend suggests so much beauty, such a fine young individual, and yet both suggests it in such a judging and, as one feels, truth-keeping a way, that the effect is quite {{different from that of the}} posthumous tribute to the early-gathered in general--it inspires a peculiar confidence and respect. Difficult to do I can well imagine the thing to have been--keeping the course between the too great claim and the too timid; and this but among other complicated matters. I feel however that there is need, in respect to the poor boy's note of inspiration, of no shade of timidity at all--of so absolutely distinguished a reality is that note, given the age at which it sounded: such fineness of impulse and such fineness of art--one doesn't really at all know where such another instance lurks--in the like condition. What an interesting and beautiful one to have had such a near view of--in the golden age, and to have been able to recover and reconstruct with such tenderness--of the measured and responsible sort. How could you not have had the emotion which, as you rightly say, can be such an extraordinary (on occasion such a miracle-working) quickener of memory!--and yet how could you not also, I see, feel shy of some of the divagations in that line to which your subject is somehow formed rather to lend itself! Your tone and tact seem to me perfect--and the rare little image is embedded in them, so safely and cleanly, for duration--which is a real [...] "service, from you, to literature" [...] and to our sum of intelligent life. And you make one ask one's self just enough, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would have meant had he lived--without making us do so too much. I don't quite see, myself, what he would have meant, and the result is an odd kind of concurrence in his charming, flashing catastrophe which is different from what most such accidents, in the case of the young of high promise, make one feel. However, I do envy you the young experience of your own, and the abiding sense of him in his actuality, just as you had and have them, and your having been able to intervene with such a light and final authority of taste and tenderness. I say final because the little clear medallion will hang there exactly as you have framed it, and your volume is the very condition of its hanging. There should be absolutely no issue of the poems without your introduction. This is odd or anomalous considering what the best of them are, bless them!--but it is exactly the best of them that most want it. I hear the poor young spirit call on you out of the vague to stick to him. But you always will.--I find myself so glad to be writing to you, however, that I only now become aware that the small hours of the a.m. are getting larger ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the first}} Democratic presidential debate in October 2015 the {{candidates}} were asked for their opinion of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. When {{asked the question}} [...] "hero or traitor?" [...] Sanders replied, [...] "I think Snowden played {{a very important role}} in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined. He didâ€”he did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did in educating us should be taken into consideration." [...] Journalist Norman Solomon praised Sanders's reply saying, [...] "I think Bernie Sanders handled it the best in terms of scoping out and describing the terrain. And for the most part, I think Edward Snowden would probably agree with what he said." ...|$|E

5000|$|Thanks to a blue-line opening {{created by}} {{injuries}} and call-ups, Fitzgerald received more playing time with Vancouverâ€™s AHL affiliate the Manitoba Moose. The additional ice time allowed Fitzgerald to refine his game causing his then coach Scott Arniel to say [...] "He's {{had an opportunity}} to play and play regularly and his game has been very good. He's been very responsible in our end of the rink, he's done a great job of making that first pass and you can see he has confidence because he's playing a lot. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> trying to do is show people that he's more than just a fighter." [...] Fitzgerald was also called up to the NHL during the 2007-08 season; he played one game for Vancouver against the Dallas Stars on February 5, 2008.|$|R

5000|$|Martin {{has said}} the Catholic Church {{felt a sense of}} [...] "bereavement" [...] {{following}} the result of the same-sex marriage referendum. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, called the result of the Irish same-sex marriage equality referendum a [...] "defeat for humanity". Martin told RTÃ‰ Radio One's Sean Oâ€™Rourke show the cardinal's comments expressed [...] "our deeply held conviction about the meaning of marriage". [...] "One of the difficulties of the debate was that we had two parallel discussions going on.

[...] "I think what Cardinal Parolin was expressing was our deeply held conviction about the meaning of marriage," [...] Martin said. [...] "He said three things. He said, look, I'm saddened by the result which I {{think a lot of people}} in this country are also. He said this isn't just a defeat for Christian principles, it's a defeat for humanity. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was trying to do was express the loss that has occurred here and we do feel it's a loss. Something very unique and precious has been lost. That's not in any way to say that there are not a lot of people who were very happy with the result, and we could see that on the night of the result." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But to {{miss him}} for so long!" [...] said Margaret. [...] "Perhaps it is best, for it is very miserable when papa is sarcastic and sharp, and he cannot {{understand}} it, and takes it as meaning {{so much more than}} it really does, and grows all the more frightened and diffident. <b>I</b> cannot <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would do without you to encourage him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mmmyes, I believe so.... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>what</b> {{you call}} a black sheep. We haven't many of them, thank God! {{but we have a}} few.... He's an unfortunate man of some kind...." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{suggested}} {{that it was a}} poor game and that he had better give it up. He answered:--'I shall never do it again, sir, God helping me.' Really <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> meant <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why should I want to hoax {{you about}} such a vital thing as that. Couldn't Kendricks come to Saratoga as well as we? He's here looking up the ground of a story <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said." ...|$|R

6000|$|Muriel smiled. [...] "My dear, I {{could not}} have stopped him, {{and now he is}} gone <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am in one way glad that it was so.

Eight thousand pounds will not go so very far, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|But she {{altogether}} misunderstood him.

6000|$|... "I'm {{not good}} at the books," [...] Mr. Foker said, wagging his head--"never could manage that--Pendennis could--he used to do half the chaps' verses--and yet"--the young gentleman broke out, [...] "you are his guardian; and I hope you will pardon me for saying that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>what</b> we call flat," [...] the candid young gentleman said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And your father, {{your poor}} father, Amy. Because {{he is not}} free to show himself and to speak for himself, you would let such people insult him with impunity.
