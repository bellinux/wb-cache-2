25|$|There has been, {{in recent}} years, a trend of legally favoring {{the right to}} a {{relation}} between the child and its biological father, rather than preserving the appearances of the 'social' family. In 2010, the ECtHR ruled in favor of a German man who had fathered twins with a married woman, granting him right of contact with the twins, {{despite the fact that the}} mother and her husband had forbidden him <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> children.|$|E
25|$|Rehearsal on Broadchurch {{was kept}} to a minimum. To heighten the raw and tension-filled tone of the show, actors were often {{prevented}} <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> space they were to perform in until shooting began. Almost no improvisation of dialogue occurred on the set. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the first take right. Director James Strong believed the first take was more spontaneous and more natural than subsequent takes. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are first takes.|$|E

25|$|Three {{airplanes}} on {{the tarmac}} at the Greater Buffalo International Airport in Cheektowaga were waiting to take off when the blizzard hit. One of them idled for five minutes due to the blizzard hitting; this resulted in the nose wheel freezing and preventing it from turning around.

The limited visibility prevented the pilots <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> men on the ground who would normally guide the airplane.|$|E
25|$|The Orphan School, {{designed}} by John Lee Archer, was situated in St John's Avenue, New Town. The parish church of St John's stood between the buildings {{for boys and}} for girls. In God's Own Country, Boyce describes this as a 'parish partnership' between the Church and government with the church designed specifically {{for the needs of}} the Asylum, convicts and free settlers. The children sat in one gallery and the convicts in the other with the settlers in the main body. Barriers and separate entrances prevented the children <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> convicts. Church of England clergy dominated the committee that managed the Asylum.|$|E

25|$|On 20–21 May, the 14th and 15th Provisional Demi-Brigades fought at the Battle of Bautzen. On {{the first}} day, the XI Corps {{attacked}} the Allied center and captured {{the town of}} Bautzen. MacDonald's XI Corps continued attacking the Allied center on the second day, but Napoleon intended {{it to be a}} holding attack to distract the Allied generals <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> real threat to their right flank. The 36th Division fought in the Battle of Katzbach on 26 August. At the Battle of Leipzig on 16–19 October, Meunier's brigade in the 36th Division was made up of the 3rd and 4th battalions of the 3rd Light Infantry and the 3rd, 4th and 7th battalions of the 14th Light Infantry. Meunier was shot in the right arm on 16 October. He was promoted general of division on 5 November 1813.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than two}} months after the {{disastrous}} result at the Flinders by-election, Hayden announced his resignation as Leader of the Labor Party to the caucus on 3 February 1983. Hawke was subsequently named as leader—and hence became Leader of the Opposition—pending a party-room ballot at which he was elected unopposed. By a remarkable coincidence, {{on the same day that}} Hawke became Leader, Fraser called a snap election for 5 March 1983, hoping to capitalise on Labor's feuding before it could replace Hayden with Hawke. Fraser initially believed that he had caught Labor out, thinking that they would be forced to fight the election with Hayden as Leader. However, he was surprised to find out upon his return <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> Governor-General that Hayden had already resigned that morning, just hours before the writs were issued. In the election held a month later, Hawke led Labor to a landslide election victory, achieving a 24-seat swing—still the worst defeat that a sitting non-Labor Government has ever suffered—and ending seven years of Liberal Party rule.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, the {{families}} attempted {{to put forward}} a writ of amparo and accused the government of violating their rights by putting unnecessary barriers and forcing them to visit Mexico City {{to see the results}} of the DNA samples. On May 24, {{the families}} pushed their case to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) to help them retrieve the DNA samples from the PGR in Jalisco. The CNDH told the lawyer that the families no longer had to go to Mexico City for the DNA samples and that they could do the procedures in Jalisco. The government was able to confirm the identity of 3 of the 8 civilians killed. They stated that their DNA samples matched those of the family members, but clarified that these people were killed in clashes with security forces on May 1 and not on May 19. The families of Villa Purificación contested the government's final decision, and stated that between May and May 19, dozens of people were killed in the town. They claimed that the Army safeguarded the morgues to prevent civilians <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> bodies and identifying them. On May 22, the families of the missing people returned to Villa Purificación.|$|E

25|$|In Boston, the LRV {{situation}} {{was becoming a}} major political and public relations nightmare {{and led to the}} LRV fleet availability typically being less than 50% {{of the total number of}} cars on the property for the first few years of service. The MBTA was still accepting new cars from Boeing-Vertol, but the cars were falling out of service faster than the MBTA's maintenance staff could repair them. Additionally, the MBTA could not acquire replacement parts fast enough to repair the disabled LRVs. In a desperate effort to keep as many LRVs operating as possible, MBTA maintenance crews began cannibalizing some of the disabled cars for replacement parts. To help prevent the riding public <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> sheer number of brand-new, but heavily cannibalized LRVs, several of the cars were hidden around the system where the public was not likely to find them. A major newspaper story emerged when a reporter and a photographer managed to get into a section of the Green Line's subway which was not in use at the time and found it was full of cannibalized cars which had been abandoned in the tunnel. The MBTA had been towing the cars into the subway during the middle of the night when the subway was closed to the public. The story and photographs brought the problems with the LRV into the public eye for the first time. After the story broke, out-of-service LRVs began to appear in several storage yards which were easily viewed by the public, though this may have simply been due to the ever-increasing number of disabled cars.|$|E
500|$|Syers' {{entry into}} the World Championships {{prompted}} the ISU to discuss the subject of women competing against men at their next Congress in 1903. The concerns raised were that [...] "(1) the dress prevents the judges <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> feet; (2) a judge might judge a girl to whom he was attached; and (3) {{it is difficult to}} compare women with men." [...] The Congress voted six to three in favour of barring women from the championships.|$|E
500|$|Several stories {{mention that}} Warhol's choice of soup cans {{reflected}} his own avid devotion to Campbell's soup as a consumer. Robert Indiana once said: [...] "I knew Andy very well. The reason he painted soup cans {{is that he}} liked soup." [...] He was thought to have focused on them because they composed a daily dietary staple. Others observed that Warhol merely painted things he held close at heart. He enjoyed eating Campbell's soup, had a taste for Coca-Cola, loved money, and admired movie stars. Thus, they all became subjects of his work. Yet another account says that his daily lunches in his studio consisted of Campbell's Soup and Coca-Cola, and thus, his inspiration came <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> empty cans and bottles accumulate on his desk.|$|E
5000|$|All three drugs {{had been}} {{administered}} to Lockett, {{but it was}} unclear how much had entered his system.

This prevented staff <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> that <b>the</b> IV connection had failed. Patton has stated [...] "the chemicals did not enter into the offender". Prison officials had reportedly discussed taking Lockett to a hospital before he died.|$|R

500|$|The {{landscape}} in Eragon {{is based on}} the [...] "wild territory" [...] of Paolini's home state, Montana. He said in an interview: [...] "I go hiking a lot, and oftentimes when I'm in the forest or in the mountains, sitting down and seeing some of those little details makes the difference between having an okay description and having a unique description." [...] Paolini also said that Paradise Valley, Montana is [...] "one of the main sources" [...] of his inspiration for the {{landscape in}} the book (Eragon takes place in the fictional continent Alagaësia). Paolini [...] "roughed out" [...] the main history of the land before he wrote the book, but he did not draw a map of it until it became important to see where Eragon was traveling. He then started to get history and plot ideas <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> landscape depicted.|$|E
500|$|As in Land of the Soviets, where Hergé had {{based his}} {{information}} about the Soviet Union almost entirely on a single source, in Tintin in the Congo he used limited source material {{to learn about the}} country and its people. He based the story largely on literature written by missionaries, with the only added element being that of the diamond smugglers, possibly adopted from the [...] "Jungle Jim-type serials". Hergé visited the Colonial Museum of Tervuren, examining their ethnographic collections of Congolese artefacts, including costumes of the Leopard Men. He adopted hunting scenes from André Maurois's novel The Silence of Colonel Bramble, while his animal drawings were inspired by Benjamin Rabier's prints. He also listened to tales of the colony from some of his colleagues who had been there, but disliked their stories, later claiming: [...] "I didn't like the colonists, who came back bragging about their exploits. But I couldn't prevent myself <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> Blacks as big children, either." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the failure}} of the Hughes brothers' exhibition, a Hughes {{daughter}} continued showing the head to anyone who wanted to see it. An offer was made to Sir Joseph Banks, but “he desired to be excused <b>from</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> remains of the old Villanous Republican, the mention of whose very name made his blood boil with indignation”. William Bullock, considering a purchase, wrote to Lord Liverpool, who stated “the strong objection which would naturally arise to the exhibition of human remains at a Public Museum frequented by Persons of both Sexes and of all ages”. Failure to sell to public museums forced the daughter to sell it privately, and in 1815 it was sold to Josiah Henry Wilkinson, in whose family it would remain until its burial. Maria Edgeworth, attending breakfast with Wilkinson in 1822, was shown the head, and she wrote with great surprise that she had seen “Oliver Cromwell's head—not his picture—not his bust—nothing of stone or marble or plaister of Paris, but his real head”.|$|E
