40|$|This paper focusses on within-breed genetic {{variation}} in resistance to endoparasites in the Australian Merino. It stresses possible {{differences in the}} Merino resistance, simply because of different history of management. The Australian Merino was introduced into Australia 200 years ago. It has almost entirely developed in that environment, i. e., it has been exposed to different methods of parasite control drenching, {{and there has been}} very little natural selection for resistance in this breed over recent years. However, the Australian Merino has been studied for over 20 years for {{genetic variation}} in parasite resistance. Genetic variation in resistance to endoparasites has been studied in five flocks in Armidale, and on flocks in New Zealand and Fiji. They were assessed using faecal egg count following artificial infection. The first <b>flock</b> includes <b>lines</b> of medium-wool peppins, and the others are based on fine and fine-medium Merinos. The work with these flocks showed that the heritability of resistance to endoparasites is measurable and that resistance is not genetically correlated with such production traits as fertility, body weight, fibre diameter and wool weight...|$|R
40|$|Two {{flocks of}} ewes {{were used as}} sources of embryos for embryo {{transfer}} programs: a Merino <b>flock</b> comprising 3 <b>lines</b> differentially selected on weaning weight and a Coopworth flock consisting of three lines differentially selected for backfat thickness. Effects of embryo genotype, year of transfer, sire and number of embryos transferred on embryo survival were examined. No significant line or sire effects were found for either flock with a mean survival of 43. 2 % for directly transferred Merino embryos and 21. 9 % for frozen Coopworth embryos. Although not significant there was a trend for improved survival with increased number of embryos transferred per recipient...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the visual effects of {{animated}} 2 D line strokes and 3 D cubes. A given 2 D image is segmented into either 2 D line strokes or 3 D cubes. Each segmented object (i. e., line stroke or each cube) is initialised {{with the position}} and the colour of the corresponding pixel in the image. The program animates these objects using the boid framework. This simulates a <b>flocking</b> behavior of <b>line</b> strokes in a 2 D space and cubes in a 3 D space. In this implementation the animation runs in a cycle from {{the disintegration of the}} original image to a swarm of line strokes or 3 D cubes, then the swarm moves about and then integrates back into the original image (an example clip has been uploaded to YouTube and can be viewed at [URL]...|$|R
60|$|Each of the British columns {{was about}} 2000 strong, making {{a total of}} 14,000 men with about fifty guns engaged in the operations. A front of not less than ten miles was to be {{maintained}} by each force. The first decided move was {{on the part of}} the extreme left wing, Smith-Dorrien's column, which moved south on Carolina, and thence on Bothwell near Lake Chrissie. The arduous duty of passing supplies down from the line fell mainly upon him, and his force was in consequence larger than the others, consisting of 8500 men with thirteen guns. On the arrival of Smith-Dorrien at Carolina the other columns started, their centre of advance being Ermelo. Over seventy miles of veld the gleam of the helio by day and the flash of the signal lamps at night marked the steady flow of the British tide. Here and there the columns came in touch with the enemy and swept him before them. French had a skirmish at Wilge River at the end of January, and Campbell another south of Middelburg, in which he had twenty casualties. On February 4th Smith-Dorrien was at Lake Chrissie; French had passed through Bethel and the enemy was retiring on Amsterdam. The hundred-mile ends of the drag net were already contracted to a third of that distance, and the game was still known to be within it. On the 5th Ermelo was occupied, and the fresh deep ruts upon the veld told the British horsemen of the huge Boer convoy that was ahead of them. For days enormous herds, endless <b>flocks,</b> and <b>lines</b> of wagons which stretched from horizon to horizon had been trekking eastward. Cavalry and mounted infantry were all hot upon the scent.|$|R
40|$|A 40 -wk {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effects of limestone particle size on the production performance, skeletal integrity and Ca/P balance of three broiler breeder purelines. A <b>flock</b> of <b>LINE</b> A, LINE B and LINE C broiler breeders were reared according to Cobb 500 guidelines (Cobb-Vantress, 2005) and transferred to a production house at 21 wks of age. Each line was split into two groups consisting of 66, 68 and 62 hens for the LINE A, LINE B and LINE C lines, respectively and fed a diet that differed only in the inclusion of either large (3489. 7 microns; 38. 5 % solubility) or small particle (185. 5 microns; 58. 8 % solubility) limestone. Production performance, egg quality, breeder skeletal integrity, reproductive performance, progeny performance and Ca/P balance were monitored. LINE B produced the most eggs per hen housed and highest egg number, followed by LINE C and LINE A, respectively. Egg weight, specific gravity and shell weight were also superior in LINE B compared to the other purelines. The % P retention did not differ across purelines, but Ca retention was also highest in LINE B. Breeder skeletal integrity and progeny bone quality were higher in LINE C. The addition of large particle limestone in lieu of small particles did not provide a consistent effect in production performance but significantly improved shell quality (P = 0. 0013), bone quality (P = 0. 0341). The large genetic differences in purelines compared to parent stock may uniquely alter the effects of particulate calcium on production performance; yet large particle limestone provided the boost in shell quality and bone quality reported by others. In summary, LINE A, LINE B and LINE C purelines utilize Ca and P differently and have unique genetic potential for hatching egg production, egg shell quality, breeder bone ash and progeny bone ash...|$|R
40|$|Data on Dajllonke sheep {{collected}} from 1983 through 1992 on 29 participating farms {{of an open}} nucleus improvement programme and from the nucleus were analysed. Initial on-farm records on 14342 lambs and on-station records on 2551 ram lambs were edited down to 6605 for birth weight (BWT), 5857 for pre-selection (birth to 80 days) average daily gain (PSADG), 10417 for 80 -day weight (WT 80), 13054 for lamb survival at pre-selection, 1978 for 180 (WT 180) and 849 for 365 (WT 365) day weights. Year of birth, sire <b>line,</b> <b>flock,</b> month and season of birth had significant (at least P< 0. 05) effects on both on-farm and on-station weights and on lamb survival. Trait means were 2. 2 (s. e. 0. 02) kg for BWT, 69. 6 (s. e. 1. 26) g/day for PSADG, 9. 1 (s. e. 0. 05) kg for WT 80, 19. 7 (s. e. 0. 24) kg for WT 180 and 31. 8 (s. e. 0. 45) kg for WT 365. Mean survival was 90 (s. e. 0. 9) percent. Single lambs were heavier at birth and at 80 days of age, grew faster to 80 days and were about 200 and 500 g heavier at 180 and 365 days respectively than multiple lambs. There was a large variation between flocks: flock means for WT 80 varied from 6. 4 to 12. 0 kg (CV 0. 21), with smaller flocks having generally the lowest means. Lambs born in the hot-rainy season had the heaviest 180 - and 365 -day weights. Lambs born during the cool months of July to October had the lowest survival rate. Multiplicative factors {{were found to be}} more appropriate for adjusting on-farm recordes for type of birth, management level, birth date, season of birth and ewe parity than additive adjustment factors...|$|R
