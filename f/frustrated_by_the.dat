5|$|The West Indian surge {{for victory}} was <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> weather, which {{periodically}} interrupted the match throughout, and by an obdurate partnership of 161 between Gooch (146) and Gower (88*).|$|E

500|$|Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy {{describes}} [...] "Attack on Cloudbase" [...] as [...] "thrilling", opining {{that it is}} [...] "perhaps the highlight" [...] of the series. Like Stansfield, he {{is critical}} of what {{he refers to as}} the [...] "lame, 'it was all a dream' ending", judging it to be rendered more <b>frustrating</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the series' final episode, [...] "The Inquisition", is a clip show that ends ambiguously with regard to the fates of Spectrum and the Mysterons: [...] "Cut the final few minutes from 'Attack on Cloudbase' and imagine what a finale that would have been!" ...|$|R
5|$|Following {{his arrest}} and release Chatwin left Benin {{and went to}} Brazil to {{continue}} his research on de Sousa. <b>Frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of documented information on de Sousa, Chatwin chose instead to write a fictionalised biography of him. This book was published in 1980, and Werner Herzog's film, Cobra Verde (1987), is based on it.|$|E
5|$|The British naval command was {{continually}} <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of Machias as {{a staging}} point for militia actions in Nova Scotia.

5|$|Waddy {{resigned}} {{his commission}} in 1974 and became Military Advisor to Westland Helicopters, a post he held {{until his retirement}} in 1989. Although he found the work stimulating, Waddy was <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Army's lack of interest in the helicopter.|$|E
5000|$|The Flemish {{saw these}} {{facilities}} {{as a measure}} of integration to another language, as opposed to viewing it as a recognition of a permanent linguistic minority. The French-speaking people, however, saw these language facilities as an acquired right, and a step for an eventual addition to the bilingual region of Brussels, even though that would be unconstitutional. As a result, the amount of French-speaking people in these regions (mostly around Brussels) did not decline, and contain a growing majority of French-speaking Belgians, even though they reside in the officially monolingual Flanders. This [...] "frenchification" [...] is considered <b>frustrating</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Flemish Movement and a reason for a call to separate.|$|R
50|$|McCall's {{career has}} been mottled by several stints in drug {{rehabilitation}} facilities and arrests for disorderly behavior. He has attempted numerous comebacks, though the efforts have repeatedly been <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> run-ins with <b>the</b> law.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 Dufka went to Nairobi, Kenya {{to cover}} {{the bombing of the}} American Embassy. She arrived hours after the blast, and was deeply <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> 'missing <b>the</b> scoop.' Later, upon {{watching}} the news coverage of the attack, Dufka realized that she had lost “compassion” for the subjects of her work, and resolved to end her career as a photojournalist.|$|R
5|$|Although NASA was {{supporting}} {{his work with}} grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research. He thought that small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies. In 1977, O'Neill and his wife Tasha founded the Space Studies Institute, a non-profit organization, at Princeton University. SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private donors, and in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement.|$|E
5|$|Although the Spanish had won decisive {{victories}} at Sonsonate and Acajutla, {{they failed}} to take the fortified Pipil cities of Cuscatlan and Izalco. Alvarado was informed that extensive lands lay ahead, with difficult terrain, many cities, and large populations. <b>Frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of progress, Alvarado withdrew to Guatemala to regroup, {{with the intention of}} returning in the dry season; He had been in the province of Cuscatlan for seventeen days, and left it at the end of June 1524.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, still <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the Railway and Port Company, Hesketh-Fleetwood organised the formation of the Preston and Wyre Railway Company to raise the funds required to bring the railway to Fleetwood. The estimated cost was £122,000. The company obtained Royal assent to start construction, with an underwritten guarantee from Hesketh-Fleetwood. The following year Hesketh-Fleetwood and Burton oversaw the marking out of Fleetwood's first street, and the first railway lines were laid.|$|E
5000|$|It was in {{part due}} to McParlan's {{strategic}} place in the Senate that the [...] "Oak Creek Law" [...] was passed in 1955, enabling semi-rural Oak Creek, part of his district, to incorporate as a city, thus <b>frustrating</b> annexation <b>by</b> <b>the</b> City of Milwaukee.|$|R
40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{offer new}} paradigms for training, allowing novel forms {{of teaching and}} learning to be devised; unfortunately, however, many e-learning systems are still based on complex procedures and unusable interfaces, which are regarded as intimidating, confusing or simply <b>frustrating</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> user. In this paper we consider the possibility of exploiting vision and speech as intuitive communication channels, to enhance the quality of the interaction between users and e-learning platforms. Through an analysis of current research in the field of vision-based and speech-based perceptive interfaces, we will discuss some application scenarios for e-learning, stressing the important role that such natural communication forms could play in improving the interaction process.

50|$|From near extinction, {{the cause}} of the disinherited was now revived; but it needed {{direction}} and focus. Above all, it needed a cause, something greater than <b>frustrated</b> ambition. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> early 1330s the cause had become Edward Balliol, in the judgement of some the rightful King of Scotland.|$|R
5|$|In March 1942, the Japanese {{military}} {{adopted a}} strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia. This plan was <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway. Following {{the defeat of the}} Japanese surface fleet, the IJN submarines were deployed to disrupt Allied supply lines by attacking shipping off the Australian east coast.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season, the Lakers won 26 {{of their first}} 39 games, but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40. They were eliminated {{in the first round}} by Phoenix again. <b>Frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the offseason. Buss initially agreed to seek a trade, but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.|$|E
5|$|Mowbray left Hibs in October 2006 {{to manage}} West Bromwich Albion, and was {{replaced}} by former player John Collins. The team won the 2007 Scottish League Cup Final under his management, but the club sold Kevin Thomson, Scott Brown and Steven Whittaker for fees totalling more than £8million. Collins resigned later that year, <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of funds provided to sign new players. Former Hibs player Mixu Paatelainen was hired to replace Collins, but he left after the end of his first full season.|$|E
50|$|Vivacious Lady is a {{story of}} love at first sight between a young botany {{professor}} named Peter Morgan Jr. (Stewart) and a nightclub singer named Francey (Rogers). The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly <b>frustrated</b> attempts <b>by</b> <b>the</b> newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other.|$|R
60|$|Defense was, in fact, impossible, but Colonel Cox {{attempted}} to negotiate, because {{he hoped that}} Wellington would at once advance to his rescue. His intentions were <b>frustrated,</b> however, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> treachery and mutiny of the principal Portuguese officers under him, and the French at once took possession of the ruins.|$|R
50|$|Alaric {{survived the}} attack and, outraged at this treachery and <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> all <b>the</b> past {{failures}} at accommodation, {{gave up on}} negotiating with Honorius {{and headed back to}} Rome, which he besieged for the third and final time. On August 24, 410, the Visigoths entered Rome through its Salarian Gate, according to some opened by treachery, according to others by want of food, and pillaged the city for three days.|$|R
5|$|Simon {{has stated}} that he {{originally}} set out to create a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his writing partner Ed Burns, a former homicide detective and public school teacher {{who had worked with}} Simon on projects including The Corner (2000). Burns, when working on protracted investigations of violent drug dealers using surveillance technology, had often been <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bureaucracy of the Baltimore Police Department; Simon saw similarities with his own ordeals as a police reporter for The Baltimore Sun.|$|E
5|$|The Bomber Mafia were {{a close-knit}} group of American {{military}} men {{who believed that}} long-range heavy bomber aircraft in large numbers were able to win a war. The derogatory term 'Bomber Mafia' was used before and after World War II by those in the military who did not share their belief, and who were <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> insistence of the men that the heavy bomber should take a primary position in planning and funding.|$|E
5|$|After decades, the Oneida became <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{failure of}} the case to settle. Instead, they began to {{purchase}} land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting sovereignty over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E
50|$|Weep Not, Child {{integrates}} Gikuyu mythology and {{the ideology}} of nationalism that serves as catalyst {{for much of the}} novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonialism and imperialism. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt.|$|R
50|$|On 9 February 2016 the SSRO's chair Jeremy Newman resigned. The Telegraph's Alan Tovey claimed sources {{had told}} him this was because Newman was <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> {{interference}} from <b>the</b> Ministry of Defence, which was allegedly preventing the SSRO from doing its job. Newman was replaced with Clive Tucker as interim chair.|$|R
5000|$|Ben Barrett, {{writing in}} Rock, Paper, Shotgun, found the game had the [...] "addictive nature {{synonymous with the}} genre", and found himself logging in almost daily to play. He was <b>frustrated</b> however <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{business}} model, {{and the lack of}} a secondary market for cards, which he felt gave the game a [...] "slight 'pay-to-win' feel".|$|R
5|$|After {{moving from}} Perthshire to Birmingham {{to set up}} {{business}} as a draper, McGregor became involved with local football club Aston Villa, which he helped to establish {{as one of the}} leading teams in England. He served the club for over 20 years in various capacities, including president, director and chairman. In 1888, <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> regular cancellation of Villa's matches, McGregor organised a meeting of representatives of England's leading clubs, which {{led to the formation of}} the Football League, giving member clubs a guaranteed fixture list each season. This was instrumental in the transition of football from an amateur pastime to a professional business.|$|E
5|$|As {{successful}} self-determination movements {{spread throughout}} Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in outlook, and increasingly <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> nation's continued subservience to foreign rule. For the other side, many enculturated indigenous Africans who were fully {{integrated into the}} Portugal-ruled social organization of Portuguese Mozambique, in particular those from the urban centres, reacted to the independentist claims {{with a mixture of}} discomfort and suspicion. The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast-paced development projects.|$|E
5|$|At the foundry {{near the}} Carey Street Bridge, {{a crowd of}} more than 100 {{gathered}} and threatened to {{set fire to the}} area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired {{over the heads of the}} crowd was sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to burn a B transportation barge at Fell's Point. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between citizens and the police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to set fire the 6th Regiment armory, but all were <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> remaining garrison there.|$|E
50|$|John began {{participating}} in governmental affairs in Brandenburg in 1424. <b>Frustrated</b> <b>by</b> disputes with <b>the</b> feudal nobility, Frederick I retired to his castle at Cadolzburg in Franconia in 1425, granting the regency of Brandenburg to John at a Landtag in Rathenow on January 13, 1426, while retaining the electoral dignity for himself.|$|R
5000|$|Cooper loves being a photographer, but is <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> some of <b>the</b> {{vocabulary}} {{that is used}} in the field. He indicates, [...] "I {{hate the}} words [...] "snap", [...] "shoot" [...] and [...] "take" [...] {{when it comes to making}} photographs. Everything I do is very seriously built up. They are 'made' pictures." ...|$|R
50|$|After Passion Fodder disbanded, {{he founded}} the band Horsepower with David Eugene Edwards and Jean-Yves Tola. <b>Frustrated</b> <b>by</b> misconceptions about <b>the</b> name Horsepower being related to heroin use, and {{inspired}} by a traditional American folk song about sixteen horses pulling the coffin of a beloved to the graveyard, the name was changed to 16 Horsepower.|$|R
