5|$|Cloud Gate <b>is</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a transformative, iconic work. It {{is similar}} to many of Kapoor's {{previous}} works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground mirrors, {{they also have a}} more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless. Cloud Gate is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics. Kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, Cloud Gate limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension. The sculpture <b>is</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a disembodied, luminous form, which is also how his earlier 1000 Names (197980) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.|$|E
