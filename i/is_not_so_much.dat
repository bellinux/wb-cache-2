5|$|In conclusion, {{the insistence}} of ahimsa <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about non-injury to others {{as it is about}} non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self. The {{ultimate}} rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally about karmic results of the hiṃsā on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for its own sake.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered {{to be more of a}} working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E

25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{a protest}} song trend in France, but rather of a {{permanent}} background of criticism and contestation, and individuals who personify it. World War II and its horrors forced French singers to think more critically about war in general, forcing them to question their governments and the powers who ruled their society.|$|E
25|$|Critics also {{dispute the}} claim that Centering Prayer is in the {{tradition}} of the Desert Fathers and Carmelite saints, saying that traditional Catholic contemplative prayer <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> a method of prayer as a stage of prayer in which God's action predominates. They cite the Catechism of the Catholic Church as evidence that meditation and contemplation are two different expressions of prayer.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the danger, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the {{annoyance}} that now bowed down {{the spirits of}} young Shelton; it was the profound humiliation to have escaped Sir Daniel, convinced Lord Risingham, and now fall helpless {{into the hands of}} this old drunken sailor; and not merely helpless, but, as his conscience loudly told him when it was too late, actually guilty--actually the bankrupt debtor of the man whose ship he had stolen and lost.|$|R

25|$|The {{good deed}} {{is a key}} {{component}} of the law and promise. Baden-Powell felt this is the main duty God asks for, and fulfilling our duty to others makes us happy, which fulfills the duty to ourselves. The point <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the deed itself, which could be minor, but to teach the Scout to always pay attention and recognise if he could help someone.|$|E
25|$|Communicative {{language}} teaching (CLT), {{also known as}} the Communicative Approach, emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of learning a language. Despite a number of criticisms it continues to be popular, particularly in Europe, where constructivist views on language learning and education in general dominate academic discourse.

25|$|The wheat cent was {{mainstream}} {{and common}} during its time. Some dates are rare, but many {{can still be}} found in circulation. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that unlike the formerly silver denominations (dollar, half, quarter, dime), the composition of the pre-1982 cent, nearly pure copper, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more valuable over face value for it to be hoarded to the extreme extent of the silver denominations.|$|E

25|$|The 1998 {{home run}} race had {{generated}} nearly unbroken positive publicity, but Barry Bonds' {{run for the}} all-time home run record provoked a backlash over steroids, which increase a person's testosterone level and subsequently enable that person to bodybuild with much more ease.

25|$|Rome's {{influence}} on Britain {{with respect to}} wine <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> viticultural as it is cultural. Throughout modern history, the British have {{played a key role}} in shaping the world of wine and defining global wine markets. Though evidence of V. vinifera vines in the British Isles dates back to the Hoxnian Stage when the climate was much warmer than it is today, British interest in wine production greatly increased following the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD.|$|E
25|$|An {{essential}} {{question of}} practical reason for Hume was {{whether or not}} standards or principles exist (and if they do, what they are) for practical reason, that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people’s intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of practical reason.|$|E

25|$|During this time, {{a gradual}} shift occurs in Adrian's focus from the bass sax to the vibraphone. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that Rollini was {{giving up on}} the bass {{saxophone}} or his abilities, as that popular tastes had rendered the instrument unmarketable after the hot jazz era of the 1920s. Rollini recorded on bass sax {{for the last time}} in 1938. He continued to be active with vibraphone and chimes, but sadly, when he gave up his role as a bass saxophonist, his role in jazz went with it.|$|E
25|$|Similar to yoga, {{learning}} the Tree of Life <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> Magick {{as it is}} a way to map out one's spiritual universe. As such, the adept may use the Tree to determine a destination for astral travel, to choose which gods to invoke for what purposes, et cetera. It also {{plays an important role in}} modeling the spiritual journey, where the adept begins in Malkuth, which is the every-day material world of phenomena, with the ultimate goal being at Kether, the sphere of Unity with the All.|$|E
25|$|For {{years the}} Touraine region would {{compete with the}} Beaujolais region {{for the release of}} an early {{bottling}} of Gamay that would rival the Beaujolais nouveau. While the competition <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of a focal point now, there are still some producers who release early bottlings of the wine around the same time as Beaujolais. The soil around the Touraine area is a variety of limestone with excellent drainage that is known as tuffeau which is the same material used to build many of the famous Loire Valley Châteaux.|$|E
