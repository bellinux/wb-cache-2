40|$|Abstract: A {{recently}} developed quantum-chemistry-like methodology to study molecules solvated in atomic clusters {{is applied to}} the IC 1 (<b>iodine</b> <b>chloride)</b> polar diatomic molecule immersed in clusters of He atoms. The atoms of the solvent clusters are treated as the `electrons' and the solvated molecule as a structured` nucleus' of the combined solvent-solute system. The helium-helium and helium-dopant interactions are represented by parametrized two-body and ab initio three-body potentials, respectively. The ground-state wavefunctions are used to compute the infrared (IR) spectra of the solvated molecule. In agreement with the experimental observations, the computed spectra exhibit considerable differences depending on whether the solvent cluster is comprised of bosonic (He- 4) or fermionic (He- 3) atoms. The source of these differences is attributed to the different spin-statistics of the solvent clusters. The bosonic versus fermionic nature of the solvent is reflected in the IR absorption selection rules. Only P and R branches with single state transitions appear in the spectrum when the molecule is solvated in a bosonic cluster. On the other hand, when the solvent represents a fermionic environment, quasi-degenerate multiplets of spin states contribute to each branch and, in addition, the Q-branch becomes also allowed. Combined, these two factors explain the more congested nature of the spectrum in the fermionic case...|$|E

Factors influencing the preference for manganation at the crowded positions ortho to the C=O in meta-substituted aryl ketones and esters are considered.

Properties of the films are determined using infrared and visible absorption spectroscopy, ellipsometry, Auger, ESCA and conductance - capacitance spectroscopy.

In general, the films showed slight, or no traces of oxygen. The maximum optical bandgap obtained was 2. 7 e. v. The optical absorption studies indicate a downward trend for the optical bandgap with increasing negative d. c. bias on the substrates. The annealed samples indicate a gradual narrowing of optical bandgap with increasing anneal temperatures, as well as a loss in their diamond-like quality.
