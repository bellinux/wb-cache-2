We also employ a novel ultraviolet regulator that is natural for the light-cone worldsheet description of planar Feynman diagrams. We show that these regulators give the known answers for the helicity non-conserving one-loop amplitudes, which don’t {{suffer from the}} usual infrared vagaries of massless particle scattering. For the maximal helicity violating process we elucidate the physics of the remarkable fact that the loop momentum integrand for the on-shell Green function associated with this process, with a suitable momentum routing of the different contributing topologies, is identically zero.

40|$|The mass of {{the lowest}} scalar {{glueball}} is discussed by using QCD sum rules. We find that the glueball mass is sensitive to the choice of moments and slightly depends on the radiative corrections. With the help of suitable moments and stability criteria, we get the scalar glueball mass: 1710 ± 110 MeV without radiative corrections and 1580 ± 150 MeV with radiative corrections. 1 Intoduction The existence of bound gluon states, glueballs, is a direct consequence based on the QCD self-interactions among gluons. Although there are several glueball candidates experimentally, there is no conclusive evidence on them. Recently, one pays particular attention to three states: f 0 (1500) (J= 0), fJ(1710) (J= 0 or 2), and ξ(2230) (J ≥ 2). They seem like glueball candidates of 0 ++ or 2 ++ states. The properties of glueballs have been investigated in the lattice gauge theory and in many models based on the QCD theory. Even in the lattice <b>gauge</b> <b>calculation,</b> there are different predictions for the 0 ++ glueball. IBM group [1] predicts the lightest 0 ++ glueball mass...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} brief {{description}} of the light-cone <b>gauge</b> <b>calculation</b> of the spindependent next-to-leading order splitting functions. It has recently become possible to perform analyses of the spin-dependent parton distributions of a longitudinally polarized hadron at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy of QCD. A first such phenomenological NLO study, taking into account all available experimental data on polarized deep-inelastic scattering has been presented in 1, followed by the analyses 2. An indispensable ingredient here are the polarized two-loop splitting functions (or anomalous dimensions) ∆P (1) ij which appear in the NLO Q 2 -evolution equations for the spin-dependent parton densities. Results (in the MS scheme) for the ∆P (1) ij have first been obtained in 3 where the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) formalism was used. The results were afterwards confirmed in 4 using the somewhat more efficient method developed in 5 and employed in the unpolarized case in 6, 7, 8, which is based on the factorization properties of mass singularities and on the use of the axial gauge. In this paper we give {{a brief description}} of our calculation 4. To begin with, we collect all ingredients for a NLO analysis of longitudinally polarized deep-inelastic scattering in terms of the spin-dependent structure function g 1 (x, Q 2). Beyond LO, there are two different short-distance cross sections, ∆Cq and ∆Cg, for scattering off incoming polarized quarks and gluons, respectively. Thus the NLO expression for g 1 reads in general: g 1 (x, Q 2) = 1 2 nf e i= 1 2 i + αs(Q 2...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the second}} {{of a pair of}} {{articles}} on scattering of glue by glue, in which we give the light-cone <b>gauge</b> <b>calculation</b> of the one-loop on-shell helicity conserving scattering amplitudes for gluon-gluon scattering (neglecting quark loops). The 1 /p + factors in the gluon propagator are regulated by replacing p + integrals with discretized sums omitting the p + = 0 terms in each sum. We also employ a novel ultraviolet regulator that is convenient for the light-cone worldsheet description of planar Feynman diagrams. The helicity conserving scattering amplitudes are divergent in the infra-red. The infrared divergences in the elastic one-loop amplitude are shown to cancel, in their contribution to cross sections, against ones in the cross section for unseen bremsstrahlung gluons. We include here the explicit calculation of the latter, because it assumes an unfamiliar form due to the peculiar way discretization of p + regulates infrared divergences. In resolving the infrared divergences we employ a covariant definition of jets, which allows a transparent demonstration of the Lorentz invariance of our final results. Because we use an explicit cutoff of the ultraviolet divergences in exactly 4 space-time dimensions, we must introduce explicit counterterms to achieve this final covariant result. These counter-terms are polynomials in the external momenta of the precise order dictated by power-counting. We discuss the modifications they entail for the light-cone worldsheet action that reproduces the “bare ” planar diagrams of the gluonic sector of QCD. The simplest {{way to do this is}} to interpret the QCD string as moving in six space-time dimensions...|$|E

The volumes are directly proportional to the charged particle pseudorapidity densities 6. 75 < dNc/dη < 20. 2. The hadronization temperature is T = 179. 5 ± 5 (syst) MeV. The hadronization energy density is ǫ = 1. 10 ± 0. 26 GeV/fm 3, corresponding to an excitation of 24. 8 ± 6. 2 quark-gluon degrees of freedom.
