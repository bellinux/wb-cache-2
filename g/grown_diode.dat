40|$|A {{systematic}} {{series of}} GaAsBi pin <b>diodes</b> was <b>grown</b> by MBE using different growth temperatures and Bi fluxes, {{to study the}} effect on the structural and opto-electronic properties of GaAsBi. The Bi contents of the diodes show both growth temperature and Bi flux dependences. The <b>diodes</b> <b>grown</b> at higher temperatures show evidence of long range inhomogeneity from X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, whereas samples of comparable Bi content grown at lower temperatures appear to have well defined, uniform GaAsBi regions. However, the high temperature <b>grown</b> <b>diodes</b> exhibit more intense photoluminescence (PL) and lower dark currents. The results suggest that growth temperature related defects have a greater influence on the dark current than bismuth related defects, and therefore GaAsBi devices should be grown at the highest temperature possible for the desired Bi content...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} metal/semiconductor Schottky {{barriers}} have found numerous applications in nanoelectronics. The work {{presented in this}} thesis focuses on the improvement of {{a few of the}} relevant devices using electrodeposition of metal on Ge for Schottky barrier fabrication. This low energy metallisation technique offers numerous advantages over the physical vapour deposition techniques. Electrical characteristics of the <b>grown</b> <b>diodes</b> show a high quality rectifying behaviour with extremely low leakage currents even on highly doped Ge. A non-Arrhenius behaviour of the temperature dependence is observed for the <b>grown</b> Ni/Ge <b>diodes</b> on lowly doped Ge that is explained by a spatial variation of the barrier heights. The inhomogeneity of the barrier hights is explained in line with an intrinsic surface states model for Ge. The understanding of the intrinsic surface states will help to create ohmic contacts for doped n-MOSFETs. NiGe were formed single phase by annealing. Results reveal that by using these high-quality germanide Schottky barriers as the source/drain, the subthreshold leakage currents of a Schottky barrier MOSFET could be minimised, in particular, due to the very low drain/body junction leakage current exhibited by the electrodeposited diodes. The Ni/Ge diodes on highly doped Ge show negative differential conductance at low temperature. This effect is attributed to the intervalley electron transfer in Ge conduction band to a low mobility valley. The results show experimentally that Schottky junctions could be used for hot electron injection in transferred-electron devices. A vertical Co/Ni/Si structure has been fabricated for spin injection and detection in Si. It is shown that the system functions electrically well although no magnetoresistance indicative of spin injection was observed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Structural, electrical, and optical properties of these WLEDs were measured and analyzed. Room temperature electroluminescence spectrum reveals a broad emission band covering the range from 420 to 750 nm. In order to distinguish the white light components and contribution of the PFO layer we used a Gaussian function to simulate the experimental data. Color coordinates measurement of the WLED reveals that the emitted light has a white impression.

While {{there is only a}} small fluctua-tion from the straight l ine for (100) orientation, there exists quite a large fluctuation for the (l l l) -A and (l l l) -B. Our results indicate that SiAs and Si-complex atoms form a broad acceptor band, the peak of which varies as the Si in the melt is varied. The band is ap-parently formed by the acceptor levels seen previously by others at 0. 03, 0. 100, and 0. 23 eV above the valence band. The Si concentration apparently changes the relative concentration of these levels. Figure 4 shows the relationship between the spectral peak and the power efficiency. There is an optimum efficiency range between 9600 and 9700 A [these cor-respond to 144 and 157 meV deviation from the GaAs bandgap (7) ].

The effects of ex situ thermal annealing are presented for temperatures between 640 and 800 C. A maximum peak to valley current ratio (PVCR) of 1. 47 was obtained at the optimum annealing temperature of 680 C for 1 min. Peak and valley (excess) currents decreased more than two orders of magnitude as annealing temperatures and times were increased with rates empirically determined to have thermal activation energies of 2. 2 and 2. 4 eV respectively. The decrease in current density is attributed to widening of the tunneling barrier due to the diffusion of phosphorus and boron. A peak current density of 47 kA/cm 2 (PVCR = 13) was achieved and is the highest reported current density for a Si-based Esaki <b>diode</b> (<b>grown</b> by either epitaxy or by alloying).
