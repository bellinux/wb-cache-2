5000|$|There {{has been}} a much debate lately {{regarding}} this issue in Toronto, especially with recent Mayor Rob Ford vowing to remove all graffiti from the City of Toronto, defining graffiti as [...] "One or more letters, symbols, figures, etching, scratches, inscriptions, stains, or other markings that disfigure or deface a structure or thing, howsoever made or otherwise affixed on the structure or thing, but, for greater certainty, does not include an art mural" [...] and defines an art mural as a [...] "mural for a designated surface and location that has been deliberately implemented {{for the purpose of}} beautifying the specific location." [...] Mural work also serves as a platform to create and link communities, <b>document</b> <b>history</b> and tradition, and to facilitate purpose and voice to its collaborators. Mural painting is not simply about making something visually appealing; the majority of active mural artists create work that captures the human experience and transforms intangible words and emotion to something that can be seen and touched.|$|E

5000|$|The company’s {{original}} {{land title}} plant and <b>document</b> <b>history</b> {{dates back to}} the sovereignty of Texas as a territory when the King of Spain granted land to the original settlers of Texas prior to its period as a Republic from 1836-1845. During the Reconstruction Era of the United States following the Civil War, the abstract and land title industry was in disarray regarding valid ownership of land and real estate claims, which gave rise to need for land & real estate contract negotiations, procedures and transactions to be insured. The general title insurance concept had previously been conceived but was not a fully legal industry within land transactions. A Pennsylvania dispute that arose in 1868, which eventually settled in 1873, led to the legal incorporation of U.S. title insurance companies, in The General Corporation Act passed in 1874. The first company in Texas which arose out of the merging concepts of abstract, title and insurance, Gracy was founded from an existing abstract of title company, as James V. Bergen and Company in 1873 by surveyor James Valentine Bergen and George B. Zimpelman, a former Travis County Texas sheriff, land developer and owner of LBJ Ranch. As Zimpelman's business influence in Texas development, increased he was given partnership, and the firm was renamed Zimpelman & Bergen. David Bergen Gracy, James Bergen’s cousin, joined the firm in 1881. When Zimpelman retired, the name changed to Bergen Daniel & Gracy Abstract Company (headed by James Bergen, David Bergen Gracy, and Charles Daniel at 103 E. 6th Street). The Austin Board of Trade referred to the firm as [...] "the only institution here that furnishes reliable abstract of title in the county." [...] The office later moved to 819 Congress Ave. David Gracy served as Austin’s city treasurer, city commissioner, and assisted in the organization of several prominent deposit & loan and mortgage companies in Austin. The company became Gracy Title Guaranty Company in 1920 and was owned and operated by the Gracy family until 1947.|$|E

40|$|The trigram {{statistical}} {{language model}} is remarkably successful {{when used in}} such applications as speech recognition. However, the trigram model is static in that it only considers the previous two words when making a prediction about a future word. The work presented here attempts to improve upon the trigram model by considering additional contextual and longer distance information. This is frequently {{referred to in the}} literature as adaptive statistical language modelling because the model is thought of as adapting to the longer term information. This work considers the creation of topic specific models, statistical evidence from {{the presence or absence of}} triggers, or related words, in the <b>document</b> <b>history</b> (document triggers) and in the current sentence (in-sentence triggers), and the incorporation of the document cache, which predicts the probability of a word by considering its frequency in the <b>document</b> <b>history.</b> An important result of this work is that the presence of self-triggers, that is, whether or not the word itself occurred in the <b>document</b> <b>history,</b> is an extremely important piece of information. A maximum entropy (ME) approach will be used in many instances to incorporate information from different sources. Maximum entropy considers a model which maximizes entropy while satisfying the constraints presented by the information we wish to incorporate. The generalized iterative scaling (GIS) algorithm can be used to compute the maximum entropy solution. This work also considers various methods of smoothing the information in a maximum entropy model. An inportant result is that smoothing improves performance noticibly and that Good-Turing discounting is an effective method of smoothing.
