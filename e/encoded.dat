5000|$|VBR {{is created}} using the {{so-called}} single-pass <b>encoding</b> or multi-pass <b>encoding.</b> Single-pass <b>encoding</b> analyzes and <b>encodes</b> the data [...] "on the fly" [...] {{and it is}} also used in constant bitrate <b>encoding.</b> Single-pass <b>encoding</b> is used when the <b>encoding</b> speed is most important — e.g. for real-time <b>encoding.</b> Single-pass VBR <b>encoding</b> is usually controlled by the fixed quality setting or by the bitrate range (minimum and maximum allowed bitrate) or by the average bitrate setting. Multi-pass <b>encoding</b> is used when the <b>encoding</b> quality is most important. Multi-pass <b>encoding</b> cannot be used in real-time <b>encoding,</b> live broadcast or live streaming. Multi-pass <b>encoding</b> takes much longer than single-pass <b>encoding,</b> because every pass means one pass through the input data (usually through the whole input file). Multi-pass <b>encoding</b> is used only for VBR <b>encoding,</b> because CBR <b>encoding</b> doesn't offer any flexibility to change the bitrate. The most common multi-pass <b>encoding</b> is two-pass <b>encoding.</b> In the first pass of two-pass <b>encoding,</b> the input data is being analyzed and the result is stored in a log file. In the second pass, the collected data from the first pass is used to achieve the best <b>encoding</b> quality. In a video <b>encoding,</b> two-pass <b>encoding</b> is usually controlled by the average bitrate setting or by the bitrate range setting (minimal and maximal allowed bitrate) or by the target video file size setting.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Multi-pixel <b>encoding</b> is an {{emerging}} method in visual cryptography for {{that it can}} <b>encode</b> more than one pixel for each <b>encoding</b> run. Nevertheless, in fact its <b>encoding</b> efficiency is still low because of that the <b>encoding</b> length is invariable and very small for each run. This paper presents a novel multi-pixel <b>encoding</b> called pixel-block aware <b>encoding.</b> It scans the secret image by zigzag and perceives a pixel block with as many pixels as possible to <b>encode</b> for each run. A pixel-block consists of consecutive pixels of same type during the scanning. The proposed scheme has advantage in <b>encoding</b> efficiency over single-pixel <b>encoding</b> and other known multi-pixel <b>encoding</b> methods. Furthermore, this scheme can work well for both threshold access structure and general access structure and well for both gray-scale and chromatic images without pixel expansion. The experimental results also show that it can achieve good quality for overlapped images.

30|$|Options {{exists for}} how to <b>encode</b> {{categorical}} variables, and different techniques have different advantages and disadvantages. A few examples include one-hot <b>encoding,</b> label or ordinal <b>encoding,</b> target mean <b>encoding,</b> and leave-one-out <b>encoding.</b> One-hot <b>encoding</b> replaces N levels with N- 1 binary features equal to 1 if the categorical features is at that level and 0 if not. Label or ordinal <b>encoding</b> replaces each level with an integer. Target mean <b>encoding</b> replaces each level with its proportion of occurrence in the target categories. For example, if the categorical variable is gender (M, F) and the response is binary (0, 1), then M and F would {{be replaced by the}} proportion of time each gender equals one. Leave-one-out <b>encoding</b> is similar to target mean <b>encoding</b> except that it leaves out the specific record when calculating the proportions.|$|R
