5|$|The Order is {{dedicated}} to the principles of Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism. A First Degree exemplification ceremony, by which a man joins the Order, explicates the virtue of charity. He {{is said to be a}} First Degree Knight of Columbus; after participating in the subsequent degrees, each of which focuses on another virtue, <b>he</b> <b>rises</b> to that status. Upon reaching the Third Degree, a gentleman is a full member. Priests do not participate directly in Degree exemplifications as laymen do, but rather take the degree by observation.|$|E
5|$|A young Serb {{boy from}} the {{vicinity}} of Višegrad is taken from his mother by the Ottomans {{as part of the}} devşirme levy, one of many Christian boys to experience this fate during the Ottoman Empire's 500-year-long occupation of the Balkans. The boy's mother follows her son wailing until she reaches the Drina River, where he is taken across by ferry and she can no longer follow. The young boy is converted to Islam and assigned the Turkish name of Mehmed, becoming known as Mehmed-paša Sokolović. <b>He</b> <b>rises</b> through the Ottoman military ranks and around the age of 60 becomes the Grand Vizier, a position he holds for the next fifteen years. During his time as Grand Vizier, he serves under three sultans and oversees the Ottoman Empire's expansion into Central Europe. He remains haunted by the memory of being forcibly taken from his mother and orders the construction of a bridge at the part of the river where the two became separated.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth and}} final entry in the Uncharted series, , was showcased at E3 2014, during Sony's press conference. A trailer {{features}} a wounded Drake washing ashore an island. <b>He</b> <b>rises,</b> grabs his gun, and checks its ammo before walking into a jungle-like area, as the camera pans to show hanging cages with skeletons inside. The trailer also features a conversation between Drake and Sully, where Drake asks for Sully's help, having seemingly just laid out a plan. Sully warns Nate against it, but Nate responds {{that he has no}} choice, and asks if he can count on Sully one last time, who confirms that he can. A Thief's End takes place three years after the events of Drake's Deception. Drake has retired from fortune hunting, and is seemingly still married to Elena, as he still wears his ring in the trailer, but is dragged back into the profession by his thought dead older brother, Sam Drake (voiced by Troy Baker), after the latter discovers a lead to the semi-mythical anarchist colony of Libertalia and with it, the possible location of the treasure stolen by the legendary pirate captain Henry Avery.|$|E

The chief plans a trick for his benefit and, putting on a mantle crown, sits down as though he were a king on a throne. Don Quixote is deceived and kneels to the chief in homage. The chief bids that he sit beside him and orders a festival to be given in his honor. This begins with Gypsy dances and is followed by a performance of the marionette theatre. Don Quixote is delighted with the entertainment but, mistaking the heroine for his Dulcinea and the marionettes for soldiers attacking her, <b>he</b> <b>rises</b> to assault them. The gypsies are terrified. At this moment the clown and Graziosa run away.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel is}} set in the fictional State of Afrozabad, which is modeled on the Indian city of Hyderabad, the capital of the state of Telangana and follows the {{political}} career of its protagonist Anand a naive idealist who goes on to become the prime minister of the nation. Much of the story corresponds closely to Rao's own experiences and political career albeit fictionalised. Anand begins his political career by rebelling against Afrozabad's tyrannical ruler. As <b>he</b> <b>rises</b> within the political party of which he is a member, Anand is drawn into the tussle between Chief Minister Mahendranath, a character modeled on Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, and his political rival Chaudhury, who is based on Kasu Brahmananda Reddy. As Chaudhary and his partner Shekhar successfully replace Mahendranath with Chaudhury as Chief Minister, Anand is made a minister under Chaudhary.|$|E
500|$|Though in Legends works Thrawn {{was mostly}} used in post-Return of the Jedi storylines, Thrawn is set {{prior to the}} events of the {{original}} 1977 film. It covers several years between Thrawn's [...] "first encounter" [...] with the Empire and the events of the third season of Rebels, chronicling his rise to power. In the novel, exiled Chiss warrior Thrawn is rescued by Imperial soldiers, and soon proves a valuable asset to the Empire. His cunning and expertise as a tactician soon attract the attention of Emperor Palpatine himself, though Thrawn's renegade tactics ignite the ire of his superiors. As <b>he</b> <b>rises</b> in rank, Thrawn trains his aide-de-camp Ensign Eli Vanto in the ways of war, and finds himself in a rivalry with ruthless administrator Arihnda Pryce.|$|E

500|$|As {{the trap}} had been sprung too early, {{portions}} of the column had not yet entered the ravine. [...] Most of these men panicked and fled; some of the attacking Indians pursued them, resulting {{in a string of}} dead and wounded that extended for several miles. [...] Between the loss of the column rear and those killed or wounded in the initial volleys, only about one half of Herkimer's men were likely still fighting thirty minutes into the battle. [...] Some of the attackers, notably those not armed with muskets, waited for the flash of an opponent's musket fire before rushing to attack with the tomahawk before the enemy had time to reload, a highly effective tactic against those men who did not have bayonets. [...] Louis Atayataronghta, a Mohawk warrior fighting with Herkimer's men, shot one of the enemy whose fire had been devastating in its accuracy, noting that [...] "every time <b>he</b> <b>rises</b> up he kills one of our men".|$|E
500|$|Fisher has {{observed}} that Puccini's was a tragic muse; {{in the second}} act of Tosca, according to Newman, <b>he</b> <b>rises</b> to his greatest height as {{a master of the}} musical macabre. The act begins quietly, with Scarpia musing on the forthcoming downfall of Angelotti and Cavaradossi, while in the background a gavotte is played in a distant quarter of the Farnese Palace. For this music Puccini adapted a fifteen-year-old student exercise by his late brother, Michele, stating that in this way his brother could live again through him. In the dialogue with Spoletta, the [...] "torture" [...] motif—an [...] "ideogram of suffering", according to Budden—is heard {{for the first time as}} a foretaste of what is to come. As Cavaradossi is brought in for interrogation, Tosca's voice is heard with the offstage chorus singing a cantata, [...] " [...] suave strains contrast dramatically with the increasing tension and ever-darkening colour of the stage action". The cantata is most likely the Cantata a Giove, in the literature referred to as a lost work of Puccini's from 1897.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{a mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Miracle at St. Anna received some praise. Eric D. Snider, writing for Film.com praised the film, writing, [...] "This {{is beyond the}} scope of anything Lee has done before, and <b>he</b> <b>rises</b> to the challenge remarkably well, with battle scenes nearly as visceral and jolting as those in Saving Private Ryan and a multi-layered story involving the U.S. Army, the Nazis, and the Italian resistance movement." [...] Snider criticized the film's frame story, which he described as [...] "unnecessary and definitely corny." [...] James Verniere of the Boston Herald awarded the film an [...] "A" [...] grade, calling it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and a [...] "classic American WWII movie that both acknowledges the rousing tradition of such war epics as The Longest Day (1962) and The Big Red One (1980) and adds something new: paying tribute to the World War II African-American soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, criticized the editing but praised the film overall, describing it as [...] "epic" [...] with [...] "one of the best battle scenes I can remember, on par with Saving Private Ryan...Miracle at St. Anna contains richness, anger, history, sentiment, fantasy, reality, violence and life. Maybe too much. Better than too little." ...|$|E

500|$|As of 2012, Ambrose's 405 Test wickets {{place him}} 11th {{on the list}} of leading Test wicket-takers. Of those who have taken over 200 Test wickets, Ambrose has the third best bowling average behind Malcolm Marshall and Joel Garner, and has the eighth best economy rate; <b>he</b> <b>rises</b> to third if only those who have taken over 250 wickets are included. For much of his career, Ambrose was rated the world's best bowler in the ICC player rankings, first {{reaching}} the top in 1991; he rarely dropped below second and was ranked in the top 10 from 1989 until the end of his career. His highest rating of 912 in the rankings, which he achieved in 1994, is the equal sixth best rating of all time. In 2010, Ambrose was chosen by a panel of writers and experts as a member of ESPNcricinfo's [...] "All-Time XI" [...] for West Indies. The following year, he was inducted into the International Cricket Council Hall of Fame. During his playing days, Ambrose had a reputation for reticence, and rarely spoke to journalists or the opposition. His response to a request for an interview in 1991—"Curtly talks to no-one"— became associated with him throughout his career, but he was more willing to talk to journalists after he retired.|$|E
500|$|Generally {{considered}} the grandfather of gangster films, in Little Caesar, Robinson as Rico and his close friend Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) move to Chicago. Joe {{wants to go}} straight and meets a woman. Rico, however, seeks {{a life of crime}} and joins the gang of Sam Vettori. <b>He</b> <b>rises</b> to the rank of boss of the crime family. After becoming concerned his friend will betray him he threatens him, at which point Joe's girlfriend goes to the police. Unable to bring himself to kill Joe and eliminate the witness against him, Rico goes into hiding. He is coaxed out by the police, who publish that he is a coward to the press. Rico is killed in a blaze of gunfire; his last words are [...] "Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?" [...] Robinson was initially cast in a small role but persuaded the film's producer to let him play the lead. Wingate, who then headed New York's censorship board, told Hays that he was flooded with complaints from people who saw kids in theaters nationwide [...] "applaud the gang leader as a hero." [...] The success of Little Caesar inspired Fox's The Secret Six (1931) and Quick Millions (1931), and Paramount's City Streets (1931), but the next big Hollywood gangster would come from Warners.|$|E
500|$|Vicky Allan of the Sunday Herald noted Bond himself, and not {{his love}} interests, was sexually {{objectified}} in this film. A moment where <b>he</b> <b>rises</b> {{from the sea}} is reminiscent of Ursula Andress in Dr. No; he feels [...] "skewered" [...] by Vesper Lynd's criticism of him; [...] "and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation, {{that is exactly what}} happens to Bond in [...]" [...] So although the film backed off from past criticism of Bond girls being sex objects, [...] "the once invincible James Bond becomes just another joint at the meat market." [...] This sentiment is shared by the University of Leicester's James Chapman, author of License to Thrill, who also notes Craig's Bond is [...] "not yet the polished article"; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming's because he is [...] "humourless," [...] but is also different because [...] "Fleming's Bond did not enjoy killing; Craig's Bond seems almost to relish it." [...] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote that this particular Bond film is [...] "the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list. Furthermore, I consider Daniel Craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007, and that includes even Sean Connery." ...|$|E
