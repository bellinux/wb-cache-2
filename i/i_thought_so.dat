60|$|DAISY. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> once. Lee Tai, you're {{a damned}} fool. Get out.|$|E
60|$|ALICE. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so.</b> Unlucky {{days for}} me, {{as it has}} turned out.|$|E
60|$|BELLA: Show. (She {{turns up}} bloom's hand) <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so.</b> Knobby {{knuckles}} for the women.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I feel it, sir, I assure you,' I returned. 'But <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>so,</b> before. Sincerely, honestly, indeed, Mr. Spenlow, <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>so,</b> before. <b>I</b> love Miss Spenlow to that extent--' ...|$|R
60|$|It's {{nothing to}} you. But to me.... Oh, you don't know what agony I endure. I'm such a coward! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was <b>so</b> much braver.|$|R
6000|$|To see the Trees, which <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> tall, [...] Mere dwarfs; the Brooks so narrow, Fields so small. [...] 1807.|$|R
60|$|RANKIN. We've {{come to it}} at last. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so.</b> Captain Brassbound is a smuggler.|$|E
60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so.</b> I was, too, {{for many}} years. The negress {{redeemed}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then punish that what's-his-name, Plinkett, Plunkett--I've got {{the name}} down somewhere. Yes, Plunkett. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so.</b> Punish Plunkett.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{shoemaker}} assented. [...] "But <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> till <b>I</b> {{heard some}} o’ the things Mr. Ketchmaid ’as been through," [...] he remarked.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed; {{just now}} I am triumphant. <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> often that <b>I</b> {{was a fool}} to love her, because {{everything}} was so much against me." ...|$|R
60|$|Har. Jun. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> spoke <b>so</b> plain, I {{might be}} understood; but since I did not, I must tell you, Towerson, I wear {{the title of}} your friend no longer, because I am your rival.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucy--is it--can it be possible!--It is then you, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> gloriously beautiful, {{and that}} without knowing you, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "’W’y {{not leave}} well alone, Ginger?’ ses Russet; and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> too. Young Beauty was quite {{enough for me}} without that.|$|E
6000|$|THE YOUNG LADY (disparagingly). <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so.</b> (Looking {{about her}} again {{in search of}} further conclusions.) I suppose you haven't been here long? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't do it. I {{should fall}} down dead first. <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> much about it,--for your sake; and have tried it with myself. I couldn't do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But am I wrong now {{to bring}} you one in person? <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> much of seeing you again! Will you not say a word of welcome to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> often <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> myself, {{and your}} offer {{to keep the}} gold in your tent on {{the days when the}} escort wasn't going was a great relief to me." ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. Who's at {{the bottom}} of this, Timothy? Rench? Hillman? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so.</b> Well, they're not bad chaps when you get under their skins.|$|E
6000|$|... "I confess <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so,</b> too. But you {{expressed}} opinions {{then that}} I shared. You have since changed your mind, for some unaccountable reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This island, that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> far away, {{and almost}} in foreign parts,' said Violet, smiling; 'I hope it has cured me of foolish terrors.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What nonsense! Do come now; we {{are going}} to this {{wonderful}} grotto. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it <b>so</b> ill-natured of you, not joining us at dinner. Indeed you know you had promised." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} that <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> it was later. Not that <b>I</b> had really <b>thought</b> <b>so,</b> but because my conversational powers were effectually scattered.|$|R
60|$|JESSIE (after a pause). Why, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{you were}} <b>so</b> fond of Miss Edgeworth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Mr. Effingham, Templemore never loved-Eve Effingham! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> once, and {{he thought}} so, too; but {{it could not have}} been a love like mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|RAMSDEN. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so,</b> sir. Morality sent to {{the devil}} to please our libertines, male and female. That {{is to be the}} future of England, is it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will take}} it away,' said Captain Bob promptly. 'It {{certainly}} is too sad; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> myself. I myself was kept awake by it one night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{gave him}} her hand, {{and then they}} sat down. 'They said you were dead,' {{continued}} Lucy, 'but <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>so.</b> We should have heard of it for certain if you had been.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A fancy? Explain to me, Baas, where truths end and fancies {{begin and}} whether {{what we think}} are fancies are not {{sometimes}} the real truths. Once or twice <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> of late, Baas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was his,' said Violet. 'He {{always has}} his things sent to me. I am glad you {{observed}} the difference. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it <b>so</b> much kinder and less satirical than his writings used to be.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so,</b> too. Nevertheless, I went {{softly to}} his room. It was empty. My {{impression}} {{was that he}} had distanced the sheriff of Calaveras about two hours.|$|E
6000|$|... "I said I knew it. I couldn't {{tell her}} the truth--why <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so.</b> I said I had made {{inquiries}} in New York, and found out about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{she said}} dryly, [...] "so SHE IS HERE. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>so.</b> Which {{of you is}} it, eh? It's a good spec--Mallory's a rich man. She's not particular." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I liked them; but naturally, I did not {{understand}} all the experience you describe. It is so different from mine. Yet that made them more interesting to me. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> should <b>so</b> much like to mix in the same scenes; but that of course is impossible.' ...|$|R
60|$|One {{confidential}} evening, {{not three}} months ago, Lionel Wallace {{told me this}} story of the Door in the Wall. And at the time <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>so</b> {{far as he was}} concerned it was a true story.|$|R
60|$|I ran forward, {{but they}} stopped me, and Mr. Woodcourt entreated {{me with the}} {{greatest}} earnestness, even with tears, before I {{went up to the}} figure to listen for an instant to what Mr. Bucket said. I did <b>so,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>I</b> did <b>so,</b> as I am sure.|$|R
