25|$|In 1991, an {{integrated}} recoil spring assembly replaced the original two-piece recoil spring and tube design. The magazine was slightly modified, changing the <b>floorplate</b> and fitting the follower spring with a resistance insert at its base.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Cossutta & Associates (Araldo Cossutta, principal) of New York to be the corporate headquarters for Southland Corporation (now 7-Eleven). Formerly named CityPlace East, it was conceived as {{the first phase of}} the [...] Cityplace development. A twin tower (CityPlace West), later canceled, was planned across North Central Expressway with a skybridge connection over the highway. Several mid-rise buildings were also planned around the base of both towers. Construction began in December 1984 and the tower opened in 1988 after one year of delays. During this time and as a result of Southland's buyout in 1987, the need for headquarters space was reduced by 50%, leaving the lower 19 floors vacant. Because of the building's unique <b>floorplate</b> (Design), converting the space to speculative office space was a challenge. Despite opening during the Savings and Loan crisis and resulting real estate crash in Dallas, the {{building was}} eventually filled. Cityplace East was renamed Cityplace Tower and was the last major skyscraper built in Dallas during the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2006, Asda {{launched}} a new trial format called 'Asda Essentials' in a former Co-op store in Northampton, followed by another in Pontefract a month later. This was the old Kwik-Save building for Pontefract. The stores were modelled on France's Leader Price chain, with a smaller <b>floorplate</b> than Asda's mainstream stores and with a primary focus on own-brand products, only stocking branded items that were perceived {{to be at the}} [...] "core" [...] of a family's weekly shop with the aim being to challenge the dominance of Tesco and Sainsbury's in the convenience store market {{while at the same time}} addressing competition from discount supermarkets such as Aldi, Lidl and Netto. On 6 December 2006, The Guardian newspaper reported that further planned store openings were under review following poor sales in the existing outlets, while the range of branded products being carried was also being expanded due to customer demand. In January 2007 it was announced that the original trial store would close within a month after only 10 months of trading. The Pontefract store continues to trade and is now part of the Asda supermarket division.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} {{is similar to}} the nearby [...] "super-slender" [...] 432 Park Avenue, with a grid of large windows, but would have even smaller <b>floorplates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Though {{the towers}} are {{visually}} distinct, their <b>floorplates</b> are actually connected and share a central service core. The 18th floor of one tower houses a special meeting suite.|$|R
50|$|The building's {{structural}} core is of concrete, {{with steel}} {{making up the}} rest of the <b>floorplates.</b> It is serviced by 22 elevators, and its recessed corners allow up to twelve corner offices per floor.|$|R
50|$|To {{these can}} be added various {{magazine}} configurations; a blind magazine which has no <b>floorplate,</b> a conventional magazine with detachable <b>floorplate</b> and a detachable box magazine. There are standard consumer versions as well as versions designed for military and police use. Some variants come with bipods, slings and other accessories.|$|E
50|$|The L579 {{could be}} {{delivered}} with detachable magazine although the default was a hinged <b>floorplate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{magazine}} <b>floorplate</b> {{was changed}} between the K-B and K-C models. This variant was produced from 1955 [...] - [...] 1958 ...|$|E
50|$|BuildAbility then {{subcontracted}} {{work for}} the construction of the concrete shell to O'Donnell, who assembled two tower cranes {{at either end of the}} site. O'Donnell used a formwork construction technique in partnership with PERI Ltd. to construct the cores, columns and basement walls. A rail climbing system was installed, which provided a scaffolding cage around the workforce during building. Lifting platforms were used to reduce the space occupied by scaffolding. An aluminium fast slab formwork system named Skydeck was used to construct the <b>floorplates.</b> BuildAbility decided to use unbonded post-tensioned concrete, an uncommon system in the UK, for the <b>floorplates</b> as this allowed them to be thinner and reduced construction time.|$|R
50|$|The Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle was {{designed}} by César Pelli, who also designed the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur. The Petronas Towers have an obvious design reference, {{with the exception of}} having round <b>floorplates</b> as opposed to square ones.|$|R
25|$|The Rotunda was {{refurbished}} by Urban Splash into residential apartments from {{an office}} building. The building was stripped {{to the core}} and <b>floorplates</b> before new full-height windows and cladding were added, plus two LED boards {{to the top of}} the building.|$|R
50|$|The building's reverse <b>floorplate</b> design {{makes the}} upper floors average 2200 m2 {{compared}} {{to an average of}} only 1900 m2 for the lower floors.|$|E
50|$|The rifle was {{finished}} in blued steel barrel and action with gloss black {{paint on the}} alloy <b>floorplate</b> and trigger guard, the stocks were of wood.|$|E
5000|$|Remington 700 SPS: Has a 26" [...] heavy contour barrel with {{standard}} features {{that include a}} hinged <b>floorplate</b> magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver.|$|E
50|$|Sears {{executives}} {{decided that}} the space they would immediately occupy should be efficiently designed to house their Merchandise Group, and that floor space for future growth would be rented out to smaller firms and businesses until Sears could retake it. The latter floor areas had to be designed to a smaller plate, with a high window-space to floor-space ratio, to be attractive and marketable to prospective lessees. Smaller <b>floorplates</b> required a taller structure to yield sufficient square footage. Skidmore architects proposed a tower with large 55000 sq ft floors in {{the lower part of}} the building, and gradually tapered areas of <b>floorplates</b> in a series of setbacks, which would give the Sears Tower its distinctive look.|$|R
50|$|The two {{office towers}} are {{actually}} connected, and the <b>floorplates</b> can be combined, but the towers have separate cores. They {{are called the}} BMO Tower and South Tower respectively. Each tower offers 14,000 {{square feet of space}} per floor, or a combined 28,000 square feet per floor.|$|R
5000|$|The ensuing £20 million {{conversion}} {{was carried}} out by DN-A architects, comprising the stripping out of the central “village” and connecting walkways which spanned the atrium and the <b>floorplates</b> filled in creating two smaller atriums turning “the doughnut plan into a pretzel” in the words of DN-A director Stuart McLarty.|$|R
50|$|Before the 75, Sako hunting rifles (except the L46 and the L579) did {{not have}} {{detachable}} magazines, but a hinged <b>floorplate</b> with the lock placed {{on the front of}} the trigger guard.|$|E
5000|$|It is a {{bolt action}} hunting rifle with a fixed {{magazine}} with hinged <b>floorplate</b> produced {{in a number}} of centrefire calibers in three variants, the normal, the full-length stock Stutzen ("short") and the carbine.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, an {{integrated}} recoil spring assembly replaced the original two-piece recoil spring and tube design. The magazine was slightly modified, changing the <b>floorplate</b> and fitting the follower spring with a resistance insert at its base.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was fully refurbished {{over a period}} of 14 months, which resulted in substantially improved cladding and a façade overrun which increased its overall height slightly. Larger, open plan <b>floorplates</b> were also created. It re-opened in mid-1995 as a multi-let office tower and is currently owned (leasehold) by Hammerson and managed by CBRE Group.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has side-core <b>floorplates</b> with the elevator shafts and structural cores {{located on the}} North {{side of the building}} which abuts the adjacent development in the lower floors. The southern facade is almost entirely glazed allowing full views of Sydney Harbour, including the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge, as well as Sydney's CBD.|$|R
50|$|These {{are popular}} in many {{suburban}} locations, where development is cheaper {{because of the}} lower land costs and the lower building costs for building wider, not necessarily higher. Some businesses prefer the larger <b>floorplates</b> as more efficient, reducing time lost moving between floors. They are also often located near motorways or main roads for easy access.|$|R
5000|$|Military Match Target Rifle {{unlike the}} {{military}} Mk III this rifle {{was using a}} box type magazine with flat <b>floorplate.</b> It was using the Ross Mk III military sight modified to fit the [...]280 Ross ammunitions. Barrel was 26 inches long.|$|E
50|$|The Five-seven's {{magazine}} can be disassembled {{for cleaning}} or lubrication {{by removing the}} polymer <b>floorplate.</b> The magazine body is constructed of polymer, with steel inserts at the feed lips. Unlike a conventional pistol magazine, it feeds from dual feed lips, with a follower that has the same appearance as that of an M16 rifle's magazine, and which is loaded in the same manner: by pushing cartridges straight down into the magazine, rather than pushing them down and back. This setup makes it very easy to load individual cartridges into the magazine. The magazine <b>floorplate</b> has a slight finger spur, and four holes in {{the left side of}} the magazine body allow a convenient estimate of the amount of remaining ammunition.|$|E
50|$|The library {{has been}} serving {{graduate}} students and faculty in the {{humanities and social sciences}} since first opening in 1964, and {{it can be said that}} the building’s concrete skeleton, dark glass windows and deep <b>floorplate</b> reflect the weight and significance of the research happening inside.|$|E
5000|$|B.3. This is an overty {{architectural}} frame. <b>Floorplates</b> and {{a foundation}} are clearly depicted, and an owl, a classic symbol of wisdom, is clearly {{visible in the}} foundation. Cleared of obstacles better that before the house of men mistress of his form takes up her abode in nature Complete in herself making her case on all grounds open to the four horizons ...|$|R
5000|$|The PPS feeds from single stack {{magazines}} {{of varying}} capacity. The various magazine capacities are achieved by small, medium (+1) or large (+2) magazine <b>floorplates.</b> The small magazine is flush with grip bottom. The extended +1 and +2 <b>floorplates</b> integrate with the gripframe adding finger rest space for better grip.The magazines {{are made of}} steel for Walther by the Italian subcontractor MEC-GAR and have an anti friction coating for easy loading and anti-corrosion and witness holes to view how many rounds are in the magazine. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. The standard PPS magazines weigh 43 g (6/5 rounds of 9×19mm Parabellum/.40 S&W), 59 g (7/6 rounds of 9×19mm Parabellum/.40 S&W) and 67 g (8/7 rounds of 9×19mm Parabellum/.40 S&W). After the last cartridge has been fired, the magazine follower exerts upward pressure on the slide stop causing it to engage the slide stop notch thereby holding it in the [...] "open" [...] position.|$|R
50|$|This {{building}} {{represented a}} major departure from convention {{by having a}} big height with small <b>floorplates.</b> This {{was made possible by}} a stayed-mast structural system in which columns around the perimeter ("stays") are linked radially to the core by multi-story trusses ("spreaders") at two points along the tower's shaft. The residential and communications floors would have been cantilevered out from the central core, to avoid perimeter columns and maximize views.|$|R
50|$|Recovery in the {{property}} market generally, coupled with continuing demand for large <b>floorplate</b> Grade A office space, slowly improved {{the level of}} interest. A critical event in the recovery was the much-delayed start of work on the Jubilee Line Extension, which the government wanted ready for the Millennium celebrations.|$|E
50|$|There are 5 {{basement}} levels, {{a ground}} floor, mezzanine, and a further 32 levels numbered 1 to 33. There is no 13th floor. The lower levels, up to level 8, incorporate large podium {{areas on the}} south and west sides. This allows large trading floors to be accommodated, each with a 50,000 sq ft <b>floorplate.</b> The south podium incorporates a secondary core.|$|E
50|$|The tower sits in {{the middle}} of the block bounded by East 56th Street, Madison Avenue, East 57th Street, and Park Avenue. The building's 100 ft base covers most of the 41,000 sq ft lot. The tower is a 93 ft square in plan, giving each <b>floorplate</b> an occupiable area of 8,255 sq ft. At 15:1, 432 Park has one of the {{greatest}} height-to-width ratios of any skyscraper in the world.|$|E
50|$|The facility, with 570000 sq ft of {{rentable}} office space, {{was developed}} by The Macklowe Organization. The building, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, has 23000 sq ft <b>floorplates.</b> The {{second floor of the}} building houses Air France's United States executive offices. Macquarie Bank houses its New York representative office in the building. Boston Properties currently owns and manages the building. The building also houses offices of Katz Media, a division of Clear Channel Communications.|$|R
50|$|The Headrow is {{a street}} in Leeds city centre, West Yorkshire, England. It houses many of the city's civic and {{cultural}} buildings including Leeds Town Hall, Leeds Central Library, Leeds Art Gallery, The Henry Moore Institute and The Light. Some of the largest retail <b>floorplates</b> in the city are on The Headrow, particularly between Park Row and Briggate, where major chains have opened flagship stores. The Headrow {{is part of a}} longer axis that includes Westgate, Eastgate and Quarry Hill.|$|R
5000|$|Los Angeles, CA [...] Completed 2002 [...] The Standard Hotel used state {{preservation}} {{tax credits}} to convert the original Superior Oil Co. Headquarters. Existing features - such as the exterior, front doors, and lobby - anchor the design. To accommodate guest traffic, the renovation moved the primary entry to the rear, adding an outdoor lounge and dining area. On the upper floors, deep office <b>floorplates</b> necessitated extensive reworking and special configuration of the guest rooms. A rooftop pool and bar were also added.|$|R
