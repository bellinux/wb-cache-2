2500|$|In {{agriculture}} and gardening, the germination rate describes how many seeds {{of a particular}} plant species, variety or seedlot are likely to germinate over a given period. It {{is a measure of}} <b>germination</b> <b>time</b> course and is usually expressed as a percentage, e.g., an 85% germination rate indicates that about 85 out of 100 seeds will probably germinate under proper conditions over the germination period given. The germination rate is useful for calculating the seed requirements for a given area or desired number of plants. In seed physiologists and seed scientists [...] "germination rate" [...] is the reciprocal of time taken for the process of germination to complete starting from time of sowing. On the other hand, the number of seed able to complete germination in a population (i.e. seed lot) is referred as germination capacity.|$|E

50|$|Plants in fire related disturbance-dependent {{ecosystems}} {{can have}} serotinous pines, {{or they have}} a resin over their seeds to delay seed release. When the fire comes through it melts the resin and allows the seed to begin growing. <b>Germination</b> <b>timed</b> to fire is another method for plant survival. <b>Germination</b> <b>timed</b> to fire means that chemicals in a plant will trigger its growth once the ground is heated to a certain temperature by a fire. Resource allocation, a plant able to disperse its seeds in a large area, helps with plant survival during fire as well. In {{the area where the}} Beaver Creek Fire took place, lodge pole pine trees and juniper trees are just two plants in the ecosystem that are fire-dependent.|$|R

5000|$|A very {{different}} plant to the Wood Strawberry, and distinguished by the greater size {{of all its}} parts — the fruit in particular — and especially by the property (which is particular to it) of producing flowers and fruit continuously all through the summer. ... The fruit has nearly the same appearance and flavour {{as that of the}} Wood Strawberry, but is generally larger, longer, and more pointed in shape. The seed is also perceptibly larger and longer. A gramme contains only about 1,500 seeds. Alpine strawberry has an undeserved reputation among home gardeners as hard to grow from seed, often with rumors of long and sporadic <b>germination</b> <b>times,</b> cold pre-chilling requirements, etc. In reality, with proper handling of the very small seeds (which can easily be washed away with rough watering), 80% germination rates at 70°F within 1-2 weeks are easily achievable.|$|R
40|$|Several {{different}} D-type cyclins can {{be found}} in plants and in maize, four of these have been characterized: CycD 2; 1, CycD 4; 1, CycD 5; 1 and CycD 5; 2. These cyclins appear to form complexes with Cdks, with PCNA and also with KRP proteins and in these kinase activity can be measured. The expression of the corresponding genes during maize germination is highly stimulated by phytohormones like auxin and cytokinin, however this is not followed by an equivalent increase in the amount of the corresponding proteins; nonetheless, auxins do stimulate the associated kinase activity, particularly at early <b>germination</b> <b>times.</b> Thus, auxins appear to stimulate the cell cycle during germination at two levels, transcription and kinase activation. Both auxins and cytokinins appear to shorten the G 1 phase during germination and stimulate DNA synthesis, but apparently they do it in different ways as the simultaneous addition of both to germinating maize axes eliminates DNA synthesis stimulation. Therefore, similar actions may be achieved by different paths...|$|R

Firstly, collect only the older fruit which is usually grey-brown, and the seed collection is suitable in the whole year. Secondly, leach the seed, and the dry fruit will usually open in 2-3 weeks or place in a hot oven 80-100 ℃ for 30 mins with the door partially open. Besides, leaching, stratification {{or a combination of}} both improves results, or moist stratify seed for 4 months in fridge for good germination.

50|$|Propagation is by {{cuttings}} {{or by the}} seeds, {{which are}} produced irregularly. Seeds are produced in a four-inch pod somewhat resembling a mango. Seeds are fully mature in approximately twelve months {{regardless of whether or}} not the pod has changed color or split open. Seeds are tightly compacted in the center of the pod and can be removed in one compact bundle, each pod producing 70 to 100 flattened half inch (1.3 cm) seeds. If the seeds are left to dry out, the bundle will begin to break up and silky 'parachutes' will begin to unfurl on each seed in the same manner as the related species, the American milkweed. Seeds propagate best if sown immediately upon opening the pod. Seeds should be sown under only enough soil to keep them moist, and kept in a well lighted place until germination. Fresh seeds will germinate in about seven days. The longer the seeds remain to dry outside the pod before sowing, the longer the <b>germination</b> <b>time</b> and the lower the propagation rate.|$|E
50|$|Passiflora gibertii is {{a fast-growing}} {{ornamental}} vine with edible fruits. The flowers are also ornamental. The fast-growing vine can {{grow up to}} 27 feet long. It has three-lobed (occasionally 5-lobed) leaves which can grow to a few inches long. Vines may trail across arbors or climb trees or fences. The plant is easily container-grown and will flower readily. Flowering generally occurs in warm months. Some fruits may follow, and the ripe fruits which are yellow to orange in color are edible, though some reports claim the unripe fruits are poisonous. Its hardiness is to about 32 °F. It grows in full sun or in part shade. The vines need regular water, especially during the growing season. Vines can be pruned if needed, as secondary shoots readily sprout. Seeds benefit from presoaking and require warm temperatures of 75-85 °F for germination. <b>Germination</b> <b>time</b> is erratic and often takes several weeks to a few months.

The species had germination percentages above 88 % and average <b>germination</b> <b>times</b> longer than 139 hours. The average {{time for the}} opening of the first leaf pair was more than 538 hours for all three species. The average root length of C. langsdorffii and D. alata seedlings after 80 days of growth was around 40 cm, four times larger than the average shoot length ( 20 cm) of K. coriacea seedlings was four times larger than the average shoot length (< 5 cm), and the root biomass was 243 % greater than the shoot biomass. Increase in seedling biomass was sustained primarily by the cotyledons in C. langsdorffii and D. alata, which acted as reserve organs and showed progressive weight reductions. Increase in seedling biomass in K. coriacea was sustained primarily by photosynthesis, since the cotyledons showed no significant weight reduction, acting primarily as photosynthetic organs. The length of the root systems was at least four times larger than the length of the shoots parts in all three species.

Studies were conducted to determine if growth conditions, viz. artificial (agar media or rice grain) or natural (infected insects) substrates for conidial production affect two traits that directly influence performance of conidia after field application: tolerance to UV-B radiation and conidial germination speed. Conidia of two isolates (ARSEF 23 and ARSEF 2575) of M. anisopliae var. anisopliae produced on potato dextrose agar plus yeast extract (PDAY) or on fungus-killed larvae of two insect species, Galleria mellonella and Zophobas morio, were inactivated by exposure to UV-B radiation. Conidia of both isolates when produced on insect cadavers were significantly more sensitive to UV-B radiation than conidia produced on PDAY. Also, conidia from insect cadavers germinated slower than those from PDAY cultures. A comparison of conidia from artificial substrates showed that conidia produced on Czapek’s and Emerson’s YpSs agar media or rice grains had higher tolerance to UV-B radiation and germinated faster than conidia raised on PDA and PDAY.
