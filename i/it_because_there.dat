5|$|The {{thoracic}} cavity is the space inside the chest {{that contains the}} lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On {{each side of the}} cavity, a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral pleura) and also lines the inside of the chest wall (parietal pleura). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space. Despite the low pressure in the pleural space, air does not enter <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space. Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas.|$|E
5|$|After {{his army}} crossed the Euphrates, {{following}} a route opened up by Lucullus {{over a hundred}} years before, he received envoys from Tiridates and Vologases. At the approach of such a large force, and aware of Corbulo's ability as a general, the two Arsacids were anxious to negotiate. Indeed, Corbulo, no doubt on instructions from Nero, reiterated the old Roman position: if Tiridates would accept his crown from Rome, then renewed war could be averted. Tiridates readily agreed to negotiations, and Rhandeia, the scene of last year's Roman defeat, was agreed upon as a meeting place. To the Armenians, this place was intended as a reminder of their strength, while Corbulo agreed to <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> he hoped to expunge the earlier disgrace, by peace or war. Once there, Corbulo put Paetus' son, who served under him as a legate, in charge of a party that was to gather the remains of the Roman soldiers and ensure them a proper burial. On the agreed day, both Tiridates and Corbulo, each accompanied by 20 horsemen, met between the two camps. Tiridates agreed to travel to Rome and seek confirmation of his crown from Nero. In sign of this agreement, a few days later, both armies put on a display, arrayed in full parade gear. Tiridates approached the Roman camp, where a statue of the Emperor Nero had been erected upon a raised platform, and placed his royal diadem at its feet in submission.|$|E

Byrne said the song was the last recording Selena made before she {{was shot and killed}} by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and former manager of her Selena Etc. boutiques, on March 31, 1995. [...] Behar said promotion [...] "will be on the superstar scale" [...] and [...] " [...] didn't put this marketing campaign behind <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> was a tragedy. We put this marketing campaign behind it because we believed {{that this was going to}} be a huge album because of the music. This is a record that we're going to work over the next 10 months." [...] EMI Records and EMI Latin put aside [...] ($784,000 2015 USD) to complete Dreaming of You. [...] "Oh No (I'll Never Fall in Love Again)", a song intended to be recorded for Dreaming of You, was released on the SelenaQRadio (a free radio operated by Quintanilla, Jr.) in September 2015. Quintanilla, Jr. decided to release the demo version of the song after fans began requesting for it to be heard.|$|E

[...] Hill began to experiment with the photocopier in 1973 by asking an attendant at a copy shop to scan various items for her. Later, she spent a weekend locked in IBM's New York offices to produce copies. About this, she said, [...] "I got a lot of copies made and walked out on Monday morning when everyone came in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elijah {{continues}} {{now from}} Ahab to {{an encounter with}} Ahaziah. The scene opens with Ahaziah seriously injured in a fall. He sends to the priests of Baalzebub in Ekron, outside the kingdom of Israel, {{to know if he}} will recover. Elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to Ahaziah with a message [...] "Is <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?" [...] Ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message. They tell him he was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist and he instantly recognizes the description as Elijah the Tishbite.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Fox ordered {{thirteen}} episodes {{based on}} the concept alone, with no pilot. Then-network head Barry Diller reversed the decision. Although he loved the idea, he didn't {{believe it was a}} [...] "Fox show". Wolf then went to CBS, which ordered a pilot, [...] "Everybody's Favorite Bagman", written by Wolf about corrupt city officials involved with the mob. The network liked the pilot but did not order <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> were no breakout stars. In the summer of 1989, NBC's top executives, Brandon Tartikoff and Warren Littlefield, screened the pilot and liked it; but they were concerned the intensity of the series could not be repeated week after week. However, by 1990, NBC executives had enough confidence that the innovative show could appeal to a wide audience that they ordered the series for a full season.|$|E

2500|$|The myth of Atlantis had {{a special}} meaning to the Nazis, who held that Atlantis was the ancient {{homeland}} of the Aryan race. Children's books were imbued with Nazi racial policies and Atlantis was mentioned in many. Sun Koh, the hero of a science fiction series, complains in a story from 1935 that the races were not kept pure, except in Germany, where a methodical racial policy was breeding the Nordic roots again. Koh says, [...] "If our Atlantis once again rises out of the sea, then we will get from there the blond, steel-hard men with the pure blood and will create with them the master race, which will finally rule the earth." [...] Ende brings this scenario about, only with the decidedly non-blond Jim Button as king and Ende creates a multi-ethnic and -cultural paradise, a utopia where people {{from every corner of}} the earth, and even birds, flock to <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is no fear there.|$|E
