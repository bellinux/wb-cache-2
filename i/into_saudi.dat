5|$|On August 2, 1990, Saddam Hussein sent an invading {{force of}} Iraqi troops into Kuwait. According to the United States {{government}} Hussein's forces would continue south <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia's oil fields. The United States military deployment to Saudi Arabia, Operation Desert Shield, grew rapidly {{to become the}} largest American deployment since the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E
5|$|From his {{headquarters}} in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to Saudi Arabia, tapping Major General William G. Pagonis {{as director of}} the logistical operations, with U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and U.S. Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend Saudi Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated Saudi Arabia, such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a warning order from The Pentagon to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.|$|E

25|$|In {{the face}} of a {{seemingly}} massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were well armed but far outnumbered. Bin Laden offered the services of his mujahideen to King Fahd to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army.

25|$|October {{was also}} the month where Somali forces joined the {{fighting}} alongside the Houthis. Some 200 Somali recruits arrived on boats via the Red Sea and were mainly sent on suicide missions against government and military targets in Saada City. Yemen would later claim to have captured 28 Somali troops. Other sources indicated that Somali fighters were used for engineering methods, primarily by digging trenches to hide ammunition and launch ambushes from the mountains. By December, a Somali diplomat claimed that many Somali refugees suffered abduction by the Houthis as they fled <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. Those who refused faced execution.|$|E
50|$|In 1952 Saudi Arabia sent raiders {{to capture}} Al-‘Ain's fortresses and {{incorporate}} the oasis <b>into</b> the <b>Saudi</b> kingdom.

25|$|On 21 December 1965, Saudi Arabia, keen {{to improve}} its air defences owing to the Saudi {{involvement}} in the North Yemen Civil War and the resultant air incursions <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> airspace by Egyptian forces supporting the Yemeni Republicans, placed a series of orders with Britain and the United States {{to build a new}} integrated air defence system. BAC received orders for 34 multirole single-seat Lightning F.53s that could still retain very high performance and reasonable endurance, and six two-seat T.55 trainers, together with 25 BAC Strikemaster trainers, while the contract also included new radar systems, American HAWK surface-to-air missiles and training and support services.|$|E
25|$|At FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C., Fleury briefs his rapid {{deployment}} {{team on the}} attack. Although the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. State Department hinder FBI {{efforts to}} investigate the attack, Fleury blackmails the Saudi ambassador into allowing an FBI investigative team <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. Fleury gathers Special Agent Janet Mayes, a forensic examiner, FBI analyst Adam Leavitt, an intelligence analyst, and Special Agent Grant Sykes, a bomb technician, to go to Saudi Arabia. On arrival they are met by Colonel Faris al-Ghazi, {{the commander of the}} Saudi State Police Force providing security at the compound.

500|$|Moving ashore southeastern Yemen, {{the storm}} dropped heavy {{rainfall}} in the typically arid region, reaching [...] in some areas, and possibly {{as high as}} , over a 20,000km2 (7,700mi2) area. This equated to about 2billionm3 (528billion gallons) of water, {{more than twice the}} capacity of most waterways. The thunderstorms and rainfall occurred over a 30‑hour period, severely disrupting life in eastern Yemen. The precipitation coalesced into valleys, resulting in flash flooding that swelled water levels to [...] Hundreds of residents became trapped in their homes, while businesses and schools were shut down. The storm sent a plume of moisture that spread <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, reaching [...] in Najran, and was drawn northward into Iraq by a trough over Syria, triggering dust storms.|$|E
500|$|Saddam Hussein, who is {{believed}} to have said, [...] "The air force has never decided a war," [...] nevertheless worried that the air campaign would erode Iraq's national morale. The Iraqi leader also believed that the United States would not be willing to lose many troops in action, and therefore sought to draw Coalition ground troops into a decisive battle. In an attempt to provoke a ground battle, he directed Iraqi forces to launch Scud missiles against Israel, while continuing to threaten the destruction of oilfields in Kuwait. These efforts were unsuccessful in provoking a large ground battle, so Saddam Hussein decided to launch a limited offensive <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia with the aim of inflicting heavy losses on the Coalition armies.|$|E
500|$|French Foreign Ministry {{spokeswoman}} Christine Valle expressed {{regret for}} the {{excessive use of}} force in several Arab countries and serious concern about the recent developments in Bahrain, as well as Libya and Yemen, in particular.

[...] "They [...] are just exercising their rights." [...] Saudi Arabian prince Talal Bin Abdulaziz, father of prince Al Waleed Bin Talal, said there is a chance protests in Bahrain would move <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia if serious reforms were not carried out.
