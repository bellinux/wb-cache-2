Joehana may have also opened a writing course, although apparently most of his income {{was derived from the}} royalties of his publications. These publications, particularly his novels, were generally inspired by the types of works that were popular at the time of writing. One of his students, Abdullah Syafi'i Sukandi, recalled that Nangis Wibisana (The Tears of Wibisana) <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> when the dangding (a traditional lyrical form) Tjeurik Oma (Oma's Cry) was popular, whereas Goenoeng Gelenjoe (The Smiling Mountain) <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> during a period of increased interest in humorous anecdotes.|$|E

50|$|The perfect {{aspect is}} {{expressed}} with {{a form of}} the auxiliary have together with the past participle of the verb. Thus the present perfect <b>is</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> or has written, and the past perfect (pluperfect) <b>is</b> <b>had</b> <b>written.</b> The perfect can combine with the progressive aspect (see above) to produce the present perfect progressive (continuous) have/has <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> and the past perfect progressive (continuous) <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing.</b> There <b>is</b> a perfect infinitive (to) have written and a perfect progressive infinitive (to) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing,</b> and corresponding present participle/gerund forms <b>having</b> <b>written</b> and <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing.</b> A perfect subjunctive (<b>have</b> <b>written)</b> <b>is</b> also sometimes used.

Principal photography took place in mid-2004 on location in New York City, and the interior scenes were vastly filmed in the family's Manhattan apartment.

Power's motive in coming to the police was that {{he was in love with}} Seymour.|$|E
5|$|After being {{concentrated}} at Yagodnik, {{the attack}} force was readied to strike Kaafjord. The Soviet personnel at the airfield provided considerable assistance, {{but the process}} of refuelling the aircraft could not be completed until 13 September due to inadequate facilities. The ground crew also repaired some of the damaged bombers, including with parts salvaged from the aircraft which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> off. The British officers and senior non-commissioned officers were accommodated in a boat, and all other personnel slept in overcrowded underground huts. Both the boat and the huts were infested with bed bugs, {{and almost all of}} the airmen were bitten before the accommodation was fumigated by the detachment's medical officer.|$|E

5|$|Although Amir {{had little}} {{correspondence}} {{with his friends}} in Java, his poems– most of which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> in Java– continued {{to be published in}} Poedjangga Baroe. His first poetry collection, Nyanyi Sunyi (Songs of Silence), was published in the magazine's November 1937 edition. Nearly two years later, in June 1939, the magazine published a collection of poems Amir had translated, entitled Setanggi Timur (Incense from the East). In June 1941 his last collection, Buah Rindu (Fruits of Longing), was published. All were later republished as stand-alone books. A last book, Sastera Melayu Lama dan Raja-Rajanya (Old Malay Literature and its Kings), was published in Medan in 1942; this was based on a radio speech Amir had delivered.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in October 2004, the Writers Guild of America, west {{conducted}} arbitration {{through the}} scripts that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> since Barry Levinson developed the film at Warner Bros. in 1987.

The Guild justified credit to Lewis Colick, {{who wrote the}} first draft of The Bobby Darin Story in 1987, and Kevin Spacey. Actor-writer Jeffrey Meek believed he should have deserved credit; he was paid $85,000 of a promised $125,000 to settle his claim to have performed writing services.|$|E

5|$|Carter and Frank Spotnitz wrote major {{parts of}} the script in Hawaii over Christmas 1996. They used the same method that they had used when writing episodes and {{sketching}} out scenes for the series on 3x5 index cards. By the time the Christmas break had ended, the whole narrative for the film <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>written.</b> Upon his return from Hawaii, Carter looked for spare time to write the script. He returned to Hawaii and in ten days wrote {{about half of the}} 124-page screenplay for the film.|$|E
5|$|Carter's story draws {{heavily on}} Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and {{particularly}} on James Whale's 1931 {{film version of}} the story. The script <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> specifically with singer Cher and actress Roseanne Barr in mind, but both were unavailable {{at the time of}} shooting. Talk-show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself, and Chris Owens—who appeared in later episodes as FBI agent Jeffrey Spender—played The Great Mutato. The episode was filmed in black-and-white, with a sky backdrop created to imitate the style of old Frankenstein films. Owens wore makeup and prosthetics that took several hours to apply.|$|E

Although he won a large number of contracts, his bids were not always successful. It has been calculated that for every contract awarded, around six others had been unsuccessful.|$|E
