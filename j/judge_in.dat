5|$|Honório Hermeto {{pursued a}} typical course open to 19th century Brazilians who became {{affluent}} through family connections and patronage: a judicial career, with expectations of entering politics. On 14 October 1826, {{he was named}} to a three-year term as juiz de fora (external judge) with jurisdiction over the three villages {{in the province of}} São Paulo. On 25 August 1828, Honório Hermeto left São Paulo upon being promoted to the post of auditor da marinha (admiralty <b>judge)</b> <b>in</b> Rio de Janeiro, the imperial capital located in the province of same name. His tenure in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro helped expand his connections. Emperor Dom PedroI appointed him ouvidor (superior <b>judge)</b> <b>in</b> late 1828 and desembargador (regional appeal <b>judge)</b> <b>in</b> 1829, an office Honório Hermeto held until his retirement in 1848.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} a tribute to the two federal <b>judges</b> <b>in</b> whose memory the Judge William B. Jones and Judge Edward A. Tamm Judicial Lecture Series is named. The Judicial Lecture Series, held at the University of Montana School of Law, is {{designed}} to engage students, faculty, practicing lawyers, and <b>judges</b> <b>in</b> study and discussion leading to an enhanced understanding of our judicial system and the roles of attorneys and <b>judges</b> <b>in</b> that system...|$|R
50|$|Appellate judges, {{district}} court judges, Denver Probate Court judges, juvenile court judges and county court <b>judges</b> <b>in</b> larger counties {{are required to}} be lawyers. Trial courts also often have magistrates with many judicial powers appointed by the court who must also be lawyers. County court <b>judges</b> <b>in</b> smaller counties {{are not required to}} be lawyers, but currently there are no more than four non-lawyer state <b>judges</b> <b>in</b> Colorado, all of whom are part-time, and at least three of whom are college educated. Preference <b>in</b> hiring municipal <b>judges</b> must be given to lawyers. Municipal <b>judges</b> <b>in</b> courts of record must be lawyers, while municipal <b>judges</b> <b>in</b> courts not of record need not be lawyers. In practice, all of the larger municipalities in Colorado have municipal courts of record with judges who are lawyers. Many municipal judges who are lawyers serve on multiple municipal courts and/or are part-time county court judges.|$|R

About 15,000 lay judges are selected for terms of five years, serving a maximum of 30 days per year, while continuing their regular employment. Observers note that lay <b>judges</b> <b>in</b> Cuba play a far more dynamic role than the lay <b>judges</b> <b>in</b> the former Soviet Union. On a whole, lay judges tend to represent the overall population in terms of race, gender, employment, and education.|$|R
