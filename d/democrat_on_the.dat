5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was the ranking <b>Democrat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of Caldwell and Crittenden counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him to announce his candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.|$|E

50|$|Longley {{noted in}} his {{testimony}} that minimum wage increases cause businesses, as well as employees, to pay more in federal taxes through employee percentage withholding and the business match of payroll taxes.

25|$|However, her opponents' {{efforts were}} unsuccessful, and five {{candidates}} entered the Democratic primary. As {{a result of}} the fragmented primary opposition, McKinney won just enough votes to avoid a runoff. This all but assured her return to Congress after a two-year absence. However, contrary to traditional practice, the Democrats did not restore McKinney's seniority.

Also addressing the event was Olympia Neocleous, the chargé d'affaires at the Cypriot embassy in Washington.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the nine}} seats on the Alabama Supreme Court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats.
