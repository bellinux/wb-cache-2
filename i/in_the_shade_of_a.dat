500|$|Hańska and Balzac met {{several times}} {{over the next five}} days, and her husband became enchanted with Balzac as well, {{inviting}} him to meals with the family. During a trip to Lake Biel, Hański went to arrange lunch, leaving his wife and Balzac alone. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large oak tree, they kissed and exchanged vows of patience and fidelity. She told him of the family's plan to visit Geneva for Christmas; Balzac agreed to visit {{before the end of the}} year. Before he left Nauchâtel, she sent a passionate letter to his hotel: [...] "Villain! Did you not see in my eyes all that I longed for? But have no fear, I felt all the desire that a woman in love seeks to provoke".|$|E
500|$|Stratton {{had several}} hobbies, brick-laying the most {{important}} one. He built the brick walls and paths {{in the garden of}} his house, a house he himself helped design. His daughter, Elenore, would recall decades later living in the house, {{with a view of the}} San Francisco bay and the Golden Gate on one side and the Marin county hills beyond. Annual camping in summer in the Sierras was another pastime, and he carried his love of books over there as well, writing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree in the mornings. Elenore also recalled his night-time reading of Homer to his children, mixing with fascinating guests for weekend suppers prepared by her mother, and the family camping out with Latin professor [...] "Uncle" [...] Leon Richardson.|$|E

2500|$|Eating in the sukkah {{does not}} cause a {{parallel}} problem because many people simply enjoy eating outdoors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sukkah. Hence, seeing someone eating in a sukkah does not per se lead one to assume it is still ḥol hamoed. Likewise, eating in the sukkah does not per se impinge on one's own celebration of Shemini Atzeret. Therefore, the prevalent practice is {{to eat in the}} sukkah on Shemini Azeret outside the Land of Israel, but not to recite the berakhah for sitting in a sukkah, as reciting it would [...] "impinge" [...] on the unique status of Shemini Atzeret.|$|E
2500|$|Critical acclaim {{came from}} Heat which called Wide Awake [...] "The best album ever {{released}} by a winner of The X Factor" [...] {{and gave it}} 5 stars. Unreality Shout praised the album and said it is [...] "the best X Factor winner's album to date, despite it being nearly schizophrenic of nature: one minute you're flouncing you're way {{through some of the}} campest songs of the year ('Real Late Starter', 'Fahrenheit'), throwing some suggestive moves and jazz hands while you do so, and the next you're relaxing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> veranda in the back garden of a country farm house, looking out on fields upon fields of lush greenery ('Smile', 'Wide Awake')." [...] Gay Times gave the songs on the album a positive review. BBC Music said the album is [...] "a disco-dusted debut of giddy pop pleasures." [...] Yahoo! Music gave the album 7/10. 4Music gave the album 4 stars, saying [...] "rather than making the ballad-heavy collection that everyone was expecting, Joe has produced a fun, upbeat pop album which takes its inspiration from acts such as Alphabeat ('Feel the Fire') and Scissor Sisters ('Fahrenheit')" [...] OK! also gave the album 4 stars, saying [...] "recent single 'Ambitions' sets the tone, with its chugging guitars, while 'Someone Wake Me Up' is an epic lighters-aloft stunner and 'Real Late Starter' has a definite Take That vibe." ...|$|E
