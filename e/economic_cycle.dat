Before federation in 1901, assisted migrants received passage assistance from colonial government funds; the British government paid for the passage of convicts, paupers, the military and civil servants. Few immigrants received colonial government assistance before 1831. In Queensland many immigrants passed through the Yungaba Immigration Centre in Brisbane. The facility was built shortly after a period when immigration had been at an all-time high.|$|E

By the hands of some industrious families, including many immigrants of Italian and Jewish origin, factories began to arise and São Paulo became known for its smoky, foggy air.

Some examples of notable modernist artists are poets Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade, artists Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral and Lasar Segall, and sculptor Victor Brecheret. The Modern Art Week of 1922 that took place at the Theatro Municipal was an event marked by avant-garde ideas and works of art. In 1929, São Paulo won its first skyscraper, the Martinelli Building.|$|E

Technological revolutions and worldwide implementation of basic inventions are necessarily accompanied by the processes of creative destruction or “sanitation” of the economy, which cause long term <b>economic</b> <b>cycles</b> which appear to be predictable but practically unavoidable. This paper explores the theoretical background and formulates the basics of the mechanism of <b>economic</b> <b>cycles</b> driven endogenously by modern knowledge based economy. It analyzes definitions of <b>economic</b> <b>cycles,</b> employs the concept of hierarchical <b>economic</b> <b>cycles,</b> studies the links between inventions, innovations and <b>economic</b> <b>cycles,</b> provides a concept of “economic organism” versus “economic mechanism”, gives a definition of “good cycles” versus “bad cycles” and proposes taxonomy of business cycles according to four attributes.

25|$|Jean-Baptiste Say was a French {{economist}} who introduced Smith's economic theories into France and whose commentaries on Smith were read in both France and Britain. Say challenged Smith's labour theory of value, believing that prices {{were determined by}} utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. His most important contribution to economic thinking was Say's law, which was interpreted by classical economists {{that there could be}} no overproduction in a market and that there would always be a balance between supply and demand. This general belief influenced government policies until the 1930s. Following this law, since the <b>economic</b> <b>cycle</b> was seen as self-correcting, government did not intervene during periods of economic hardship because it was seen as futile.|$|E

The latest acronym for attackers used by the Americans was AAF, for anti-Afghan fighters. These AAF were more professional and probably represented groups from areas outside of Nuristan. They would be Pashtuns, who hated the Tajiks and Hazara tribes that made up the ANA, or Afghan National Army. The AAF would disguise themselves in ANA uniforms and set up fake checkpoints to extract taxes and tolls from local contractors, and allied themselves with smugglers transporting illegal timber and gems across the border into Pakistan. Urdu and Pashtun HIG warriors bringing in arms and ammunition from Pakistan would cross the border in the other direction. Their fake government check points and “taxes” would finance and complete the <b>economic</b> <b>cycle</b> and serve to finance AAF operations. On the whole the AAF was a broader based and more formidable force in 2007 than before the American invasion, and represented a significant escalation.|$|E

This is amply evidenced by the “creative accounting” gimmickry used by many countries to achieve the required deficit to GDP ratio of 3 percent, and by the immediate abandonment of fiscal prudence by some countries {{as soon as they were}} included in the euro club.

30|$|Compared to {{the usual}} forced van der Pol model of {{nonlinear}} <b>economic</b> <b>cycles,</b> {{the contribution of the}} fractional forced van der Pol model of nonlinear <b>economic</b> <b>cycles</b> is that it can describe memory in economic dynamics. However, the characteristic of this memory in economic time series will change with time, for which it is affected by the macroeconomic environment and government policy at different times. Therefore, this paper will propose a variable-order fractional forced van der Pol model of nonlinear <b>economic</b> <b>cycles,</b> which can describe the fact that memory in economic series is varying with time. The orders in the fractional forced van der Pol model of nonlinear <b>economic</b> <b>cycles</b> are replaced by positive bounded continuous functions. In order to obtain an effective and applicable numerical technique for solving the variable-order fractional van der Pol model, the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method is adopted. Then we employ the technique to obtain the numerical results for the dynamics characteristics of the variable-order fractional van der Pol model with different parameters.|$|R

[...] Jagdish Bhagwati, a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous <b>economic</b> <b>cycle</b> associated with faster economic growth. However, economic growth {{does not necessarily mean}} a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist. Economic growth is conventionally measured using indicators such as GDP and GNI that do not accurately reflect the growing disparities in wealth. Additionally, Oxfam International argues that poor people are often excluded from globalization-induced opportunities [...] "by a lack of productive assets, weak infrastructure, poor education and ill-health;" [...] effectively leaving these marginalized groups in a poverty trap. Economist Paul Krugman is another staunch supporter of globalization and free trade with a record of disagreeing with many critics of globalization.
