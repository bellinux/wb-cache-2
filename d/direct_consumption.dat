Sambal Tempoyak is a Sumatran dish made from the fermented durian fruit, coconut milk, and a collection of spicy ingredients known as sambal. In Palembang, Pangasius catfish can be either cooked as tempoyak ikan patin (fish in tempoyak curry) or as brengkes (pepes) tempoyak, which is a steamed fermented durian paste in banana leaf container.|$|E
5|$|At these lower prices, ice {{began to}} sell in {{considerable}} volumes, with the market moving beyond the wealthy elite to {{a wider range of}} consumers, to the point where supplies became overstretched. It was also being used by tradesmen to preserve perishable good, rather than for <b>direct</b> <b>consumption.</b> Tudor looked beyond his existing suppliers to Maine and even to harvesting from passing icebergs, but neither source proved practical. Instead, Tudor teamed up with Nathaniel Wyeth to exploit the ice supplies of Boston on a more industrial scale. Wyeth devised a new form of horse-pulled ice-cutter in 1825 that cut square blocks of ice more efficiently than previous methods. He agreed to supply Tudor from Fresh Pond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reducing the cost of harvesting ice from 30 cents ($7.30) a ton (901kg) to only 10 cents ($2.40). Sawdust to insulate the ice was brought from Maine, at $16,000 ($390,000) a year.|$|E

The diet of the uplands often included cabbage, string beans, white potatoes, while most affluent whites in the uplands avoided crops imported from Africa because they were associated with, and reflected the social inferiority of, black slaves. Those who could grow or afford wheat often had biscuits on their table for breakfast, along with healthy portions of pork.

40|$|SUMMARY Household <b>direct</b> energy <b>consumption</b> {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a given and determined using a top-down approach. Furthermore, research regarding household energy consumption tends to focus on western countries. This research uses a bottom-up approach to determine the <b>direct</b> energy <b>consumption</b> and CO 2 emissions in the West-European countries the Netherlands and Germany and the East-European countries Hungary and the Czech Republic. This was possible because {{of the availability of}} a dataset that contained data from a survey, which was performed in all four countries. The dataset enables a more detailed determination of the underlying variables (e. g. household size, infrastructure, region, climate, habits, etc.) that influence the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions per energy category (transport, heating and electricity). This should make it possible to answer the following research question: What are the differences in the <b>direct</b> energy <b>consumption</b> of households within and between European countries and their consequent CO 2 emissions and how will these patterns change in the future? Household final energy consumption was converted to primary energy consumption using energy-required-for-energy ratios of national electricity sectors and fuels used. The CO 2 emissions were determined using data regarding the national electricity sector and fuel-specific CO 2 emissions from fuel burning. In addition, a model was used to forecast possible changes in the energy consumption patterns and related CO 2 emissions of households. Households in the Netherlands and Germany consume, on average, 162 GJ and 174 GJ respectively. The average Czech household consumes 200 GJ of direct energy. This high consumption is primarily due to the rural households with their high heating and electricity consumption. The average Hungarian household consumes the least amount of direct energy with 115 GJ. The average CO 2 emissions related to the <b>direct</b> energy <b>consumption</b> in households is 10. 2 tons in the Netherlands, 11. 6 tons in Germany, 17. 4 tons in the Czech Republic and 7. 3 tons in Hungary. In West-European households, the increase of a 1 -person household to a 2 -person household causes an increase in the <b>direct</b> energy <b>consumption</b> of around 33 %. In East-European households, the same household size increase leads to a 102 % or 176 % increase in the <b>direct</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> The further addition of a third or fourth household member has no considerable effect on the household <b>direct</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> The number of insulation measures taken in a house {{plays a major role in}} the energy consumption for heating. Houses with relatively few insulation measures in Hungary and the Czech Republic consume more energy than households in the Netherlands and Germany that have the same number of insulation measures. The type of insulation measures taken in these households is not the same and it is possible that the different insulation-types are not equally effective. In 2030, the household <b>direct</b> energy <b>consumption</b> will see an increase in transport energy due to more passenger cars per household. Households in Germany and the Czech Republic will remain at the same energy consumption levels. A decline in the primary electricity consumption compensates the increase in transport in these countries. Households in the Netherlands and Hungary will see an increase in the <b>direct</b> energy <b>consumption</b> in all three consumption categories (transport, heating and electricity). The energy source is often quite different and of importance in determining the <b>direct</b> energy <b>consumption</b> and related CO 2 emissions. Firstly, the electricity sectors in Hungary and the Czech Republic are less efficient than in the Netherlands and Germany. This can greatly increase the primary electricity consumption compared to the final consumption. Secondly, compared to households in the Netherlands and Germany, rural households in the Czech Republic and Hungary often use wood for household heating and when they use wood, the energy consumption is almost twice the energy consumption for households using a different fuel. ...|$|R

Nonetheless, since the 1950s, the overwhelming destination for captured E. ringens (anchoveta or Peruvian sardine) has been as the principal input for reduction fishery in the production of fishmeal and fish oil, with minuscule quantities destined for <b>direct</b> human <b>consumption.</b> Due to a combination of environmental and regulatory effects, since 2000, the Peruvian catch has ranged from 9.58 million metric tons (MT) to a low of 5.35 million MT, with the reported 2009 catch concluding at 5.35 million MT. E. ringens In recent years, <b>direct</b> human <b>consumption</b> (local and for export) has reached about 110,000 MT (about 2% of catch) due to evangelical promotion of health, environmental, and economic benefits, such as Mistura 2010, coupled with government and NGO activities, e.g. www.anchoveta.info, and private-sector offers from local supermarkets.|$|R

While total consumption has increased, the western economies are less reliant on oil than they were twenty-five years ago, due both to substantial growth in productivity and the growth of sectors of the economy with little oil dependence such as finance and banking, retail, etc. The decline of heavy industry and manufacturing in most developed countries has reduced the amount of oil per unit GDP; however, since these items are imported anyway, there is less change in the oil dependence of industrialized countries than the <b>direct</b> <b>consumption</b> statistics indicate.|$|E

[...] Just like microbial mats, environments which could produce this mode of fossilisation became increasingly restricted to harsher and deeper areas, where burrowers could not establish a foothold; as time progressed, the extent of burrowing increased sufficiently to effectively make this mode of preservation impossible.

However, along with the development of RES technology, the improvement of people’s living standards as well as the change of <b>consumption</b> patterns, residential <b>direct</b> energy <b>consumption</b> is shifting towards clean energy, through clean energy sources and highly-efficient energy use.
