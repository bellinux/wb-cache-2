5|$|Details of {{the game}} were leaked in February 2007, shortly before Rare {{announced}} development later that month. During development process Rare attempted {{to ensure that the}} game did not <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> similar to the original Jetpac, whilst keeping the core mechanics. The game received mostly favourable reviews upon release. Critics praised the updated graphics and gameplay, however they criticised the overall repetitiveness {{of the game}} and its multiplayer mode. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Mohammad Alavi {{was heavily}} involved in the level's development. Alavi sought to explain why Russia would invade the United States, and have the player make an emotional connection with Makarov. Much of the level's development was spent designing the massacre portion, as Alavi did not want it to <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> contrived or traumatic. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 developer Infinity Ward and publisher Activision were both supportive of the level's inclusion, though several game testers expressed disapproval, with one game tester refusing to play the level at all.|$|E
5|$|Under a 2007 {{agreement}} with Malaysia Airlines, Tzu Chi—an international Buddhist organisation—immediately sent specially trained teams to Beijing and Malaysia to give emotional support to passengers' families. The airline also sent its own team of caregivers and volunteers {{and agreed to}} bear the expense of bringing {{family members of the}} passengers to Kuala Lumpur and providing them with accommodation, medical care, and counselling. Altogether, 115 family members of the Chinese passengers flew to Kuala Lumpur. Some other family members chose to remain in China, fearing they would <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> isolated in Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|Rita Sullivan {{contacts}} Lewis {{and they}} attend the theatre together. Lewis charms Rita and she books {{him for the}} Chamber of Commerce Easter Dinner Dance. Lewis is surprised when Audrey turns up at the dance with Claudia. Audrey becomes jealous of Rita, and the women insult each other until Lewis intervenes. Lewis leaves his diary containing his clients' details in Audrey's salon. When he returns to collect it, he finds Audrey has read it. Audrey tells Lewis that they cannot continue to be together, but Lewis kisses Audrey and tells her he has feelings for her. They begin dating, despite Rita telling Audrey it will end in tears. After noticing Audrey is not happy with his occupation, Lewis quits and tells Audrey that he is beginning to <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> old for the job. Audrey invites Lewis {{to move in with}} her; and although he hesitates at first, Lewis eventually accepts.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E
25|$|If {{the straps}} {{dig into the}} {{shoulder}}, leaving red marks or causing shoulder or neck pain, the bra band is not offering enough support. If breast tissue overflows {{the bottom of the}} bra, under the armpit, or over the top edge of the bra cup, the cup size is too small. Loose fabric in the bra cup indicates the cup size is too big. If the underwires poke the breast under the armpit or if the bra's center panel does not lie flat against the sternum, the cup size is too small. If the band rides up the torso at the back, the band size is too big. If it digs into the flesh, causing the flesh to spill over the edges of the band, the band is too small. If the band feels tight, {{this may be due to}} the cups being too small; instead of going up in band size a person should try going up in cup size. Similarly a band might <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> loose if the cup is too big. It is possible to test whether a bra band is too tight or too loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that the cups are at the back and then check for fit and comfort. Generally, if the wearer must continually adjust the bra or experiences general discomfort, the bra is a poor fit and she should get a new fitting.|$|E

50|$|The {{reviewer}} for Variety {{found that}} the director had demonstrated “his thoroughgoing knowledge of and delight in film history, yet his striving for a 1970s screwball vibe <b>feels</b> <b>too</b> forced and artificial”. In Público's Ípsilon, Luís Miguel Oliveira gave the film two out of five stars.|$|R
500|$|Herriman had a {{great love}} of animals, and had {{a large number of}} dogs and cats; he had five dogs and {{thirteen}} cats in 1934.

500|$|In March 1995, Cuomo, who {{was born}} with one leg shorter than the other, had {{extensive}} surgery to lengthen his leg followed by months of painful physiotherapy sessions. This affected his songwriting, as he would spend long periods hospitalized {{under the influence of}} painkillers. According to Cuomo, around this time the rock opera concept [...] "started to <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> whimsical for where I was emotionally, going through the pain of the procedure ... I went to a more serious and dark place." ...|$|E
500|$|The storyline of the {{original}} Dragonlance series had been plotted and outlined before either the novel trilogy or the games were written. Dragons of Autumn Twilight was the first novel of the Dragonlance series. [...] It was based upon a Dungeons & Dragons session played by the authors with some of their friends, some of whom later became Dragonlance writers. The novel was written {{after the completion of}} the first Dragonlance game modules. [...] Weis and Hickman felt this was constraining and made the novel <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> episodic, so they reversed the process for the next books and completed the novels before the related modules were written.|$|E
5000|$|Jeffrey Lewis {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with Audio Antihero Records that [...] "It seems {{like a lot of people}} say that “The Ones Who’ve Cracked” is their preferred album, but to me that one <b>feels</b> <b>too</b> in-between, it’s in-between being a lo-fi album and a nicer studio album." ...|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to the Doctor Who music by Murray Gold, several classical pieces {{were included in the}} concert, including one piece which had its United Kingdom début. [...] Julie Gardner told Doctor Who Magazine that the concert's planners considered a theme of [...] "time and space" [...] to tie in with Doctor Who, but decided that this [...] "would lead to using the big sci-fi tracks from the likes of , which would make the concert <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> much like a 'film and TV soundtrack day'." [...] Instead, the producers chose [...] "the Doctor's love of humanity" [...] as a theme, and selected pieces which they felt connected with that theme.|$|E
500|$|Much of the level's {{development}} constituted {{designing the}} massacre portion. In the first iteration of [...] "No Russian", the massacre ended once the player killed {{the group of}} civilians outside the elevator, which then transitioned into a firefight. Alavi felt that having an emotional scene abruptly shift into a firefight was [...] "gimmicky", and altered the level to have the massacre continue much longer. He also did not want it too <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> traumatic for the player, and removed scenes with children or families hugging each other. Talent director Keith Arem remarked that due to the level's emotionally charged massacre, some of the actors became tearful while reciting their lines.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were divided}} on the game's level of difficulty. Fritz claimed that, though Lego Star Wars II {{provided}} only a [...] "short journey", it was [...] "loads of fun". GameSpots Ryan Davis estimated {{that it could be}} completed in six hours, but praised its bonus content. GameSpy and 1UP.com's reviewers thought similarly. A review by USA Todays Brett Molina claimed that [...] "he game's difficulty is balanced well enough so kids won't <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> frustrated while older gamers will still find a solid challenge" [...] and gave the game an overall score of 8 out of 10. Official Xbox Magazines review praised its [...] "weird puzzles". IGN's Jeremy Dunham and Reiner were more critical of the perceived low difficulty.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's an end," [...] said Dowd, [...] "anyhow. My God!

500|$|Copeland's {{score was}} {{generally}} well-received, though several critics sharply {{disagreed with the}} general consensus. Publications like PSXExtreme thought the music helped bring atmosphere to the varied worlds, and Allgame enthused that [...] "Insomniac should be commended for realizing the importance of music in games; it seems to enhance the whole experience." [...] Others, such as Joseph Parazen of Game Revolution, thought the background music sounded [...] "identical to every other 3D, cartoony, action platformer I've ever played". Other points of praise were the voice acting and character development. Among complaints aside from the story included the game camera, which could be difficult to control and led to unjustified enemy attacks. Some publications warned that the game might <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> much like its predecessors, with a similar plot and objectives.|$|E
500|$|Carl's {{relationship}} with Russell reflects how [...] "he's not really {{ready for the}} whirlwind that a kid is, as few of us are". Docter added he saw Up as a [...] "coming of age" [...] tale and an [...] "unfinished love story", with Carl still dealing {{with the loss of}} his wife. He cited inspiration from Casablanca and A Christmas Carol, which are both [...] "resurrection" [...] stories about men who lose something, and regain purpose during their journey. Docter and Rivera cited inspirations from the Muppets, Hayao Miyazaki, Dumbo, and Peter Pan. They also saw parallels to The Wizard of Oz and tried to make Up not <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> similar. There is a scene where Carl and Russell haul the floating house through the jungle. A Pixar employee compared the scene to Fitzcarraldo, and Docter watched that film and The Mission for further inspiration. The character Charles Muntz comes from Howard Hughes and Errol Flynn.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{criticized the}} high {{difficulty}} and [...] "permanent death" [...] {{for being too}} much and making the game not accessible to players. Patrick Joynt of GameSpy saw this as both a positive and negative, calling it [...] "punishingly, unrelentingly hardcore". He noted that the game uses simple core gameplay concepts to successfully create a [...] "satisfyingly deep and responsive system" [...] and depth in the combat encounters. RPGFan's Patrick Gann similarly enjoyed the game's depth, calling the gameplay concepts [...] "nearly perfect". IGN's Jack DeVries, however, thought that the turn-based gameplay made combat <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> [...] "stop-and-go", {{and said that he}} felt wary of trying certain risky things, such as attempting to steal from merchants, due to how punishing the game was. Meanwhile, Gann said that the knowledge that one would likely fall in battle eventually regardless of what happens made it possible to play the game without fear. Austin Shau at GameSpot liked the large variety of items for players to experiment with. Joynt and Famitsu enjoyed the game balance; the latter also appreciated the improved item storage system of the Nintendo DS version.|$|E

500|$|The game's mission design {{received}} mixed reviews. Martin {{criticized the}} limited geographical variety of each level, but Welsh applauded the map variety, adding that each level feels different, as ideas were never identical. He further praised the game's portrayal of nature, describing it as [...] "elegantly expressed". Gonzalez {{added that the}} game's variety was sufficient, and is successful in keeping the game interesting. Some critics criticized the game's difficulty curve, and added that the later levels can be frustrating as they are significantly more challenging and demand high levels of time management. Winterhalter however, criticized {{the first half of}} the game, calling it a [...] "tutorial" [...] that must be endured before reaching the better missions, while describing the latter half as addictive. Justin McElroy from Joystiq added that the natural disasters featured are way too unpredictable, and lamented that the game had failed to provide players enough clues when the player failed and destroyed the entire tribe. Tom Francis of PC Gamer echoed similar statements, that the game seldom notified players of their mistakes, and that levels are excessively trial-and-error and <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> stressful for players to play. Jamin Smith of VideoGamer.com criticized the mission structure and objectives for being unrewarding and lacking a sense of progression.|$|E
500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{after the release}} of No Line on the Horizon. David Fricke of Rolling Stone enjoyed the song, writing, [...] "The rising-falling effect of the harmony voices around Bono... is a perfect picture of where he really wants to be, when he gets to the line about 'vision over visibility.'" [...] Blender considered it the high-point of the album, comparing it to the band's 1987 single [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". Reviewer Rob Sheffield complimented the melding of bass, guitar, and vocals, calling it [...] "the kind of gimme-divinity anthem that U2 cut their teeth on, except it really does seem like they've gotten better at these songs now that they've picked up some bummed-out adult grit. Bono actually sounds scared of something in this song, and whether his nightmares are religious or sexual, the fear gives his voice some heft." [...] NME felt that it was the [...] "most impressive" [...] song on the album, describing it as a [...] "gorgeously sparse prayer built around Adam Clayton's heartbeat bassline and Bono's rough growl", and noting that despite its seven-minute length, it did not <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> long. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was more critical of the song, saying it [...] "doesn't have enough of a tune to support the full seven-minute gospel treatment", a sentiment that The Times agreed with.|$|E
500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote [...] "this {{convoluted}} {{hybrid of}} fairy tale and fantasy/action/comedy/horror aims for campy fun, but comes off tedious and blood-spattered." [...] Andrew Barker of Variety called the film [...] "inconsistently acted, and somehow both underwritten and overplotted," [...] {{and while the}} action is [...] "frequent and competently staged," [...] it might <b>feel</b> <b>too</b> repetitive [...] "as yet another witch is ripped apart limb from limb, sending yet another wave of viscera sluicing toward the camera." [...] Similarly, Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "after a while it’s easy to become numb to the repulsive sights and bored by action that once seemed intense and exciting" [...] in this [...] "rarely funny spoof that’s heavy on bone-crushing and blood-gushing," [...] giving it one-and-half star out of four. Steven Farber of The Hollywood Reporter also wrote a scathing review, saying that while [...] "Wirkola makes {{the most of the}} 3D technology", [...] "the film is too fanciful to be truly revolting" [...] for its gore effects and [...] "despite its few wry jokes, the script is awfully thin." [...] Roger Moore of The Charlotte Observer gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, writing that Wirkola [...] "focuses on the fights and flings all manner of viscera at the 3-D camera as limbs are whacked off and heads and torsos explode. Less attention was paid to the story, and the dialogue is a tad over-reliant on the random f-word to land a laugh." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film zero out of four stars, writing that [...] "nothing makes a whole lot of sense in this incoherent movie, whose director’s philosophy seems to be: When in doubt, cut somebody’s head off." [...] Kat Murphy of MSN gave it one star out of four, comparing this [...] "big-budget faux fairy tale about skanky witches" [...] to a [...] "downscale video game for dull-eyed teens happy to lap up lame wisecracks and lots of gore." [...] According to Vulture's Bilge Ebiri, [...] "if the similarly situated Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter took itself too seriously, the problem with Hansel & Gretel is that it doesn’t quite take itself seriously enough." [...] Keith Staskiewicz of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C-, calling it [...] "an intermittently fun, but overexcited and predictable mish-mash." [...] Alicia Malone of IGN rated it a 4.5/10, stating [...] "there are a few funny moments, but overall Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is too similar to many films we’ve seen before." [...] Calum Marsh of Slant Magazine lambasted the film's [...] "sub-Tim Burton aesthetic" [...] and wrote that [...] "the result suggests A Knight's Tale as penned by Seth MacFarlane," [...] giving it zero out of four stars. Scott A. Gray of Exclaim! praised some elements of the film, such as [...] "lush and colourful art design that recalls a Guillermo Del Toro production, sound creature makeup and special effects, decently choreographed action scenes and a pair of leads who do their damnedest to sell the limp script", giving it a score of 4/10. Chris Knight of The Vancouver Sun called it a [...] "mess of a fairy tale", expecting [...] "a wiccan outcry at the film’s depiction — nay, endorsement — of the torture of witch-folk." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave it one star out of four, concerned how it [...] "has an alarming number of females being strung up, burned, shot, decapitated and eviscerated." ...|$|E
