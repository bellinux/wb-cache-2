40|$|A longstanding puzzle in isotope {{studies of}} C 3 plant species is that {{heterotrophic}} plant organs (e. g., stems, roots, seeds, and fruits) {{tend to be}} enriched in 13 C compared to the autotrophic organ (leaves) that provides them with photosynthate. Our inability to explain this puzzle suggests key deficiencies in understanding post-photosynthetic metabolic processes. It also limits the effectiveness of applications of stable carbon isotope analyses {{in a variety of}} scientific disciplines ranging from plant physiology to global carbon cycle studies. To gain insight into this puzzle, we <b>excavated</b> whole <b>plant</b> architectures of Nitraria tangutorum Bobrov, a C 3 species that has an exceptional capability of fixing sands and building sand dunes, in two deserts in northwestern China. We systematically and simultaneously measured carbon isotope ratios and nitrogen and phosphorous contents of different parts of the <b>excavated</b> <b>plants.</b> We also determined the seasonal variations in leaf carbon isotope ratios on nearby intact plants of N. tangutorum. We found, for the first time, that higher nitrogen contents in heterotrophic organs were significantly correlated with increased heterotrophic 13 C enrichment compared to leaves. However, phosphorous contents had no effect on the enrichment. In addition, new leaves had carbon isotope ratios similar to roots but were progressively depleted in 13 C as they matured. We concluded that a nitrogen-mediated process, hypothesized to be the refixation of respiratory CO 2 by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase, was responsible for the differences in 13 C enrichment among different heterotrophic organs, while processes such as fractionating foliar metabolism and preferentially loading into phloem of 13 C-enriched sugars may contribute to the overall autotrophic–heterotrophic difference in carbon isotope compositions...|$|R

However, few researchers have systematically evaluated intra-plant {{variations in}} δ 15 N and their relationships with organ nutrient contents. We <b>excavated</b> whole <b>plant</b> architectures of Nitraria tangutorum Bobrov, a C 3 species of vital regional ecological importance, in two deserts in northwestern China. We systematically and simultaneously measured N isotope ratios and N and P contents of different parts of the <b>excavated</b> <b>plants.</b> We found that intra-plant variations in δ 15 N of N. tangutorum were positively correlated with corresponding organ N and P contents. However, it was the N ×[*]P interaction, not N and P individually or their linear combination, that was the strongest predictor of intra-plant δ 15 N. Additionally, we showed that root δ 15 N increased with depth into soil, a pattern similar to profiles of soil δ 15 N reported by previous studies in different ecosystems. We hypothesized that the strong positive intra-plant δ 15 N–N and P relationships are caused by three processes acting in conjunction: (1)  N and P content-driven fractionating exchanges of ammonia between leaves and the atmosphere (volatilization) during photorespiration, (2)  resorption and remobilization of N and P from senescing leaves, and (3)  mixture of the re-translocated foliar N and P with existing pools in stems and roots. To test our hypothesis, future studies should investigate plant N volatilization and associated isotope fractionation and intra-plant variations in δ 15 N in different species across ecosystems and climates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Vps 25 p is {{the product}} of yeast gene VPS 25 and is found in an endosomal sorting complex {{required}} for transport (ESCRT) -II, along with Vps 22 p and Vps 36 p. This complex is essential for sorting of ubiquitinated biosynthetic and endosomal cargoes into endosomes. Results We found that VPS 25 is a highly conserved and widely expressed eukaryotic gene, with single orthologs in chromalveolate, <b>excavate,</b> amoebozoan, <b>plant,</b> fungal and metazoan species. Two paralogs were found in Trichomonas vaginalis. An ortholog was strikingly absent from the Encephalitozoon cuniculi genome. Intron positions were analyzed in VPS 25 from 36 species. We found evidence for five ancestral VPS 25 introns, intron loss, and single instances of intron gain (a Paramecium species) and intron slippage (Theileria species). Processed pseudogenes were identified in four mammalian genomes, with a notable absence in the mouse genome. Two retropseudogenes were found in the chimpanzee genome, one more recently inserted, and one evolving from a common primate ancestor. The amino acid sequences of 119 Vps 25 orthologs are aligned, compared with the known secondary structure of yeast Vps 25 p, and used to carry out phylogenetic analysis. Residues in two amino-terminal PPXY motifs (motif I and II), involved in dimerization of Vps 25 p and interaction with Vps 22 p and Vps 36 p, were closely, but not absolutely conserved. Specifically, motif I was absent in Vps 25 homologs of chromalveolates, euglenozoa, and diplomonads. A highly conserved carboxy-terminal lysine was identified, which suggests Vps 25 is ubiquitinated. Arginine- 83 of yeast Vps 25 p involved in Vps 22 p interaction was highly, but not absolutely, conserved. Human tissue expression analysis showed universal expression. Conclusion We have identified 119 orthologs of yeast Vps 25 p. Expression of mammalian VPS 25 {{in a wide range of}} tissues, and the presence in a broad range of eukaryotic species, indicates a basic role in eukaryotic cell function. Intron splice site positions were highly conserved across all major eukaryotic species, suggesting an ancestral origin. Amino acid sequence analysis showed the consensus for the amino-terminal proline-rich motifs is P- [WP]-X-[YF] for motif I (when present) and P-P-[FYL]-[FY] for motif II, and that Vps 25 may be ubiquitinated. </p...|$|R

In yeast, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB genes, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB genes in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all eukaryotic lineages, with plants and animals harboring massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically harbor less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB genes are orthologous across all four eukaryotic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of enzymes of the ubiquitination system probably dating back to the first eukaryotes approximately 2 billion years ago.

The sandstone consists primarily of clasts from granitic basement rocks underlying much of southeast Tasmania and mafic clasts containing feldspathic microliths, and primary, phreatomagmatic quartz crystals. Detrital zircons from the sandstones are mostly Early Jurassic (Toarcian) in age (182 +/- 4 Ma) with minor Triassic (226 Ma), Devonian (380360 Ma) and Proterozoic populations, Basaltic andesite, hereafter referred to as andesite, caps the volcanilithic units and displays similar ratios of fluid-immobile trace elements (e. g.

The andesites are correlated with the Jurassic Kirkpatrick Basalts (Trans-Antarctic Mountains, Antarctica) based on their field relationships with bounding strata, age, and distinctive similarities in major-element composition and fluid-immobile trace-element ratios. The andesite is interpreted as an extrusive equivalent of the Tasmanian dolerite. Importantly, drillcore from Lune River contains stoped clasts of andesite in fine-grained dolerite, indicating that the andesite pre-dates the dolerite.

40|$|Meiosis is {{a unique}} {{mechanism}} and fundamental process that is shared by sexually reproducing eukaryotic species. Species that undergo meiosis can be determined by identifying the presence of core meiotic genes {{also known as the}} “Meiosis Detection Toolkit”. These genes include the following: SPO 11, HOP 1, HOP 2, MND 1, DMC 1, MSH 4, MSH 5, MER 3, and REC. Red algae (Rhodophyta) represent a distinct eukaryotic lineage with a long evolutionary history that dates 1. 2 BYA and is represented by a fossil that exhibits characteristics of meiosis. Nonetheless, sexuality has never been observed in unicellular red algal species in the order Cyanidiales (Galdieria sulphuraria and Cyanidioschyzon merolae) and the Porphyridiales (Porphyridium purpureum). To understand the evolution of meiosis in red algae, this study examined the usefulness of the meiotic toolkit to determine the presence of sexuality as well as the utility of these genes as taxonomic markers for the evolutionary history of the red algae. This study used the available red algal genomes of G. sulphuraria, C. schyzon merolae, C. crispus, and Porphyridium purpureum. As a secondary objective, the genomic DNA of several sexual and asexual red algal taxa were experimentally examined to identify and compare the meiotic genes using a variety of biotechnological methods such as degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analyses. Of the nine core meiotic genes, MND 1, which is the essential meiotic gene for nuclear division and new recombination, has been observed in the Porphyra rediviva nuclear genome and appear to contain premature stop codons. Moreover, annotated amino acid sequences of six core meiotic genes (DMC 1, MND 1, SPO 11, HOP 2, MSH 4, and MSH 5) were used in the phylogenetic analyses.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the longevity of four grassland suffrutex plant species, namely Berkheya insignis, Callilepis laureola, Protea insignis and Tephrosia kraussiana. Seed viability, seedling growth, morphology, habitat and population structure and demography were also assessed and related to plant age. The rhizomes, seeds (if available) and canopies of B. insignis, C. laureola, P. simplex and T. kraussiana were removed from a site near Port Edward in the Pondoland region, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa in April 2008. Seeds were available for P. simplex and T. kraussiana only. Seed germination and viability were tested in the field and laboratory using germination trials and tetrazolium tests. Greenhouse and field grown seedlings were used to monitor seedling growth and to record seedling morphology. The aerial and rhizome morphologies of adult <b>plants</b> <b>excavated</b> from the field were also recorded. The largest of these rhizomes were aged using radiocarbon dating. Attempts were made to develop morphological surrogates for plant age as no method currently exists. Plant density, demographies, number of inflorescences and various environmental variables of wild populations of B. insignis, C. laureola, P. simplex and T. kraussiana were sampled from the Red Desert Nature Reserve and the Umtamvuna Nature Reserve. Species morphologies varied, however important similarities suggest convergent evolution. These included a single vertical main stem rhizome with multiple side branches, early rhizome development in seedlings, and high root: shoot ratios. Seed viability was high in the laboratory but low seedling emergence was observed in the field. Seedling growth was rapid for T. kraussiana and slow for P. simplex. The population stage structure for all four species comprised primarily adults with few or no juveniles. Wild population plant height and main stem diameter followed normal distributions. Number of stems, basal area, canopy area and the number of floral structures had distributions favouring the smaller size classes. Soil P, N, K and organic carbon were important soil nutrients in a PCA analysis of the habitats of the four species. Radiocarbon dating yielded the following ages: B. insignis: 49 - 51 years, C. laureola: 49 - 50 years, P. simplex: 49 - 51 years and T. kraussiana: 51 years. There was a significant relationship between rhizome mass and canopy area, basal area, height, number of stems and main stem diameter. Since rhizome mass had a positive relationship with age- a relationship between age and aerial structures is likely. Therefore, creating surrogates for age may be possible. Overall, these species have moderate longevity, are poor seed producers with possibly slow population growth and are closely associated with soil nutrients. Therefore, these and other suffrutex species are particularly vulnerable to habitat destruction and climate change. The results of this study indicate that there needs to be a greater focus on below ground growth during ecological assessments in order to better understand the ecology of our diverse grassland biome plants...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{contribute}} to the knowledge of how plants respond to adverse influences of intensified land use. In particular, attention was paid {{to the ways in which}} life history strategies change in order to buffer environmental variation, and which important parts of the life cycle are affected most. Herbaceous plant species are often threatened when the land use in an agricultural landscape is intensified: habitat is destroyed for new fields, infrastructure or urban areas, or habitat becomes less favorable because water levels are lowered for agriculture and because of pollution and nutrient enrichment by the influx of particles through air and water from the neighboring fields. Nutrient enrichment enhances natural succession and causes more competitive species to take over from species that are characteristic for nutrient-poor grasslands. As a result of habitat reduction and deterioration, populations decline in size and are more prone to extinction. The distances between remaining populations also increases, which makes gene flow through pollen or seed dispersal less likely. Decreased gene flow may lead to inbreeding depression and again higher extinction risks. Plant species may counterbalance some of these influences by flexible growth patterns and may adapt for instance to nutrient enrichment. For the conservation of the floral diversity of agricultural landscapes it is therefore important to know to what extent plant species are endangered by the different effects of intensified land use and to what extent these species can buffer the changes in their growing conditions. In this study I concentrate on four co-occurring perennial herbs in nutrient-poor, species-rich meadows. With three species from the Asteraceae (Cirsium dissectum (L.) Hill, Hypochaeris radicata L. and Centaurea jacea L.) and one from the Dipsacaceae (Succisa pratensis Moench), the species are phylogenetically related but have contrasting life history strategies as they differ in the life-span of their rosettes and in the rate of clonal propagation. The flexibility of the allocation of biomass to different life history functions (plant growth, sexual reproduction and clonal reproduction) is investigated in chapter 2. In a one-season garden experiment we continuously removed either rosette buds or flower buds to study the responses to damage. All investigated plants compensated for the removed buds. The short-lived species (H. radicata) showed stronger compensation for lost flower buds than the longer-lived species (S. pratensis and C. jacea) and the species with a high clonal propagation rate (C. jacea) compensated more strongly for lost rosette buds than the infrequently ramifying species. However, two species (H. radicata and S. pratensis) also switched to increased rosette formation when flower buds were removed. This switch shows, together with increased vegetative plant weight, that sexual reproduction has costs in terms of growth in size and clonal propagation. Costs of sexual reproduction underlie the hypotheses on the response of plants that are gradually outcompeted during succession: plants are expected to either increase their seed production to escape to other sites through seed dispersal (but at the expense of plant growth and future reproduction), or alternatively to persist by investing more in vegetative growth. In chapter 3 we aim to test these long-standing, but largely untested hypotheses in a three-year garden experiment. The target plants were grown together with a dominating, tall grass (Molinia caerulea (L.) Moench). Costs of sexual reproduction were investigated by continuous flower bud removal and were found in all target species as either reduced plant biomass or reduced number of rosettes. Succession was mimicked by fertilizing of the plots, which caused a threefold increase of the grass biomass. Mortality rates increased under fertilization in two target species (H. radicata and C. dissectum) probably because they lacked a means of competing with the grasses. Three target species increased their relative allocation to flowers and seeds when their plots were enriched, while their relative allocation to storage did not decrease but in some species even slightly increased. In the fourth species (C. jacea) seed production was only higher in large plants but not in small plants. Allocation to every life history function was strongly and positively dependent on plant size. Consequently, the two hypothesized strategies collapse into a single syndrome: in response to succession plants must increase in size in order to survive and to increase seed production. The sexual reproduction pathway, from flower production to established seedlings, is further investigated in chapter 4. By sampling flowering plants and flower heads with seeds and by performing seed addition experiments we quantified for each species all involved steps: flower head production, flower production, seed set, seed predation and establishment as seedlings. The two infrequently ramifying species (H. radicata and S. pratensis) had high numbers of seedlings per flowering rosette: more than one on average. This number was below one in the two more clonally propagating species (C. dissectum and C. jacea). Seedling establishment was the largest bottleneck in the pathway, while seed set was important too in one of the more clonal species. The different steps were studied in several sites and over several years. The spatiotemporal coefficients of variation were highest for seedling establishment, but closely followed in magnitude by the coefficients for flower head production and seed set, indicating that selection processes can be expected in different parts of the sexual pathway of the life cycle. The whole life cycle is studied for three species (S. pratensis, H. radicata and C. jacea) in chapter 5. Demographic measurements on rosette survival, clonal propagation and flower head production were made in permanent plots in three or five populations over four years. The sexual pathway of the life cycle was completed with data of the previous chapter. We constructed 42 stage-based projection matrices to study the population dynamics of the three species in different sites over time. The calculated population growth rates were lowest in the most short-lived species (H. radicata) and most stable in the most clonal species (C. jacea). Using life table response experiment analyses we found that the species differed in their response to the same spatiotemporal variation in environmental conditions. Furthermore, species responded differently in sites in which they had low population growth rates than to years in which they had low population growth rates. In two species (S. pratensis and H. radicata) below-average values of some life cycle components in bad sites were partly compensated for by the above-average values of other components, but similar compensation did not occur in bad years. By contrast, this compensation did appear in bad years for the third, more clonal species (C. jacea). The implication of this difference between spatial and temporal variation in population dynamics is that temporal variation can not readily be substituted with spatial variation as has previously been done in some time-limited studies. In chapter 6 we investigate the demographic implications of inbreeding depression in order to evaluate if reported effects of inbreeding on several life history components significantly influence the population dynamics and population survival of S. pratensis. For that purpose we constructed a projection matrix model with an outcrossing and an inbreeding cycle. The growth of seedlings and small rosettes were reduced in the latter cycle, as was seed set and germination, using empirically based data. The proportion of seeds entering either cycle was a function of the size of the population: more seeds were inbred in smaller populations. We compared a declining and an increasing population in the simulations. Although only a part of the life cycle was affected, inbreeding reduced the time to extinction in the decreasing population. Inbreeding affected the increasing population only when the initial population was small. Density dependency by limiting habitat size only affected the increasing population. The demography of the most clonal (rhizomatous) and also most endangered herb of the model species (C. dissectum) was studied in chapter 7. The results of the allocation experiment of the third chapter are further analyzed: whereas the total biomass of the plants was unaffected by the fertilization treatment, the surviving rosettes were further away from the original planting location and more remnants of dead rosettes were found in the fertilized plots. Field observations on <b>excavated</b> <b>plants</b> and an additional experiment confirmed that both flowering and rhizome formation are size-dependent. This suggests that the high percentage of flowering rosettes in the allocation experiment was the result of a high growth rate of the fertilized rosettes. The total biomass did not differ from the control plots because the mortality rate of the non-flowering rosettes was also higher in the fertilized plots. This pattern of increased flowering and of increased turn-over of biomass and rosettes is consistent with the results of a demographic field study. In the most productive site we found high flowering probabilities and above-average clonal propagation but lower rosette survival. This trend towards higher turn-over rates makes this bad competitor even more prone to extinction when the nutrient enrichment of a meadow continues. The increased seed production has a negligible contribution to the local population growth rate as seedling recruitment seems confined to very open, early-successional habitats. The last chapter was aimed to integrate the population dynamics models and the results of the fertilization experiments to investigate which effects on individual plants have the strongest impact on the dynamics of the population. As fertilization had both positive effects on plant size and seed production and negative effects on survival and seedling establishment, we were also interested in the overall outcome when all effects were incorporated into a model describing the natural population dynamics. In order to model effects on life history components and plant traits we built a hierarchical matrix in which each element was a function of life history components and many of the components in turn were functions of plant traits. The negative effects of fertilization on the population growth rate by increased mortality rates in the two weak competitors (C. dissectum and H. radicata) overruled other effects and caused strong population declines. In the other two species (S. pratensis and C. jacea), in which mortality was still unaffected, negative impacts of reduced seedling establishment were small or compensated by increased seed production and plant size. However, the model results also suggest that also in these better competitors populations will decline once the mortality rates of individuals increase. Positive effects on plant size and seed number can not compensate for high death rates. We therefore conclude that although the life history responses of these perennials are rather flexible, their populations will go extinct in grasslands that have become more productive through succession and nutrient enrichment. The decline of small population can be expected to be even accelerated by inbreeding depressions. However, when increased allocation to sexual reproduction leads to increased seed production for the total population, this flexible life history response may have positive effects on the dynamics of a species in the landscape through increased colonization probabilities...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the first ever}} synthesis of the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age in Perthshire and Stirlingshire. It draws on evidence from excavations, field survey and aerial survey, the latter two largely undertaken by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. It is clear from this study {{that the key to}} appreciating the structure of the data within this region is a sound understanding of the history of research. Several key players are identified in the history of antiquarian research in the area, with Christian Maclagan and David Christian emerging as pioneers in field recording. However, aerial and ground survey, particularly since the mid- 1970 s has been crucial in altering the perceived nature of the archaeological resource, with the density of known upland settlement increasing dramatically, and numerous plough-truncated sites being identified in lowland cropmarks. The geology, geomorphology and soils of the study area is characterised, and factors that might have affected how later prehistoric people interacted with and perceived their environment are identified. These include sea level change in the Forth Valley in the Iron Age, climatic deterioration in the Early Iron Age and major forest clearance and increased cultivation in the Late Iron Age. A mosaic of vegetation types can be envisaged for the later prehistoric landscape, which seems to have opened out in the last few hundred years of the first millennium ВС, perhaps to cope with an increased population. Analysis of existing <b>excavated</b> data on <b>plant</b> macrofossils provided further detail here, suggesting that such crops were grown and processed in both the upland and lowland zones. While the absence of significant quantities of cereal pollen need not conclusively imply a pastoral dimension to the later prehistoric economy, a reassessment of zoo-archaeological evidence made it quite clear that domestic cattle and sheep/goat were in use, in addition to domestic horses and wild animals. Following this, a critical review of the chronological framework is provided, followed by reclassification of the various site types known. It proves possible to assign broad date ranges to the different types of site identified. This new classification is used as the basis for an assessment of dating and function of these sites. The case studies of Stirling, south-east Perthshire and north-east Perthshire enable an assessment of site morphology and settlement patterns on a more local level, armed with a regionally-specific chronological and functional framework. These various lines of enquiry are then drawn together to provide a narrative describing the nature of later prehistoric settlement and society. The study area is then put into context, through comparison with the evidence from adjacent areas of Eastern Scotland. The previous models, which emphasised the differences between settlement, society and economy in areas north and south of the Forth, as a long-term structural feature of Scottish archaeology {{have been shown to be}} erroneous. It is not until the Late Iron Age that marked differences in the settlement of Stirlingshire and Perthshire can be observed. A conscious decision was made in this study to move away from the status-dominated assumptions of previous accounts. When we look at the Iron Age of Stirlingshire in a chronologically dynamic way, we see rather than the no-man's land described by previous authors, or the highly stratified society envisaged by those who assume that the lowland brochs are high-status, a wealthy area with a high enough population to necessitate large-scale woodland clearance by the final years of the first millennium ВС. In Perthshire too, both highland and lowland, there is little evidence of a social hierarchy at any time. The contextual, temporally dynamic approach to later prehistoric remains taken here has enabled us to gain a much more firmly-based view of settlement and society in Perthshire and Stirlingshire.
