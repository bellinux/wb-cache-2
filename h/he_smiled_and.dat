25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} {{opened and}} immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending {{a week of}} performances in the hall, a music critic for The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was [...] "a very mature building"; <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> replied: [...] "Ah, but did I have to wait this long?" ...|$|E
500|$|Watson also observes, [...] "Similarly, the Dutch Defence looks {{particularly}} sterile when White achieves the reversed positions a tempo up (it {{turns out}} that he has nothing useful to do!); and indeed, many standard Black openings are not very inspiring when one gets them as White, tempo in hand." [...] GM Alex Yermolinsky likewise notes that GM Vladimir Malaniuk, a successful exponent of the Leningrad Dutch (1.d4 f5 2.g3 g6) at the highest levels, [...] "once made a deep impression on me by casually dismissing someone's suggestion that he should try 1.f4 as White. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> said, 'That extra move's gonna hurt me.|$|E

500|$|On July 7, he was {{selected}} to his seventh consecutive All-Star Game, played at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. [...] In the Reds' clubhouse for the All-Star Game, Molina shared a locker with Reds' second baseman Brandon Phillips. [...] Since the brawl between the Cardinals and Reds in 2010, [...] the two mended their schism, and Molina has a photograph of their families together. [...] When informed whose locker he was using, Molina replied, [...] "This is Phillips' locker? [...] How about that? [...] I'll have to write something to him." [...] While the pregame roster introductions were made, Reds fans booed all six Cardinals players who were selected, and even former Cardinal Albert Pujols. [...] When Molina was introduced, <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> turned and pointed his thumbs {{toward the back of}} his jersey. [...] Pujols provided levity when he then joined in the booing. [...] After the game, Molina remarked to reporters, [...] "when you spend 12 years coming to Cincinnati and you beat them so many times, they’re going to boo you." [...] In his career to that point, he hit [...]319 with a [...]352 on-base percentage and [...]500 slugging percentage in 270 career at-bats at Great American Ball Park.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson was {{successful}} despite the obstacle of racism. A favorite Robinson anecdote {{is that he}} seated himself in a restaurant and a customer objected to his presence. When the manager suggested {{that it might be}} better if Robinson leave, <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> asked, [...] "Have you got a ten-dollar bill?" [...] Politely asking to borrow the manager's note for a moment, Robinson added six $10 bills from his own wallet and mixed them up, then extended the seven bills together, adding, [...] "Here, let's see you pick out the colored one". The restaurant manager served Robinson without further delay.|$|E
2500|$|During the inauguration, {{there were}} two matters of controversy. First, {{although}} Obama constitutionally assumed the Presidency at noon on January 20, he did not complete {{the oath of office}} until 12:05pm. Clinton also completed the oath about five minutes late during his first inauguration. Additionally, Obama and the administering official, Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts, did not execute the 35-word oath as prescribed by the United States Constitution. First, Obama jumped in before the [...] "do solemnly swear" [...] phrase, which seemed to throw the Chief Justice off his stride. Subsequently, Roberts moved the word [...] "faithfully" [...] back nine spots, and used [...] "to" [...] instead of [...] "of." [...] That threw the president off, and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> paused to collect his thoughts, then decided to follow Roberts' lead. The flaw is recorded in the transcript of the oath as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|Kelly then {{heard the}} {{approach}} of Kennedy and Scanlan, and the four gang members concealed themselves, some behind logs, {{and one in the}} tent. They forced McIntyre to sit on a log, and Kelly threatened, [...] "Mind, I have a rifle for you if you give any alarm." [...] Kennedy and Scanlan rode into the camp. McIntyre went forward and said, [...] "Sergeant, I think you had better dismount and surrender, as you are surrounded." [...] Kelly at the same time called out, [...] "Put up your hands." [...] Kennedy appeared to think it was Lonigan who called out, and that a jest was intended, for <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> put his hand on his revolver case. He was instantly fired at, but not hit. Kennedy then realised the hopelessness of his position, jumped off his horse, and begged for his life, [...] "It's all right, stop it, stop it." [...] Scanlan jumped down and tried to make for a tree, but before he could unsling his rifle, he was shot and killed.|$|E

60|$|She {{opened her}} basket {{and began to}} prepare a meal. Old Swallowtail sat and watched her. Presently <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> grimly <b>and</b> Nan never noticed the expression.
