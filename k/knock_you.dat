Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to <b>knock</b> <b>you</b> down.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll <b>knock</b> <b>you</b> down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} many {{alternate}} versions of this event. One version, which was later portrayed in The Babe Ruth Story, claims that Ruth went to Sylvester's hospital bed and promised him in person that he would {{hit a home run}} for him. On October 9, Ruth followed up on Sylvester and told him he would [...] "try to <b>knock</b> <b>you</b> another homer, maybe two today". Differing newspaper reports from October 1926 claimed that Sylvester suffered from blood poisoning, a spinal infection, a sinus condition, or had a condition requiring a spinal fusion.

They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day, alternating with the Beatles. They were appalled at the living conditions the Beatles and other groups like Howie Casey and the Seniors (who were sleeping in one room {{at the back of the}} Kaiserkeller) had to put up with, so they booked into Hamburg's Seamens' Mission.|$|E

Former Hartlepools player Cliff Wright described the pair as [...] "good cop, bad cop. Cloughie would <b>knock</b> <b>you</b> to the ground, verbally at least, and Pete would pick you up and put you back together." [...] As the bigger personality and the man with the title of manager, Clough garnered much greater publicity than Taylor, which caused Taylor to grumble that [...] "I sometimes wonder why he never says to Bell's whisky, for instance, when they're handing out Manager of the Month awards, 'You'll have to present an extra gallon bottle.

500|$|Thrive was {{recorded}} at Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with producer Mark A. Miller. According to lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the idea behind}} Thrive came from the student ministry he is involved in. As a youth pastor, Hall frequently uses Psalms 1, which metaphorically compares {{the concept of a}} righteous man to a prosperous tree planted by a river. Hall said that many people he has talked with are simply surviving, which he feels contrasts with this â€” he felt that, although hard times can come upon anyone, people are not put in these situations to simply survive through them, but rather to thrive through the adversity. Using the metaphor, Hall noted that, if one were to pull away all the dirt from around a tree, one would find roots digging into the ground in addition to the limbs of the tree reaching out. Hall elaborated that [...] "you need to get your strength from God; you donâ€™t get it on your own. If youâ€™re all limbs, the thorns of life will <b>knock</b> <b>you</b> over. You need to dig your roots in and let God reach out through you". Accordingly, half of the record focuses on 'reaching out', while the other half focuses on 'digging deep'. Hall described the record as being [...] "an effort to draw a picture of what a believer, a follower of Jesus, would look like if they dug into their roots and understood God and themselves more, and then instead of trying to go be Christian for God, they just let God give them chances to be a Christian".|$|E

Me being from L.A., I was trying to rep our entire city alone, so had to step to him". Ice-T also replied {{that he had no}} personal problem with him but just [...] "thought I could beat him rapping anyways". Ice-T stated that he recorded [...] "Girls L.G.B.N.A.F." [...] as a humorous response to LL Cool J's song [...] "I Need Love". Ice-T stated that: [...] "Girls came to me and asked, 'Ice, why don't you write a ballad'? Now can you imagine saying, 'I need loooove?' That's a wimp. So I wrote ('Girls') as a joke." [...] LL Cool J later retaliated [...] dissing Ice-T in his song [...] "To da Break of Dawn" [...] from his album Mama Said <b>Knock</b> <b>You</b> Out (1990). Afrika Islam said their feud ended when a group meeting involving Flavor Flav, DJ Red Alert, Mike Tyson and Afrika Bambaataa persuaded them to stop fighting. Islam explained Tyson's role: [...] " [...] down with hip-hop and the Zulus and I've always considered rappers like boxers anyway". Ice-T commented on the feud in NME magazine in 2012, stating: [...] "You need a nemesis in hip hop. It's part of what fuels good rap. L was coming out of New York saying he was the best rapper in the world. I was trying to get my feet out of LA. You can't have someone saying they're the best if you're trying to. We had a little hip hop thing but it was never serious." ...|$|E

2500|$|Along with James Brown and Parliament-Funkadelic, Sly and the Family Stone were {{pioneers of}} late 1960s and early '70s funk. Their fusion of R rhythms, {{infectious}} melodies, and psychedelia {{created a new}} pop/soul/rock hybrid the impact of which has proven lasting and widespread. Motown producer Norman Whitfield, for example, patterned the label's forays into harder-driving, socially relevant material (such as The Temptations' [...] "Runaway Child" [...] and [...] "Ball of Confusion") based on their sound. The pioneering precedent of Stone's racial, sexual, and stylistic mix, had a major influence in the 1980s on artists such as Prince and Rick James. Legions of artists from the 1990s forward â€“ including Public Enemy, Fatboy Slim, Beck, Beastie Boys and LL Cool J's popular [...] "Mama Said <b>Knock</b> <b>You</b> Out" [...] along with many others â€“ mined Stone's seminal back catalog for hook-laden samples.|$|E
2500|$|Goodman {{was also}} {{responsible}} for a significant step in racial integration in America. In the early 1930s, black and white musicians could not play together in most clubs and concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by the Jim Crow laws. Goodman broke with tradition by hiring Teddy Wilson to play with him and the drummer Gene Krupa in the Benny Goodman Trio. In 1936, he added the vibraphonist Lionel Hampton to form the Benny Goodman Quartet. In 1939 Goodman added the pioneering jazz guitarist Charlie Christian to his band and small ensembles; Christian played with him until his death from tuberculosis {{less than three years}} later. This integration in music happened ten years before Jackie Robinson became the first black American to enter Major League Baseball. [...] " [...] popularity was such that he could remain financially viable without touring the South, where he would have been subject to arrest for violating Jim Crow laws." [...] According to Jazz by Ken Burns, when someone asked him why he [...] "played with that nigger" [...] (referring to Teddy Wilson), Goodman replied, [...] "I'll <b>knock</b> <b>you</b> out if you use that word around me again".|$|E
