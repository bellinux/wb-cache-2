5000|$|The {{vibration}} galvanometer {{is used for}} detecting alternating currents {{in the frequency of}} its natural resonance. Most common application is as a null <b>indicating</b> <b>instrument</b> in AC bridge circuits and current comparators.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the use of}} {{the first}} current <b>indicating</b> <b>instrument</b> called galvanometer, {{metrology}} have been developed and presently there are different technologies available to measure electric current which includes the shunt resistor based on the Ohm’s Law, AC current measurements carried out by traditional current transformers and Rogowski coils, Magnetic-field based transducers and there are other emerging technologies like the magneto-resistance effect (MR) Transducers.|$|E
5000|$|The finite lumped {{system is}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} simple parts, each of which has known dynamical properties which can be defined by equations using two types of scalar variables and parameters of the system. Variables of the first type represent quantities which can be measured, at least conceptually, by attaching an <b>indicating</b> <b>instrument</b> to two connection points of the element. Variables of the second type characterize quantities which can be measured by connecting a meter in series with the element. Relative velocities and positions, pressure differentials and voltages are typical quantities of the first class, whereas electric currents, forces, rates of heat flow, are variables of the second type. Firestone has been the first to distinguish these two types of variables with the names across variables and through variables.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to synchronizing generators to power systems, similar frequency-difference <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments</b> are used on multiengine ships and aircraft {{to allow the}} operators to exactly synchronize the speed of engines. This helps reduce the noise and vibration due to slight differences, for example, in the speeds of two propellers on an aircraft. In this application a synchroscope responds to slight speed differences {{that would not be}} visible on an engine tachometer.|$|R

This second version was a remote maritime compass device, consisting of ampermeters as the <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments</b> located {{in different parts of the}} ship, resistant to magnetic forces or magnetic masses in their vicinity.|$|R
50|$|Model {{circuits}} were energized {{at relatively}} low voltages {{to allow for}} safe measurement with adequate precision. The model base quantities varied by manufacturer and date of design; as amplified <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments</b> became more common, lower base quantities were feasible. Model voltages and currents started off around 200 volts and 0.5 amperes in the MIT analyzer, which still allowed directly driven (but especially sensitive) instruments {{to be used to}} measure model parameters. The later machines used as little as 50 volts and 50 mA, used with amplified <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments.</b> By use of the per-unit system, model quantities could be readily transformed into the actual system quantities of voltage, current, power or impedance. A watt measured in the model might correspond to hundreds of kilowatts or megawatts in the modeled system. One hundred volts measured on the model might correspond to one per-unit, which could represent, say, 230,000 volts on a transmission line or 11,000 volts in a distribution system. Typically, results accurate to around 2% of measurement could be obtained. Model components were single-phase devices, but using the symmetrical components method, unbalanced three-phase systems could be studied as well.|$|R
40|$|Although {{fluxgate}} magnetometers {{have been}} in use for many years, {{and a number of}} theoretical studies of these sensors are available, very little information has been published on the engineering choices relating to the detailed design of magnetometers intended for navigational applications in aircraft and other vehicles. This paper addresses some of the problems encountered {{in the design of the}} sensing head, the choice of operating mode, and the design of the supporting electronics for a simple low-cost magnetometer system which will produce a digital readout of the magnetic heading of the vehicle in which it is mounted. A major goal of this study has been to develop a design which minimizes circuit complexity, is easy to fabricate and calibrate, and utilizes a minimum of specialized components. Such a magnetometer system is intended either as a stand-alone <b>indicating</b> <b>instrument</b> or as a source of magnetic heading information for a more sophisticated navigational system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{utilization of}} electricity in electrical and electronics workshop {{as perceived by}} undergraduate students in Nigeria. Electrical and electronics are practical and activity oriented subjects that require electricity to function effectively in the workshop and laboratories. It {{is because of the}} practical oriented activities that the subject requires electricity supply in electric lamps, motors, wiring and connection of equipment, tools, soldering, <b>indicating</b> <b>instrument</b> and measurement of quantities and resistors and capacitor testing. The other areas in the workshop that require electricity supply are electronic components and devices, rectification circuits, network, radio, television, modulation and maintenance of equipment, gadgets, and the operation of safety equipment in the workshop. Despite the importance of electricity supply for the operation of these workshop equipment in Nigeria, it appears that electricity supply remain a mirage in our school workshop due epileptic power supply in Nigeria. Based on the discussion and implications, the following recommendations were preferred as a way forward: the power sector in Nigeria should be given urgent attention to increase and improve electricity supply by the government to improve on the use of equipment and electrical/electronic tools in Nigeria among others...|$|E
40|$|Microseismic {{monitoring}} {{has gained}} importance ever since a correlation was established between earthquakes and intensive mining operations at various mine sites across the world. A microseismic network {{is in place}} at the Cory, Saskatchewan, mine site to record vibrations from minor tremors and to analyse the data to locate zones of impending faults. Precise fault location demands greater accuracy and resolution of recorded data - both of which depend on transducer characteristics. Different transducers can be designed depending on the parameters (displacement, velocity or acceleration) that they sense, the sensing element used and the placement of the sensing element in the transducer. Currently, mass spring transducers that sense velocity are the most common transducers. It is anticipated that, in future, new transducers will be developed for microseismic monitoring applications. Before deploying these sensors in microseismic networks, it is important to test them and validate their performance. The primary focus of this research was to develop a portable wideband data acquisition system {{that can be used to}} acquire data from newly developed transducers and compare the recorded waveforms with that obtained from transducers already in use. The data acquistion system developed in this research has an antialiasing filter with a cut-off frequency at 2485 Hz. The AID converter has a default sampling 2500 samples per second. The developed wideband data acquisition system can be assembled and carried in a case and installed at site. The system can be remotely accessed and configured and allows for easy offloading of data to a soft media for futher analysis with other software packages. This system is not Intended for online analysis but only to acquire data and process it into a form readily readable by other analysis packages. The developed system was used to acquire test data using a geophone and a piezoelectric accelerometer developed by Dr. Brian Daku. The transducer output was read simultaneoulsy from the data acquisition system and an <b>indicating</b> <b>instrument.</b> The response curves show a close match between. these values over the selected frequency range, thus establishing software integrity. This thesis describes the design procedure and features of the portable wideband microseismic data acquisition system, the experimental setup and benchmarks tests conducted and an intepretation of the results obtained...|$|E

50|$|To {{reduce the}} size of the model components, the network {{analyzer}} often was energized at a higher frequency than the 50 Hz or 60 Hz utility frequency. The operating frequency was chosen to be high enough to allow high-quality inductors and capacitors to be made, and to be compatible with the available <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments,</b> but not so high that stray capacitance would affect results. Many systems used either 440 Hz, or 480 Hz, provided by a motor-generator set, to reduce size of model components. Some systems used 10 kHz, using capacitors and inductors similar to those used in radio electronics.|$|R

50|$|Laboratory {{investigations}} of the stability of multiple-machine systems were constrained {{by the use of}} direct-operated <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments</b> (voltmeters, ammeters, and wattmeters). To ensure that the instruments negligibly loaded the model system, the machine power level used was substantial. Some workers in the 1920s used three-phase model generators rated up to 600 kVA and 2300 volts to represent a power system. General Electric developed model systems using generators rated at 3.75 kVA. It was difficult to keep multiple generators in synchronism, and the size and cost of the units was a constraint. While transmission lines and loads could be accurately scaled down to laboratory representations, rotating machines could not be accurately miniaturized and keep the same dynamic characteristics as full-sized prototypes; the ratio of machine inertia to machine frictional loss did not scale.|$|R
