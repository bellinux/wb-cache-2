60|$|Bert was {{trembling}} violently. <b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> hoarsely.|$|E
60|$|THE old man showed {{pleasure}} in being thus called upon. <b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> and began.|$|E
60|$|M. de Cussy {{started out}} of his gloomy abstraction. <b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> He was {{extremely}} nervous.|$|E
6000|$|DOLPHIN. Like this (<b>he</b> <b>clears</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat).</b> [...] "Casbeen has been, and Moghreb is no more." [...] Ah, the transience of all sublunary things! But {{inspiration}} {{has stopped}} short there.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{very welcome}} invasion, ma'am," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> and pulling at his high collar. [...] "Try this garden chair. What is there that I can do for you? Shall I ring and let Mrs. Denver {{know that you are}} here?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> coughed, <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> in a {{way that}} betrayed he had been drinking.|$|R
6000|$|Then up and {{answered}} WILLIAM LEE (The kindly captain's coxswain he, A nervous, shy, low-spoken man), <b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> and thus began: ...|$|E
6000|$|Billy pondered {{this for}} a quarter of a mile, but could come to no conclusion. At last <b>he</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> and remarked: ...|$|E
60|$|During this announcement, {{which had}} been made with an ominous calmness, Mr. Simpson had gazed {{steadily}} at the brass andirons. <b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now {{how could}} Grandfather Frog resist that? He couldn't. He didn't even try to. <b>He</b> just <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> {{once or twice}} and began.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> paused, <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> and coughed once or twice, evoking in Denis's {{mind the}} vision of a table with a glass and water-bottle, and, lying across one corner, a long white pointer for the lantern pictures.|$|R
6000|$|Here {{the harsh}} voice of Donne broke {{in on the}} mild tones of Mr. Hall. [...] "Ahem!" [...] <b>he</b> began, <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> evidently for a speech of some importance--"ahem! Miss Keeldar, your {{attention}} an instant, if you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then up and {{answered}} William Lee, [...] (The kindly captain's coxswain he, [...] A nervous, shy, low-spoken man) [...] <b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> and thus began: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> {{put on his}} spectacles, and {{emitted a}} long, flat {{preliminary}} note, rather {{like the sound of}} a child's trumpet. [...] "Er--'Dear Sir!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{could not}} find his voice quite as {{promptly}} as before. <b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> before he asked: [...] "Has Mr. Westover been saying anything about me?" ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>he</b> only <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> {{and looked}} at his letter again, while she fixed her eager eyes upon him so earnestly that he let his fall again, and looked once more over his letters before he spoke again.|$|R
6000|$|While Raymie blushed and admitted, [...] "Oh, {{they don't}} {{want to hear}} me," [...] <b>he</b> was <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> pulling <b>his</b> clean {{handkerchief}} farther out of his breast pocket, and thrusting his fingers between the buttons of his vest.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so, too," [...] <b>he</b> said hoarsely, <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> {{and after}} a meditative moment {{proceeded}} sacramentally with his wood-carving.|$|R
60|$|A {{matter that}} had been in his mind during his last waking moments at Boscastle recurred, a thing {{resolved}} upon and somehow neglected. <b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> and spoke, {{addressing}} {{the young man}} who sat {{on the corner of the}} horse-hair sofa, where the shadows of the room were darkest.|$|E
6000|$|Blacky {{waited until}} {{he was sure that}} no one else was coming. Then <b>he</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> very loudly and began to speak. [...] "Friends," [...] said he.|$|E
6000|$|... "We had {{to submit}} to a damnable outrage," [...] added Lawson, passionately, as if {{the sound of his}} voice {{augmented}} his feeling. [...] "Listen, girls; I'll tell you-all about it." [...] <b>He</b> coughed, <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> in a way that betrayed he had been drinking.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know," [...] he began, and <b>he</b> {{tried to}} <b>clear</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> <b>His</b> voice was husky and strangulated with excitement. He tried again: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I d'know," [...] <b>he</b> began, after <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> with a {{conscious}} air, [...] "as you know we'd {{got a new}} minister to our church." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> however, and {{squeezing}} her arm gently, began: [...] "Gratian's told me, Nollie. The {{great thing}} is to keep your spirit up, and not worry." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Corporal {{looked up}} shyly. <b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> [...] "Sir, I am a plant, I don't just think so. I've been a plant for several days, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That proves it," [...] said Byfield. [...] "Go away; or {{at least}} keep quiet. I'm {{going to make a}} speech." [...] <b>He</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> [...] "Ladies and gentlemen----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ahem!" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> [...] "I am much obliged by your {{kindness}} (`Don't mention it, sir,' {{from the}} captain), and should prefer, if possible, to reach Hong-Kong and ship thence for England. You see, I have some business friends there, and as I {{shall have to}} replenish my purse before--" ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{the curtain}} rises, CHRIS and ANNA are discovered. ANNA is {{seated in the}} rocking-chair by the table, with a {{newspaper}} in her hands. She is not reading but staring straight in front of her. She looks unhappy, troubled, frowningly concentrated on her thoughts. CHRIS wanders about the room, casting quick, uneasy side glances at her face, then stopping to peer absentmindedly out of the window. His attitude betrays an overwhelming, gloomy anxiety which has him on tenter hooks. He pretends {{to be engaged in}} setting things ship-shape, but this occupation is confined to picking up some object, staring at it stupidly for a second, then aimlessly putting it down again. <b>He</b> <b>clears</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> and starts to sing to himself in a low, doleful voice: [...] "My Yosephine, come aboard de ship. Long time Ay wait for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> {{tried to}} <b>clear</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> to speak, but it {{required}} {{more than one}} effort to bring the words. [...] "I guess you better go along with me up to Boston. I'm going up {{the first of the}} week." ...|$|R
60|$|Almayer {{was not to}} be cheered up; for all answer <b>he</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> {{and looked}} down again at his feet. I tried to close with him on another tack.|$|E
6000|$|They {{looked at}} Chum Frink, the {{recognized}} lord of language. Frink pulled at his eye-glass cord as at a bell-rope, <b>he</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> {{and said that}} which was the custom: ...|$|E
6000|$|The baggage-camel {{had been}} bobbing {{his head to}} and fro for some time past, anxious to {{get a word in}} edgewise. Then I heard him say, as <b>he</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> nervously: ...|$|E
60|$|Fid was {{far from}} {{discovering}} the smallest reluctance to enter on the required detail; and, by the time <b>he</b> had <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> freshened <b>his</b> supply of the weed, and otherwise disposed himself to proceed Mrs Wyllys had so far conquered her reluctance to pry clandestinely into the secrets of others, as to yield to a curiosity which she found unconquerable and to take the seat to which her companion invited her by a gesture of his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{that were}} a scaffold, and a rope were around my neck, I'd say it over again. And I thank God I've {{had a chance to}} say it to you." [...] <b>He</b> paused, <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> and {{continued}} in a voice that all at once had become unemotional and natural. [...] "I've three tin boxes of the private papers you wanted. I didn't think of 'em to-day, but I'll bring 'em up to you myself on Thursday." ...|$|R
6000|$|They sat {{for perhaps}} two minutes, {{and when he}} spoke again his voice was hoarse. He reverted to a former formula. [...] "Look here," [...] <b>he</b> said, and <b>cleared</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> [...] "I don't know whether you think I'm going to stand this, but I'm not." ...|$|R
