2500|$|The primary {{mechanism}} of action of progestogen-only emergency contraceptive pills is to prevent fertilization by inhibition of ovulation.LevonorgestrelMechanism and efficacy There is strong evidence that treatment with emergency contraception acts primarily by preventing or delaying ovulation and by preventing fertilization.22–26 Studies have indicated that emergency contraception does not prevent implantation.27–29 Experiments in monkeys and rats could detect no effect of a high dose of levonorgesterel administered postcoitally once fertilization had occurred.30,31 The evidence indicates that a postfertilization effect does {{not contribute to the}} efficacy of emergency contraception.25,30–33 Clinicians, pharmacists, and patients can be reassured that treatment with emergency contraception is not an abortifacient.p. 157:The use of progesterone receptor modulators for emergency contraception Mifepristone. In randomized trials, 10 mg mifepristone was as effective as 25, 50, or 600 mg. preventing about 80-85% of expected pregnancies (the same efficacy and side effects as with the levonorgestrel method), with a slight decrease in efficacy when treatment was delayed to 5 days after intercourse.16,52–54Ulipristal Acetate. Ulipristal acetate (ellaOne) has similar biologic effects as mifepristone and is approved for emergency contraception in Europe and is expected to become available in the U.S.in a single oral dose of 30 mg. Randomized trials demonstrated that ulipristal acetate is slightly more effective than the single 1.5 mg dose of levonorgestrel when used within 72 h after sexual intercourse and even between 72 h and 120h.55,56 … Progesterone receptor modulators like ulipristal acetate and mifepristone suppress ovarian follicular growth and also delay endometrial maturation, manifested in a delay in menstruation after treatment. Ovulation can be temporarily postponed.Other methodsAnother method of emergency contraception is the insertion of a copper IUD, anytime during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle and up to 5 days after ovulation. The failure rate (in a small number of studies) is very low, 0.1%.34,35 This method definitely prevents implantation, but it is not suitable for women who are not candidates for intrauterine contraception, e.g., multiple sexual partners or a rape victim. The use of a copper IUD for emergency contraception is expensive, but not if it is retained as an ongoing method of contraception.It is believed that the main {{mechanism of}} action of high-dose progestin emergency contraception is inhibition of ovulation, but other mechanisms may be involved... Taken together, these data are highly supportive of the concept that levonorgestrel emergency contraception has little or no effect on postovulation events but is highly effective when taken before ovulation. Levonorgestrel emergency contraception does not affect implantation and is not abortifacient.Intrauterine insertion of a copper IUD within 5 to 10 days of midcycle coitus is a very effective method of preventing continuation of the pregnancy… The LNG-IUS should not be used for emergency contraception.A study by the WHO reported that use of a single tablet of 10 mg of mifepristone was an effective emergency contraceptive with a pregnancy rate of 1.2%.Ulipristal, also known as CDB-2914, has been studied as an emergency contraceptive pill… In 2009, European regulatory approval was granted for a 30-mg tablet of ulipristal (under the brand name of EllaOne) as an <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill</b> for use up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. An application for approval in the United States is under review. The best available evidence is {{that they do not have}} any post-fertilization effects such as the prevention of implantation. The U.S. FDA-approved labels and European EMA-approved labels (except for HRA Pharma's NorLevo) levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills (based on labels for regular oral contraceptive pills) say they may cause endometrial changes that discourage implantation. Daily use of regular oral contraceptive pills can alter the endometrium (although this has not been proven to interfere with implantation), but the isolated use of a levonorgestrel <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill</b> does not have time to alter the endometrium. In March 2011, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) issued a statement that: [...] "review of the evidence suggests that LNG [...] ECPs cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg.

Language on implantation should not be included in LNG ECP product labeling.• The fact that LNG ECPs have no demonstrated effect on implantation explains why they are not 100% effective in preventing pregnancy, and are less effective the later they are taken. Women should be given a clear message that LNG ECPs are more effective the sooner they are taken.• LNG ECPs do not interrupt a pregnancy (by any definition of the beginning of pregnancy). However, LNG ECPs can prevent abortions by reducing unwanted pregnancies. In June 2012, a New York Times editorial called on the FDA to remove from the label the unsupported suggestion that levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills inhibit implantation. In November 2013, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a change to the label for HRA Pharma's NorLevo saying it cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Unsafe {{abortion}} {{is a major}} public health problem in low-and-middle income countries. Young and unmarried women constitute a high risk group for unsafe abortions. It {{has been estimated that}} widespread use of emergency contraception may significantly reduce the number of abortion-related morbidity and mortality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and experiences on <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> by the university students in Cameroon in order to develop and refine a national health programme for reducing unwanted pregnancies and their associated morbidity and mortality. Methods A convenient sample of 700 students of the University of Buea (Cameroon) was selected for the study. Data was collected by a self-administered, anonymous and pre-tested questionnaire. Results The response rate was 94. 9 % (664 / 700). General level of awareness of <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> was 63. 0 % (418 / 664). However, knowledge of the general features of <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> was low and misinformation was high among these students. Knowledge differed according to the source of information: informal source was associated with misinformation, while medical and informational sources were associated with better knowledge. Although the students generally had positive attitudes regarding <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills,</b> up to 65. 0 % (465 / 664) believed that <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> were unsafe. Those with adequate knowledge generally showed favourable attitudes with regards to <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> (Mann-Whitney U = 2592. 5, p = 0. 000). Forty-nine students (7. 4 %) had used <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> themselves or had a partner who had used them. Conclusion Awareness of emergency contraception pills by Cameroonian students is low and the method is still underused. Strategies to promote use of emergency contraception should be focused on spreading accurate information through medical and informational sources, which have been found to be reliable and associated with good knowledge on <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Unsafe {{abortion}} {{is a major}} Public health problem in developing countries, where women make several unsafe attempts at termination of the unintended pregnancy before turning to health services. Community health workers {{can act as a}} bridge between the community and their health facilities and can use <b>Emergency</b> <b>Contraceptive</b> <b>Pills</b> to significantly reduce the mortality and morbidity related to unsafe abortions. Aims: This study explores the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the Lady Health Supervisor of the National Program for Family Planning, district Rawalpindi, regarding emergency contraception pills. Materials and Methods: The cross sectional survey was conducted during the monthly meeting of Lady Health Supervisors. Self administered, anonymous and voluntary questionnaire consisting of 17 items, regarding demographic profile, awareness, knowledge, attitudes and practices, was used. Results: Insufficient knowledge, high misinformation and strongly negative attitudes were revealed. More than half did not know that <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> do not cause abortion. About four fifths believed that <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> will lead to ‘evil’ practices in society.

RESULTS: Participants were predominately white, college- educated, urban residents. Women most frequently cited structural barriers to obtaining <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills,</b> such as inconvenient office hours. Although women supported advanced prescription of <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills,</b> there was less enthusiasm for nonprescription access because of concerns that others (but not they) would engage in risky sexual behavior.

40|$|Emergency {{contraception}} is {{an effective}} backup for contraceptive failure. In Hong Kong, levonorgestrel <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill</b> is a prescription drug. In most developed countries, it is provided in advance or over-the-counter to eliminate the barrier to access. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of these novel delivery modes in Hong Kong. Four studies were conducted to study pertinent subject matters. A retrospective review on 11014 clinical records of The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong on emergency contraception prescription between 2006 and 2008 was performed to delineate the characteristics of emergency contraceptive users. One-year follow-up data was available in 4728 records, with 89. 4 % used emergency contraception once and 8. 5 % used it twice. The proportion of subjects not using ongoing contraceptives reduced from 20. 6 % at the emergency contraception visit to 4. 5 % at post-treatment follow-up, 3. 9 % at 6 th month and 3. 3 % at 12 th month. Young age {{was not associated with}} not using ongoing contraceptives and repeat use of emergency contraceptives. A randomized controlled trial with 1030 women was conducted to compare the behavior of those given three courses of levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills in advance against those who had to get them from clinics when needed. After one year, 29. 9 % of women in the advanced provision group had used the pills versus 12. 9 % in the control group (odds ratio 2. 87, 95 % confidence interval 2. 07 - 3. 97). The advanced provision group used three times more pills than the control group (278 versus 95 courses, p< 0. 001). The median coitus-treatment interval in the advanced provision group was significantly shorter than the control group (11 h versus 20 h; p< 0. 001). Most women used condoms before (90 %) and during (89 %) the study. In both groups, consistency of use was higher after emergency contraception (65 %) than before (60 %) (p< 0. 001). This study confirmed that advanced provision increased the utilization of <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill,</b> facilitated its early use and did not hamper ongoing contraceptive use. A questionnaire survey was conducted to evaluate the acceptability of novel use of <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill</b> among women practicing contraception. Of the 1405 questionnaires analyzed, 46. 3 % of women supported more advertising on emergency contraception; 48. 7 % supported advanced provision of <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill</b> and 25. 7 % supported over-the-counter provision. Another questionnaire survey assessed the attitude of physicians who provide family planning services. Half (54. 2 %) of them supported advanced provision of emergency contraceptive pill; 32. 5 % supported advanced provision to girls aged 16 and below and 40. 2 % supported over-thecounter provision. Among 352 physicians who provided emergency contraception, only 21. 7 % of private family physicians and 15. 9 % of private obstetrician-gynaecologists prescribed emergency contraceptive pills in advance. In conclusion, local women used emergency contraception responsibly and remained vigilant with ongoing contraception even when they got pills in advance. Minority of physicians practice advanced provision. The acceptance of advanced provision, among women and physicians who do not know much about it, is around 50 %. It is thus possible to improve when more education on advanced provision is provided. The support for over-the-counter provision was too weak to boost. published_or_final_versionMedicineMasterDoctor of Medicin...|$|E

The study will provide insight into the reasons for contraceptive „failure‟ or non-use. Methods This is a cross sectional questionnaire survey. Subjects for the study were recruited from clients requesting TOP at the Gynaecology clinic (ward 54), CHBH. They included women between 13 to 49 years, who were referred from their local clinic or General practitioner with a positive pregnancy test or a pregnancy confirmed on sonar, and were less than 20 weeks pregnant. Consenting women completed a self-administered questionnaire which assessed their demographic details, current contraceptive use, past contraceptive experience, future contraceptive plans, knowledge of <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill,</b> and the current status of the relationship, initial intention with regard to the pregnancy, and the number of sexual partners they had in the last year.

In both countries, arguments in support of expanding access to the pills were shaped by two competing orientations toward health and sexuality. The first, "harm reduction," promotes emergency contraception as attenuating the public health risks entailed in sex. The second orientation regards access to pills as a question of women's right to engage in nonprocreative sex and to choose from among all reproductive health-care options. The authors contend that arguments for expanding access to <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> that frame issues in terms of health and science are insufficient bases for drug regulation; ultimately, women's health is also a matter of women's rights. 15 page(s...|$|R
