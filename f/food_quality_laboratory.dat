MethodsA total of 110 samples of various dairy products such as raw milk, long life pasteurized milk, yoghurt and infant powdered milk formulas, raw rice, and feces were examined {{for the presence of}} B.  cereus by selective plating on mannitol-egg-yolk-polymyxin agar. Confirmation of B.  cereus was carried out by biochemical tests and PCR. Identification of non-B.  cereus isolates was carried out by 16 S rDNA sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility was done by disk diffusion method. ResultsOverall 35 samples (31. 8 %, n =  110) yielded Bacillus-like growth. Of which 19 samples (54. 28 %) were positive for B.  cereus. All isolates were positive for enterotoxin production. No psychrotolerant B.  cereus strains were detected in all samples. All B.  cereus isolates were resistant to penicillin G, but susceptible to vancomycin, erythromycin and clindamycin. ConclusionsThe results of this study confirm the importance of including B.  cereus in disease control and prevention programs, as well as in routine clinical and <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> control <b>laboratories</b> in both Saudi Arabia and Egypt...|$|R

In the present study, a total of 200 random beef product samples were collected from different supermarkets located at Menofia and Cairo governorates were examined for the presence of B. cereus. In addition, the presence of some virulence encoding genes was evaluated using Multiplex PCR. Finally, the antibiogram testing was conveyed to illustrate the resistance pattern of the confirmed B. cereus. The data showed that B. cereus was recovered from 22. 5 %, 30 %, 25 %, 37. 5 % and 15 % of the minced meat, burger, sausage, kofta, and luncheon respectively.

Rapid qPCR methods {{have the benefit of}} being faster than conventional methods and provide a means to more accurately protect public health. However, many scientists and technicians in water and <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> microbiology <b>laboratories</b> have limited experience using these molecular tests. To ensure that practitioners can use and implement qPCR techniques successfully, we developed a week long workshop to provide hands-on training and exposure to rapid molecular methods for water quality management. This workshop trained academic professors, government employees, private industry representatives, and graduate students in rapid qPCR methods for monitoring recreational water quality. Attendees were immersed in these new methods with hands-on laboratory sessions, lectures, and one-on-one training. Upon completion, the attendees gained sufficient knowledge and practice to teach and share these new molecular techniques with colleagues at their respective laboratories. Key findings from this workshop demonstrated: 1) participants with no prior experience could be effectively trained to conduct highly repeatable qPCR analysis in one week; 2) participants with different desirable outcomes required exposure to a range of different platforms and sample processing approaches; and 3) the collaborative interaction amongst newly trained practitioners, workshop leaders, and members of the water quality community helped foster a cohesive cohort of individuals which can advocate powerful cohort for proper implementation of molecular methods...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Annually, many {{reports of}} {{occurrence}} of food poisoning {{due to the}} consumption of sea-foods contaminated with Vibrio species have been published. The present study was carried out to study the prevalence rate of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and V. cholera and evaluation of presence of virulence genes of V. parahaemolyticus in sea-food products caught from Persian Gulf. Materials and Methods: In total, 200 samples of fish, lobster and crab caught from Persian Gulf collected {{in the summer of}} 2013 and were transferred to the <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> control <b>laboratory</b> of the Islamic Azad University of Shahrekord. Samples were cultured and the positive specimens were evaluated for presence of bacterial species and virulence genes using Polymerase Chain Reaction. Results: In total, 34. 5 % of samples were contaminated with Vibrio species. Frequency of V. cholera and V. parahaemolyticus were 5 % and 21 %, respectively. 8. 5 percent of samples were contaminated with other species of Vibrio. From a total of 42 positive samples of V. parahaemolyticus, frequency of tdh, tlh and trh virulence genes were 45. 93 %, 40. 47 % and 16. 46 %, respectively. Conclusions: The sea-food products of Persian Gulf were infected with V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholera. Fish samples had the highest prevalence of V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholera.

40|$|Unknown substances, not {{previously}} observed, are frequently detected in <b>foods</b> by <b>quality</b> control <b>laboratories.</b> In many cases, {{the assessment of}} these 'new' substances requires additional chemical analysis for their identification prior to assessing risk. This identification procedure can be time-consuming, expensive {{and in some instances}} difficult. Furthermore, in many cases, no toxicological information will be available for the substance. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop pragmatic tools for the assessment of the potential toxicity of substances with unknown identity to avoid delays in their risk assessment. Hence, the 'ILSI Europe expert group on the application of the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) to unexpected peaks found in food' was established to explore whether the TTC concept may enable a more pragmatic risk assessment of unknown substances that were {{not previously}} detected in food. A step-wise approach is introduced that uses expert judgement on the source of the food, information on the analytical techniques, the dietary consumption of food sources containing the unknown substance and quantitative information of the unknown substance to assess the safety to the consumer using the TTC. By following this step-wise approach, it may be possible to apply a TTC threshold of 90. µg/day for an unknown substance in food. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

This book describes quality assurance systems currently in use, ranging from international QA-systems like GMP, HACCP, ISO and BRC. Furthermore, policy and business strategy principles are discussed in the framework of <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> management and the concept of TQM receives special attention.

40|$|Purpose - The {{research}} {{presented here}} aims to gain understanding of consumers¿ {{perceptions of the}} concepts of <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> and safety, two concepts that {{play an important role}} in how consumers perceive food, and that are used in decision making. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative semi-structured interviews (n = 163 consumers) were held in four European countries (Germany, France, Italy and Spain). Consumers' own definitions of the two concepts of <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> and safety were examined, together with the perceived interrelationship between quality and safety, and whether these concepts were linked to improved food chain traceability. Findings - The results indicate that most consumers see <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>food</b> safety as interlinked concepts, which becomes evident in their partly overlapping definitions of the two concepts. Consumers believe both <b>food</b> safety and <b>quality</b> are important to food in general, but pay relatively more attention to <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> when purchasing a product. Traceability was linked not only to food safety, but also to <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> in the mind of the consumer. Research limitations/implications - Future research on consumer perceptions of <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> and safety will need to take account of the observation that these concepts are strongly related in consumers¿ minds, and therefore cannot be easily separated in explaining consumer choices. Originality/value - Instead of investigating consumer perceptions of <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> and safety in relation to specific products, consumer perceptions of <b>food</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>food</b> safety in general, and how these were related to each other, were studied. Further understanding was gained of how consumers might use these concepts in judgements about food, which, in turn may influence their purchase decision...|$|R
