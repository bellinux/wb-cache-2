5|$|Aristotle {{stated in}} the History of Animals that all beings were {{arranged}} in a fixed scale of perfection, reflected <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form</b> (eidos). They stretched from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the scala naturae or great chain of being. His system had eleven grades, arranged according to the potentiality of each being, expressed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form</b> at birth. The highest animals gave birth to warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. The system was based on Aristotle's interpretation of the four elements in his On Generation and Corruption: Fire (hot and dry); Air (hot and wet); Water (cold and wet); and Earth (cold and dry). These are arranged from the most energetic to the least, so the warm, wet young raised in a womb with a placenta were higher on the scale than the cold, dry, nearly mineral eggs of birds. However, Aristotle is careful never to insist that a group fits perfectly in the scale; he knows animals have many combinations of attributes, and that placements are approximate.|$|E

Distinctly patterned tufts of hair grow from the lion's ears {{and on their}} shoulders, emanating from a central disk-shaped whorl. They lie prone, their heads are sculpted with attention to detail, but {{with a degree of}} artistic liberty <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form,</b> e.g., regarding their rounded shapes. Both lions look towards the viewer, and both have their mouths closed.|$|E

25|$|The {{peninsula}} {{was formed}} {{at the same}} time as the hills that face it across the harbour, as part of a large, long-extinct, volcano. Several of the peninsula's peaks, notably the aptly named Harbour Cone, clearly show these volcanic origins <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form.</b> These rocks were built up between 13 and 10million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Raj Bisaria {{started his}} venture in English {{language}} with Shakespeare’s Othello in 1966, Christopher Fry's poetic play A Phoenix too Frequent and Eugène Ionesco’s absurd play The Lesson in 1967. The selection {{of these two}} plays; diametrically opposite <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form</b> and content, in a single show was an experiment by Raj Bisaria. It was a box office failure.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} overlaps to {{some degree}} with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying, but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form</b> and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.|$|E

25|$|The general {{structure}} of teeth is similar across the vertebrates, {{although there is}} considerable variation <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form</b> and position. The teeth of mammals have deep roots, and this pattern {{is also found in}} some fish, and in crocodilians. In most teleost fish, however, the teeth are attached to the outer surface of the bone, while in lizards they are attached to the inner surface of the jaw by one side. In cartilaginous fish, such as sharks, the teeth are attached by tough ligaments to the hoops of cartilage that form the jaw.|$|E
25|$|The {{school day}} begins at 8:45 am, when pupils {{must be in}} Registration <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>Form</b> Tutor Groups to be {{registered}} {{at the beginning of}} each day. In each year there are around 7 or 8 such classes, each of about 17–25 pupils. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays pupils attend Morning Assembly from 9:00 am to 9:15 am. This consists of an academic parade, a hymn, a bible reading and a prayer, followed by announcements about the forthcoming days. On Tuesdays and Thursdays there is an extended registration and lessons begin at around 9:05 am this means Period 1 and 2 end at 9:10 on these days.|$|E
25|$|State level laws vary {{significantly}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form,</b> content, {{and level}} of restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects {{the right to keep}} and bear arms. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of the Second Amendment {{to keep and bear arms}} for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.|$|E

They didn't progress beyond {{the first round of the}} 2007 ACC Twenty20 Cup, beating only Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia, but captain Chaminda Ruwan did make the highest score of the tournament. In the World Cricket League Division Five tournament in Jersey, Singapore finished fifth after beating Botswana in a play-off, though they did beat Afghanistan during the first round, who went on to win the tournament.|$|E
25|$|All rattlesnakes are carnivorous, {{their primary}} food sources being rodents, other small mammals, birds, and small reptiles. The {{behavior}} of northern black-tailed rattlesnakes varies {{over the course}} of a year. In the spring and fall, they are primarily diurnal. In the summer, they shift to a nocturnal behavior, to avoid the heat of summer. In the winter, they hibernate in dens created and abandoned by other animals, often with other species of snakes. They are variable <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form</b> of locomotion depending on what substrate they need to traverse and will actively change between sidewinding or rectilinear movement. Although it is an able climber and expert swimmer, C. molossus is primarily a terrestrial species and inhabits grasslands, desert areas, and rocky and mountainous areas, as well as high-altitude forested habitats.|$|E
500|$|For three years, from 1787 to 1790, Dissenters {{had been}} {{attempting}} to convince Parliament {{to repeal the}} Test and Corporation Acts which limited {{the civil rights of}} Dissenters. After the repeal was voted down for the third time, Barbauld burst onto the public stage after [...] "nine years of silence." [...] Her highly charged pamphlet is written in a biting and sarcastic tone; it opens, [...] "we thank you for the compliment paid the Dissenters, when you suppose that the moment they are eligible to places of power and profit, all such places will at once be filled with them." [...] She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: [...] "We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects." [...] Moreover, she contends that it is precisely the isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out, not anything inherent <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form</b> of worship. Finally, appealing to British patriotism, she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip the English in liberty.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the field}} of legal interpretation, Joshua was of {{considerable}} importance, his decisions being generally declared valid even when disputed by his contemporaries Rabbi Johanan and Resh Lakish. He was lenient, especially in cases where cleanliness and the preservation of health were involved. (Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 121b; Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 44d.) Joshua devoted himself to the elucidation of the Mishnah. [...] And his own legal interpretations resemble <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form</b> and brevity {{the writings of the}} Tannaim in the Mishnah.|$|E
2500|$|Plants exhibit natural {{variation}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form</b> and structure. [...] While all organisms {{vary from}} individual to individual, plants exhibit an additional type of variation. [...] Within a single individual, parts are repeated which may differ {{in form and}} structure from other similar parts. [...] This variation is most easily seen in the leaves of a plant, though other organs such as stems and flowers may show similar variation. [...] There are three primary causes of this variation: positional effects, environmental effects, and juvenility.|$|E

The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. For Charles Singer, [...] "Nothing is more remarkable than [...] efforts to [...] the relationships of living things as a scala naturae".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to towns, every New England state has incorporated cities. However, cities are {{treated in the}} same manner as towns under state law, differing from towns only <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form</b> of government. Most cities are former towns that changed to a city form of government because they grew too large to be administered by a town meeting. However, even that distinction has become somewhat blurred in recent years. Cities are typically governed by a mayor (and/or city manager) and city council or other similar arrangement. In common speech, people often generically refer to communities of either type as [...] "towns", drawing no distinction between the two.|$|E
2500|$|Use of {{the term}} [...] "shanty," [...] once this {{paradigm}} for singing had become a comprehensive practice for most tasks, incorporated all manner of shipboard work songs under its definition, regardless of style and origin. Yet, shanties were of several types, and not all had necessarily developed at the same time. [...] "Capstan shanties" [...] (see below), {{some of which may}} have developed out of the earlier capstan songs discussed above, are quite variable <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>form</b> and origins. On the other hand, the repertoire of the so-called [...] "halyard shanties" [...] coheres into a consistent form. The distinctive [...] "double-pull" [...] format that typifies most of these songs—also at times [...] used, with slight changes, for pumps, windlass, and capstan, too—was a later development that appears to owe much to African-American work songs.|$|E
50|$|UV {{light is}} often used, since the common coenzymes NADH and NADPH absorb UV light <b>in</b> <b>their</b> reduced <b>forms,</b> {{but do not}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{oxidized}} <b>forms.</b> An oxidoreductase using NADH as a substrate could therefore be assayed by following the decrease in UV absorbance at a wavelength of 340 nm as it consumes the coenzyme.|$|R
