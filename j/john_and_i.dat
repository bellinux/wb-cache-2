[...] She was also pleased {{to be working with}} de Lancie again. [...] "I love the way they write for <b>John,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> loved the stuff we got to do together in 'Q-Less'", she said. Hetrick underwent ten hours of make-up for the sequence where Q shows Vash what could have happened if he did not save her life following an insect bite in the Gamma Quadrant. [...] The experience left her with a newfound appreciation for not having to wear prosthetics like other members of the cast.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{said about}} the line [...] "I'd love to turn you on", which concludes both verse sections: [...] "This was the time of Tim Leary's 'Turn on, tune in, drop out' and we wrote, 'I'd love to turn you on.' <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> gave each other a knowing look: 'Uh-huh, it's a drug song. You know that, don't you?'" [...] George Martin commented that he had always {{suspected}} that the line [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke" [...] was a drug reference, recalling how the Beatles would [...] "disappear and have a little puff", presumably of marijuana, but {{not in front of}} him. [...] "When [...] was doing his TV programme on Pepper", McCartney recalled later, [...] "he asked me, 'Do you know what caused Pepper?' I said, 'In one word, George, drugs. Pot.' And George said, 'No, no. But you weren't on it all the time.' 'Yes, we were.' Sgt. Pepper was a drug album." ...|$|E
500|$|McCartney became {{interested}} in painting after watching artist Willem de Kooning work in de Kooning's Long Island studio. McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in Siegen, Germany, in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, Andy Warhol and David Bowie. Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art. In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, England. In October 2000, McCartney's art debuted {{in his hometown of}} Liverpool. McCartney said, [...] "I've been offered an exhibition of my paintings at the Walker Art Gallery ... where <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> used to spend many a pleasant afternoon. So I'm really excited about it. I didn't tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now I'm out of the closet". McCartney is lead patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, a school in the building formerly occupied by the Liverpool Institute for Boys.|$|E

500|$|Soap Opera Digest {{noted the}} rarity of {{brothers}} like Edmund Grey and Dimitri Marick. In {{the soap opera}} genre, brothers with a standing rivalry {{as well as a}} strong fraternal bond are considered to be a rarity. Sisters on soap operas were usually the ones who shared [...] "men, makeup, and misery." [...] Dimitri and Edmund's relationship was scripted as complicated, transitioning between loving and antagonistic. Their relationship gained positive feedback from both viewers and the soap opera media. Soap Opera Digest named them Best Brothers of 1994, saying, [...] "In Michael Nader (Dimitri) and John Callahan (Edmund), AMC has charismatic performers with chemistry, and they're making the most of it." [...] Complications in the brothers' relationship included childhood jealousies, the revelation that they were brothers, Dimitri's one-night stand with Edmund's wife Maria and subsequent question of the paternity of Maddie Grey, and the Dimitri, Alex, and Edmund triangle. Along with the conflict, they displayed a loving relationship where they stood by each other. In describing the relationship, Nader said, [...] "The storyline with Edmund and Dimitri, the Marick brothers, there wasn't a brother duo on television that had the sort of power that <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could bring to that relationship." ...|$|E
500|$|Onstage tension {{began to}} grow between Kiedis and Frusciante. Kiedis {{recalled}} an argument after a show in New Orleans: [...] "We had a sold-out house and John just stood in the corner, barely playing his guitar. We came offstage and <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got into it." [...] With the Peppers now playing shows at arenas rather than theaters, the promoters of the tour decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act. Kiedis contacted Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, {{and asked him if}} Nirvana would replace Pearl Jam on the tour—an offer Grohl accepted. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan, however, refused to play with Nirvana as he once dated frontman Kurt Cobain's wife Courtney Love. The Pumpkins were, therefore, taken off the concert bill and replaced with Pearl Jam. Their first show with Nirvana was at the L.A Sports Arena. Kiedis considered their act to be [...] "raw energy; their musicality, their song selection, they were like a chain saw cutting through the night." [...] When the Red Hot Chili Peppers finished touring with Nirvana, they traveled to Europe, where Frusciante, in need of someone to connect to, brought along his girlfriend Toni Oswald. Kiedis said that [...] "John had broken our unwritten rule of no spouses or girlfriends on the road." [...] Briefly interrupting the European-tour, the Chili Peppers flew to New York City and performed on an episode of Saturday Night Live. The band played [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] as the second number; a performance that Kiedis felt was sabotaged by Frusciante: ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{her first}} release with Virgin, Jackson was asked by Jam and Lewis to record a song for the sound track to the feature film Mo' Money, {{released}} in 1992 by their label Perspective Records. Jon Bream of the Star Tribune reported: [...] "For most movie soundtracks, producers negotiate with record companies, managers and lawyers for the services of big-name singers. Like the Hollywood outsiders that they are, Edina-based Jam and Lewis went directly to such stars as Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson, Luther Vandross, Bell Biv Devoe, Color Me Badd and Johnny Gill." [...] Jackson, Jackson and Vandross recorded the duet or trio [...] "The Best Things in Life Are Free", which peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot R Singles chart. Shortly afterward, Jackson began filming for her first feature length role in John Singleton's Poetic Justice. Although she was encouraged by a major studio executive {{to take on a}} film in which she could portray a singer, she insisted on finding a different role. She explained: [...] "About that same time John Singleton asked me to read his new script. <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> became buddies—I loved Boyz N the Hood—so I thought he was just asking my advice. I was shocked and honored to learn the screenplay had been written with me in mind. 'Would you play Justice?' he wanted to know. Yes! I'd finally found a role—a dramatic nonsinging role—that was right." [...] Released in July 1993, Poetic Justice debuted at number one at the box office, grossing $11,728,455; it grossed a grand total of $27,515,786.|$|E

2500|$|However, Akkad {{rejected}} the Etchison script, calling it [...] "too cerebral" [...] and insisting that any new Halloween sequel must feature Myers as a {{flesh and blood}} killer. In an interview, Etchison explained how he received the phone call informing him of the rejection of his script. Etchison said, [...] "I {{received a call from}} Debra Hill and she said, 'Dennis, I just wanted you to know that <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have sold our interest in the title 'Halloween' and unfortunately, your script {{was not part of the}} deal." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the third}} track on the album, [...] "Baby's in Black" [...] conveys the same sad and resentful outlook {{of the two}} {{preceding}} songs. Music critic Richie Unterberger views it as [...] "a love lament for a grieving girl that was perhaps more morose than any previous Beatles song". It was the first song recorded for the album and features a two-part harmony sung by Lennon and McCartney. McCartney recalled: [...] "'Baby's in Black' we did because we liked waltz-time... And I think also <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to do something}} bluesy, a bit darker, more grown-up, rather than just straight pop." [...] Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn cites the band's dedication to achieving a discordant twanging sound for Harrison's lead guitar part, and Martin's objection to the song opening with this sound, {{as an example of the}} Beatles breaking free of their producer's control for the first time. To achieve the desired swelling effect, Lennon knelt on the studio floor and altered the volume control on Harrison's Gretsch as he played.|$|E
2500|$|Byrne joined Claremont {{beginning}} with The X-Men #108 (Dec. 1977). Their work together, along with inker Terry Austin, on such classic story arcs as [...] "Proteus", [...] "Dark Phoenix Saga", and [...] "Days of Future Past" [...] {{would make them}} both fan favorites. Byrne insisted that the title keep its Canadian character, Wolverine, and contributed a series of story elements to justify Wolverine's presence which eventually made the character {{among the most popular}} in Marvel's publishing history. With issue #114, Byrne began co-plotting the series as well as penciling. Claremont recounted that [...] "at that point in time <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were, in a very real sense, true collaborators on the book. It was with very few exceptions, difficult, for me, anyway, to tell in the actual gestation of the book where one of us left off and the other began - because it involved one of us coming up with an idea and bouncing it off the other ..." [...] The [...] "Dark Phoenix Saga" [...] in 1980 {{is one of the most}} notable stories in the title's history. Comics writers and historians Roy Thomas and Peter Sanderson observed that [...] "'The Dark Phoenix Saga' is to Claremont and Byrne what the 'Galactus Trilogy' is to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It is a landmark in Marvel history, showcasing its creators' work at the height of their abilities." [...] Byrne has repeatedly compared his working relationship with Claremont to Gilbert and Sullivan, and has said that they were [...] "almost constantly at war over who the characters were." [...] Byrne created the characters Alpha Flight, Proteus, and Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat during his run on The X-Men. A new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by Mystique, was introduced in the [...] "Days of Future Past" [...] storyline (#141-142, Jan.-Feb. 1981) in which a time-travelling Kitty Pryde tried to avert a dystopian future caused by the Brotherhood assassinating Presidential candidate Senator Robert Kelly. Byrne plotted the story wanting to depict the Sentinels as a genuine threat to the existence of the mutant race. Byrne left The X-Men with #143 (March 1981). During his tenure on the series, The X-Men was promoted from a bimonthly to a monthly publication schedule, with a steady sales incline that continued long after Byrne left.|$|E
