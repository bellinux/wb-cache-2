2500|$|The most remembered shot where Davis {{missed the}} fine {{cut into the}} corner pocket was {{unfortunately}} not discussed in detail. Davis states [...] "I was saying to myself, don't hit it thick" [...] and [...] "that's how you bottle it, by hitting it thick." [...] However he did not elaborate on whether {{he was forced to}} use side spin to avoid a possible in off foul stroke into the middle pocket (This would have cost him the match) or whether he played it with centre ball striking. He summarised: [...] "although I missed the black, it wasn't that shot which lost the match. There were other shots earlier in the frame." [...] In particular, Davis mentions how close he was to being able to pot a pink which he snookered himself on that changed the course of the match. David Vine closes the programme by asking both players their opinion regarding some voices claiming the match must have been fixed. This preposterous notion gives a fascinating insight into the prevailing naivety in some quarters with regard to Snooker in 1985, when it was still a comparatively young TV sport and reaching its zenith in popularity. Davis replies [...] "Well, its simple. They don't understand. If anyone ever {{came up to me and}} asked if the match was fixed, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> yeah it was, yeah. It's just not even worth arguing with people like that." [...] Davis allowed himself to joke about the defeat, making a joke about being asked by a petrol station attendant if he wanted glasses (free tumblers) and has now admitted that he will probably be remembered more for the final he did not win in 1985 than for the six he did. But barely months after the final he states [...] "although I lost the match, it was great to be involved in. To be involved in something like that." [...] The programme was later released on DVD as [...] "The Greatest Snooker Final Of All Time" [...] by Retro Videos.

[...] "The curious {{thing about it}} was that I never exactly knew {{the subject of his}} nightmare, and a more curious thing yet was Melford himself never knew it, when I woke him up. He said he couldn't make out anything but a kind of scraping in a door-lock. His theory was that in his childhood it had been a much completer thing, but that the circumstances had broken down in a sort of decadence, and now there was nothing left of it but that scraping in the door-lock, like somebody trying to turn a misfit key. I used to throw things at his door, and once I tried a cold-water douche from the pitcher, when he was very hard to waken; but that was rather brutal, and after a while I used to let him roar himself awake; he would always do it, if I trusted to nature; and before our junior year was out I got so that I could sleep through, pretty calmly; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> to myself when he fetched me to the surface with a yell, 'That's Melford dreaming,' and doze off sweetly." ...|$|E

I would try to make out, from things you did and said, whether you did or not; but I never could be certain. I believe I used {{to find the most}} comfort in {{discouraging}} myself. I used to say to myself, 'Why, of course he doesn't! How can he? He's been everywhere, and he's seen so many girls. He corresponds with lots of them. Altogether likely he's engaged to some of the young ladies he's met in Boston; and he just goes with me here for a blind.' And then when you would praise me, sometimes, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>say,</b> 'Oh, he's complimented plenty of girls. I know he's thinking this instant of the young lady he's engaged to in Boston.' And it would almost kill me; and when you did some little thing to show that you liked me, I would think, 'He doesn't like me! He hates, he despises me. He does, he does, he does!' And I would go on that way, with my teeth shut, and my breath held, I don't know how long."

40|$|If I had {{to write}} one day <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> like to <b>say</b> people is people and not damn white, damn black [...] . Make them real. Make you love them {{not because of the}} color of their skin but because they are {{important}} as human beings. – Bessie Head South African writer Bessie Head’s (1937 – 1986) desire to write about “real” people— the racially and economically marginalized and disenfranchised subaltern populations of South Africa and Botswana—directs us to the primary contention of Subaltern Studies, namely, can we represent without silencing the subaltern? Whether it is the marginalized Lodha tribe from India, the women and children in the sweatshops of Bangladesh who fall outside the international division of labor, and/or the Mayan guerillas in Guatemala, anyone claiming to represent them authentically is suspect of speaking over and as such erasing the subaltern. Since the publication of Gayatri Spivak’s ‘Can the Subaltern Speak?’ in 1985, Subaltern Studies have always cautioned against representations that reduce the subaltern to nothing more than “an idealized shadow” – a romanticized and falsified other that functions to intensify the imaginary of the self (Drucilla, “Ethical Affirmation” 103). In context of Spivak’s claim and recent debates around the politics of subaltern representation (which I discuss below), this paper will illustrate Head’s praxis of representing the subaltern through “un-coercive rearrangement of subaltern desires” does not put subalternity in crisis. 1 I argue that Head’s unique position as a writer who occupies the marginal space of subalternity allows her to articulate subaltern experiences from the locus of the subaltern. Her claim to write on subalternity thus stems from her practice to describe and not inscribe the subaltern in mainstream desires...|$|R

5000|$|Davis {{went on to}} {{lose the}} {{following}} year's final to Joe Johnson, before winning {{three in a row}} to give him six in total. Davis and Taylor would meet once more at the World Championship in 1991, with Davis this time winning comfortably 13-7 in the quarter-final. Taylor never reached the final again, but did win the Masters in 1987, again producing a memorable comeback this time against Alex Higgins. Some months later, a special programme was recorded which was hosted by David Vine. In this programme, both Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor watched the entire frame and discussed it shot by shot. As David Vine stated, {{this was the first time}} that Steve Davis had actually watched the frame. The programme features some insight into certain shots. Dennis Taylor asks Steve Davis about one shot in particular, a potentially key shot (if Taylor had potted his first clear chance at the black.) After Taylor had missed the initial double into the centre pocket and then the long double into the top pocket, Davis was left with a chance to either double the black into the top right hand pocket, or play the black [...] "around the angles" [...] with a chance of making the [...] "cocked hat" [...] shot into the centre pocket. Taylor, like millions of TV viewers watching that night, did not know which of the two shots Davis had played. Davis confirmed that he had in fact played the latter, but had not got the angle necessary to pull it off easily. In fact, he states that it may have worked but [...] "I hit it too hard, the white checked up (left the cushion too straight.)" [...] The most remembered shot where Davis missed the fine cut into the corner pocket was unfortunately not discussed in detail.
