However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Aberdaron can <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> extreme weather, the number of frosts per year is very low, at around 7.2 days per year. This is {{comparable}} with coastal areas of Devon and Cornwall. The region, England NW and Wales N, averages 52.3 days, with December alone exceeding the average yearly amount of frost for Aberdaron. The village is generally quite windy throughout the year, particularly in Autumn and Winter. Sunshine amounts are lower than the UK average. Rainfall is well below the Wales average.|$|E

5|$|Generally the whorls of {{the shell}} {{increase}} rather regularly in size, however, species which are probably closely related, such as A. sinistralis (Reeve) and A. heccarii Tapparone-Canefri, can <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> different degrees of whorl increment. No attempt {{has been made to}} express these differences meristically, since most of the available material was inadequate for statistical treatment. Actual dimensions {{of the shell}} vary greatly both within and between species. The minimum adult size is about 21mm high, the observed maximum about 75mm. There is not much variation in adult size within species: only a few species, notably A. maculiferus, A. sinensis and A. entobaptus, have a variation in adult size that is greater than seven or eight millimeters in total.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal Women are {{the most}} {{successful}} team in English women's football. In the 2008–09 season, they won all three major English trophies– the FA Women's Premier League, FA Women's Cup and FA Women's Premier League Cup, and, as of 2017, were the only English side to have won the UEFA Women's Cup or UEFA Women's Champions League, having won the Cup in the 2006–07 season {{as part of a}} unique quadruple. The men's and women's clubs are formally separate entities but <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> close ties; Arsenal Women are entitled to play once a season at the Emirates Stadium, though they usually play their home matches at Boreham Wood. At present the women have won 46 trophies in their 30-year history.|$|E
5|$|Los Angeles robbery-homicide {{sergeant}} Vincent Hanna (Plank) is on {{the trail}} of a gang of ruthless professional criminals, led by the methodical Patrick McLaren (McArthur), whose only mistake in the last heist was the killing of armored car guards by the new recruit, Waingro (Berkeley), who is a loose cannon. But Hanna is soon surprised when he discovers that he and McLaren <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> a lot in common. While McLaren and his gang plan another heist, Hanna and his colleagues keep surveillance. Hanna is facing a personal problem, as the police work is straining his relationship with his wife, Lillian (Pouget). Moreover, McLaren is also facing a similar problem when he finds himself falling in love with Eady (Harrington), which he personally condemns due to the commitment required to his profession.|$|E

5|$|The public stage ban 1642–60 {{imposed by}} the Puritan regime {{represents}} a long and sharp break in dramatic tradition, but was still never completely successful in suppressing the ideologically hateful make-believe of play-acting. Performances in grand private houses were not unusual, and could <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> elaborate sets, {{as can be seen}} from the extant drawings for the original performance of Davenant's opera The Siege of Rhodes (1656) at his home Rutland House. This was public theatre in all but name, as Davenant charged 5 shillings for admission. Some professional actors also managed to scrape a living and evade the authorities in stealth acting companies in London, such as that of Michael Mohun at the Red Bull Theatre. Professional writers from the previous era were growing middle-aged, biding their time, and hoping for the monarchy to be restored. By the later 1650s, it was becoming obvious that that time was at hand, and William Davenant, for example, stepped up his theatrical activities.|$|E
5|$|Astatine's {{alpha decay}} {{energies}} {{follow the same}} trend as for other heavy elements. Lighter astatine isotopes <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> high energies of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, {{because it has a}} nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1hours for astatine-210 and 7.2hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, because of the increasing role of beta decay (electron emission). This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay. Beta decay modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, -214, -215, and -216m. Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay (positron emission), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes electron capture.|$|E

25|$|Earthquakes {{not caused}} by fault {{movement}} <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> different patterns of energy radiation.

25|$|The {{breakdown}} voltage of film capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. When using film capacitors at temperatures between the upper rated temperature {{and the upper}} category temperature, only a temperature-derated category voltage VC is allowed. The derating factors apply to both DC and AC voltages.

25|$|Although some {{consider}} that the distinction between transpersonal psychology and the psychology of religion, is fading (e.g. The Oxford Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality), there is still {{generally considered to be}} a clear distinction between the two. Much of the focus of psychology of religion is concerned with issues that wouldn't be considered 'transcendent' within transpersonal psychology, so the two disciplines do <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> a distinct focus.|$|E
25|$|Species of B.subg. Isostylis {{occur only}} in Western Australia's South West Botanical Province. B.ilicifolia is {{widespread}} within 70 kilometres {{of the coast}} from Mount Lesueur in the north, south to Cape Leeuwin and east to Albany. The other two species occur further inland, and <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> limited distributions. B.cuneata occurs Brookton and Bruce Rock in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region; while B.oligantha occurs slightly further south, {{in the vicinity of}} Wagin.|$|E

25|$|Many musicians <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> good {{relative}} pitch, a {{skill that}} can be learned through ear training. With practice, {{it is possible to}} listen to a single known pitch once (from a pitch pipe or a tuning fork) and then have stable, reliable pitch identification by comparing the notes heard to the stored memory of the tonic pitch. Unlike absolute pitch, this skill is dependent on a recently perceived tonal center.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{though many}} parades and processions <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> separate, {{independent}} origins, civic or republican equivalents of the Entry continue. They include Victory parades, New York's traditional ticker-tape parades and the Lord Mayor's Show in London, {{dating back to}} 1215 and still preserving the Renaissance car, or float model. It is not frivolous to add that the specific occasion of the contemporary American Thanksgiving Day Parade or the Santa Claus parade is the triumphal entry into the city of Santa Claus in his sleigh.|$|E
25|$|Whereas a {{gene family}} (several tightly linked genes {{performing}} similar or identical functions) arises by duplication {{of a single}} original gene, this is usually {{not the case with}} supergenes. In a supergene some of the constituent genes <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> distinct functions, so they must have come together under selection. This process might involve suppression of crossing-over, translocation of chromosome fragments and possibly occasional cistron duplication. That crossing-over can be suppressed by selection has been known for many years.|$|E
