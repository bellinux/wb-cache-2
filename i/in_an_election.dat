5|$|A Republican in a {{predominantly}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats in his canvasses for public office. His 1879 loss <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>election</b> for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky Senate marked the first in a string of political defeats. He failed in bids to represent Kentucky's Fifth District in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1884, 1886, 1888, and 1892. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1884, 1888, 1892, 1904, 1908, and 1916. In 1897, {{he was a member of}} the executive committee at the national monetary conference in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he advocated a sound money position.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, Diefenbaker {{had grown}} disillusioned with Trudeau, and campaigned wholeheartedly for the Tories in that year's election. Diefenbaker was reelected comfortably {{in his home}} riding, and the Progressive Conservatives came within two seats of {{matching}} the Liberal total. Diefenbaker was relieved both that Trudeau had been humbled and that Stanfield had been denied power. Trudeau regained his majority two years later <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>election</b> that saw Diefenbaker, by then the only living former Prime Minister, have his personal majority grow to 11,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|During her premiership {{support for}} Dunderdale, her {{government}} and the PC Party saw a steady decline. A Corporate Research Associates (CRA) poll released days after Dunderdale became premier, and conducted before she took office, showed that 90 per cent of the population {{were satisfied with the}} PC government. 75 per cent would vote for the Progressive Conservative Party <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>election</b> and 76 percent chose Williams as the best leader to be premier. A CRA poll conducted throughout February 2011, showed that support for Dunderdale, her {{government and the}} PC Party remained high. Satisfaction with government was at 82 per cent, while 73 per cent of respondents said they would vote for the PC Party <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>election.</b> 64 per cent of respondents stated Dunderdale was the best choice for premier, compared to 18 per cent for Liberal leader Yvonne Jones and 5 per cent for Lorraine Michael. An Angus Reid Public Opinion (Angus Reid) poll conducted around the same time listed Dunderdale as the second most popular premier in Canada with a 55 percent approval rating. 10 percent of respondents disapproved of her performance while 35 percent were not sure if they approved or disapproved of her performance.|$|E

As Denning had {{argued for the}} retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was widely seen as {{a victory for the}} proponents of autonomy, but with his industrial background Baxter had little in common with the professors who came from academia, and did not share their views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive autonomy on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became vice-chancellor.|$|E

5|$|A CRA poll {{conducted}} throughout May 2013 continued to show declining support for Dunderdale, her government, and the PC Party. Only 21 per cent {{of those surveyed}} felt Dunderdale was {{the best choice for}} premier, behind both Michael and Ball. Dissatisfaction with her government increased to 65 per cent, compared to 33 per cent who indicated they were dissatisfied a year earlier. Support for the Progressive Conservatives also fell to just 27 per cent. This was below both the NDP and Liberals who were statistically tied for first, at 37 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. The poll also showed that 35 per cent of respondents were undecided or did not plan to vote, a significant increase from 14 per cent in November 2011. Towards the end of 2013, satisfaction for the Dunderdale administration saw a significant increase, though support for her and the PC Party saw little change from the poll in May. According to a November CRA poll, satisfaction with the Dunderdale government was up 10 points from May to 42 per cent, while dissatisfaction was at 52 per cent. A quarter of decided voters thought Dundedale was the best choice for premier, this was above Michael but 14 points below Ball. Due to a large drop in NDP support, down to 19 percent, the PC Party moved back into second place with 29 per cent of decided voters indicating that they would vote for the party <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>election.</b> The Liberal Party opened up a wide lead with 52 per cent of decided voters saying they would vote for the party <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
