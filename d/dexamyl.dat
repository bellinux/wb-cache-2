5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, <b>Dexamyl,</b> and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E
500|$|During his {{minor league}} career, Ellis once chased a heckler {{in the stands}} with a {{baseball}} bat. He also used pills when he pitched, specifically the amphetamines Benzedrine and <b>Dexamyl.</b> Stressed by the pressure of his [...] "can't-miss" [...] status as a prospect, Ellis became addicted. Ellis later said that he never pitched a game without using amphetamines. He eventually needed [...] per game, between five and twelve capsules, depending on their strength. Ellis acknowledged {{that he began to}} use cocaine in the late 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|While imprisoned, Woodcock {{underwent}} {{various forms}} of psychiatric therapy, including LSD treatments when they were popular in the 1960s. He was also given other personality-breaking drugs: scopolamine, sodium amytal, methedrine and <b>dexamyl.</b> He was subjected to [...] "dyads" [...] — a personality-breaking therapy in which inmates challenged each other's belief systems — which inmates referred to as [...] "The Hundred-Day Hate-In". Dyads were developed in the late 1950s to early 1960s by a Harvard psychologist and former CIA interrogation and psychological warfare expert, Henry A. Murray. In the 1960s, one of Murray's volunteer personality-destruction subjects had been a young Harvard student—Ted Kaczynski, the future Unabomber. Woodcock did not respond well to these treatments, and was not an ideal prisoner. He engaged in homosexual acts and exploited his fellow inmates, who were often less intelligent or less sane than he was. He formed an imaginary gang, the Brotherhood. He convinced inmates that he had contact with the mythical group on the outside, and {{that in order to}} be initiated, inmates had to perform oral sex on him and bring him gifts of cigarettes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dexamyl,</b> another {{pharmaceutical}} drug {{containing a}} substituted amphetamine and a barbiturate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dexamyl</b> was {{discontinued}} in the 1970s {{in favor}} of MAO inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dexamyl</b> (or Drinamyl in the UK) is {{the brand}} name of a {{combination}} drug composed of amobarbital (previously called amylbarbitone) and dextroamphetamine.|$|E
50|$|First {{introduced}} in 1950 by Smith, Kline and French, <b>Dexamyl</b> was marketed as an antidepressant medication {{that did not}} cause agitation, and also as an anti-anxiety drug and diet drug. Amphetamine alone had previously been marketed as an antidepressant (under the Benzedrine Sulfate brand) beginning around 1938. The amphetamine in <b>Dexamyl</b> was intended to elevate mood, while the barbiturate was added to counter {{the side effects of}} the amphetamine. Its name is a portmanteau of dextroamphetamine and amylbarbitone.|$|E
50|$|Dr. George C. Nichopoulos {{was indicted}} in May 1980 for having {{improperly}} prescribed <b>Dexamyl</b> and Preludin to the singer Jerry Lee Lewis, despite {{knowing he was}} addicted to them.Dr. Patrick A. Mazza, team physician for the Reading Phillies, said he prescribed <b>Dexamyl,</b> Eskatrol, Dexedrine, and Preludin for Steve Carlton, Larry Christenson, Tim McCarver, Pete Rose, Larry Bowa, and Greg Luzinski. The charges against Mazza were dropped after he contended that he had provided the prescriptions in good faith to the baseball players at their request.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, <b>Dexamyl</b> spansules—a clear and green capsule {{containing}} {{green and white}} [...] "beads"—became popular as a street-drug upper nicknamed [...] "Christmas trees," [...] a reference to its appearance.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{autobiography}} My Life of Absurdity, Chester Himes writes of {{his use of}} <b>Dexamyl</b> in the mid-1950s. He also writes that he stopped taking the pill after his friend Vandi Haygood died from [...] "steady doses of Dexamyl." ...|$|E
5000|$|Subsequent to Horton's death, {{there was}} no {{official}} public inquiry, and his autopsy was not made public. Police would not state if Horton was driving drunk. [...] In 2005, the autopsy was made public (with witness statements redacted) and revealed that Horton's blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit, and that a half-filled vodka bottle was amongst the crash debris. Horton was also in possession of the drugs Dexedrine (a stimulant) and <b>Dexamyl</b> (a stimulant-sedative), and traces of amobarbital (an ingredient in <b>Dexamyl)</b> were found in his blood. The autopsy report found no painkillers in Horton's body, and also concluded that his car had been in good working order. There was nothing to suggest Horton was evading police, or that police got near enough to initiate a criminal pursuit. Horton was interred at York Cemetery in Toronto.|$|E
5000|$|Eskatrol was an {{amphetamine}} {{weight loss}} agent which was removed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1981 after its manufacturer,SmithKline & French, {{was unable to}} prove the drug's effectiveness. At {{the time it was}} among the 200 most widely prescribed drugs in the United States. Another was <b>Dexamyl</b> tablets. Eskatrol contained dextroamphetamine sulfate [...] and prochlorperazine.|$|E
50|$|The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs and the Food and Drug Administration {{decided to}} recall all diet drugs that {{contained}} amphetamines and required {{all of them}} to be off the market by June 30, 1973. Smith, Kline & French, the producer of <b>Dexamyl</b> and Eskatrol, was excepted from an order banning interstate shipment of its drugs. Thecompany asked for a hearing before the F.D.A.|$|E
50|$|Southern's pre-eminence waned {{rapidly in}} the 1970s—his screen credits decreased, his book and story output dwindled, and he {{acquired}} a reputation as an out-of-control substance abuser. He continued to drink heavily and take various drugs; in particular, his dependence on <b>Dexamyl</b> badly affected his health as he aged. Biographer Lee Hill suggests that Southern was a functioning alcoholic and that his image was largely based on his occasional public appearances in New York, partying and socializing; in private, he remained a tireless worker.|$|E
5000|$|Southern's work on {{the project}} was brief but intense; he officially worked on the script from November 16 to December 28, 1962. Southern began {{to rely on the}} {{amphetamine}} [...] "diet pill" [...] <b>Dexamyl</b> to keep him going through the frantic rewriting process; in later years, he became increasingly reliant on the drug and he developed a long-term dependency. His amphetamine abuse, combined with his heavy intake of alcohol and other drugs, contributed significantly to health problems in later life.|$|E
50|$|There {{were reports}} Horton had {{consumed}} {{a considerable amount}} of vodka, and was rumoured to have been taking pain killers due to a jaw injury suffered in practice the day before. An autopsy report released in 2005 showed Horton had a blood alcohol level of twice the legal limit. The blood test also showed signs of amobarbital, which was possibly a residue from the <b>Dexamyl</b> pills that were found on Horton's body. The autopsy showed no indication Horton was taking painkillers as previously thought.|$|E

Ellis later said that he never pitched a game without using amphetamines. He eventually needed 70 to(-) 85 mg per game, between five and twelve capsules, depending on their strength.

5000|$|Three years later, in 1935, {{the medical}} {{community}} {{became aware of the}} stimulant properties of amphetamine, specifically dextroamphetamine, and in 1937 Smith, Kline, and French introduced tablets under the tradename Dexedrine. In the United States, Dexedrine was approved to treat narcolepsy, attention disorders, and obesity. In Canada indications once included epilepsy and parkinsonism. Dextroamphetamine was marketed in various other forms in the following decades, primarily by Smith, Kline, and French, such as several combination medications including a mixture of dextroamphetamine and amobarbital (a barbiturate) sold under the tradename <b>Dexamyl</b> and, in the 1950s, an extended release capsule (the [...] "Spansule"). Preparations containing dextroamphetamine were also used in World War II as a treatment against fatigue.|$|E
5000|$|Gordon A. Alles (November 26, 1901 - January 21, 1963), was an American chemist and {{pharmacologist}} who {{did much}} {{research on the}} isolation and properties of insulin {{for the treatment of}} diabetics. He is also credited with discovering and publishing the psychological effects of amphetamine, and for methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). He is the first person to have prepared amphetamine sulfate, although not the amphetamine molecule. Alles first reported the physiological properties amphetamine as a synthetic analog of ephedrine, and therefore received credit for this discovery. He enjoyed large royalties from Smith, Kline & French (SKF) because he sold his patent rights for amphetamine to the company and it enjoyed large sales. Several popular products sold by SKF contained amphetamine including Benzedrine pills and inhalers, Dexedrine pills, and <b>Dexamyl</b> tablets. Counterfeit drugs appeared, trying to violate Alles' 'weak' patent, e.g., [...] "Profetamine".|$|E
50|$|This is {{all well}} and good to Sidda, but doesn't change her opinion of her mother as a self-centered person unable to deal with her {{troubles}}, which she has unfairly inflicted on Sidda to the point of needing psychotherapy. Meanwhile, she tells Connor not to send out the wedding invitations, which troubles him enough to come down to Louisiana to find her. The Sisters then realize that Sidda must be told Vivi's deepest, darkest secret in order to understand. They try to persuade Vivi that she must do this herself, but she doesn't have the courage to tell her daughter, so they do it for her with Sidda's father present. In the meantime, Vivi tells Connor herself. The secret is that Vivi eventually had a nervous breakdown, and brutally beat Sidda and her siblings. What the children never knew was that Vivi had taken an overdose of <b>Dexamyl,</b> (an amphetamine used as an antidepressant), and had to be hospitalized.|$|E
