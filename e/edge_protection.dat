25|$|UHMWPE is {{polyethylene}} with {{a molecular}} weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The {{high molecular weight}} makes it a very tough material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the crystal structure as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930–0.935nbsp&g/cm3). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and bottle-handling machine parts, moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, artificial joints, <b>edge</b> <b>protection</b> on ice rinks, and butchers' chopping boards.

40|$|Governments {{and private}} organisations are {{increasingly}} aware that vital information stored in their databases {{is no longer}} safe behind perimeter firewalls, intrusion prevention systems and other <b>edge</b> <b>protections.</b> Databases store {{a broad range of}} private and important information, making them a prime target for exploitation by wrongdoers wishing to breach confidentiality, damage the integrity of the data or make it unavailable to its users. The intricate nature and the non-stoppable critical services running in databases makes forensic examination of database difficult and challenges the forensics recovery and examination processes. The research presented in this thesis discusses the feasibility of developing an enhanced workflow that provides insight into the challenging complexities of examining and using database evidence. It lays the foundation for the development and establishment of standards in database forensic analysis and forensic case management. The major contribution of this research is a literature review that summarises the state-of-the-art in database forensics. It argues for the need for more in-depth research in this field and highlights limited availability of forensic data. To improve this, the research presents the design of a generic workflow of database forensic examination. This is evaluated using a qualitative and case study based evaluation and highlights the various limitations and drawback of the workflow. In summary, the research in this thesis proposes a system that allows a forensic examiner to focus on what is relevant to a case in a systematic way that can be proved in court. The workflow also acts as a case management tool by aiding the forensic examiner to apply established standards and procedures to identify best-case result by systematically, thoroughly and efficiently collecting and validating digital evidence...|$|R

30|$|During {{low-pass}} filtering, each pixel {{is assigned}} to a neighborhood of surrounding pixels. <b>Edge</b> <b>protection</b> works by first estimating a significant brightness level for the neighborhood. Then it compares the central pixel with each neighbor and computes a weighted difference. When a neighbor pixel, whose difference with the central pixel exceeds the corresponding edges protection threshold (either for bright or dark sides, depending on {{the sign of the}} difference), is found, then a corrective function is applied to the neighbor pixel in order to give it more opportunities to survive after the low-pass filtering. This allows to preserve small-scale image features and contrast. Note that too high value of the threshold can allow excessive low-pass filtering, whilst too low value of the threshold can generate artifacts. The SGBNR can also be applied recursively. In this case the threshold parameters are less critical and the <b>edge</b> <b>protection</b> mechanism is more efficient.|$|E

30|$|The {{breakdown}} {{behavior is}} related to the distribution of electric field inside the devices, and cylindrical junction and spherical junction have larger electric field than parallel-plane junction in the same condition [1]. Therefore, some <b>edge</b> termination <b>protection</b> methods are needed such as field plate to enhance the breakdown voltage [19, 23, 68]. The interface states referred as interface charges normally impact the electric field close to the semiconductor surface and cause the premature breakdown. The leakage current is the indicator of breakdown behavior and is commonly affected by the internal defects of semiconductor, including dislocations. Both situations cause the instability of devices and may decrease the breakdown voltage which should be avoided. The common practice for reducing the impact of interface states is surface passivation, and high-quality substrate is also required for increasing the breakdown voltage.|$|R
