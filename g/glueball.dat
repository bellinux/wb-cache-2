Quarks are normally produced in pairs (quark + antiquark) to compensate the quantum color and flavor numbers; however at Fermilab single production of top quarks has been shown (technically this still involves a pair production, but quark and antiquark are of different flavor).

25|$|To {{obtain the}} {{behavior}} of the Yang–Mills theory at high energies, and so to prove asymptotic freedom, one applies perturbation theory assuming a small coupling. This is verified a posteriori in the ultraviolet limit. In the opposite limit, the infrared limit, the situation is the opposite, as the coupling is too large for perturbation theory to be reliable. Most of the difficulties that research meets is just managing the theory at low energies. That is the interesting case, being inherent to the description of hadronic matter and, more generally, to all the observed bound states of gluons and quarks and their confinement (see hadrons). The most used method to study the theory in this limit is to try to solve it on computers (see lattice gauge theory). In this case, large computational resources are needed to be sure the correct limit of infinite volume (smaller lattice spacing) is obtained. This is the limit the results must be compared with. Smaller spacing and larger coupling are not independent of each other, and larger computational resources are needed for each. As of today, the situation appears somewhat satisfactory for the hadronic spectrum and the computation of the gluon and ghost propagators, but the <b>glueball</b> and hybrids spectra are yet a questioned matter in view of the experimental observation of such exotic states.

The presence of an eta(1405) state also brings <b>glueball</b> mixing into the discussion. It is possible that the eta and eta prime mesons mix with the pseudoscalar <b>glueball</b> which should occur, in its pure state, somewhere above the scalar <b>glueball</b> in mass.

40|$|Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is {{the modern}} theory of strong {{interact}}ions. Quarks and antiquarks interact extit{via} gluons, the gauge bosons, and form well-know bound states, namely mesons and baryons. This non-Abelian gauge theory predicts {{the existence of}} unconventional states of quarks and gluons: Exotic hadrons. Their observation remains a difficult task since their properties are poorly known. Their theoretical study is a challenging task and will guide experimentalists in their work. This thesis is devoted to two main types of exotic hadrons: Hybrid mesons and <b>glueballs.</b> Hybrid mesons are mesons in which the gluon field is in an excited state. In constituent models, the excitation of the flux tube is interpreted in term of a constituent gluon. In this thesis, {{the connection between the}} two pictures, flux tube excitation and constituent gluon, is demonstrated. Using the technique of the auxiliary field, we reproduce, from the three-body system quark-antiquark-gluon, the excitations of the quark-antiquark potential observed in lattice QCD. We complete our study of mesons with exotic quantum numbers by performing a analysis of the low-lying spectrum. <b>Glueballs</b> are hadronic states with no valence quarks. Theoretical developments suggests that confined gluons gain a constituent mass inside <b>glueballs.</b> According to this, a gluon can be considered as a heavy spin- 1 particle. Two- and three-gluon <b>glueballs</b> are then similar of heavy meson and baryon systems. We preformed a complete study of the low-lying spectrum of these <b>glueballs.</b> The comparison with the pure gauge results from lattice QCD showed a disagreement and led us {{to the conclusion that the}} gluon degree-of-freedom was not correctly taken into account. Indeed, the implementation of transverse gluons at the level of the wave functions solved this problem for two-gluon <b>glueballs.</b> For both systems, hybrid mesons and <b>glueballs,</b> we used semi-relativistic Hamiltonians since they remain valid for massless particles.

40|$|The {{structure}} of hadrons consisting of three static color sources in fundamental (baryons) or adjoint (three-gluon <b>glueballs)</b> representations is studied. The static potentials of <b>glueballs</b> {{as well as}} gluon field distributions in <b>glueballs</b> and baryons are calculated {{in the framework of}} field correlator method. 1. The study of the gluon field structure in hadrons is important for the deep understanding of the strong interaction physics. Interesting results on the baryon flux structure were obtained recently in the maximally abelian gauge on the lattice [1]. We demonstrate below how to perform calculations in gauge invariant way using the field correlator method relyed directly on QCD.
