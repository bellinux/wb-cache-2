40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a case that}} was successfully treated for acquired factor VIII inhibitor after extensive visceral surgery. A 71 -year-old male who underwent surgery for bile duct cancer had active bleeding in the abdominal drainage tube on postoperative day (POD) 5, and prolonged {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT) was detected (83. 1 s) on POD 7. An extensive coagulation work-up revealed factor VIII deficiency (1 %), and a diagnosis of an acquired factor VIII deficiency was established when a factor VIII inhibitor of 8 Bethesda units was demonstrated. The patient was treated with activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCCs) and bloody <b>discharge</b> <b>was</b> <b>stopped</b> within 3 days. Inhibitor elimination was started using prednisolone on POD 20; rituximab, was administered on POD 74 and 81. Factor VIII inhibitor had disappeared by POD 124, and factor VIII (72 %) and aPTT recovered to 45. 9 s.

5000|$|As Saint Columb's Rill moves northeast, {{it flows}} across acidic Sphagnum peatlands towards {{the village of}} Bushmills. In {{addition}} to acidity, histosol soils like peat give the water its brown colour and distinctive flavour and this has made Saint Columb's Rill highly prized for brewing and distilling. It is essential {{that the quality of}} this Rill is monitored to ensure that it remains unpolluted and this role is carried out by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency. [...] In 2012 a polluting <b>discharge</b> <b>was</b> <b>stopped</b> after being discovered by a Water Quality Inspector and the person responsible faced court action. After harvesting, peat is known as turf and by the late eighteenth century it was the main fuel in Ireland. The lure of special Saint Columb's Rill water combined with an abundant supply of local peat for fuel, resulted in five licensed distilleries [...] being situated in the vicinity of Bushmills. In 2013, just one remains and it stills draws all of its process water from Saint Columb's Rill but it has shifted its energy dependence from turf to natural gas.|$|R
40|$|Idealized and {{realistic}} simulations of the Merrimack River plume {{on the east}} coast of the U. S. are performed using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The effect of discharge, tides and rotation on the evolution of the tidal plume are examined. Experiments investigating the deceleration of the plume body through mixing and the relaxation of the tidal plume front are performed. Three primary findings result from this research. First, more ambient water interacts with the tidal plume front than source water. Because it takes several hours for source water to translate the plume and it is strongly diluted in the plume interior, {{only a small fraction of}} source water reaches the front. Therefore, the front is responsible for a small portion of mixing of the total ebb discharge. Second, the mouth and the tidal plume front communicate on an advective time scale. When the ebb <b>discharge</b> <b>is</b> <b>stopped</b> at the estuary mouth, the inertia of the <b>discharge</b> <b>is</b> enough to keep previously released source water necessary to sustain frontal propagation moving frontward. The front begins to slow when the withheld estuarine <b>discharge</b> <b>is</b> not supplied to the front. Third, the net plume mixing, defined as the total mixing of a parcel of source water before it enters the far-field, is altered by rotation. As discharge increases, an irrotational plume will exhibit an increasing trend in net mixing, while a rotational plume will exhibit a decreasing trend. These experiments bridge engineering and geophysical scale plume studies and provide a framework for understanding results reported in literature...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Mediterranean region {{includes}} many small coastal rivers about which {{little is known}} concerning organic contaminant loads in their sediment. This {{study was designed to}} assess organic contamination in one of these small coastal rivers (Lez River) and associated coastal sediments. Levels of alkylphenols (APs), polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in sediments of the Lez River and two coastal lagoons impacted by wastewater discharges. In parallel, sediment surrounding a recently built submarine outfall that discharges treated wastewater, from an area encompassing some 450, 000 inhabitants, into the sea was monitored a year after the beginning of emission via the outfall. Finally, these sediments were characterized by screening estrogenic, PAH-like and dioxin-like activities using in vitro bioassays. Both chemical analyses and bioassays revealed that wastewater inputs were a source of organic contamination of sediments from the Lez and lagoons, which still persisted 2 years after the <b>discharges</b> <b>were</b> <b>stopped.</b> APs could explain a small proportion of the overall estrogenic activities (up to 31 %), suggesting that other estrogenic compounds were also present in the sediments. PAHs explained a great share (83 % on average) of the EROD induction potency of the extracts. This survey should be {{the first step in the}} long-term monitoring of these sites...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn situ and ex situ {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} of nano Si and SiO anode particles was carried out during the first cycles, and at various stages of charge. The particle size effects were explored in the range 0. 1 - 20 μm, providing a new insight into the micro-structural evolution of the particles {{as a function of}} their size, and into the 'mechanical' resistance upon important volume change upon phase transformation of these anodes. For small particles, the failure of the battery comes from an electrochemical sintering that compacts the whole electrode, which results in its cracking. The particles keep their integrity when the <b>discharge</b> <b>is</b> <b>stopped</b> at a voltage 0. 1 V, which corresponds to the chemical composition Li 12 Si 7, while the particles are known to crack at deeper discharge up to Li 22 Si 5. Replacing the Si particles by SiO particles in an attempt to avoid these structural effects did not help, because of the different chemical reactions during cycling, with the loss of oxygen. Upon deeper discharge, the particles of size d< 2 μm do not crack (at least during the first cycles that were investigated). On another hand, particles with 1010 μm are pulverized...|$|R
40|$|Clindamycin is a {{lincosamide}} antibiotic {{which is}} approved {{for the treatment}} of Anaerobic, Streptococcal and Staphylococcal infections. There has been an increased interest in the use of clindamycin since it achieves high intracellular levels in phagocytic cells, high levels in bone and appears to have an antitoxin effect against the toxin elaborating strains of streptococci and staphylococci. Clindamycin is considered as a bacteriostatic antibiotic, while it is bactericidal against some strains of Staphylococci, Streptococci and Anaerobes such as B. fragilis. Its major disadvantage is its propensity to cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea. In spite of expanded use of clindamycin in bone infections, the adverse reactions of this antibiotic are minor. Polyarthritis is a rare adverse effect of this antibiotic. In this case report, we studied a 75 -year-old male patient with past history of drop attack and subdural hematoma who developed skull osteomyelitis after the surgery. After two weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy, wound <b>discharge</b> <b>was</b> <b>stopped</b> and the patient <b>was</b> <b>discharged</b> from the hospital with the maintenance oral antibiotic therapy including clindamycin 300 mg q 8 h, ciprofloxacin 500 mg q 12 h and rifampin 600 mg fasting. Six days after the beginning of oral antibiotics, right wrist monoarthritis was developed. It was unresponsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and improved after decreased doses of clindamycin. As best as we know, monoarthritis was not reported with clindamycin previously...|$|R
30|$|The {{lifetime}} of the lithium battery determines {{the life of}} the entire system. Based on the premise of not affecting the system work, reducing the charge-discharge cycles of the battery is very helpful. Experimental results show that the lithium battery can work for a long time when its voltage is between 3.7 – 3.9  V, but if the voltage is lower than the threshold, it drops rapidly with discharge going on. So the lithium battery should be charged at once when its voltage is under the threshold. Critically, if the battery voltage is lower than the danger boundary, it may be eternally damaged, so <b>discharge</b> should <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> immediately, and the system has to do something to avoid this from happening [35].|$|R
30|$|In November 2009, {{drilling}} activities for a near-surface geothermal energy application {{on behalf of}} the Hessian Ministry of Finance induced flooding in the city centre of Wiesbaden. Drillings reached a depth of 130  m when a 7 -m-high groundwater spring erupted from the borehole.
