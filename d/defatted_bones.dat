40|$|ABSTRACT A {{trial with}} broiler males, housed in cages, was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} of (added) dietary fluoride at 0, 200, and 400 mg/kg on performance and bone characteristics and the influence of preconditioning (drying, defatting) on bone-breaking strength. The F administration resulted in a significantly (P<. 05) lower weight gain. Feed conversion, however, was not affected. Tibial ash deposition and ash-per-centage increased significantly (P<. 05) at both dietary levels of added F. Broiler males fed supplemented F had a significantly (P<. 05) higher incidence of tibial dyschondroplastic plugs and epiphyseal bone with looser structure, as judged macroscopically. Tibial bone strength was significantly (P<. 05) affected not only by dietary F level, but also by preconditioning, resulting in a significant interaction. Administration of F had a significantly negative or positive effect on breaking strength, depending on whether the measure-ments were carried out on fresh bones or dried (<b>defatted)</b> <b>bones,</b> respectively. This diverging response of F on breaking strength offers a valid explanation for the contradictory results in the literature, demonstrating {{at the same time that}} F supplementation of feed or drinking water should be discontinued as a method to improve bone-breaking strength.

40|$|Palaeo-histology is {{the branch}} of palaeontology {{concerned}} with the microscopic structure of fossil bone. Researchers entering {{the field for the}} first time become aware of a need for a concise description of a technique to prepare thin sections from fossil bone. This note aims to fill that need by describing the procedure used in a recent palaeohistological study (Chinsamy 1988, 1990, 1991, 1992). The technique described has been successfully applied to the bones of dinosaurs and mammal-like reptiles, as well as to archaeological samples ofhuman bone and also to <b>defatted</b> <b>bone</b> of recent taxa. There is no one 'correct' method of making sections of hard tissues like bones, but all existing techniques share a number of core processes in common (Enlow 1954; Enlow and Brown 1956; Honjo and Fischer 1965; Peabody 1961; Macfall and Wollin 1972; Buffrenil, Ricqles, Ray and Domning 1990). Although the method described here is specifically intended for use on bone, thin sections of fossilised wood have also been obtained using the same method...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is often}} {{emphasized}} that the matrix of bone grafts contains several growth factors, {{it is not known}} if these factors become activated and play a role in bone grafting. We therefore compared ground <b>defatted</b> <b>bone</b> which had or had not been deproteinized by heating with water to 270 degrees C at an autogenic pressure of 55 bar. This is a careful ceramic procedure which leaves the mineral unchanged. Deproteinized and non-deproteinized bone granulae derived from cortical rat bone were placed in titanium bone conduction chambers implanted bilaterally in rat tibiae. Ingrowing bone could enter the cylindrical interior of the chamber only at one end. It then penetrated the material in the chamber, but due to the length of the cylinder, it never reached the other end. The mean distance which the ingrown bone had reached in the material was then measured on histological slides. The bone formation activity was measured by TcMDP scintimetry. With the protein-containing granulae, the mean bone ingrowth distance and the scintimetric activity were increased by 41 % and 31 %, respectively (p < 0. 01). We conclude that there is a limited favourable effect of proteins in a graft. Our grounded material had a large fracture surface area with no osteoid lining. The leakage of growth factors from such areas may explain the extraordinarily good clinical incorporation of morselized compacted allografts...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Defatted</b> <b>bone</b> chips with {{or without}} {{freeze-drying}} and irradiation have mechanical advantages as compared to fresh-frozen controls in in vitro models of impaction. These improved results have been ascribed to replacement of viscous bone marrow by saline and embrittlement of the freeze-dried bone by irradiation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To determine which of these hypotheses is correct, we compared the development of stiffness and compactness of morselized bone graft that had been: 1) fat-reduced with saline, and 2) fresh-frozen, solvent-detergent defatted, 3) freeze-dried irradiated and 4) not irradiated. We used 12 osteoarthrotic femoral heads to prepare these four batches of morselized bone, and impacted 18 samples from each batch in a cylinder. The frozen bone grafts were tested after thawing {{at room temperature for}} 2 hours and the freeze-dried grafts were tested after 30 minutes of rehydration. We monitored the development of compactness and stiffness of the material during impaction. RESULTS: The stiffness of the freeze-dried irradiated bone was greater than that of the other three series after 10, 50 and 150 impactions. The freeze-dried bone chips that were not irradiated and the chips defatted with saline alone were less stiff than the fresh-frozen control after 150 impactions. INTERPRETATION: The brittleness of freeze-dried irradiated bone, caused by loss of the capacity to absorb energy in a plastic way, increases the compactness and stiffness of the morselized grafts. Washing bone with saline alone or treating bone with solvent-detergent but no irradiation had no similar mechanical advantage and the bone did not impact better than fresh-frozen undefatted bone in our model...|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from its}} slender appearance, four main factors lead to {{questions}} regarding the bone density, mineral content and morphology of the giraffe skeleton: X A rapid vertical growth rate Â¡V especially in the neck and metapodials X Biomechanical considerations pertaining to the tall and slender shape of the skeleton X A proportionally larger skeleton in relation to body mass X A seemingly abnormal mineral balance in their diet with possible signs of mineral deficiency (i. e. osteophagia) In this study the skeleton of the giraffe was {{compared with that of}} the African buffalo with regards to bone density, skeletal calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) content and certain femoral and metacarpal morphological characteristics. The aim was to establish if, compared to buffalo, the features of the giraffe skeleton differed in any unique way. Fourteen similar bones or parts of bones were collected from carcasses of six adult giraffe bulls and nine adult buffalo bulls. These bones were cleaned, weighed and their volume determined through water displacement, from which their density could be calculated. Hereafter, Ca and P content were analysed in 10 bones from each carcass. Morphological characteristics of cross-sections from femoral and metacarpal shafts were also measured. No significant differences between the density or mineral content of bones in the two species could be found. In both species 19, 5 % Ca and 9, 5 % P were measured in <b>defatted</b> <b>bone.</b> Although similar in mineral concentration, the giraffe skeleton contains three times more absolute Ca and P, which translates into a 1, 5 - 2 -fold higher dietary requirement for these minerals compared to buffaloes. A gradation in the volume and weight of cervical vertebrae was also seen in giraffes. This could hold biomechanical advantage for the carriage and manoeuvrability of the long neck. Bone wall thickness of the giraffe femur and metacarpus is increased compared to buffaloes. This could hold biomechanical advantage for the slender legs that are subjected to increased vertical forces. Adequate Ca seems to be acquired through very specific browse selection, which seems to be of evolutionary origin, while the acquisition of adequate P seems to be critical and a possible cause for osteophagia. This study is {{the first of its kind}} in these species and therefore also provide valuable baseline data for future work in this field.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in dry and wet season to determine macro and micro mineral status of growing sheep and goats in arid rangelands of northern Kenya. Forty four, 22 each of sheep and goats (1 - 2 year old), randomly purchased from three herds/flocks in study area, were sacrificed for whole liver and 12 th right and left ribs. Homogenized liver samples pooled from all the lobes and <b>defatted</b> <b>bone</b> ash from whole left and right 12 th ribs were used for determination of Ca, P, Mg, Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn status. Liver mineral analysis, showed that in sheep Cu (303 vs. 184 mg/kg DM), Zn (94. 1 vs. 83 mg/kg DM) and Mn (13. 2 vs. 7. 5 mg/kg DM) were higher (p< 0. 05) in wet than dry season. In goats, season had no effect on Cu (274. 28 vs. 236 mg/kg DM) and Fe (183 vs. 171 mg/kg DM), but had significant influence on Zn (102 vs. 126 mg/kg DM) and Mn (13. 6 vs. 6. 8 mg/kg DM). Sheep grazing in different pastures showed variation (p< 0. 05) in hepatic Zn, Cu and Mn contents, while goat varied (p< 0. 05) in hepatic Cu, Fe and Mn concentrations. Rib analysis indicated that season had significant effect (p< 0. 05) on sheep and goats DFF% ash. The rib Ca (359 vs. 362 mg/g), P (157 vs. 147 mg/g) and Mg (9. 56 vs. 8. 54 mg/g) contents of sheep was not influenced by season and grazing area (p< 0. 05), whereas goats rib Ca (360 vs. 326 mg/g), P (142 vs. 165 mg/g) content was affected by season and grazing area (p< 0. 05), but Mg showed no seasonal variation. In the wet season, liver and bone tissue of sheep and goats indicated adequate body status of Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn. However, in the dry season, sheep showed deficient levels of Zn, goats in Cu, while both species suffered from low liver Mn and rib Zn reserves. With the exception of P which was marginal in all seasons, mineral deficiencies affected animals mostly in the dry season. The liver and rib bone of sheep and goats has demonstrated seasonal fluctuation in tissue mineral reserve. Evaluation of specific minerals in different periods and body pools can be useful in the diagnosis of mineral status of animals. It can be concluded that, sheep and goats would benefit from P, Cu, Zn and Mn supplementation, particularly in the dry season...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{evaluate}} in vivo {{performance of}} hydroxylapatite cement (HAC) as a porous bone graft substitute, HAC was mixed (1 : 1 volume ratio) with either porous calcium phosphate GRANULES (80 % TCP, 20 % HA) or <b>defatted</b> morsellized cancellous <b>bone</b> allograft (MCB) and implanted bilaterally in rabbit distal femurs. Groups with EMPTY defects and impacted MCB {{were used for}} reference. After eight weeks, one femur from each pair was examined histologically. Contralateral specimens and time-zero specimens were used for mechanical indentation tests. Histology showed that the EMPTY defects were filled with newly formed osteopenic bone after eight weeks. The MCB defects showed complete remodelling of graft into vital bone. Incorporation of the HAC/MCB composites was extensive but not completed, while minimal new bone ingrowth into the HAC/GRANULE composites was found. Indentation tests showed that both cement composites were significantly stronger than EMPTY defects, incorporated MCB and intact bone. Composites of HAC and porous biomaterials can maintain their relatively high strength over eight weeks in vivo, but their incorporation into a new bony structure is slowed by the synthetic materials. The HAC/MCB composite showed more favourable strength and incorporation...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} in vivo {{performance of}} hydroxyapatite cement (HAC) as a porous bone graft substitute, HAC was mixed (1 : 1 ratio) with either porous calcium-phosphate granules (80 % tricalcium phosphate, 20 % hydroxyapatite) or <b>defatted</b> morsellized cancellous <b>bone</b> (MCB) allograft and implanted bilaterally in cylindrical drill holes in distal femurs of rabbits. Groups with empty defects and impacted MCB {{were used for}} reference. After 8 weeks, one femur from each pair was examined histologically. All contralateral specimens and Time- 0 specimens were used for mechanical indentation tests. Histology showed that some empty defects were filled with newly formed osteopenic bone after 8 weeks. The impacted MCB showed remodeling into new vital bone. Incorporation of the HAC/MCB composite was incomplete, whereas minimal new bone ingrowth {{was found in the}} HAC/granule composites. Though not different from each other, both composites were significantly stronger than empty defects, incorporated impacted MCB, and intact cancellous bone. At Time 0, the mechanical behavior of impacted MCB was similar to both HAC composites. In conclusion, composites of HAC and porous biomaterials can maintain relatively high strength over 8 weeks in vivo, but their incorporation into a new bony structure is slower than impacted MCB. The HAC/MCB composite showed favorable incorporation behavior...|$|R
