50|$|A typical LEEM setup {{consists}} of (see figure):1. Electron gun, {{used to generate}} electrons by way of thermionic or field emission from a source tip. In thermionic emission, electrons escape a source tip (usually made of LaB6) by resistive heating and application of an electric field to effectively lower the energy needed for electrons to escape the surface. Once sufficient thermal vibrational energy is attained electrons may overcome this electrostatic energy barrier, allowing them to travel into vacuum and accelerate down the lens column to the gun potential (because the lenses are at ground). In field emission, rather than heating the tip to vibrationally excite electrons from the surface, the source tip (usually tungsten) is sharpened to a small point such that when large electric fields are applied, they concentrate at the tip, lowering the barrier to escape the surface as well as making tunneling of electrons from the tip to vacuum level more feasible. 2. Condenser/illumination optics, used to focus electrons leaving the electron gun and manipulate and/or translate the illumination electron beam. Electromagnetic quadrupole electron lenses are used, the number of which {{depends on how much}} resolution and focusing flexibility the designer wishes. However, the ultimate resolution of LEEM is usually determined by that of the objective lens.3. Illumination beam aperture allows researchers to control the area of the specimen which is illuminated (LEEM’s version of electron microscopy’s “selected area diffraction”, termed microdiffraction) and is located in the beam separator on the illumination side.4. Magnetic beam separator, needed to resolve the illuminating and imaging beam (while in turn spatially separating the optics for each). There has been much development on the technology of electron beam separators; the early separators introduced distortion in either the image or diffraction plane. However, IBM recently developed a hybrid prism array/nested quadratic field design, focusing the electron beams {{both in and out of}} the plane of the beampath, allowing for deflection and transfer of the image and diffraction planes without distortion or energy dispersion.5. Electrostatic immersion objective lens, used to form a real image of the sample by way of a 2/3-magnification virtual image behind the sample. The uniformity of the electrostatic field between the objective lens and specimen, limited by spherical and chromatic aberrations larger than those of any other lenses, ultimately determines the overall performance of the instrument.6. Contrast aperture, located in the center on the projector lens side of the beam separator. In most electron microscopies, the contrast aperture is introduced into the back <b>focal</b> <b>plan</b> of the objective lens (where the actual diffraction plane lies). However, this is not true in the LEEM, because dark-field imaging (imaging of nonspecular beams) would not be possible because the aperture has to move laterally and would intercept the incident beam for large shifts. Therefore, researchers adjust the excitation of the objective lens so as to produce an image of the diffraction pattern in the middle of the beam separator and choose the desired spot intensity to image using a contrast aperture inserted there. This aperture allows scientists to image diffraction intensities that may be of particular interest (dark field).7. Illumination optics are employed to magnify the image or diffraction pattern and project it onto the imaging plate or screen.8. Imaging plate or screen, used to image the electron intensity so that we can see it. This can be done many different ways including, phosphorescent screens, imaging plates, CCDs, among others.|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{efficacy}} of focal continuous low dose-rate brachytherapy (CLDR-BT) {{for prostate cancer}} requires that appropriate margins are applied to ensure robust target coverage. In this study we propose a method to establish such margins by emulating a focal treatment in patients treated with CLDR-BT to the entire gland. Material and methods. In 15 patients with localized prostate cancer, prostate volumes and dominant intra-prostatic lesions were delineated on pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Delineations and MRI were registered to trans-rectal ultrasound images in the operating theater. The patients received CLDR-BT treatment to the total prostate volume. The implantation consisted of two parts: an experimental <b>focal</b> <b>plan</b> covering the dominant intra-prostatic lesion (F-GTV), followed by a plan containing additional seeds to achieve entire prostate coverage. Isodose surfaces were reconstructed using follow-up computed tomography (CT). The focal dose was emulated by reconstructing seeds from the <b>focal</b> <b>plan</b> only. The distance to agreement between planned and delivered isodose surfaces and F-GTV coverage was determined to calculate the margin required for robust treatment. Results.

The present manuscript describes the procedures used for collectingimmature and mature oocytes from horse ovaries using ovum pick-up (OPU). These oocytes were then used to investigate the incidence of aneuploidy by adapting a protocol previously developed in mice. Specifically, the chromosomes and the centromeres of metaphase II (MII) oocytes were fluorescently labeled and counted on sequential <b>focal</b> <b>plans</b> after confocal laser microscope scanning. This analysis revealed a higher incidence in the aneuploidy rate when immature oocytes were collected from the follicles and matured in vitro compared to in vivo. Immunostaining for tubulin and the acetylated form of histone four at specific lysine residues also revealed differences in the morphology of the meiotic spindle and in the global pattern of histone acetylation. Finally, the expression of mRNAs coding for histone deacetylases (HDACs) and acetyl-transferases (HATs) was investigated by reverse transcription and quantitative-PCR (q-PCR). No differences in the relative expression of transcripts were observed between in vitro and in vivo matured oocytes. In agreement with a general silencing of the transcriptional activity during oocyte maturation, the analysis of the total transcript amount can only reveal mRNA stability or degradation. Therefore, these findings indicate that other translational and post-translational regulations might be affected. Overall, the present study describes an experimental approach to morphologically and biochemically characterize the horse oocyte, a cell type that is extremely challenging to study due to low sample availability.

Although several remote sensing techniques are suitable for such measurements they are considered high cost techniques involving complicated instrumentation. Therefore, simultaneous measurement of atmospheric species using a single remote sensing instrument is significant for minimizing cost, size and complexity.

OPLS-DA was able to differentiate between chemical properties and physical properties (e. g., edge effects). OPLS-DA model interpretation of the chemical features that separated the two cell types clearly highlighted proteins and lipids/bile acids. The modeled variation that was uncorrelated to cell type made up a larger portion of the total variation and displayed strong variability in the amide I region.

The plasma evolution is described {{by means of a}} numerical 2 -D model in cylindrical geometry R,Z. We explore the space of fundamental parameters. As a reference model, we consider a flare triggered by a heating pulse that would cause a 20 MK flare if delivered in a 40000 km long closed loop. The modeled plasma evolution is described. The X-ray emission, spectra and light curves at the ASCA/SIS <b>focal</b> <b>plan,</b> and in two intense X-ray lines (Mg XI at 9. 169 A and Fe XXI at 128. 752 A), have been synthesized from the models.

We show that this evolution of the emission, and especially the fast decay, together with other potentially observable effects, are intrinsic to the assumption of non-confinement.

30|$|Quantum cascade {{photodetector}} is {{one kind}} of ISB photodetectors based on electrons’ transitions between quantized subbands in the conduction band of semiconductor heterostructures. As a photovoltaic detector, quantum cascade photodetector (QCD) works without an external bias voltage due to asymmetric conduction band profile. This asymmetry {{is derived from the}} stair-like subbands separated by LO-phonon energy by choosing appropriate layer thicknesses of the superlattice in the extraction region. This design guarantees a negligible dark current, which makes QCDs promising in large <b>focal</b> <b>plan</b> array and small pixel applications [1, 2]. QCDs have been studied extensively from short wavelength to THz wavelength through the entire infrared spectrum [3 – 10]. However, the absorption of normal incident light was limited by polarization selection rule for ISB transitions in quantum wells, which restricts the possible applications of QCDs. This leads to strong interest in exploring the possibility of using the intersubband transitions in quantum dot (QD) [11 – 13], quantum wire [14, 15], and also the dot-in-a-well structure [16, 17] instead of in a QW in terms of polarization relaxation. Effective results have been achieved, because the in-plane confinement of the carriers allows the absorption of photons at normal incidence. Nevertheless, these devices sensitive to normal incident light usually work in photoconductive scheme. The strong dark current derived from photoconductive working scheme seems to be an unavoidable weakness. Lately, quantum dot quantum cascade detectors (QD-QCDs) were demonstrated on both GaAs-based [18] and InP-based [19] material system. The hybrid QW/QD absorption region and the stairs-like extraction region allow the detector to respond to normal incident light and work in photovoltaic scheme at the same time.|$|E

The selection of the final <b>focal</b> <b>plan</b> instrument will depend on a trade-off of the ideal instrument versus reality, the number of etalons, the aperture of etalons, the number of blocking filters the electronic control system and computer interfaces, the temperature control and controllers for the etalons and the electronics. The use of existing experience should provide significant cost savings. The heritage of use of etalons and multiple etalon systems in solar physics come from a number of observatories, which includes MSFC Solar Observatory (NASA), Sac Peak Observatory (NSO), and Kiepenheuer Institute for Solar Physics (Germany), Mees Solar Observatory (University of Hawaii), and Arcetri Astrophysical Observatory (Italy). The design of the ATST multiple etalon system will reply on the existing experience from these observatories...|$|E
40|$|Many U. S. {{population}} groups [...] including {{racial and}} ethnic minority groups, such as African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asian Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders, {{as well as some}} geographic and/or socioeconomic groups, such as low-income and rural populations [...] experience a disproportionately high burden of disease and mortality. These disparities prompted Congress in 2000 to pass legislation (P. L. 106 - 525) creating the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD), which serves as a <b>focal</b> point for <b>planning</b> and coordinating of minority health and other health disparities research. This legislation also mandated that the NCMHD, working in coordination with the Institutes and Centers (ICs) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) develop a strategic plan for the reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities. This plan represents the major priorities and range of activities that NIH will undertake to address health disparities, and as such reflects a guiding vision of how NIH will develop research priorities and expend resources to improve the health status of minorities and other health disparity populations...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{understand}} how 35 focal students in a No Excuses high school, a charter school model designed to promote social mobility, made decisions about if and where to go to college. This study draws on college choice, cultural capital, and performance management literature {{to understand how}} the high school context at the focal school influenced students 2 ̆ 7 college choice processes. Drawing on data from interviews, observations, and documents, this exploratory study found that Performance High provided extensive college resources and support to its students, which was consistent with how researchers conceptualize a 2 ̆ 2 college-going culture 2 ̆ 2 in high schools. Further, the high school used a performance management approach, in which administrators held teachers and students accountable for meeting particular college related metrics, such as the number and types of applications students were required to submit. The study found that focal students submitted applications and enrolled in college at high rates. Thirty-four of the 35 <b>focal</b> students <b>planned</b> to attend college the following fall. However, rather than exhibit the sense of entitlement and expectation that research describes for students who benefit from dominant forms of cultural capital, most of the focal students 2 ̆ 7 college choice processes were characterized by hesitation, ambivalence, and doubt. Further, the findings suggest the performance management approach assimilated students to one model of college choice that did not easily accommodate students 2 ̆ 7 preferences. These findings highlight the difficulties for schools in providing cultural capital for students independent of their families, and suggests the need to reconceptualize 2 ̆ 2 college-going cultures 2 ̆ 2 to not only consider the college outcomes and the density of resources in the high school context, but how well students absorb cultural capital, which may be important for social mobility. ...|$|R
40|$|ERC) is an {{innovative}} initiative designed to integrate {{science and engineering}} principles into the K- 12 curriculum. For the past two years, approximately 630 students in grades 3, 4 and 5 at Murchison Elementary School were supported in experiential learning that promoted the understanding of fundamental science and engineering principles. Essentially all MES students are minority students who are underrepresented in STEM professions. ERC faculty and students, in collaboration with MES teachers, designed a series of modules which use BMES research as <b>focal</b> points. Lesson <b>plans</b> are age-appropriate, standards-aligned and incorporate problem-based learning exercises demonstrating scientific discovery. Student motivation and learning was facilitated by ERC mentors who served as role models in the classroom. Formative and summative assessment strategies {{were used in the}} outreach program and included student Science Attitude Surveys and measurements of student achievement in science content and process. Results indicate that significant science achievement was attained by a majority of students but the degree of success was influenced by their English proficiency. The elementary outreach component {{is part of a larger}} BMES ERC effort to establish and sustain a STEM pipeline that extends from K- 12 to graduate school.
