5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings {{be kept in}} good condition by whoever <b>has</b> <b>them.</b> Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works {{should be kept in}} a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be kept away from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting would need to be done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E

Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even <b>has</b> <b>them</b> on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E
5|$|Arha's {{childhood}} and youth are lonely; her only friends are Manan and Penthe, a priestess her own age. She {{is trained in}} her duties by Thar and Kossil, the priestesses of the two other major deities. Thar tells her of the undertomb and the labyrinth beneath the Tombs, teaching her the instructions to find her way around them. She tells of the treasure hidden within the labyrinth, which wizards from the archipelago have tried to steal in past years. When Arha asks about the wizards, Thar tells her that they are unbelievers who can work magic. When she turns fourteen, Arha assumes all the responsibilities of her position, becoming the highest ranked priestess in the Tombs. She is required to order the death of prisoners sent to the Tombs by the God-King of the Kargad lands; she <b>has</b> <b>them</b> killed by starvation, an act which haunts {{her for a long}} time. After Thar dies of old age, Arha becomes increasingly isolated: although stern, Thar had been fair to her. Kossil despises Arha and sees the Nameless Ones as a threat to her power.|$|E

5|$|In North America, Tricholoma pardinum can be {{confused}} with T.nigrum and forms of T.virgatum that have more streaked rather than spotted caps. A form of T.pardinum in North America can be nearly white with pale scales, and may {{be confused}} with the whitish edible species T.resplendens. Microscopically, the presence of clamp connections sets T.pardinum apart from most other members of the genus, although the similar-looking (though more tan-coloured) T.venenatum also <b>has</b> <b>them.</b> According to Alexander H. Smith, T.huronense is closely related, but can be distinguished from T.pardinum by its narrower gills, its tendency to form drops of reddish liquid on the gills and stalk, and an ash-grey and scaly stalk surface.|$|E

They find Daniels, who is killed in an ensuing firefight. The Gorn bring Kirk and Spock to the Commander, who <b>has</b> <b>them</b> taken to an arena to fight his soldiers to the death. Angered by their besting of his champion, the Commander has Spock infected with the virus and pits him against Kirk. Sulu's shuttle arrives and McCoy shoots Spock with an antidote, while the Commander flees to his ship with T'Mar and the device.|$|E

The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus. The Doctor and Christina spot a sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion just recently but now is desert wherever they scan. The Doctor <b>has</b> <b>them</b> scan the approaching sandstorm and finds {{it really is a}} swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem.

He <b>has</b> <b>them</b> watch an episode of an anime called Pichu Bros. and then introduces the game's basic features before leaving them alone.

5|$|The {{mourning}} dove {{is closely related}} to the eared dove (Zenaida auriculata) and the Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni). Some authorities describe them as forming a superspecies and these three birds are sometimes classified in the separate genus Zenaidura, but the current classification <b>has</b> <b>them</b> as separate species in the genus Zenaida. In addition, the Socorro dove has at times been considered conspecific with the {{mourning dove}}, although several differences in behavior, call, and appearance justify separation as two different species. While the three species do form a subgroup of Zenaida, using a separate genus would interfere with the monophyly of Zenaida by making it paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|The {{story was}} redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Hergé was {{assisted}} by Edgar Pierre Jacobs, {{an artist who}} worked as part of Studios Hergé. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version <b>has</b> <b>them</b> dressed in a Balkanised uniform. Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and {{his wife in the}} Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Hergé, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friend's - Édouard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Hergé and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Hergé had introduced in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E
