5|$|Chimbu Deven {{worked as}} a {{cartoonist}} in the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan before venturing into mainstream cinema as an associate to director Cheran in three of his films, Vetri Kodi Kattu (2000), Pandavar Bhoomi (2001) and Autograph (2004). Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei draws inspiration from a cartoon created by Deven, which originally appeared in Ananda Vikatan. Deven, who wrote the script, showed it to director S. Shankar. Shankar {{was impressed with the}} script as soon as <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>it,</b> and offered to produce and distribute the film under his production company S Pictures, making the film his third as producer after Mudhalvan (1999) and Kaadhal (2004).|$|E
5|$|Director Doug Liman {{has said}} that he had been a fan of the source novel by Robert Ludlum since <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> in high school. Near the end of {{production}} of Liman's previous film Swingers, Liman decided to develop a film adaptation of the novel. After more than two years of securing rights to the book from Warner Bros. and a further year of screenplay development with screenwriter Tony Gilroy, the film went through two years of production. Universal Pictures acquired the film rights to Ludlum's books in the hopes of starting a new film franchise. William Blake Herron was brought in to rewrite the script in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Jake Gyllenhaal was {{the first}} to be cast in the film; after {{receiving}} the script, <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> in an hour and immediately contacted Ayer. Michael Peña was cast shortly after, following a string of auditions. He and Gyllenhaal did not bond immediately but gradually became close friends over the process of training and filming. Gyllenhaal and Peña undertook five months of intensive training under the guidance of FitzSimons to prepare for their roles—this included 12-hour ride-alongs with multiple Greater Los Angeles Area law enforcement agencies up to three times a week, as well as training in hand-to-hand combat, police tactics and weapons. On his first ride-along, Gyllenhaal witnessed a murder during a drug bust. Tactical training was also given to the other actors playing police officers, including David Harbour, America Ferrera, Cody Horn, and Frank Grillo.|$|E

5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. <b>He</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E

25|$|The film is an {{adaptation}} of an unpublished novel written by Robinson in late 1969. Actor friend Don Hawkins passed {{a copy of the}} manuscript to his friend, the wealthy oil heir Moderick Schreiber in 1980. Schreiber, looking to break into the film industry, paid Robinson a few thousand pounds sterling to adapt it into a screenplay, which Robinson did in the early 1980s. On completing the script, producer Paul Heller urged Robinson to direct it and found funding for half the film. The script was then passed to HandMade Films. After <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>it,</b> George Harrison agreed to fund the remainder of the film.|$|E

25|$|This rather {{straightforward}} {{account of}} the Ring's origins, however, has been disputed {{by a number of}} authorities, who accuse Wagner of deliberately distorting the facts so as to bring them into harmony with his own private version of history. The actual sequence of events, it seems, was not nearly as clear-cut as he would have us believe. It was in October 1846 – some sixteen months before the February Revolution – that he first drew up a plan for a five-act drama based on the life of Friedrich Barbarossa. He may even have considered writing an opera on Siegfried as early as 1843, when he read Jacob Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie (German Mythology), or possibly in 1844, when he borrowed several works on the Nibelungs from the Royal Library in Dresden. As for Die Wibelungen, it would appear that he only started work on this essay in December 1848 at the earliest, finishing it sometime before 22 February 1849, when <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> to his friend Eduard Devrient.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} study that Dr. Kupferberg introduces to Dr. Melfi, which she later carefully reads and which makes her decide to finally drop Tony Soprano as her patient, is an actual three-volume study called The Criminal Personality, written by Dr. Samuel Yochelson and Dr. Stanton Samenow, published between 1977 and 1986. David Chase discovered the study {{when he and}} some Sopranos writers attended a psychiatric conference. Chase further asked forensic psychologist Nancy Duggan to analyze Tony Soprano's mental state and the progress of his psychotherapy with Melfi; Dugan also opined that talk therapy was enabling Melfi's patient to commit crime and justify his actions for himself. The Criminal Personality greatly impressed Chase after <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> and he decided that its introduction in the show would spell the end of Tony and Melfi's psychotherapy story arc in the series. After the airing of the episode, psychotherapists reported an outpouring of questions and concern from their clientele about the ethics of dropping patients unilaterally. Chase also commented about the seeming lack of finality in Tony Soprano's therapy, stating that its depiction was most realistic as psychotherapy most often is marked with moments of progress but is essentially an endless process until one party decides it has had enough of it.|$|E
25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|E

Chandler, the more experienced politician, attacked Combs for this suggestion, maintaining that an experienced governor like himself would not need to raise taxes to meet the state's obligations. Combs' speech was also attacked as dry and uninspiring, partly because <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> verbatim from prepared notes. [...] "And you said I couldn't give a speech," [...] Doc Beauchamp later complained to Clements. Hugh Morris, chief of the Louisville Courier-Journals Frankfort bureau, commented that [...] "Combs opened and closed his campaign on the same night".|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>it,</b> he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E

500|$|At {{a meeting}} between Follmer and Regali, Follmer says he is {{finished}} consorting with him, but Regali reminds him he was being bribed, and threatens to blackmail him. In the meantime, Mimms tells Scully that he first noticed the case of Luke Doggett when <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> in a newspaper. He further states that he lied about his name {{so that he could}} help solve the case. At the end, he still pushes that Regali is the real murderer of Doggett's son, and not him. Later on, Doggett approaches Regali. Regali tells him a [...] "hypothetical" [...] story about how a pedophile took a young boy to his home. A [...] "businessman" [...] then walked in on the incident, realized that the boy has seen his face, and feared that the boy might associate him with the crime. The businessman then found a solution to the boy seeing his face: he murdered him. Regali then walks away and Doggett, filled with rage, unholsters his gun and follows. But a gunshot rings out and when Doggett gets outside, he sees Regali has been killed by Follmer. Later, Doggett and Barbara scatter Luke's ashes into the ocean, finally achieving the release he has sought.|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt {{had been}} {{approached}} at a British Academy Television Awards ceremony by director Paul Greengrass, who {{wanted him to}} star in a television drama he was making about the 1972 [...] "Bloody Sunday" [...] shootings in Derry. Nesbitt was only seven years old when the shootings happened and was ignorant of its cause; he believed that there was [...] "no smoke without fire" [...] and that the Catholic marchers {{must have done something}} to provoke the British Army. He was filming Cold Feet in Manchester when he received the script. <b>He</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> and found that had [...] "an extraordinary effect" [...] on him. Nesbitt played Ivan Cooper in Bloody Sunday, the man who pressed for the march to go ahead. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Cooper and spent many hours talking to him about his motives on that day. He met with relatives of the victims and watched the televised Bloody Sunday Inquiry with them, and also read Don Mullan's Eyewitness Bloody Sunday and Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson's Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?. Greengrass compared Nesbitt's preparation to an athlete preparing for a race, and told The Observer, [...] "For an Irish actor, doing the Troubles is like doing Lear." [...] Nesbitt had questioned whether he was a good enough actor to effectively portray Cooper and was worried what Derry Catholics would think of a Protestant playing the lead, although Ivan Cooper himself is a Protestant.|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{published}} On the Origin of Species on November24, 1859. The first printing was 1,250 copies, {{with some}} having {{been sent to}} America via ship; one of those was for Gray. Gray's copy arrived just before Christmas, and <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> between Christmas and New Year's. Since there was no international copyright law at the time, Gray worked to protect the book from publishing piracy. According to American law at the time, a copyright could only be secured by an American edition being published by an American citizen, and royalties {{were not required to}} be paid to the author. Gray arranged the first American edition of On the Origin of Species and was able to negotiate royalties on Darwin's behalf. Gray took a 5%royalty from the publisher, and Darwin was so grateful for Gray's efforts that he offered Gray some of his royalties. Darwin held Gray in high esteem: he dedicated his book Forms of Flowers (1877) to Gray, and he wrote in 1881, [...] "there is hardly any one in the world whose approbation I value more highly than I do yours." [...] Seeing the [...] "unity we perceive in nature" [...] and law in the universe, regarding all species he felt [...] "that they not only had a Creator but have a Governor." [...] Gray and Agassiz strongly disagreed; Agassiz was adamantly opposed to the idea of evolution, whereas Gray was a staunch supporter, believing in theistic evolution. As the debate raged over Darwin's theories, the rift between Gray and Agassiz grew deeper, and they were estranged by December 1863, when Gray was elected president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which also marked Agassiz' increasing isolation within the scientific community. Gray showed little interest in scientific politics and resigned from the National Academy of Sciences in 1867. In late 1866 Agassiz apologized to Gray and the two were at least civil to one another again.|$|E
