500|$|In 1755, {{as part of}} the British {{military}} escalation, Major General Edward Braddock {{arrived in}} North America with a force of British Army regulars to head a major effort against the French in the Ohio Country. Washington wanted to serve on the expedition, but refused to do so as a provincial officer, since he would be outranked by even junior officers in the regular army establishment. [...] (Washington was said to [...] " [...] with fury when British regular officers expressed their disdain of provincial officers and soldiers", and at the realization that British officers were always senior to colonials regardless of rank.) Through negotiations mediated by Governor Dinwiddie, Washington was offered an unpaid volunteer position as one of Braddock's aides. [...] Washington accepted, writing to Braddock's principal aide, Captain Robert Orme, [...] "I wish for nothing more earnestly, than to attain a small degree of knowledge in the Military Art", and that the position would provide him [...] "a good opportunity ... of forming an acquaintance which may be serviceable hereafter, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> it worth while pushing my Fortune in the Military way." ...|$|E

When {{speaking}} about her weight loss and diet to Access Hollywood, Sparks said, [...] "My diet has pretty much remained the same, like if I {{want a piece of}} bread, I’m gonna have a piece of bread, but I’m making healthier decisions like instead of a bag of chips for a snack, I’ll see <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> an apple.

He was also charged with threatening to kill an AAIB official involved in {{the investigation into the}} accident. In April 2011, the pilot was found guilty of making death threats. The judge said that the defendant was [...] "clearly extremely disturbed" [...] at the time the offences happened, adding [...] "He is a man who does need help. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> a way of giving him help I will." ...|$|E

In his statement to the committee, he detailed his experiences and expressed his hope that his case will not be repeated. [...] "I now understand how fragile our human rights and freedoms are, and how easily they can be taken from us by the very same governments and institutions that have sworn to protect us. I also know that the only way I {{will ever be able to}} move on in my life and have a future is <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> out why this happened to me, and help prevent it from happening to others." ...|$|E
2500|$|One long-standing {{mystery of}} the {{painting}} is why Mona Lisa features very faint eyebrows and apparently {{does not have any}} eyelashes. In October 2007, Pascal Cotte, a French engineer and inventor, says he discovered with a high-definition camera that Leonardo da Vinci originally did paint eyebrows and eyelashes. Creating an ultra-high resolution close-up that magnified Mona Lisas face 24 times, Cotte says he found a single brushstroke of a single hair above the left eye. [...] "One day I say, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> only one hair, only one hair of the eyebrow, I will have definitively the proof that originally Leonardo da Vinci had painted eyelash and eyebrow," [...] said Cotte. The engineer claims that other eyebrow hairs that potentially could have appeared on the painting may have faded or been inadvertently erased by a poor attempt to clean the painting. In addition, Cotte says his work uncovered proof that her hands were originally painted in a slightly different position than in the final portrait.|$|E

2500|$|Joseph Smith, {{the founder}} of the Latter Day Saint movement, was a strong proponent of capital punishment, and favored {{execution}} methods that involved the shedding of blood as retribution for crimes of bloodshed. In 1843, he or his scribe commented that the common execution method in Christian nations was hanging, [...] "instead of blood for blood according to the law of heaven." [...] Years before making this remark, however, Smith was quoted as saying that the hanging of Judas Iscariot was not a suicide, but an execution carried out by Saint Peter. In a March 4, 1843 debate with church leader George A. Smith, who argued against capital punishment, Smith said that if he ever had the opportunity to enact a death penalty law, he [...] "was opposed to hanging" [...] the convict; rather, he would [...] "shoot him, or cut off his head, spill his blood on the ground, and let the smoke thereof ascend up to God." [...] In the church's April 6, 1843 general conference, Smith said he would [...] "wring a thief's neck off <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> him, if I cannot bring him to justice any other way." [...] Sidney Rigdon, Smith's counselor in the First Presidency, also supported capital punishment involving the spilling of blood, stating, [...] "There are men standing in your midst that you can't do anything with them but cut their throat and bury them." [...] On the other hand, Smith was willing to tolerate the presence of men [...] "as corrupt as the devil himself" [...] in Nauvoo, Illinois, who [...] "had been guilty of murder and robbery," [...] in the chance that they might [...] "come to the waters of baptism ...|$|E

It was indeed a heart-breaking sight. The habitation which he had left in its seclusion, beside the mountain-stream, surrounded with every evidence of rustic plenty, was now a wasted and blackened ruin. From amongst the shattered and sable walls the smoke continued to rise. The turf-stack, the barn-yard, the offices stocked with cattle, all the wealth of an upland cultivator of the period, of which poor Elliot possessed no common share, had been laid waste or carried off in a single night. He stood a moment motionless, and then exclaimed, [...] "I am ruined--ruined to the ground!--But curse on the warld's gear--Had it not been the week before the bridal--But I am nae babe, to sit down and greet about it. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> but <b>find</b> Grace, and my grandmother, and my sisters weel, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go to the wars in Flanders, as my gude-sire did, under the Bellenden banner, wi' auld Buccleuch.
