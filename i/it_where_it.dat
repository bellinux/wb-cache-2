25|$|The {{only way}} California can support its {{extensive}} population and agriculture is to store water in numerous reservoirs and use pipes, tunnels, pumps and canals to distribute <b>it</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is needed {{when it is}} needed. Beginning before 1900, California has built extensive water projects costing many {{billions of dollars to}} store and move water where it is needed. California water comes primarily from snowfall in the Sierra Nevada {{in the northern part of}} the state during the relatively short winter from about October to March. The rest of the year typically has very little rainfall or snowfall. California weather is also prone to extended droughts that can last several years. During an average rainfall year, about 14% of the power used in California is generated by hydroelectricity.|$|E

The singers wore white T-shirts and jeans and during the end of the performance went under cascading water on stage. While reviewing a show by the group in the UK, Adenike Adenitire writing for MTV News found the performance to be somehow casual: [...] "It was like watching three young girls and their friends practicing their moves at a slumber party. It was a perfect note of DC harmony to end a night that celebrated both the group and the individuals within it." [...] Barbara Ellen from The Observer felt that the song worked as a [...] "stupendous encore".

He considered its story to be [...] "good" [...] but [...] "nothing great" [...] and its graphics to be [...] "decent"; but he commented that the game was [...] "really all about the gameplay", which he praised as [...] "quite compelling and fun". Benjamin E. Sones of Computer Games Magazine considered the game's story to be [...] "quite good", but he faulted Looking Glass for failing to detail the events of the first game for new players. He wrote that Thief IIs graphics were passable but that its sound design was [...] "phenomenal". Sones praised its missions as [...] "very well crafted", and noted that they gave the impression of being in [...] "a living, breathing world."

500|$|The {{game was}} criticized for its {{graphics}} and engine, which reviewers considered to be outdated. G4 called the engine [...] "old" [...] and [...] "clunky", and PC Format said that [...] "the whole thing {{is limited by the}} creaking engine." [...] However, certain sources praised the engine. Game Informer called it [...] "the best role-playing engine that has ever been invented," [...] and GameSpot said that [...] "'immortal' may be a better word to describe the engine, because the fact is, Icewind Dale II plays great." [...] In regards to the graphics, GameSpot said that [...] "in many ways Icewind Dale II represents the best use of the Infinity Engine's prerendered, isometric settings to date, [...] that doesn't change the fact that Icewind Dale II generally looks dated." [...] IGN thought the sprites had become out-dated, and that [...] "the animations are crude by today's standards." [...] New Straits Times agreed, saying that although some of the effects were attractive, the [...] "dated Infinity engine" [...] could not compare to contemporaries Dungeon Siege and Neverwinter Nights. However, Computer Gaming World believed that [...] "it consistently offers the same striking and imaginative environments that establish the tone and immersive charm of the game," [...] and Computer Games Magazine said, [...] "it may not look like much, but it's got <b>it</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> counts." [...] The game's pre-rendered backgrounds received praise. IGN said that [...] "the artwork is attractive, both conceptually and in its final form," [...] and Game Informer called them [...] "beautiful". Many reviewers complained about the game's pathfinding AI, which PC Zone called [...] "outrageously bad." ...|$|E

John Wesley said the peacemakers 'endeavour to calm the stormy spirits of men, to quiet their turbulent passions, to soften the minds of contending parties, and, if possible, reconcile them to each other.

2500|$|The {{presence}} of Placidianus inspired {{the city of}} Augustodunum Haeduorum to abandon Victorinus and declare its intention to declare for Claudius Gothicus.

Victorinus returned to Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium in triumph. It remains a mystery just why Claudius did not authorise Placidianus {{to go to the}} relief of Augustodunum Haeduorum; however, it is speculated that Claudius, who was fully engaged either in Italy against the Alamanni or in the Balkans against the Goths, did not wish to open a second theatre of operations in Gaul, which would not only have involved a major military effort, but would also have required Claudius to assume responsibility for the defense of the Rhine frontier had he been successful. There is evidence to suggest that Claudius was having some difficulties in the East, which also occupied his attention.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) (or carbon capture and {{sequestration}} or carbon control and sequestration) {{is the process}} of capturing waste carbon dioxide (...) from large point sources, such as fossil fuel power plants, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing <b>it</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> will not enter the atmosphere, normally an underground geological formation.
