5|$|Chaplin {{founded a}} new {{production}} company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting. Filming in England proved a difficult experience, {{as he was}} used to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had limitless production time. According to Robinson, this had an effect {{on the quality of the}} film. A King <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews. Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. A King <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> not shown in America until 1973.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his duties in Iran, Juskalian assumed {{the role of}} chief of operations and training at the headquarters of the First Army that commanded all U.S. Army installations in New England, New York and New Jersey. His posting <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> cut short by the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and Juskalian was sent to France to join the 1st Logistical Command. When the 1st Logistical Command was merged with the 4th Logistical Command at Verdun, Juskalian was transferred to this command, serving as the G-3 chief of plans, operations and training.|$|E
5|$|Calls {{were made}} in New York for {{legislation}} to prevent the growth of skyscrapers, citing their effect on the city skylines, but these attempts faced legal obstacles. The United States Constitution did not give local government authority to prevent the buildings {{on the grounds of}} aesthetics alone, and any such law <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> considered likely to face judicial challenge.|$|E

5|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} between the then-Kingdom of Serbia and the United States were established in the 19th century. In 1879, the Serbian Consulate-General <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> opened. On February 3, 1882, the Serbian Parliament adopted a contract and Convention of diplomatic {{relations between}} the Kingdom of Serbia and the United States, given by King Milan Obrenović. The United States Senate adopted both documents on July 5, 1882 without debate or amendments. On November 10, 1882, Eugene Schuyler became the first United States ambassador in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Flash floods {{occurred}} in mountainous regions of southeastern New York, including Port Jervis along the Delaware River. Wappinger Creek flooded to cause heavy damage. Most streams in the Rondout Creek basin left damage due to fast-moving waters, including heavy damage near Ellenville. Damage <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> largely limited {{to an area}} between Port Jervis and Poughkeepsie. Several bridges were destroyed along the Bash Bish Brook, and portions of U.S. Route 209 were flooded. Damage totaled $16.2million, {{and there was one}} death in the state.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Sotomayor {{was part}} of the judge panel that ruled in Swedenburg v. Kelly that New York's law prohibiting out-of-state wineries from {{shipping}} directly to consumers <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> constitutional even though in-state wineries were allowed to. The case, which invoked the 21st Amendment, was appealed and attached to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court later on as Swedenburg v. Kelly and was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.|$|E

5|$|In New York, Sanders {{encountered}} {{a different form}} of racism. At Montefiore Hospital, where she performed her clinical training, black nurses were given worse assignments than white nurses. White patients sometimes were abusive toward black nurses. While the racial climate <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> better than the situation in Alabama, Sanders frequently wondered whether she had merely exchanged Jim Crow racism for a more genteel prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Lambert {{proved to}} be unable to mix the track, and a fresh attempt at {{recording}} was made {{at the start of}} April at Mick Jagger's house, Stargroves, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Glyn Johns was invited to help with production, and he decided to re-use the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the re-recording of the part <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> felt to be inferior to the original. Keith Moon had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played electric guitar and bass.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Astaire, Donen took dance {{lessons in}} Columbia and {{performed}} at the local Town Theater. His family often traveled to New York City during summer vacations where he saw Broadway musicals and took further dance lessons. One of his early instructors <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> Ned Wayburn, who had taught eleven-year-old Astaire in 1910. After {{graduating from high school}} at sixteen, Donen attended the University of South Carolina for one summer semester, studying psychology. Encouraged by his mother, he moved to New York City to pursue dancing on stage in the fall of 1940. After two auditions he was cast as a chorus dancer in the original Broadway production of Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, directed by the legendary George Abbott. The title role of Pal Joey was played by the young up-and-comer Gene Kelly, who became a Broadway star in the role.|$|E

5|$|The franchise's first {{manager was}} Hall of Famer John McGraw, who managed {{the team for}} one year {{and part of a}} second before {{becoming}} manager of the New York Giants. In 1903, the team moved from Baltimore to New York, where it was initially known as the New York Highlanders. Its first manager <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> Clark Griffith, who managed the team from 1903 to 1908. Miller Huggins was the next manager to manage the team for more than three seasons. Huggins took over the managerial duties in 1918 and led the Yankees to six American League championships and three World Series titles until his death in 1929. Huggins won 1,067 regular season games with the Yankees, which ranks fourth all-time among Yankee managers.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} and successful visiting artist was Jimi Hendrix who in early 1966, after {{years on the}} chitlin circuit as sideman for major R acts as well as playing in bands <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>was</b> invited to England to record as a solo artist by former Animals bassist Chas Chandler. With Mitch Mitchell on drums and Noel Redding on bass, the band formed around him as The Jimi Hendrix Experience became major stars in the UK, with three top ten hits in early 1967. it was followed later that year by the psychedelic album Are You Experienced?, which became a major hit in the US after Hendrix's triumphant return at the Monterey Pop Festival and {{made him one of}} the major figures of late 60s rock.|$|E
5|$|There are 62 {{counties}} {{in the state of}} New York. The original twelve counties were created immediately after the British takeover of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, although two of these counties have since been abolished. The most recent county formation <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> in 1914, when Bronx County was created from the portions of New York City that had been annexed from Westchester County in the late 19th century and added to New York County. New York's counties are named for a variety of Native American words; British provinces, counties, cities, and royalty; early American statesmen and military personnel; and New York State politicians.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the second day, June 23, the Committee on Permanent Organization {{announced}} the roster of officers, including the permanent president, John W. Stevenson of Kentucky. Before the delegates could formally elect Stevenson, they heard the report on the Committee on Credentials. Two rival factions of Massachusetts Democrats had agreed to compromise, both being admitted as a united delegation. A similar dispute <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> not resolved so easily: Tammany Hall and Tilden's Irving Hall had sent rival delegations as well, and neither was willing to compromise. The Committee had voted to consider the Irving Hall Democrats to have been regularly elected; Tammany was consequently excluded. Debate followed, in which some delegates urged compromise, with the idea that a united delegation would help unite the party in New York in the coming general election. The argument was unpersuasive, as the delegates endorsed the Committee's decision by a vote of 457 to 205½; Tammany was banished. Stevenson was then installed as permanent chairman and, as the Committee on Resolutions had not finished writing the platform, the delegates moved on to nominations.|$|E
5|$|Barbirolli's first concert <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> on 5 November 1936. The {{programme}} {{consisted of}} short pieces by Berlioz and Arnold Bax, and symphonies by Mozart (the Linz) and Brahms (the Fourth). During his ten weeks, he programmed several American novelties including Charles Martin Loeffler's tone-poem Memories of My Childhood, a symphony by Anis Fuleihan, and Philip James's Bret Harte overture. He also conducted Serge Koussevitzky's Double Bass Concerto. The players told the Philharmonic management {{that they would}} be happy for Barbirolli to be appointed to a permanent position. The outcome of this was an invitation to him to become Music Director and Permanent Conductor for three years starting with the 1937–38 season. At the same time as this great change in his professional life, Barbirolli's personal life was also transformed. His marriage had not lasted; within four years he and Marjorie Barbirolli had been living apart. In 1938 she sued for divorce on the grounds of his desertion. The suit was undefended, and the divorce was granted in December 1938. In 1939, Barbirolli married the British oboist Evelyn Rothwell. The marriage lasted for the rest of Barbirolli's life.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Peace Bell at the {{headquarters}} of the United Nations <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> donated by Japan in 1954 as a symbol of world peace. It was created using metal reclaimed from coins and medals provided by donors from around the globe. Similar bells representing a commitment to the cause of world peace can be found in many civic areas, including Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park. In 1995, the city of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, erected a four-ton peace bell– a replica of one of the Hiroshima bells– in the city centre as part of its fiftieth-anniversary celebrations, and to strengthen ties with Japan. The Oak Ridge Friendship Bell is decorated with dates relating to Oak Ridge's connection to Japan (the uranium used in the Hiroshima atomic bomb was produced in Oak Ridge). In 1998, a local citizen sued the city over the bell, claiming that it was a Buddhist symbol and violated local laws and the US Constitution. The case was ruled in favour of the City of Oak Ridge.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies opened May {{against the}} division-rival New York Mets, losing the opening {{game of the}} month, 7–4. Back-to-back walks in the tenth inning of the Saturday {{afternoon}} game gave the Phillies their first win of the season over the Mets. After a rainout, the Phillies opened their first series in St. Louis with the Cardinals. They won {{the first game of}} the series on Howard's second grand slam in as many weeks after a pitchers' duel between starters Kyle Lohse and Joe Blanton and completed the two-game series sweep with a 10–7 victory on May 5, capped by a Jayson Werth three-run home run and a 4-for-5 performance from Victorino. The Phillies' brief stop <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> marred by a two-game series sweep; Phillies hitters were shut down by Mets starters Johan Santana and Mike Pelfrey, and closer Francisco Rodríguez recorded saves in both games of the series. The following series was barely better, as the Phillies dropped two games to the Braves.|$|E
5|$|Turner {{had never}} been a head coach before; he faced a team {{convinced}} that Baugh had been treated shabbily by Wismer and had difficulty uniting the players. After the Titans split their first two games against Oakland and the Chargers (who had moved to San Diego), the team came home to no paychecks. The players refused to practice, though they worked out on their own on Friday. They then flew to Buffalo and defeated the winless Bills. Public attention <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>was</b> focused on the established local teams, as well as the abysmal record of the fledgling Mets, who nevertheless attracted a cult following. The Titans received little publicity and attracted only 4,719 fans to the home opener against Denver. They were required to wait {{until the end of the}} Mets' season before they were allowed to use the Polo Grounds. The Broncos defeated the Titans, 32–10, and Titans quarterback Dean Look suffered a career-ending injury. New York's financial and football woes continued through October 1962, and at the beginning of November, Wismer informed AFL commissioner Joe Foss that he lacked the money to continue operations. The league assumed the cost of running the team for the rest of 1962; Wismer remained in nominal charge. The Titans had little success on the field (the highlight was a 46–45 victory at favored Denver on Thanksgiving), and finished the season insolvent with a 5–9 record.|$|E
