25|$|After {{the end of}} the war Gibbs {{invested}} in a chain of laundrettes, but his career shifted after a friend introduced him to actress Muriel Pavlow. He and Pavlow became lifelong friends, and Pavlow in turn introduced him to dramatic critic of The Daily Telegraph, W A Darlington. Darlington invited Gibbs to review some minor works for the paper as a stringer. During this period, the Telegraph's film critic, George Campbell Dixon, was frequently ill and Gibbs often picked up his work. In 1960, Dixon left the post and Gibbs took over his duties. He was an observant critic, but sometimes irked readers with his <b>detailed</b> <b>summary</b> of a film's plot. He had little time for celebrity or the Hollywood system and his reviews were independent and tended to concentrate on acting and production.|$|E

500|$|Edgecombe's {{trial began}} on 14 March but Keeler, {{one of the}} Crown's key witnesses, was missing. She had, without informing the court, gone to Spain, {{although}} at this stage her whereabouts were unknown. Her unexplained absence caused a press sensation. Every newspaper knew the rumours linking Keeler with Profumo, but refrained from reporting any direct connection; {{in the wake of}} the Radcliffe inquiry they were, in Wigg's later words, [...] "willing to wound but afraid to strike". They could only hint, by front-page juxtapositions of stories and photographs, that Profumo might be connected to Keeler's disappearance. Despite her absence the judge proceeded with the case; Edgecombe was found guilty on a lesser charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. A few days after the trial, on 21 March, the satirical magazine Private Eye printed the most <b>detailed</b> <b>summary</b> so far of the rumours, with the main characters lightly disguised: [...] "Mr James Montesi", [...] "Miss Gaye Funloving", [...] "Dr Spook" [...] and [...] "Vladimir Bolokhov".|$|E
500|$|Following the 1936 {{general strike}} {{that was to}} {{degenerate}} into the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the most significant outbreak of violence since the Mandate began, a British Royal Commission – a high profile public inquiry – was appointed to investigate {{the causes of the}} unrest. The [...] "Palestine Royal Commission", appointed with significantly broader terms of reference than the previous British inquiries into Palestine, completed its 404-page report after sixmonths of work in June 1937, publishing it a month later. The report began by describing the history of the problem, including a <b>detailed</b> <b>summary</b> of the origins of the Balfour Declaration. Much of this summary relied on Lloyd-George's personal testimony; Balfour had died in 1930 and Sykes in 1919. He told the commission that the declaration was made [...] "due to propagandist reasons... In particular Jewish sympathy would confirm the support of American Jewry, and would {{make it more difficult for}} Germany to reduce her military commitments and improve her economic position on the eastern front". Two years later, in his Memoirs, Lloyd George described a total of nine factors motivating his decision as Prime Minister to release the declaration, including the additional reasons that a Jewish presence in Palestine would strengthen Britain's position on the Suez Canal and reinforce the route to their imperial dominion in India.|$|E

2500|$|Under {{increasing}} pressure, {{the government}} appointed a Royal Commission on Vaccination in 1889, which issued six reports between 1892 and 1896, with a <b>detailed</b> <b>summary</b> in 1898. Its recommendations {{were incorporated into}} the 1898 Vaccination Act, which still required compulsory vaccination but allowed exemption {{on the grounds of}} conscientious objection on presentation of a certificate signed by two magistrates. These were not easy to obtain in towns where magistrates supported compulsory vaccination, and after continued protests, a further act in 1907 allowed exemption on a simple signed declaration. Although this solved the immediate problem, the compulsory vaccination acts remained legally enforceable, and determined opponents lobbied for their repeal. No Compulsory Vaccination was one of the demands of the 1900 Labour Party General Election Manifesto.

2500|$|Lactantius {{provides}} a <b>detailed</b> <b>summary</b> of the Oracles of Hystaspes in his Divinae Institutiones (Book VII, {{from the end}} of chapter 15 through chapter 19). It begins with Hystaspes awaking from a dream, and needing to have it interpreted for him. This is duly accomplished by a young boy, [...] "here representing, according to convention, the openness of youth and innocent to divine visitations. [...] " [...] As interpreted by the boy, the dream [...] "predicts" [...] the iniquity of the last age, and the impending destruction of the wicked by fire. The divine fire will burn both the righteous and the wicked, but only the wicked will be hurt and neither will be destroyed. During the eschatological inferno, the [...] "followers of truth" [...] will separate themselves from the wicked and ascend a mountain. The evil king who dominates the world will be angered on hearing this, and he will resolve to encircle the mountain with his army. The righteous implore to [...] "Jupiter", who sends them a saviour, who will descend from heaven accompanied by angels and before him a flaming sword. Hystaspes [...] "prophesies" [...] that the wicked king (i.e. the Roman emperor) will survive the destruction of his armies, but will lose power. [...] It was [...] "presumably" [...] the prophecy of the destruction of a victorious power (i.e. the Roman empire) that caused the work to be proscribed by Rome; according to Justin Martyr (Apologia, I. 44. 12), reading the work was punishable by death.|$|E
60|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{has been}} treated at great length in these volumes; for, as I have attempted to shew, it has played {{an important part in}} the history of the organic world. As summaries have been given to each chapter, it would be superfluous here to add a <b>detailed</b> <b>summary.</b> I am aware that much remains doubtful, but I have endeavoured to give a fair view of the whole case. In the lower divisions of the animal kingdom, sexual selection seems to have done nothing: such animals are often affixed for life to the same spot, or have the two sexes combined in the same individual, or what is still more important, their perceptive and intellectual faculties are not sufficiently advanced to allow of the feelings of love and jealousy, or of the exertion of choice. When, however, we come to the Arthropoda and Vertebrata, even to the lowest classes in these two great Sub-Kingdoms, sexual selection has effected much; and it deserves notice that we here find the intellectual faculties developed, but in two very distinct lines, to the highest standard, namely in the Hymenoptera (ants, bees, &c.) amongst the Arthropoda, and in the Mammalia, including man, amongst the Vertebrata.|$|E
