Using focal ionophoresis and pressure injections to apply <b>glutamate</b> and other agonists including NMDA, AMPA, and kainate to {{different regions of the}} neurons, he noticed that certain hot spots were desensitized more rapidly that other sites on the neuron. Fischbach and his collaborators hypothesized that these hot spots may be located at synapses between neurons, where clusters of <b>glutamate</b> receptors were present.|$|E
5|$|Ibotenic {{acid and}} {{muscimol}} are structurally {{related to each}} other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA <b>glutamate</b> receptors and certain metabotropic <b>glutamate</b> receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication. Muscimol is the agent responsible for the majority of the psychoactivity.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into organic compounds {{in the form}} of <b>glutamate,</b> formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid.

50|$|A {{computational}} study, {{combined with}} the available experimental data, suggests the following atomic-resolution mechanism for glyoxalase I. In the active site, the catalytic metal adopts an octahedral coordination geometry and, {{in the absence of}} substrate, binds two waters, two opposite <b>glutamates,</b> a histidine and one other sidechain, usually another histidine or <b>glutamates.</b> When the substrate enters the active site, the two waters are shed and the two carbonyl oxygens of the substrate are bound directly to the metal ion. The two opposing <b>glutamates</b> add and subtract protons from C1 and C2 and their respective oxygens, O1 and O2. The first half of the reaction transfers a proton from C1 to O2, whereas the second half transfers a proton from O1 to C2. The former reaction may be carried out by either of the opposing <b>glutamates,</b> depending on the initial chirality of C1 in the hemithioacetal substrate; however, the second half is stereospecific and is carried out by only one of the opposing <b>glutamates.</b>|$|R

40|$|During early {{stationary}} phase, Bacillus subtilis NAFM 5 produces capsular poly(c-glutamic acid) (cPGA, 26106 Da), {{which contains}} D- and L-glutamate, and then degrades it during late stationary phase. The c-glutamyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 2. 2; GGT) of this strain successively hydrolysed cPGA from the amino-terminal end, to yield both D- and L-glutamate. This enzyme was specifically synthesized during the stationary phase through transcriptional {{activation of the}} corresponding ggt gene by the ComQXPA quorum-sensing system. A ggt knockout mutant degraded cPGA into 16105 Da fragments, but not any further, indicating that the capsule cPGA is first internally degraded by an endo-type of cPGA hydrolase into 16105 Da intermediates, then externally into <b>glutamates</b> via GGT. Due to its inability to generate the <b>glutamates</b> from the capsule, the ggt mutant sporulated more frequently than the wild-type strain. The results show that B. subtilis GGT has a powerful exo-c-glutamyl hydrolase activity that participates in capsule cPGA degradation to supply stationary-phase cells with constituent <b>glutamates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Chemotactic {{transducer}} proteins of Escherichia coli contain {{four or five}} methyl-accepting <b>glutamates</b> {{that are}} crucial for sensory adaptation and gradient sensing. Two residues arise from posttranslational deamidation of glutamines to yield methyl-accepting <b>glutamates.</b> We addressed {{the significance of this}} arrangement by creating two mutated trg genes: trg(5 E), coding for a transducer in which all five modification sites were synthesized as <b>glutamates,</b> and trg(5 Q), in which all five were glutamines. We found that the normal (3 E, 2 Q) configuration was not an absolute requirement for synthesis, assembly, or stable maintenance of transducers. Both mutant proteins were methylated, although Trg(5 Q) had a reduced number of methyl-accepting sites because two glutamines at adjacent residues were blocked for deamidation and thus could not become methyl-accepting <b>glutamates.</b> The glutamine-glutamate balance had striking effects on signaling state. Trg(5 E) was in a strong counterclockwise signaling configuration, and Trg(5 Q) was in a strong clockwise signaling induced by ligand binding, and alanines substituted at modification sites had an intermediate effect. Chemotactic migration by growing cells containing trg(5 E) or trg(5 Q) exhibited reduced effectiveness, probably reflecting perturbations of the counterclockwise/clockwise ratio caused by newly synthesized transducers not modified rapidly enough to produce a balanced signaling state during growth. These defects were evident for cells in which other transducers were not available to contribute to balanced signaling or were present at lower levels than the mutant proteins...|$|R

40|$|Denitrification is an {{anaerobic}} process {{performed by}} several soil bacteria {{as an alternative}} to aerobic respiration. A key-step in denitrification (the N-N-bond is made) is catalyzed by nitric oxide reductase (NOR); 2 NO + 2 e- + 2 H+ → N 2 O + H 2 O. NOR from Paracoccus denitrificans {{is a member of the}} heme copper oxidase superfamily (HCuOs), where the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase is the classical example. NOR is situated in the cytoplasmic membrane and can, as a side reaction, catalyze the reduction of oxygen to water. NORs have properties that make them divergent members of the HCuOs; the reactions they catalyze are not electrogenic and they do not pump protons. They also have five strictly conserved <b>glutamates</b> in their catalytic subunit (NorB) that are not conserved in the ‘classical’ HCuOs. It has been asked whether the protons used in the reaction really come from the periplasm and if so how do the protons proceed through the protein into the catalytic site? In order to find out whether the protons are taken from the periplasm or the cytoplasm and in order to pinpoint the proton-route in NorB, we studied electron- and proton transfer during a single- as well as multiple turnovers, using time resolved optical spectroscopy. Wild type NOR and several variants of the five conserved <b>glutamates</b> were investigated in their solubilised form or/and reconstituted into vesicles. The results demonstrate that protons needed for the reaction indeed are taken from the periplasm and that all but one of the conserved <b>glutamates</b> are crucial for the oxidative phase of the reaction that is limited by proton uptake to the active site. In this thesis it is proposed, using a model of NorB, that two of the <b>glutamates</b> are located at the entrance of the proton pathway which also contains two of the other <b>glutamates</b> close to the active site...|$|R
5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person.

5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, <b>glutamate,</b> and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and <b>glutamate</b> is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E

5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or <b>glutamate)</b> {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or <b>glutamate,</b> leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad.

Contrary to this proposal, evidence is presented here that the four <b>glutamates</b> in Nef do not functionally engage the PACS- 1 fbr.
