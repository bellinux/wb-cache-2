25|$|Through the {{humanities}} we {{reflect on the}} fundamental question: What does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world where irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.|$|E

5000|$|Kierkegaard {{seems to}} have {{fulfilled}} his goal presented in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, where he said it had become clear to him that people had forgotten what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be religious (confession and repentance before God) and had also forgotten what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be {{a human being and}} had therefore also forgotten what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> try to become a Christian. He put it this way. [...] The main thought was that, because of the copiousness of knowledge, people in our day have forgotten what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> exist, and what inwardness is, and that the misunderstanding between speculative thought and Christianity could be explained by that. I resolved to go back as far as possible in order not to arrive too soon at what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> exist religiously, not to mention existing Christianly-religiously, and in that way leave dubieties behind me. If people had forgotten what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> exist religiously, they had probably also forgotten what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> exist humanly. I resolved to begin: first was to have the existence relation between esthetic and ethical come into existence in an existing human. But this must not on any account be done didactically, because then the misunderstanding would in a new misunderstanding instantly make capital of the explanatory attempt, as if existing consisted in coming to know something about a particular point. If this is communicated as knowledge, the recipient is mistakenly induced to understand that he is gaining something to know, and then we are back in knowledge again.

500|$|Philosophy of {{mathematics}} {{is concerned with}} the philosophical foundations and implications {{of mathematics}}. The central questions are whether numbers, triangles, and other mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind and {{what is the nature of}} mathematical propositions. Is asking whether [...] "1+1=2" [...] is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was calculus invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires experience or reason alone. What does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> prove a mathematical theorem and how does one know whether a mathematical proof is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and logic, human capabilities such as intuition, and the material universe.|$|E
500|$|An {{entertainment}} {{might go}} beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience. [...] Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: [...] "What {{is the meaning}} of life?"; [...] "What does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be human?"; [...] "What {{is the right thing to}} do?"; or [...] "How do I know what I know?". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include Shakespeare's influential play Hamlet, whose hero articulates these concerns in poetry; and films, such as The Matrix, which explores the nature of knowledge and was released world-wide. Novels give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers. An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Originally a radio comedy, this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, audiobook, LP record, adventure game and online game, its ideas became popular references (see Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and has been translated into many languages. Its themes encompass the meaning of life, as well as [...] "the ethics of entertainment, artificial intelligence, multiple worlds, God, and philosophical method".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said he {{was particularly}} interested in the Marie and Jesse characters this episode, and called it a credit to the show's evolution that the supporting cast subplots can be so interesting without Walt. He also praised David Slade's direction, particularly during the jumpshots in Jesse's scenes. Seth Amitin of IGN called it a [...] "great episode" [...] and an improvement over the previous two, [...] "Box Cutter" [...] and [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub". He praised the way Skyler's character proved herself to both Walter and Saul, and praised Betsy Brandt's performance, claiming her subplot provided much-needed comic relief and reminded him of the works of David Sedaris. Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz praised the development of Skyler's character and said the episode touched upon a common theme in Breaking Bad about masculinity. With Skyler asserting herself in Walter's work, and Hank taking out his insecurities about being disabled on Marie, Maerz said the script raises the question, [...] "What does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be a strong man?" [...] Los Angeles Times writer Todd VanDerWerff called it [...] "one of the best episodes this show has ever done", despite diverting the attention from Walter to the support cast members. VanDerWerff said the episode well demonstrated how Walter's actions affected others around him and said Marie's character was more interesting than in the past.|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} of the season, which begins with episode 11, takes place three months after the events of episode 10. On the {{structure}} of the season and shifting the focus between the two parts, Bell stated it was the intent to follow the format from season two, by tying [...] "a whole bunch of [...] but not all of them off by the midseason. And then we launch something exciting for the back half...the promise of more to come." [...] Whedon added that [...] "though we do break the season up, we feel that the season as a whole is one arc" [...] and so the series would explore the same themes in the second half, [...] "themes {{of what it means to}} be human and Inhuman. What does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> all these people when they have to live with their actions? Are they capable of the things their enemies are capable of?...What is the true nature of a person? Is everybody capable of everything if put in a terrible position? Or is there true good and a true evil?" [...] The second half of the season sees the introduction of the comics' right-wing hate group the Watchdogs, depicted as radicals wishing to [...] "eliminate the Inhumans", as well as a [...] "cure" [...] that can prevent terrigenisis in yet-to-transition Inhumans.|$|E
500|$|On the {{decision}} to downplay Raziel's quest for vengeance against Kain in this sequel, Hennig explained, [...] "he's being pretty simple-minded, he's sort of being very black-and-white in his interpretation of things, and being kind of petulant [...] he's not really as heroic as Kain is, {{and he has a}} lot of stuff to figure out, basically, about what's going on". Soul Reaver 2 was crafted to feature a more cinematic, story-focused experience than its predecessor, which the developers felt had been [...] "patchy" [...] in this regard. It entered production after Blood Omen 2, but shipped almost six months before the latter game. A separate team within Crystal Dynamics, with creative autonomy, developed Blood Omen 2, and contradictions created by its scenario hindered work on Soul Reaver 2. After researching time travel fiction, Hennig devised a subplot concerning temporal paradoxes to resolve the continuity problems between both titles, and established that Blood Omen 2s story is a product of the final paradox created when Kain saves Raziel at the end of Soul Reaver 2. Other themes were inspired by the works of Joseph Campbell, and theology surrounding Gnosticism. Concepts which formulated the crux of the story included the idea [...] "that the only way a hero can ever succeed is by following his own path", and the question, [...] "can you change history or not? And if so, what does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> change history - in terms of being responsible for the repercussions?" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{writing for}} Batman, Hill {{considered}} that a fundamental {{aspect of the}} character was how he interacts with his villains, allies, and the city around him. Hill said: [...] "You know, what does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be Batman? ...How does it affect Batman when things happen to him? What is his psychological make up? Those are the influences behind the game... you actually delve into the psyche of what makes him what he is, which is where I think {{so much of the}} interest in Batman is." [...] Batman's armor was redesigned to match that of the Batmobile to make them appear visually similar—featuring the same shapes and material textures—and appear functionally compatible with the high-speed methods in which the character enters and exits the vehicle. The design also added armor over Batman's shoulders, covering the previously exposed cape, to make it appear more feasible that it could hold Batman's weight without failing during gliding. For other returning characters, art director David Hego said that the designs were conceived to keep them interesting after players had seen them several times before in previous games, while the game's autumnal setting also necessitated a change in character clothing over the winter setting of Arkham City. The Penguin lost his long coat, and was made to look dirtier, his clothing showing signs of sweat and food stains, and his head was shaved. For Two-Face, the designers felt the character did not require changing significantly, and instead emphasized existing character traits, particularly his disfigured flesh, using references of burnt flesh as inspiration. Similarly, they wanted to retain the typical Riddler characterizations like green shirts emblazoned with question marks, but instead had the character design evolve throughout the game, modifying his own costume in response to the events of the plot.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{began to}} write again in 1847. His first work in this period was Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits which {{was made up of}} three parts. It {{included}} Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing, What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air, and The Gospel of Sufferings. These questions are asked, What does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be a single individual who wants to do the good? What does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be a human being? What does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> follow Christ? He now moves from [...] "upbuilding (Edifying) discourses" [...] to [...] " [...] discourses", however, he still maintains that these are not [...] "sermons". [...] A sermon is about struggle with oneself about the tasks life offers one and about repentance for not completing the tasks. Later, in 1849, he wrote [...] discourses and Godly discourses.Is it really hopelessness to reject the task because it is too heavy; is it really hopelessness almost to collapse under the burden because it is so heavy; is it really hopelessness to give up hope out of fear of the task? Oh no, but this is hopelessness: to will with all one's might-but there is no task. Thus, only if there is nothing to do and if the person who says it were without guilt before God-for if he is guilty, there is indeed always something to do-only if there is nothing to do and this is understood to mean that there is no task, only then is there hopelessness.

2500|$|Subjectivity is {{that which}} the individual—and no one else—has. But what does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> have {{something}} like this? It cannot be understood {{in the same way}} as having a car or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society’s, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{attempting}} to define noise music and its value, Paul Hegarty (2007) cites {{the work of}} noted cultural critics Jean Baudrillard, Georges Bataille and Theodor Adorno and through their work traces the history of [...] "noise". He defines noise at different times as [...] "intrusive, unwanted", [...] "lacking skill, not being appropriate" [...] and [...] "a threatening emptiness". He traces these trends starting with 18th-century concert hall music. Hegarty contends that it is John Cage's composition 4'33", in which an audience sits through {{four and a half}} minutes of [...] "silence" [...] (Cage 1973), that represents the beginning of noise music proper. For Hegarty, [...] "noise music", as with 4'33", is that music made up of incidental sounds that represent perfectly the tension between [...] "desirable" [...] sound (properly played musical notes) and undesirable [...] "noise" [...] that make up all noise music from Erik Satie to NON to Glenn Branca. Writing about Japanese noise music, Hegarty suggests that [...] "it is not a genre, {{but it is also a}} genre that is multiple, and characterized by this very multiplicity... Japanese noise music can come in all styles, referring to all other genres... but crucially asks the question of genre—what does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be categorized, categorizable, definable?"
