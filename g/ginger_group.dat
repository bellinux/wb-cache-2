5|$|Wooller was a {{dissident}} {{member of the}} Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). In 1991, Wooller accused the ICAEW of having built-in bias when it marked examinations during a recession, and used PE II (Professional Education II) results to show the bias. Wooller was fined by the ICAEW in 1995 for promoting unaccredited MBA courses. Wooller formed a <b>ginger</b> <b>group</b> when the ICAEW tried to merge with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) in 1995. Wooller's <b>ginger</b> <b>group</b> opposed many {{of the actions of}} the ICAEW. The merger was shelved after the majority of the ICAEW members voted against it. The <b>ginger</b> <b>group</b> decided to keep fighting for democratic reforms and in June 1996, demanded that the executive of the ICAEW be elected directly by the 109,000 members of the body, instead of by the ICAEW's council of seventy members. A year later, Wooller demanded that members of the ICAEW be allowed to vote on Peter Gerrard's key constitutional reform proposals, and Wooller's motion failed by 1,400 votes, including proxies.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} findings of historian Carroll Quigley, {{author of the}} 1966 book Tragedy and Hope, are taken by both conspiracy theorists of the American Old Right (W. Cleon Skousen) and New Left (Carl Oglesby) to substantiate this view, even though Quigley argued that the Establishment {{is not involved in}} a plot to implement a one-world government but rather British and American benevolent imperialism driven by the mutual interests of economic elites in the United Kingdom and the United States. Quigley also argued that, although the Round Table still exists today, its position in influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during World War I and slowly waned after the end of World War II and the Suez Crisis. Today the Round Table is largely a <b>ginger</b> <b>group,</b> designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the Commonwealth of Nations, but faces strong opposition. Furthermore, in American society after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly.|$|E

We could all easily have taken CIMA or CIPFA without having to make any sacrifices", believing that differing standards of education were the greatest obstacle.

40|$|Background: Although some {{remedies}} {{have been}} suggested for treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, some free of side effects treatment methods such as herbal drugs and exercise are especially important. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the effect of ginger and resistance training on physical and psychological symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Materials and Methods: 60 nonathletic female collegiate students of Shiraz university participated in this study voluntarily and were divided randomly to 4 groups including 15 persons (exercise +placebo, exercise + ginger, ginger, and placebo). <b>Ginger</b> <b>groups</b> were prescribed 250 mg of ginger, four times a day for 3 days from beginning of menstruation and placebo groups were recommended the same prescription with 250 mg of placebo drug. Exercise with <b>ginger</b> or placebo <b>groups</b> participated in 2 months of progressive resistance training (3 times a week) besides consuming Ginger or placebo drugs. Menstrual symptoms were recorded with using validated questionnaire, before intervention and during two consecutive periods of menstruation. The analysis was performed with using Covariate analysis of variance with repeated measures by SPSS version 16. Results: A significant reduction was found in physical symptoms of dysmenorrhea in <b>groups</b> of <b>Ginger</b> but no significant statistically changes were found within other groups. Comparison of four groups indicated more significant reduction of physical symptoms in <b>ginger</b> <b>groups</b> compared with other groups. There were no significant difference in psychologic symptoms within and between groups (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: Ginger is recommended for treatment of physical symptoms of dysmenorrhea...|$|R

In 1929 the National Textile Workers led a strike of thousands of textile workers in Gastonia, North Carolina, who walked out, despite the NTW's attempts to hold them back, after management fired five union activists.

2500|$|Temple {{remained}} an activist in the CCF. In the early 1950s {{he was a}} leader of the [...] "Ginger Group", a group of dissident CCFers who argued that the party's poor performance in the 1951 provincial election was due to the party moving away from taking clear socialist stands on issues and instead focussing too much on organizational issues. The group opposed what they saw as the [...] "bureaucratization" [...] of the CCF with salaried organizers and a greater emphasis on fundraising taking the place of grassroots volunteers and political education and discussion. Temple and his supporters also argued that power was being increasingly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} party executive instead of the grassroots resulting in the squelching of democratic discussion and grassroots policy development and sought to rectify this by curtailing the powers of the provincial secretary. On 12 April 1952, at the 18th annual provincial convention, Temple nearly ran for leader against Ted Jolliffe but withdrew at the last minute allowing Jolliffe to be acclaimed.

40|$|Objective: To compare {{between the}} effect of curcuminoids and ginger extract on hypercoagulability, endothelial {{dysfunction}} and some ischemic markers in dyslipidemic rabbits. Methods: 24 male rabbits were randomly allocated into normal control (NC) group, dyslipidemic group fed atherogenic diet for 6 weeks, curcuminoids and <b>ginger</b> <b>groups</b> received their extracts as well as atherogenic diet for 6 weeks. Results: curcuminoids and ginger extract significantly decreased serum plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), prothrombin fragment (1 + 2) (PF 1 + 2), endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), ischemia modified albumin (IMA), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) while nitric oxide (NO) showed a significant increase as compared to dyslipidemic <b>group.</b> <b>Ginger</b> extract exerted more pronounced effect than curcumionoids regarding serum PAI- 1 and PF 1 + 2. Curcuminoids, however demonstrated better effect regarding NO, ET- 1 and IMA as compared to ginger extract which may refer to their antioxidant potential. Both extracts demonstrated a similar effect on plasma FIB level. Conclusion: Ginger seems to improve haemostatic abnormalities in dyslipidemic rabbits better than curcuminoids. The latter exerted similar but weaker effects than ginger, except for their remarkable antioxidant potential and improving endothelial functions. Therefore, co-supplementation of both extracts may synergize their effects in dyslipidemia-induced haemostatic and vascular complications...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} and political crisis of 1931 provoked the reappearance of rank and file movements in Britain. This article examines the unofficial organisations that developed in building, engineering, passenger transport and the railways – {{as well as more}} ephemeral bodies. It critically synthesises the existing historiography and replenishes it with new material from the Russian archives. The progress of rank and filism to 1939 is surveyed and the largely forgotten project of a new Communist-led rank and file organisation, a Trade Union Militant League, which would supersede the National Minority Movement, is recuperated. The article stresses the role of Comintern policy in harnessing and moulding grass-roots rebellion. It validates that strand in the literature which argues that Moscow’s subsequent turn to the popular front and aspirations to alliances with labour movement leaders predominated over, and legitimated, indigenous influences, enhanced existing adaptation to trade unionism, and encouraged subordination of oppositional movements to activity in official structures. By 1939, the Communists had abandoned the idea of a national rank and file movement they had pursued since 1923. Little survived of the revolutionary enterprise launched in 1931. Rank and filism endured only as a handful of sectional, party-sponsored, trade union <b>ginger</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
