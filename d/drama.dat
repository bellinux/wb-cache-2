40|$|The study aims at {{discussing}} the Korean TV <b>dramas</b> with high ratings in Taiwan. The <b>dramas</b> {{selected for the}} current study dated from 2000 to 2013. In the study, based on text types and gender imagination, the selected <b>dramas</b> were used as examples to examine the acceptability of Korean TV <b>dramas</b> in Taiwan. In chapter one, the research background was presented. In chapter two, the foreign <b>dramas</b> broadcast in Taiwan in the 1990 s were investigated. The study revealed that Korean <b>dramas</b> in the late 1990 s succeeded the prototype created by Japanese dramas— idol <b>dramas.</b> The Korean idol <b>dramas</b> at that time have gained much popularity in Taiwan because of their “po-mom” plots and the high quality tradition deriving from the Japanese <b>dramas.</b> During 2000 and 2013, the main types and air time of Korean <b>dramas</b> broadcast in Taiwan have gradually changed and conformed {{to the needs of}} Taiwanese audience. The long-term Korean <b>dramas</b> such as family <b>dramas</b> and history <b>dramas</b> become the primary types broadcast in Taiwan, showing the localization of Korean <b>dramas.</b> In chapter three, the text analysis probed into the reasons of this transition. In chapter four, an example for the subtype of Korean TV dramas—female cross-dressers—was given to illustrate the possibilities of fulfilling the imagination of the local Taiwanese audience. In chapter five, the conclusion for the above discussions was demonstrated. 本文以 2000 年至 2013 年的在台韓劇為研究範圍，選取收視較佳韓劇為例，就文本類型（genre）及性別想像探討韓劇在台的接受現象。首先於第一章介紹研究背景，第二章切入台灣 90 年代的外國戲劇節目播出情形，認為 90 年代末期於台灣播出的韓劇承接了日劇開創的類型──「偶像劇」。韓國偶像劇媲美當時日劇的精緻品質以及劇情裡的「婆媽」特色，讓它有機會在台灣獲得成功。在 2000 年至 2013 年之間，在台韓劇的播出型態及主要類型逐漸改變，符合台灣觀眾需求的長篇韓劇（家庭劇、古裝歷史劇）成為主力，呈現了韓劇於台灣的在地化現象。第三章的文本分析則深入探討此類型轉變的原因。經由觀眾觀看韓劇同時產生的性別想像，將可能加強觀眾及韓劇之間的關係，本論文將於第四章以韓國偶像劇子類型「女扮男裝」韓劇為例，作為台灣在地觀眾投射想像的實踐可能。最後於第五章進行上述討論的總結。第一章 緒論	 1 第一節　研究動機	 1 第二節　研究範圍及方法	 3 第三節　文獻回顧及檢討	 5 一、韓劇相關研究	 5 二、影像及類型相關研究	 9 三、流行文化文本及性別想像相關研究	 10 第四節　章節架構	 12 第二章　類型及愉悅：韓劇的台灣在地化脈絡	 15 第一節　異國偶像劇在台灣：「類型」作為一種可能	 15 一、台灣主要外國戲劇節目播出：異國想像的作用	 16 二、 90 年代日本偶像劇在台灣	 18 第二節　韓劇在台播出類型及時段的轉變	 22 第三節　韓劇裡的性別想像：女性觀眾及男性偶像	 31 一、在台韓劇的三大類型：偶像劇、家庭劇、歷史劇	 33 二、韓國影像裡的男性與（男性）偶像：「美男」們	 35 小結	 38 第三章　愛情及勵志：韓劇滿足女性觀眾的基本要素	 39 第一節　韓劇裡的愛情：女性觀眾獲得「勵志」的可能	 39 一、消費「愛情」：韓劇裡的男女性別想像	 41 二、「勵志」的滿足：階級、權力變動的可能	 44 第二節　從現代看古代：擁有「知識卅身體」的女人	 52 一、歷史劇的愛情及權力	 55 二、回歸愛情的敘事結構：從歷史劇到古裝偶像劇	 61 小結	 68 第四章　 台灣在地想像的「美男」：以韓國偶像劇的子類型之一為例	 69 第一節 被凝視的「美男」：男偶像、男性愛（Boy’s Love）及女性愉悅可能	 69 第二節　韓劇裡的「男性愛」情境生產	 75 一、「男性愛」情境的使用：男主角或男配角的真愛考驗	 75 二、同性愛情境的繁衍：男性愛、女性愛的角逐競爭	 79 小結	 83 第五章　結論	 85 參考書目（依姓名筆劃）	 88 附錄一：以「韓劇」為研究對象的碩士論文	 96 附錄二： 2000 年至 2012 年在台播出韓劇	 9...|$|R
