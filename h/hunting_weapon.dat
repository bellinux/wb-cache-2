25|$|The {{most common}} <b>hunting</b> <b>weapon</b> before the {{introduction}} of European guns was the bow and arrow. Various hunting strategies were used. Some techniques involved using animal head masks worn as a disguise. Whistles were sometimes used to lure animals closer. Another technique was the relay method where hunters positioned at various points would chase the prey in turns in order to tire the animal. A similar method involved chasing the prey down a steep cliff.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>hunting</b> <b>weapon,</b> {{based on}} {{different}} principles than the spear, is the throwing stick. While at its simplest the throwing stick {{is just a}} heavy club thrown at the game, a well designed throwing stick uses the principles of an airfoil shape and gyroscopic stability; the oldest of these dates back 200,000 years to ancient Poland. The kylie, for example, an Australian hunting boomerang in use into modern times, uses the bent shape and a symmetric airfoil cross section to provide stability and low drag for long, accurate throws. Kylies do not return (a good thing, since they are large, heavy, and dangerous) but smaller, lighter versions, the classic boomerang, exhibit the classic circular path that made the boomerang famous. Boomerangs, of both the non-returning and returning variety, {{have been found in}} many ancient cultures, ranging from Egypt to North America.|$|E
500|$|The atlatl (spear-thrower) was {{introduced}} to the Maya region by Teotihuacan in the Early Classic. This was a [...] stick with a notched end to hold a dart or javelin. The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than could be accomplished by simply hurling it with the arm alone. Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior. Commoners used blowguns in war, which also served as their <b>hunting</b> <b>weapon.</b> The bow and arrow is another weapon that was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting. Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period, its use as a weapon of war was not favoured; it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic. The Contact period Maya also used two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.|$|E

2500|$|Crossbows were {{eventually}} replaced in warfare by gunpowder weapons, although early guns had slower rates {{of fire and}} much worse accuracy than contemporary crossbows. The Battle of Cerignola in 1503 was largely won by Spain {{through the use of}} matchlock firearms, marking the first time a major battle was won through the use of firearms. Later, similar competing tactics would feature harquebusiers or musketeers in formation with pikemen, pitted against cavalry firing pistols or carbines. While the military crossbow had largely been supplanted by firearms on the battlefield by 1525, the sporting crossbow in various forms remained a popular <b>hunting</b> <b>weapon</b> in Europe until the eighteenth century. [...] Up until the seventeenth century most beekeepers in Europe kept their hives spread across the woods and had to defend them against bears. Therefore, their guild was granted {{the right to bear arms}} and is commonly depicted carrying heavy crossbows.|$|E
