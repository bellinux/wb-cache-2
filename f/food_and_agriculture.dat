5|$|Bivalves {{have been}} an {{important}} source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. Oysters, scallops, clams, ark clams, mussels and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve, and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Agriculture</b> Organization (FAO) started making such information available, world trade in bivalve molluscs was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier.

5|$|By the war's end in 1945, Bruce {{had become}} {{tired of the}} High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin's {{successor}} Ben Chifley {{that he would not}} object to being replaced in the position. In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and China that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters. Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations. The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work {{came to the attention of}} Eleanor Roosevelt, and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression at the <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Agriculture</b> Conference that Franklin Roosevelt convened in Hot Springs, Virginia, in May 1943.

5|$|Although he {{returned}} to parliament in 1931, Bruce's service in the Lyons Government was brief.

According to a <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Agriculture</b> Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished. The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates. Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest. Corruption in India is perceived to have increased significantly, with one report estimating the illegal capital flows since independence to be US$462 billion.|$|E
