40|$|Moths {{and other}} insects at flowers of Oregongrape (Berberis aquifolium [Mahonia aquifolium]) were sampled with traps during April and May 2001 in Yakima, Washington, USA. Moths {{captured}} were predominantly the alfalfa looper (Autographa californica; 43 %), and the <b>gooseberry</b> <b>fruitworm</b> (Zophodia grossulariella; 26 %) with {{small numbers of}} 14 other species in the families Noctuidae and Geometridae. Analyses of samples made from the air around blooms of Oregongrape shrubs revealed the consistent presence of alpha -pinene, beta -pinene, sabinene, E- beta -ocimene, beta -myrcene, limonene, benzaldehyde, and phenylacetaldehyde. Greatest amounts released per flower per hour were 124. 5 +or- 40. 8 ng phenylacetaldehyde, 87. 6 +or- 6. 7 ng alpha -pinene, 54. 4 +or- 17. 8 ng E- beta -ocimene, and 43. 9 +or- 7. 0 ng limonene. Phenylacetaldehyde and benzaldehyde are known attractants for some moths, including the alfalfa looper. The odour produced by Oregongrape blooms may attract feeding moths for pollination of flowers.
