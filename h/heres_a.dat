5000|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film {{four out of}} four stars and described the film as [...] "a dazzling movie from Walt Disney in which computers {{have been used to}} make themselves romantic and glamorous. <b>Heres</b> <b>a</b> technological sound-and-light show that is sensational and brainy, stylish, and fun". However, {{near the end of his}} review, he noted (in a positive tone), [...] "This is an almost wholly technological movie. Although its populated by actors who are engaging (Bridges, Cindy Morgan) or sinister (Warner), it is not really a movie about human nature. Like Star Wars or The Empire Strikes Back, but much more so, this movie is a machine to dazzle and delight us". Ebert closed his first annual Overlooked Film Festival with a showing of Tron. Tron was also featured in Siskel and Eberts video pick of the week in 1993.|$|E

[...] The Horn Book Magazine wrote [...] "And <b>heres</b> <b>a</b> book one doesnt see every day: a narrative perfectly attuned to a toddlers sense of playful discovery[...]. Horaceks uncluttered watercolors merrily counterbalance the straightforward text and provide numerous opportunities for listeners to identify colors and animals {{as well as}} to count objects."

Its what I went through from my own group. They never bothered to listen to what I was fucking singing, they dont even know the words to my songs. They never bothered to listen, it was like <b>Heres</b> <b>a</b> tune, write some words to it. So I did. They never questioned it. I found that offensive, it meant I was literally wasting my time, cos if you aint working with people that are on the same level then you aint doing anything. The rest of the band and Malcolm never bothered to find out if I could sing, they just took me as an image. It was as basic as that, they really were as dull as that. After a year of it they were going Why dont you have your hair this colour this year? And I was going Oh God, a brick wall, Im fighting a brick wall! They dont understand even now.” ...|$|E

[...] Thornton recalled later that she learned her record was in circulation while {{she was on her}} way to a performance with the Johnny Otis Orchestra during this tour in Dayton, Ohio. [...] "I was going to the theater and I just turned the radio on in the car and the man said, <b>Heres</b> <b>a</b> record thats going nationwide: Hound Dog by Willie Mae Thornton. I said, Thats me! laughs I hadnt heard the record in so long. So when we get to the theater they was blasting it. You could hear it from the theater, from the loudspeaker. They were just playing Hound Dog all over the theater. So I goes up in the operating room, I say, Do you mind playing that again? Cause I hadnt heard the record in so long I forgot the words myself. So I stood there while he was playing it, listening to it. So that evening I sang it on the show, and everybody went for it. Hound Dog just took off like a jet." ...|$|E

[...] PlayStation Universe also chose Claire in her original outfit from Resident Evil 2 as one of the five characters they wanted to appear in Resident Evil 6s Mercenaries mode as she [...] "is long overdue a canonical appearance in the series." [...] In 2012, RE6 producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi wrote they have [...] "heard a lot of love for Jill and Claire recently and people asking if they’ll be in the next Resident Evil." [...] Including Claire among the 30 best characters in the three decades of Capcoms history, GamesRadar staff commented in 2013: [...] "Sadly shes fallen into the background of the series, which makes sense she avoided work as a government zombie hunter, but we hope Capcom has plans for her in the future. <b>Heres</b> <b>a</b> suggestion: a co-op focused RE that teams Claire up with the almost as underused Jill. Its your move Capcom." [...] Reacting to Claires return in Revelations 2 IGNs Mitch Dyer wrote: [...] "The Resident Evil series places women in prominent, powerful, playable roles. Jill Valentine, Rebecca Chambers, Sheva Alomar, and Ada Wong, to name a few. Still, theyre often opposite a male lead. This is the first time a Resident Evil game has revolved around the story of two women. Its fun to get to play as Claire again." [...] According to a CVG preview of Revelations 2, [...] "shes older, calmer and more capable, but she still retains everything that made her compelling in the first place. Where Rachael from the first Revelations was part centrefold, part melted-ice cream, Claire feels distinct from many women in the Resi universe in that theres more to her than lady-lumps and lycra. Shes the perfect choice for the games brand of isolated horror." ...|$|E

40|$|Similar Meaning Often {{a number}} of means (including various cases) are used to express a set of similar {{concepts}} with overlapping or contiguous meanings. For example, Russian has many ways to express directionality {{in the domain of}} intention (many of which are roughly equivalent to English for), among them the prepositions v, na, pro, and za with the accusative case, do, dlja, radi with the genitive case, as well as the bare dative case (as in Vot pis#mo emu <b>Heres</b> <b>a</b> letter for him). Same/Similar Lexical Trigger Sometimes different case uses are triggered by the same or similar lexical items, such as verit# believe, which can combine with both the bare dative case and the preposition v with the accusative case. The verb napolnit# fill uses the instrumental case to mark the substance doing the filling, but the related adjective polon full can use the genitive case for the filling substance. The same/similar triggers indicate that there are some semantic points of contact between these case uses, again usually involving overlapping or contiguous meanings. This paper will examine these and other factors in an exploration of the interconnections among the Russian cases (from a database of inter-case relationships currently numbering several dozen) ...|$|E
40|$|Print shows {{a number}} of {{encounter}}s, in two panels, {{between men and women}} either off to bed or awakened to the horrors of the night before: the first, an old man on the arm of an old woman, says, "Och! Long life to Belvoir Castle [...] . and now <b>heres</b> <b>a</b> polite Damsel, going to shew me to bed in the morning!" to which the woman responds, "Come along sir [...] . bless me I would not have my Lady to see me for the World! She would never have an opinion of my virtue again. " The second encounter has a rather homely man discovering by candlelight that he has slept with an African woman who tells him, " [...] . you did, and you be very pretty man. " The third encounter shows an old man exclaiming that he has often heard that his wife "wore the Breeches and now I am convinced of it" as he catches sight of her in her nightdress, one breast exposed, and a man's breeches around her shoulders, and she thinking "I shall now escape without detection" of her adulterous activities. The top panel closes with an old man sitting at a table having tea with a young couple, the young man, a rake, proposes to " [...] . read you a passage in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night - there is something peculiarly whimsical and interesting in the Character of Malvolio" to which the young woman replies, " [...] . for like Malvolio I perceive you are cross garter'd" and the old man exclaims, "Cross garter'd, why Tom has got on a Lady's Stocking - there must be some cursed mistake in this. " The bottom panel continues in this vein with a man on one knee appealing to a plump woman, "Shew me to bed - or give me something to drink - great lump of loveliness - devine Cherry-bum, - hear me! - give me some drink, thou mighty Castle Spectre!" The next encounter has a husband and wife embracing in the dark, he thinking " [...] . I should know her voice from a thousand" after hearing her speak, "I am glad I have found you my Dear, I persuaded my Husband to let us have separate rooms, as he complain'd of being very ill, - bless me how dark it is, why don't you speak?" Next an uncle and a nephew confronting each other in the morning, the uncle says, "Why Jack what wickedness have you been at? You have got a Woman's Cap on!" to which the nephew replies, "Have I Uncle, and if I don't mistake, this is an under petticoat about your shoulders. " Lastly, a "Bond Street Sailor" is about to lead or take "in tow" a "bashful" young woman down the path to ruin with the aid of another woman who says to her, "Why are you so bashful - I was so at first, - till I found all the fine Ladies of Fashion set us so good an example.
