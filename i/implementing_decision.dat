This exchange of information is often called the Sevilla process because it is steered by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies of the European Commissions' Joint Research Centre, which is based in Seville. The process is described in detail in Commission <b>Implementing</b> <b>Decision</b> 2012/119/EU.

50|$|The Mekong-Delta covers an area {{of about}} 70,000 km² in South Vietnam and {{underlies}} {{the influence of the}} tropical monsoon. The annual dry season lasts from November till April and the rain season from May till October. The river regularly overflows its banks in the lower Mekong area, with beneficial effects, such as the accumulation of fertile sediment. However extreme flood events occur more frequently causing extensive damage. High population density, and farming as a major income source close to flooding endangered areas increase the economic and ecologic impacts of extreme river floods. Beside these extreme floods the Mekong Delta region encounters further challenges and problems, such as deteriorating water quality due to strong pesticide use in rice farming areas, unfilteres discharge of rural and industrial waste water, changing climatic conditions with predicted sea level rise, and thereupon resulting salinization and acidification, species / habitats diminish, and regulatory measures (hydropower) is ongoing at {{the upper reaches of the}} Mekong. The interactions between nature and human beings make the Mekong Delta a complex system, requiring a more and more adapted regulation, based on accurate information concerning the different factors entering the equation. Providing information, linking different related scientific domains, designing and <b>implementing</b> <b>decision</b> support technologies accompanied by capacity building measures is the aim of the WISDOM project serving the integrated water resources management (IWRM) domain in the Mekong Delta.|$|E

40|$|With {{the coming}} of post-industrial society, organisations will {{increasingly}} rely on intellectual technology to aid problem-solving. But those technologies that deal explicitly with uncertainty, such as decision analysis, face special problems hampering their institutionalisation. The main argument {{of this paper is}} that success or failure in <b>implementing</b> <b>decision</b> analysis is in part determined by an organisation's structure. Yet, uncertainty is one factor that determines the structure of an organisation, and some structures facilitate an organisation's handling of uncertainty, while others do not. In general, intellectual technologies that deal with uncertainty will be difficult to implement in organisations whose structures do not facilitate the handling of uncertainty. Strong centralisation of decision making, often found in large organisations, creates special problems in <b>implementing</b> <b>decision</b> analysis. Organisational structures that allow the level and type of uncertainty facing individuals to be matched to their personal levels of capability to handle it, will facilitate implementation of decision analysis. Within large organisations, creating specialist programming and technical functions at appropriate levels or introducing matrix structures, which combine vertical and lateral structures, may facilitate the introduction of technologies that deal with uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} issue of {{compiling}} ML pattern matching to compact and efficient decisions trees. Traditionally, compilation to decision trees is optimized by (1) <b>implementing</b> <b>decision</b> trees as dags with maximal sharing; (2) guiding a simple compiler with heuristics. We first design new heuristics that are inspired by necessity, a concept from lazy pattern matching that we rephrase in terms of decision tree semantics. Thereby, we simplify previous semantic frameworks and demonstrate a straightforward connection between necessity and decision tree runtime efficiency. We complete our study by experiments, showing that optimizing compilation to decision trees is competitive with the optimizing match compile...|$|E

A data warehouse stores materialized views of data from one or more remote sources, {{with the purpose of}} efficiently <b>implementing</b> <b>decision</b> support or OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) queries. One of more important decisions in designing data warehouse is the selection of materialized views to be maintained at the warehouse. The first part of this paper briefly introduces key concepts surrounding data warehousing system. The second part studies how to select the set of supporting views and indexes to materialize to minimize the total query response time and cost of maintaining the selected views...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A data {{warehouse}} contains multiple views accessed by queries. One {{of the most}} im-portant decisions in designing a {{data warehouse}} is the selection of materialized views for the pur-pose of efficiently <b>implementing</b> <b>decision</b> mak-ing. The search space for the selection of ma-terialized views is exponentially large, therefore, heuristics {{have been used to}} search a small frac-tion of the space to get a near optimal solu-tion. In this paper, we explore the use of a ge-netic algorithm for the selection of materialized views based on multiple global processing plans for many queries. Our experimental studies in-dicate that the genetic algorithm delivers better solutions than some heuristics. ...|$|E
