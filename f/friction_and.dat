We construct a model in which aggregate growth {{is driven by the}} continual entry of new firms that face barriers to entry <b>and</b> financial <b>frictions.</b> We find that reforms to financial <b>frictions</b> <b>and</b> entry barriers are substitutes — once a country has enacted one type of reform, the percentage increase in GDP from the other reform decreases. We also show that economies with more severe financial <b>frictions</b> <b>and</b> entry costs have lower levels of output along the balanced growth path, even though all economies grow at the same constant rate. The model generates sharp predictions regarding entry barriers, financial <b>frictions,</b> <b>and</b> output levels, which are borne out in the cross country data...|$|R

40|$|Financial <b>frictions</b> <b>and</b> {{financial}} shocks {{can affect}} the trade-off between inflation stabilization and output-gap stabilization faced by a central bank. Financial frictions lead to a greater response in output following any deviation of inflation from target and thus {{lead to an increase}} in the sacrifice ratio. As a result, optimal monetary policy in the face of credit frictions is to allow greater output gap instability in return for greater inflation stability. Such a shift in optimal monetary policy can be mimicked in a Taylor-type interest rate feedback rule that shifts weight to inflation and the lagged interest rate and away from output. However, the ability of the conventional Taylor rule to mimic optimal policy gets worse as credit market <b>frictions</b> <b>and</b> shocks intensify. By including a financial variable like the lending spread in the monetary policy rule, the central bank can partially reverse this worsening output-inflation trade-off brought about by financial <b>frictions</b> <b>and</b> partially undo the effects of credit market <b>frictions</b> <b>and</b> shocks. Thus the central bank may want to include lending spreads in the policy rule even when financial distortions are not explicitly part of the centra...|$|R

We estimate the model using a unique data set, which contains estimates of export quality, measures of financial development, and indicators of financial vulnerability for all manufacturing industries and {{countries in the world}} over the last three decades. We find the interplay between financial <b>frictions</b> <b>and</b> financial vulnerability to be a first-order determinant of the observed variation in product quality across countries and industries.

5|$|On {{water-based}} pitches, shorter fibres and wetted turf reduce <b>friction</b> <b>and</b> {{increase the}} speed at which the game can be played. However, these pitches require watering before, during and after the game and maintenance costs are significant. Sand-dressed pitches cost more than sand-filled pitches but are preferable for hockey as there is an absence of sand close to the playing surface. However, a multi-purpose surface suitable for sports including association football and tennis is often required and hockey may not be the predominant sport. There are many different specifications and categorisations for artificial turf including shock absorption, surface rebound, <b>friction,</b> <b>and</b> strength outlined by the International Hockey Federation.

5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which <b>friction</b> <b>and</b> any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E
5|$|In England, the {{manufacturing}} of pendulum clocks was soon taken up. The longcase clock (also {{known as the}} grandfather clock) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the anchor escapement mechanism in about 1670. Before then, pendulum clocks used the older verge escapement mechanism, which required very wide pendulum swings of about 100°. To avoid {{the need for a}} very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less <b>friction</b> <b>and</b> wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39inches) long {{to the center of the}} bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, Francis Hauksbee and French chemist Charles François de Fay {{independently}} discovered {{what they believed}} were two kinds of frictional electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous and resinous, that are separated by <b>friction,</b> <b>and</b> that neutralize each other when combined. American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion. A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (-). He gave them the modern charge nomenclature {{of positive and negative}} respectively. Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the charge carrier, and which situation was a deficit.|$|E

30|$|If {{trying to}} explain the {{variance}} of paid wages between observationally equivalent workers, basically two components are required: first, there are firm effects on the wage, and, second, there is an effect {{of the degree of}} frictions on wages. In addition, wages vary considerably between workers with different observed characteristics, controlling for firm characteristics <b>and</b> search <b>frictions.</b> Summing up, three factors are needed to explain empirical wage distributions: heterogeneous firms, heterogeneous workers <b>and</b> search <b>frictions</b> (see Bontemps et  al. 2000; Abowd et  al. 1999). So far, the presented models explain wage variation by search <b>frictions</b> (Burdett <b>and</b> Mortensen 1998), by search <b>frictions</b> <b>and</b> heterogeneity of the employees (Burdett and Mortensen 1998), <b>and</b> by search <b>frictions</b> <b>and</b> exogenous technology differences (Bontemps et  al. 2000). The model presented in this section integrates the three important factors for the explanation of an empirical wage distribution. The model is due to Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002 a).|$|R

5|$|Philosophers {{in antiquity}} used {{the concept of}} force {{in the study of}} {{stationary}} and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of <b>friction,</b> <b>and</b> a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.|$|E
