5000|$|One type, the British Number Ten <b>Delay</b> <b>Switch</b> (official name, [...] "Switch, No. 10, Delay" [...] {{and often}} {{referred}} to as a [...] "timing pencil"), was made of a brass (or in later versions aluminium) tube, with a copper section at one end which contained a glass vial of cupric chloride (the liquid was widely and erroneously reported to be sulfuric acid), while beneath the vial was a spring-loaded striker under tension and held in place by a thin metal wire. The timer was started by crushing the copper section of the tube to break the vial of cupric chloride, which then began to slowly erode the wire holding back the striker. When the wire eventually parted, the striker was propelled down the hollow centre of the detonator, hitting the percussion cap {{at the other end of}} the detonator.|$|E

50|$|Ilinga was an Australian car {{manufacturer}} founded in Melbourne by Tony Farrell and his partner, Daryl Davies, in business from 1974 to 1975. The company's only model, the AF-2, saw only two examples produced, despite having fifteen customers order one. Presented at the 1975 Melbourne Motor Show, the AF-2 {{was a potential}} luxury sports car, built {{to compete with the}} likes of Porsche and Aston Martin. The 1973 oil crisis and high price tag chased many potential customers away, as well as Australia's lack of automotive history. It was powered by a Leyland P76 engine modified to 220 horsepower. This engine was sourced from Rover. Plans for a four-door model in 1974 were scrapped before the factory was abandoned with broken Borg-Warner gearboxes littering the floor, as the transmission manufacturer refused to provide further assistance. US $328,000 was spent before the company finally folded after just a year in business. The two AF-2 models constructed featured a digital clock, a <b>delay</b> <b>switch</b> which extinguished the lights and locked the doors if the driver didn't do so, a self-seeking cassette player with radio, electric windows, and a fully integrated air conditioning unit. One AF-2 resides in Museum Victoria, in Melbourne. The other was reportedly used as a daily driver by a fast food restaurant owner and re-painted green (the original color of both units was a very light powder blue). It awaits restoration.|$|E
40|$|Objective—Routine {{monitoring}} of plasma HIV RNA among HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is unavailable in many resource-limited settings. Alternative monitoring approaches correlate poorly with virologic failure and can substantially <b>delay</b> <b>switch</b> to second-line therapy. We evaluated {{the impact of}} delayed switch on mortality among patients with virologic failure in Africa. Design—A cohort. Methods—We examined patients with confirmed virologic failure on first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) -based regimens from four cohorts with serial HIV RNA monitoring in Uganda and South Africa. Marginal structural models aimed to estimate the effect of delayed switch on mortality in a hypothetical trial in which switch time was randomly assigned. Inverse probability weights adjusted for measured confounders including time-updated CD 4 + T-cell count and HIV RNA. Results—Among 823 patients with confirmed virologic failure, the cumulative incidence of switch 180 days after failure was 30 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 27 – 33]. The majority of patients (74 %) had not failed immunologically as defined by WHO criteria {{by the time of}} virologic failure. Adjusted mortality was higher for individuals who remained on first-line therapy than for those who had switched [odds ratio (OR) 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 4. 2]. Among those without immunologic failure, the relative harm of failure to switch was similar (OR 2. 4; 95 % CI 0. 99 – 5. 8) to that of the entire cohort, although of borderline statistical significance. Conclusion—Among HIV-infected patients with confirmed virologic failure on first-line ART, remaining on first-line therapy led to an increase in mortality relative to switching. Our results suggest that detection and response to confirmed virologic failure could decrease mortality...|$|E

Most EFV-related {{central nervous system}} (CNS) toxicity resolves early though symptoms may persist; we studied switching to etravirine (ETR) in these individuals. METHODS A randomized, double-blind trial in patients with viral suppression but ongoing CNS adverse events after more than 12 weeks EFV. Patients received 2 NRTI/EFV/ETR-placebo (<b>delayed</b> <b>switch)</b> or 2 NRTI/ETR/EFV-placebo (immediate switch) for 12 weeks followed by 12 -week open-label phase (2 NRTI/ETR).

40|$|Background: South Africa {{has one of}} {{the largest}} {{antiretroviral}} treatment (ART) programmes globally. In addition to increasing access to ART, {{it is important that the}} health system also focuses on the appropriate management of patients who fail first-line ART. <b>Delays</b> in <b>switching</b> patients onto second-line ART can adversely affect patient outcomes. Aim: To identify the patient-related and programmatic factors that <b>delay</b> <b>switching</b> patients onto second-line ART, and to assess whether these delays contribute to subsequent virological failure. Methods: Clinical records of adult patients switched onto second-line ART between 2011 and 2014 at a public antiretroviral clinic were used to collect demographic, clinical, laboratory and programmatic data (availability of viral load results, inadequate patient follow-up, insufficient notes for effective follow-up). Data were analysed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: The median duration from the date of first and confirmatory documented high viral load (VL > 1000 copies/mL) to being switched to second-line ART was 13. 2 months [interquartile range (IQR) 1. 1 – 52. 7 months] and 6. 4 months (IQR 0 – 43. 3 months), respectively. Inadequate prescriber notes for appropriate follow-up (p = 0. 01) and unavailability of patients’ viral load results (p = 0. 02) were significantly associated with <b>delays</b> in <b>switching</b> to second-line ART.

40|$|Since mobile {{devices are}} battery powered, several mobile TV {{standards}} dictate using energy saving schemes {{to increase the}} viewing time on mobile devices. The most common scheme for saving energy {{is to make the}} base station broadcast the video data of a TV channel in bursts with a bit rate much higher than the encoding rate of the video stream, which enables mobile devices to turn off their radio frequency circuits when not receiving bursts. While broadcasting bursts saves energy, it increases the channel <b>switching</b> <b>delay.</b> The <b>switching</b> <b>delay</b> is an important performance metric, because long and variable <b>switching</b> <b>delays</b> are annoying to users and may turn them away from the mobile TV service.
