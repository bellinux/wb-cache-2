5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E
25|$|A single-speed bicycle {{is a type}} of bicycle with {{a single}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> These {{bicycles}} are without derailleur gears, hub gearing or other methods for varying the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of the bicycle. Adult single-speed bicycles typically have a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of between 55 and 75 gear inches, depending on the rider and the anticipated usage.|$|E
25|$|In pennate muscles, {{segments}} {{with higher}} pennation angles put out less force per shortening muscle fiber. Therefore, the architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of a pennate muscle {{is higher than}} the architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of spindle like muscles (e.g. fusiform). A smaller fiber length neutralizes this higher architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> if the muscle fibers must be squeezed into the same space.|$|E

25|$|On {{a bicycle}} {{with only one}} gear change {{mechanism}} (e.g. rear hub only or rear derailleur only), the number of possible <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> {{is the same as}} the number of usable <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> which is also the same as the number of distinct <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Most hybrid, touring, mountain, {{and racing}} {{bicycles}} {{are equipped with}} both front and rear derailleurs. [...] There are a few <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> which have a straight chain path, {{but most of the}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> will have the chain running at an angle. [...] The use of two derailleurs generally results in some duplicate or near duplicate <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> so that the number of distinct <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> is typically around two-thirds of the number of advertised <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The more common configurations have specific names [...] which are usually related to the relative step sizes between the front chainrings and the rear cogset.|$|R
25|$|Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> {{also called}} {{anatomical}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> (AGR) is {{a feature of}} pennate muscle defined by the ratio between the longitudinal strain of the muscle and muscle fiber strain.|$|E
25|$|The Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{explained}} through the segmented muscle model 3 proposed by Emanuel Azizi, where a muscle segment is shown {{as a single}} muscle fiber attached to the myosepta of a Siren lacertina an aquatic salamander at a certain acute, pennation angle. The model allows segments to bulge out differently in the horizontal, and vertical direction and was {{used to calculate the}} Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of each segment. Preliminary models results show that with muscle bulging, the Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> will increase. Different bulging conditions were studied, and shown in Fig. 2 The model results show the more a muscle bulges in dorsoventral height, the further the muscle fibers shorten, therefore providing a higher Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

50|$|There is no optimal {{choice of}} {{transmission}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> or a {{final drive ratio}} for best performance at all speeds, as <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> are compromises, and not necessarily better than the original ratios for certain purposes.|$|R
25|$|The Insight’s Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> are infinitely variable between 3.172–0.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted {{behind the steering wheel}} allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT’s <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The CVT’s variable <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|R
50|$|Transmission Upgrade: This {{allows the}} player to adjust <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> On cars with high redlines and high top speeds, {{such as the}} mustang and GT-90, the <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> can be set to the fastest {{acceleration}} ratios without affecting top speed substantially.|$|R
25|$|Many modern {{bicycles}} have removable chainrings, {{to allow}} for replacement when worn, or to change the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> provided (although the change is limited).|$|E
25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on racing bicycles with two chainrings. The relative {{step on the}} chainrings (say 35%) is typically around {{three or four times}} the relative step on the cogset (say 8% or 10%), e.g. chainrings 39-53 and close-range cogsets 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21 or 12-13-15-17-19-21-23-25. This arrangement provides much more scope for adjusting the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> to maintain a constant pedalling speed, but any change of chainring must be accompanied by a simultaneous change of 3 or 4 sprockets on the cogset if the goal is to switch to the next higher or lower <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

25|$|Continuously {{variable}} transmissions are {{a relatively}} new development in bicycles (though not a new idea). Mechanisms like the NuVinci gearing system use balls connected to two disks by static friction - changing the point of contact changes the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

25|$|Human {{factors can}} also be significant. Rohloff {{demonstrates}} that overall efficiency can be improved in some cases by using a slightly less efficient <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> when this leads to greater human efficiency (in converting food to pedal power) because a more effective pedalling speed is being used.|$|E

50|$|If {{replacing}} this transmission {{with a new}} or used transmission, pay {{special attention}} to the transmission code. The code is a three character code stamped in a pad just above the starter flange. This transmission was available in several <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> for different engines and vehicles, so it's important to get a transmission with the same code or another code know to be the same <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> If the <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> are not the same the transmission controller will assume the transmission is slipping and go into fail safe mode.|$|R

25|$|Front/rear gear {{measurement}} uses two numbers (e.g. 53/19) {{where the}} first is the number of teeth in the front chainring and the second is the number of teeth in the rear sprocket. Without doing some arithmetic, it is not immediately obvious that 53/19 and 39/14 represent effectively the same <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
25|$|In most (VW) applications, the readout in the {{instrument}} display changes to 6 5 4 3 2 1, {{and just like}} the automatic modes, the currently used <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is highlighted or emboldened. In other versions (e.g., on the Audi TT) the display shows just M followed by the gear currently selected; e.g., M1, M2, etc.|$|E
25|$|The pennation {{angle of}} the rotator cuff myofibers, the angle at which fibers connect to the {{associated}} tendon, affects the contractile properties and function of the whole pennate muscle. For example, the pennation angle determines the architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> at which a pennate muscle operates. A large initial pennation angle results in a large AGR and velocity amplification.|$|E

25|$|The base model's SOHC {{inline-four}} engine produced 95hp (71kW) {{and had a}} 9.1:1 compression ratio. The {{more powerful}} 1990–1991 GSi used a 1.6L DOHC engine that produced 130hp (97kW) and had a 9.8:1 compression ratio. The GSi package also included driving lights, a spoiler, a rear anti-sway bar, and a transmission with a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> that was slightly better for acceleration than the base model's manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|Current {{variants}} of the DSG will still downshift {{to the lowest}} possible <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> when the kick-down button is activated during full throttle whilst in manual mode. In Manual mode this kick-down is only activated by an additional button {{at the bottom of}} the accelerator pedal travel; unless this is pressed the DSG will not downshift, and will simply perform a full-throttle acceleration in whatever gear was previously being utilised.|$|E
25|$|As the pennate {{muscle is}} activated, the fibers rotate as they shorten and pull {{at an angle}}. In pennate muscles, fibers are {{oriented}} {{at an angle to}} the muscle's line of action and rotate as they shorten, becoming more oblique such that the fraction of force directed along the muscle's line of action decreases throughout a contraction. Force output is dependent upon the angle of fiber rotation, so changes in muscle thickness and the vector of change in thickness vary; based upon the force being produced. Due to the rotational motion; pennate muscles operate at low velocities (low shortening distance). The shortening velocity of the pennate muscle as a whole is greater than that of the individual fibers. This gives rise to the property of AGR. Fiber rotation decreases a muscle's output force but increases output velocity by allowing the muscle to function at a higher <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> (muscle velocity/fiber velocity). Azizi and Brainerd demonstrated that the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of pennate muscle can vary; dependent on external load.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} transmission, {{also called}} auto, self-shifting transmission, n-speed automatic (where n is its number of forward <b>gear</b> <b>ratios),</b> or AT, {{is a type}} of motor vehicle transmission that can automatically change <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> as the vehicle moves, freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually. Like other transmission systems on vehicles, it allows an internal combustion engine, best suited to run at a relatively high rotational speed, to provide a range of speed and torque outputs necessary for vehicular travel. The number of forward <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> is often expressed for manual transmissions as well (e.g., 6-speed manual).|$|R
50|$|The <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> {{were also}} revised {{to match the}} engine upgrade.|$|R
5000|$|The recent {{introduction}} of continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) attempts {{to push this}} strategy to its logical conclusion. This allows a near infinite [...] "number" [...] of <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> which this implies an infinitely close-ratioed transmission. However, given {{that there are no}} gears or specific <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> one would not really consider such a transmission close-ratioed.|$|R
