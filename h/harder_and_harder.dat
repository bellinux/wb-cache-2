25|$|In Season 18, John Nathan-Turner {{became the}} series' producer. He instituted {{a number of}} changes to the show, {{including}} toning down the humour and introducing more science fiction concepts. During this season the Fourth Doctor became very much subdued and, on occasion, melancholy. Baker began the season in poor health, though he eventually recovered. Both the actor and the character seemed noticeably older and tired, due to Baker's gaunt appearance and greying hair. Baker had been finding the role <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> to maintain and the previous season had been particularly draining on him. Many of this season's stories also had an elegiac tone, with entropy and decay being a recurring theme.|$|E

She was finding it <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> to handle a full-time music career and being a full-time wife and mother. She wrote a letter which was posted on the group's website, along with a letter from Heather, Shelley, and Denise. They {{made it clear that}} they had no intentions of carrying on as a trio, and called upon band leader Dana Cappillino's wife Leigh to join her husband on tour. Terry's last tour with the group was the 2003 Christmastime Tour with Michael W. Smith, and her last concert was in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 28, 2004. Leigh had been officially on board since January 1, 2004, but her first concert was in Atlanta, Georgia on March 12, 2004.|$|E

By 2 July 1997 Thailand abandoned its defence of the baht, allowing it to float freely. Indonesia, which had massive foreign reserves and was seen as having a strong economy, responded on 11 July 1997, by widening its exchange rate band from 8 to 12%. Indonesia had taken similar actions in the {{years leading up to}} the crisis, in December 1995 from 2 to 3%, in response to the Mexican {{financial crisis}}, and in June and September 1996 from 3 to 5% and then 5 to 8%. These actions had been successful in the past in defending the rupiah, but on this occasion there was a more serious crisis of confidence.|$|E

25|$|The {{marginal}} value theorem {{is a type}} of optimality model that is often applied to optimal foraging. This theorem is used to describe a situation in which an organism searching for food in a patch must decide when it is economically favorable to leave. While the animal is within a patch, it experiences the law of diminishing returns, where it becomes <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> to find prey as time goes on. This may be because the prey is being depleted, the prey begins to take evasive action and becomes harder to catch, or the predator starts crossing its own path more as it searches. This law of diminishing returns can be shown as a curve of energy gain per time spent in a patch (Figure 3). The curve starts off with a steep slope and gradually levels off as prey becomes harder to find. Another important cost to consider is the traveling time between different patches and the nesting site. An animal loses foraging time while it travels and expends energy through its locomotion.|$|E

500|$|While at Magdalen College, Wilde became {{particularly}} {{well known for}} his role in the aesthetic and decadent movements. He wore his hair long, openly scorned [...] "manly" [...] sports though he occasionally boxed, and decorated his rooms with peacock feathers, lilies, sunflowers, blue china and other objets d'art, once remarking to friends whom he entertained lavishly, [...] "I find it <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> every day to live up to my blue china." [...] The line quickly became famous, accepted as a slogan by aesthetes but used against them by critics who sensed in it a terrible vacuousness. Some elements disdained the aesthetes, but their languishing attitudes and showy costumes became a recognised pose. Wilde was once physically attacked by a group of four fellow students, and dealt with them single-handedly, surprising critics. By his third year Wilde had truly begun to create himself and his myth, and saw his learning developing in much larger ways than merely the prescribed texts. This attitude resulted in his being rusticated for one term, when he nonchalantly returned to college late from a trip to Greece with Prof. Mahaffy.|$|E

We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder.</b> Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there."

500|$|The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Scott's performance, {{as well as}} how {{the writers}} have [...] "smartly underplayed" [...] the {{relationship}} between Leslie and Ben. Meslow also liked that the April-Andy subplot was now resolved, as he called it the [...] "weakest plotline of the season", but he felt the scenes between Chris and Ann in [...] "Media Blitz" [...] were a rehash of the previous episode. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised Scott's performance, calling him a master at the straight man role, but said he was funnier the previous week in [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two": [...] "The laughs weren't as loud on [...] "Media Blitz," [...] as {{it was more of a}} squirm-inducing half hour of television." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN called it a fine episode that was [...] "dominated, in a good way, by its softer, sweeter moments", particularly the kiss between Andy and April, which he said [...] "was so damn sweet that I just couldn't resist it". Although he enjoyed the Perd Hapley interview, Fowler said he did not find Scott's performance otherwise especially funny. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis also praised Scott's performance, adding, [...] "Did anyone else's heart melt just a little bit at the proud smile that crept across Leslie’s face when Ben found his voice?" [...] Busis also said she was glad the April and Andy reconciled, as April's constant mistreatment of Andy was making it <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> to like her character. Busis criticized the Ann and Chris subplot, of which she said, [...] "Wake me up when something actually happens." ...|$|E
