50|$|In 1939, Crittall {{built its}} first <b>galvanising</b> <b>plant</b> at Witham, shortly before it once again became engaged in munitions {{production}} during the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, after lying dormant {{for over}} twenty years, {{part of the}} site was redeveloped for {{industrial}} use with Sperrin Galvanisers (Ireland) Ltd opening a steel <b>galvanising</b> <b>plant,</b> and Tynagh Energy Ltd a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant, the first in Galway.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 2000-2001 the Company set-up {{manufacturing}} facilities including a fabrication unit and a <b>galvanising</b> <b>plant</b> at Ranjangaon, near Pune for {{the manufacture of}} high masts, lattice towers, and related products, and the said manufacturing facilities commenced commercial production with effect from April 1, 2001.|$|E
5000|$|Bhusan Power and Steel {{started with}} a cold rolling and <b>galvanising</b> <b>plants</b> in 2001 at Bangihati, Mallickpara, Dankuni and have {{subsequently}} expanded.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the sepn. of heavy metal ions in water using a {{flocking}} agent comprises {{the following steps}} :(a) a carrier soln. contg. heavy metal ions {{is added to the}} water; (b) the resulting carrier metal suspension is pptd. using an organic polymer flocking agent; and (c) the residue is sepd. by standard techniques. USE - For removing any metal ions left in effluent (eg. from <b>galvanising</b> <b>plants)</b> treated by pptn. of insoluble metal hydroxides. ADVANTAGE - Relatively non-toxic materials are used, removal of metal ions is improved and no difficult to dispose waste (eg. spent ion exchange resin, sludge or algae loaded with metal ions) is generated...|$|R
2500|$|In 1929, with no {{room for}} {{expansion}} at Stalybridge, the Summers sheet rolling and <b>galvanising</b> <b>plants</b> were transferred to Shotton in North Wales, having devastating effects on local employment; the new plant later became a [...] component in the British Steel Corporation. By 1932, seven of the town's largest mills had closed and unemployment reached 7,000. In 1934 the borough council set up an Industrial Development Committee {{for the purpose of}} encouraging new industries to settle in the town. The committee purchased Cheetham's Mill and rented it out to small firms engaged {{in a wide variety of}} enterprises. By 1939 unemployment in the town had almost disappeared.|$|R
50|$|Hope's Gearings, {{along with}} their metal glazing systems, were fitted to many major {{industrial}} plants such as the Ford Dagenham assembly plant at Dagenham, Essex, and power stations such as Cliff Quay, Ipswich, Suffolk. In 1930 the company opened a hot-dip <b>galvanising</b> <b>plant</b> in Wednesbury, Staffordshire and this was, in the post-WW2 period, to become the main plant for metal window production.|$|E
50|$|In 1865 Gartcosh {{became the}} home of Woodneuk Iron Works owned by William Gray & Co. It was bought by Smith & McLeans in 1872 and {{subsequently}} Colville's steel mills. British Steel Corporation took ownership of the Colville's steel mill in Gartcosh in 1967 and operated until its closure in February 1986. The main steel mill building was demolished around 1994-95. The <b>galvanising</b> <b>plant</b> - latterly a storage shed for oversized products produced in the mill building - was used by a paper recycling company, Stirling Fibre, between October 1990 and October 2001. After this company relocated, the building was demolished in 2002.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 {{the club}} has been owned by local steel <b>galvanising</b> <b>plant,</b> Llamkos GalvaSteel and they changed their name from Kosova Vushtrri to Llamkos Kosova due to these {{ownership}} and sponsorship reasons. When the club {{was taken over by}} Llamkos GalvaSteel and the Core Group, there was immediate investment made which resulted in the club winning they 2013-14 league title, which was the first in its history. Llamkos GalvaSteel then distanced itself from the club as did the club's owner Jeton Sadiku, leaving the financing and management {{in the hands of the}} Vushtrri municipality. On 6 December 2014 Bekim Pantina was elected as the head of the club and the name reverted to KF Kosova Vushtrri.|$|E
50|$|Further {{investment}} in the 1990s and 2000s gave the <b>plant</b> <b>galvanising</b> facilities (through a joint venture Galtec with Dutch steelmaker Hoogovens opened 1998, and renamed Sidgal in 2002, followed by two more lines Sidgal 2 and Sidgal 3 in 2000.) and later the ability to continuous cast slab steel, as well as blast furnace expansion.|$|R
40|$|Hot zinc {{galvanising}} gives {{steel objects}} a corrosion resistant surface. The method demands large immersion basins for cleaning, pre-treatment and galvanising. Molten zinc {{has to be}} kept at a uniform temperature of 450 degrees C which requires a high consumption of energy. A Finnish company, Kuumagalvanionti Oy, has built a new hot zinc <b>galvanising</b> <b>plant.</b> By choosing to use electrical heating with sophisticated load control, energy consumption has been cut to 0. 15 kWh per kg of product. Average energy consumption of oil/gas fuelled zinc basins in Finland is about 0. 45 kWh/kg. The new plant also has a system for recycling the pickling fluid used in the process. This reduces cost and also minimises pollution...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{exerted by}} temperature on the resistant capacity of structural steel is well known. A highly efficient protection system for steel {{consists of the}} application of intumescent paints. In the case of fire, their effectiveness {{is based on the}} property that when they come into contact with flames they react by swelling to form an insulating layer, referred to as "intumescence", which impedes the propagation of heat. These paints do not require continuous maintenance though their service behaviour depends on the exposure conditions to which they are exposed. This paper studies the behaviour of two acrylated rubber type intumescent systems exposed to a <b>galvanising</b> <b>plant</b> for 16 months, evaluating the effect of the environment on the capacity to intumesce of the coating when subjected to heating. Es conocida la influencia que ejerce la temperatura en la capacidad resistente del acero estructural. Un sistema de protección del acero, altamente efectivo, consiste en la utilización de pinturas intumescentes. Su efectividad se basa en el hecho de que, en el caso eventual de un incendio, al entrar en contacto con la llama reaccionan hinchándose y formando una capa aislante que se denomina "intumescencia" y que impide la propagación del calor. Estas pinturas no precisan de un mantenimiento continuo, aunque su comportamiento en servicio depende de las condiciones de exposición. Este trabajo estudia el comportamiento de dos sistemas intumescentes de tipo caucho acrilado expuestos en una planta de galvanizado durante 16 meses, valorando el efecto del medio ambiente sobre la capacidad para intumescer del recubrimiento cuando es sometido a un calentamiento...|$|E
