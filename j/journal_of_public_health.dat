In the same year the government asked Shaw informally whether he would accept the Order of Merit. He declined, believing that an author's merit could only be determined by the posthumous verdict of history. 1946 saw the publication, as The Crime of Imprisonment, of the preface Shaw had written 20 years previously to a study of prison conditions.

500|$|Shilts' {{book has}} been used as a {{standard}} by the lay press when reviewing books chronicling subsequent medical crises including breast cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, Agent Orange, and continued response to AIDS. However, the academic and scientific communities have been somewhat more critical. Howard Merkel, in the American <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Health,</b> notes Shilts' tendency to assign blame, writing [...] "A requirement of the journalist, and certainly the historian, however, is to explain human society rather than to point fingers". Jon Katz in Rolling Stone refutes this by stating [...] " [...] fused strong belief with the gathering of factual information and the marshaling of arguments, the way the founders of the modern press did. In doing so, he has exposed the notion of objectivity as bankrupt, ineffective, even lethal".|$|E

In the American <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Health,</b> Howard Merkel characterizes And the Band Played On as the first volume of the historiography of AIDS.

40|$|This {{article is}} based on {{fieldwork}} conducted in southern Chad on the recent adoption of female circumcision. In Myabé, a village with a population of about 1, 000, girls were first circumcised around 1980. Residents describe female circumcision and their experiences of it in ways that contrast sharply with popular notions of what female circumcision means and how it is practiced, and with the descriptions and interpretations available in the medical, <b>public</b> <b>health,</b> and anthropological literatures. In making sense of these find-ings, the author questions the reasons for the hegemony of the “standard tale ” and argues for the need to allow a plurality of stories and experiences of female circumcision to emerge. There is a story about female circumcision. Most of us know it, having read it in the newspaper, or in the <b>journals</b> <b>of</b> medicine, <b>public</b> <b>health,</b> or anthropol-ogy, or even in recent best-selling novels.
