30|$|For our algorithm, {{three types}} of {{features}} are detected: end-points (points at the <b>extremities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessels),</b> interior-points (points along a vessel), junctions (a new vessel is a branch of a longer one - T-junctions or a vessel is split into two or more new vessels - bifurcation) and crossovers (one vessel passes over another). Please note that further processing is needed to distinguish between a crossover and a bifurcation.|$|R
60|$|The hatches were next removed, when it {{was found}} that the water in the schooner's hold had so far lowered, as to leave a vacant space of quite a foot between the lowest part of the deck and its surface. Toward the two <b>extremities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> this space {{necessarily}} was much increased, in consequence of the sheer. Men were now sent into the hatchway with orders to hook on to the flour-barrels--a whip having been rigged in readiness to hoist them on deck. At the same time gangs were sent to the pumps, though Spike still depended for getting rid of the water somewhat on the auger--the carpenter continuing to bore and plug his holes as new opportunities offered, and the old outlets became useless. It was true this expedient would soon cease, for the water having found its level in the vessel's hold, was very nearly on a level also with that on the outside. Bailing also was commenced, both forward and aft.|$|R
40|$|The two {{theoretical}} models proposed previously {{to calculate the}} intracapillary and transcapillary glomerular pressure gradients from the sieving of macromolecules such as PVP {{have been used to}} analyse in 22 normotensive dogs the sieving curve relating the sieving coefficients, Φ, to molecular size (Φ: glomerular clearance of PVP fractions/GFR). Neither the "local c 2 " model-filtrate unmixed at the outer face of the capillaries walls-nor the constant c 2 model-filtrate well mixed-allowed to obtain realistic values for the hemodynamical parameters. Indeed with the local c 2 model, the best fit between calculated and experimental sieving curves could be obtained only by reversing the intracapillary pressure gradient; conversely the constant c 2 model obliged to decrease the intracapillary pressure so abruptly along the capillaries, that retrofiltration took place in the distal parts <b>of</b> the <b>vessels.</b> This difficulty has been overcome by combining the two models; the so-called "hybrid model" considers that the filtrate is well mixed {{in the vicinity of the}} urinary pole only. The following results were obtained: 1. PGC a and PGC e (intracapillary pressures at the afferent and efferent <b>extremities</b> <b>of</b> the capillaries) equal to 49. 7 ± 1. 03 and 41. 8 ± 1. 00 mm Hg respectively. 2. Pressure equilibrium is generally reached at the efferent <b>extremity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessels.</b> 3. The slope of PGC {Mathematical expression} varies inversely to F. F. (filtration fraction). 4. The model, however, does not allow to rule out the possibility of retrofiltration. © 1975 Springer-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
60|$|No {{expectation}} existed of ever {{getting the}} schooner afloat again. All that Spike and the Señor Montefalderon now aimed at, was {{to obtain the}} doubloons, which the former thought could be got at in the following manner. He {{knew that it would}} be much easier handling the wreck, so far as its gravity was concerned, while the hull continued submerged. He also knew that one end could be raised with a comparatively trifling effort, so long as the other rested on the rock. Under these circumstances, therefore, he proposed merely to get slings around the after body of the schooner, as near her stern-post, indeed, as would be safe, and to raise that <b>extremity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> to the surface, leaving most of the weight of the craft to rest on the bows. The difference between the power necessary to effect this much, and that which would be required to raise the whole wreck, would be like the difference in power necessary to turn over a log with one end resting on the ground, and turning the same log by lifting it bodily in the arms, and turning it in the air. With the stern once above water, {{it would be easy to}} come at the bag of doubloons, which Jack Tier had placed in a locker above the transoms.|$|R

60|$|The {{conjecture}} of Judith Hutter, {{concerning the}} manner in which the Indian girl had met her death, was accurate in the main. After sleeping several hours, her father and March awoke. This occurred a few minutes after she had left the Ark to go in quest of her sister, and when of course Chingachgook and his betrothed were on board. From the Delaware the old man learned the position of the camp, and the recent events, as well as the absence of his daughters. The latter gave him no concern, for he relied greatly on the sagacity of the elder, and the known impunity with which the younger passed among the savages. Long familiarity with danger, too, had blunted his sensibilities. Nor did he seem much to regret the captivity of Deerslayer, for, while he knew how material his aid might be in a defence, the difference in their views on the morality of the woods, had not left much sympathy between them. He would have rejoiced to know the position of the camp before it had been alarmed by the escape of Hist, but it would be too hazardous now to venture to land, and he reluctantly relinquished for the night the ruthless designs that cupidity and revenge had excited him to entertain. In this mood Hutter took a seat in the head of the scow, where he was quickly joined by Hurry, leaving the Serpent and Hist in quiet possession <b>of</b> the other <b>extremity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessel.</b>|$|R
