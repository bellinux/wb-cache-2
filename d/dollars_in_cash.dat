As he rushes to leave, his briefcase falls open, revealing thousands of <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> he claims she was not supposed to have seen. Sawyer then informs her that he is meeting someone to get money for an investment that will triple his cash in two weeks, and Jessica tells him that she will get additional money from her husband, David (Michael DeLuise), so that she and Sawyer can split the profit. Later, Sawyer is revealed to be a con artist in debt with a loan shark, Kilo (Billy Mayo), who demands his money back, plus fifty percent, by the next day.

As {{the second wave}} landed, Major Siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two truckloads of soldiers and held a grenade {{in one hand and}} a radio in the other. His request to speak with the ambassador was granted. Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation. He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued. The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major, who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> and keys to the ambassador's armored car.

40|$|Economists {{have strong}} {{theoretical}} predictions about how in-kind transfers, such as providing vouchers for food, impact consumption. Despite {{the prominence of}} the theory, there is little empirical work on responses to in-kind transfers, and most existing work fails to support the canonical theoretical model. We employ difference-indifference methods to estimate the impact of program introduction on food spending. Consistent with predictions, we find that food stamps reduce out-of-pocket food spending and increase overall food expenditures. We also find that households are inframarginal and respond similarly to one <b>dollar</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> income and one <b>dollar</b> <b>in</b> food stamps. (JEL D 12, H 23, I 38) ...|$|R

25|$|Once the war began, the Confederacy pinned its {{hopes on}} {{military}} intervention by Great Britain and France. As for King Cotton, Confederate leaders were {{unaware that the}} British were not dependent on Southern cotton and that Great Britain had stocks on hand to last over a year, having developed alternative sources of cotton, most notably in India and Egypt. Great Britain was unwilling to risk war with the U.S. to acquire more cotton {{at the risk of}} losing the large quantities of food imported from the North. Meanwhile, the Confederate national government had lost control of its own foreign policy when cotton planters, factors, and financiers spontaneously decided to embargo shipments of cotton to Europe in early 1861. It was a hugely expensive mistake, depriving the Confederacy of millions of <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> it would desperately need.|$|E

Using the theory behind pyramid schemes, the resulting chain of money flowing back and forth would supposedly deliver a reward of thousands of dollars to the ones participating in the chain, as copies of their chain spread and more and more people sent one dollar to their address.|$|R

Enron's creditors, who lost about $63 billion due to its massive bankruptcy, were expected to receive between 17 and 22 cents on the <b>dollar</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> and <b>in</b> Prisma stock due to its parent company Enron's dissolution.
