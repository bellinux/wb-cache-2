The portrait I've created aims to capture the Queen's warm and friendly personality, rather than being a very formal portrait focusing more on her official status."

500|$|After Beebo Brinker, Bannon {{said the}} energy {{to write about the}} {{characters}} left her, but she got so good at her [...] "obsessive fantasies" [...] that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. [...] "I realize now that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting for my children to grow up and the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University.

500|$|When {{accessing}} the very deep emotions {{called for by}} her character, Mulligan stated, [...] "I really took my cue from the book". She noted that her role did not require her to have much to say, because Kathy {{was more of an}} observer throughout most of the film. She recalled that [...] "every time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> scene where I wasn’t quite sure where I was going with it, I would go to the book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much of the time she's not being truly honest with herself or the audience." [...] The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel [...] "insulted or hurt" [...] in discussion.|$|E
500|$|After {{the shoot}} at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to The Bahamas to shoot with real sharks. Recounting his {{experience}} there, actor Thomas Jane, who played shark wrangler Carter, said, [...] "The first day, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cage, {{but the next}} day, they swam me 30 feet down... Then this guy yanks the breather off me and the water's churning with blood and guts and stuff... It was so terrifying that I don't want to remember it." [...] The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish Deep Blue Sea from Jaws, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then.|$|E

Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it.

500|$|American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile, {{the second}} {{spin-off}} to the American Pie film series, was a commercial success, and Universal Pictures {{prepared for a}} sequel. The Naked Miles writer, Erik Lindsay, pitched the film by saying: [...] "Look, we're not going to top Animal House of course, but it's been 25 years. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fraternity for six years. Let's just make a straight pledging movie." [...] Universal gave Lindsay {{the green light to}} write Beta House, and also hired Andrew Waller and The Naked Miles producer, W. K. Border, as the film's director and producer, respectively. The film's screenplay was based on characters by Adam Herz and on aspects of Lindsay's own life. Lindsay felt that Universal being unworried about making the film similar to Animal House provided [...] "more opportunities to keep the story organic," [...] which he found the challenge of writing a sequel.|$|E

The superbly crafted, eccentric and evocative story of his Afghan travels was like a call to arms." [...] John Gimlette, in the same list, chooses Newby's Love and War in the Apennines. The Telegraph includes {{it as one of}} its [...] "20 best travel books of all time", describing Newby and Carless's meeting with the explorer Wilfred Thesiger as a [...] "hilarious segment".

The song {{contains}} a sample of the song [...] "Africa" [...] (1982) by American rock band Toto. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Fight for You" [...] features [...] "airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of [...] "Fight for You", saying: [...] "It's very relationship-based and the line [...] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relationship and I put myself in that place again where you would do anything to keep the relationship together so I went back to that place." ...|$|E

According to the Hungarian charter, he was subject to Charles I of Hungary as the voivode of Wallachia, although he was not at all. [...] Basarab was suddenly accused to be [...] "disloyal to the Holy Crown of Hungary" [...] in 1325. He seized the Banate of Severin and raided the southern regions of the Kingdom of Hungary. In fact, Charles Robert of Anjou, king of the Hungarians as Charles <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> desperate refuge in Timișoara and needed money to fight the middle and small nobility of Hungary. Basarab supported Michael Shishman of Bulgaria's attack against the Kingdom of Serbia, but their united armies were defeated in the Battle of Velbazhd on 28 July 1330. Soon after, Charles I of Hungary invaded Wallachia, but the Wallachians ambushed and almost annihilated the royal troops in the Battle of Posada, which occurred between 9 and 12 November 1330.
