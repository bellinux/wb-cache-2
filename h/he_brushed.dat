25|$|The 1992 {{season was}} also {{considered}} Dale Earnhardt's worst season of his career, finishing {{outside of the}} top ten in points, with only one win all season. He led the race early, but pitted at a yellow and fell a lap down. After battling back to the lead lap, <b>he</b> <b>brushed</b> the wall and finished 26th.|$|E

In December 2001, in Bangalore, Vaughan became the second Englishman, after Graham Gooch, and the 7th and most recent player in Test match history, {{to be given}} out handled the ball in Tests: on 64, <b>he</b> <b>brushed</b> away a ball from Sarandeep Singh, and was given out on appeal.|$|E
25|$|French’s {{division}} {{moved in}} line of squadron columns across a five-mile wide front, halting between 12.30 and 1pm at the well at Blauuwboschpan, {{where he left}} a garrison to hold until the infantry arrived. <b>He</b> <b>brushed</b> aside a small Boer force (perhaps 300 men) which attempted to block his path to the Modder River, but concerned {{that he might be}} attacked from the east by de Wet’s main force, moved quickly at 2pm to seize the crossings at Rondeval and Klip Drift (he aimed to at least threaten two crossings to avoid the delay which had happened at De Kiel's Drift). By 5pm he was able to send a galloper to Roberts with the message that he was across the Modder. He had lost only three men wounded, although 40 horses had died of exhaustion and over 500 were incapable of further work. French then had to wait a day while Kelly-Kenny’s 6th Infantry Division made a forced march from the Riet Crossings to the Modder Crossings, during which time Cronje, believing French’s advance to be a feint, missed an opportunity to reinforce the area.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the rules}} and banishments, there were {{incidents}} which {{made their way into}} newspapers. Billingsley associate Steve Hannagan believed that one [...] "good fight" [...] a year was permissible for a respectable night club. Johnny Weissmuller accused a Navy lieutenant of using a lit cigarette to burn the clothing of dancers as they passed his table. The lieutenant advised Weissmuller to get a haircut; his wife told Weissmuller to go back to Hollywood with the other ape-men. The Navy man suffered two black eyes and complained that Weissmuller's friends held him as he was punched by Weissmuller. [...] Ernest Hemingway once took issue with a stranger who slapped him on the back; knocking him into three chairs and a table as <b>he</b> <b>brushed</b> him away. Billingsley contended that many of the incidents that appeared in print were minor disagreements which were inflated by the press.|$|E
500|$|Truman's brief vice-presidency was {{relatively}} uneventful. On April 10, 1945, Truman cast his only tie-breaking vote as President of the Senate, against a Robert A. Taft {{amendment that would}} have blocked the postwar delivery of Lend-Lease Act items contracted for during the war. Roosevelt rarely contacted him, even to inform him of major decisions; the President and Vice President met alone together only twice during their time in office. In {{one of his first}} acts as vice president, Truman created some controversy when he attended the disgraced Pendergast's funeral. <b>He</b> <b>brushed</b> aside the criticism, saying simply, [...] "He was always my friend and I have always been his." [...] He had rarely discussed world affairs or domestic politics with Roosevelt; he was uninformed about major initiatives relating to the war and the top-secret Manhattan Project, which was about to test the world's first atomic bomb. He was also photographed with actress Lauren Bacall sitting atop the piano at the National Press Club as he played for soldiers.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the actor}} turned 18, his sexualized image was often critiqued, {{and subject to}} controversy. In December 2009, Lautner {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Rolling Stone in a wet T-shirt. Jennifer Cady of E! Online said to wait a few months when Lautner would [...] "be of age, which will make this whole operation you got going on completely legal." [...] In his interview with the magazine, after declining to talk about whether he was dating Taylor Swift, the magazine pressed Lautner on rumors of him being homosexual, which <b>he</b> <b>brushed</b> off. Brent Hartinger, a columnist for AfterElton, blasted the magazine, calling the questioning [...] "unimaginably irresponsible," [...] commenting that Lautner was just [...] "a 17-year old kid" [...] and that while the rumors were baseless and speculation from certain blogs and fans, it was disappointing that a [...] "legitimate media outlet" [...] would print gossip. Hartinger said the magazine reached a [...] "new low" [...] and did not have common decency, noting that the line between child and adult [...] "is there for a good reason".|$|E

2500|$|The Syrian {{rebellion}} {{was backed}} by the Egyptians (Hanuna of Gaza was encouraged by them and so rebelled) and led by the ruler of Hamath. The cities of Damascus, Samaria {{and a few other}} Phoenician cities also broke away and allied once again to face the threat of Assyria. The rebellion was ultimately doomed; the coalition lacked the military ability to stop Sargon's rapid advance south. After taking Arpad, Sargon II smashed the coalition army at Qarqar, thereby avenging the stalemate of Shalmaneser III. Hamath, followed by Damascus and then Samaria fell. Sargon then went on to take Gaza where <b>he</b> <b>brushed</b> aside an Egyptian expeditionary force. Hanuna was captured and flayed ...|$|E
2500|$|Mindarus set {{out from}} Miletus with 73 ships; a storm forced him ashore at Chios, but he {{remained}} there only a few days. [...] Sailing with haste to avoid an Athenian fleet that had been brought up from Samos to oppose him, he succeeded in bringing his fleet between Lesbos and the mainland and into the Hellespont, where <b>he</b> <b>brushed</b> aside a small Athenian fleet and joined the few allied ships in {{the region in the}} Spartan base at Abydos. [...] With this strategic move, Mindarus had placed his fleet in position to cut off the Athenian grain supply, and had forced the Athenian fleet to challenge him on ground of his choosing.|$|E
2500|$|Even Maine Senator Edmund Muskie {{tested the}} limits of {{political}} muscle when <b>he</b> <b>brushed</b> against Leavitt's following. It was arranged for Muskie to go ice-fishing with Bud Leavitt—or as Muskie adviser Clyde MacDonald Jr. put it, [...] "possibly the greatest political event that could be arranged at that time." [...] MacDonald lived next to columnist Leavitt, whom the Muskie aide inveigled to accompany Muskie on a fishing trip to an Ellsworth, Maine, lake. Muskie landed the prize-winning fish, headlined in the next day's Bangor newspaper. As Muskie recalled, his fishing trip with Leavitt made a deeper impression than most of his electoral efforts. [...] "Muskie {{throughout the rest of}} his career would say, 'You know, I fought for Dickey-Lincoln , and I prevented them from closing Loring, but the thing that people talk about is that fish.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when <b>he</b> <b>brushed</b> the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem. It's not like we were having a problem out on the racetrack with her. It's not like I just drew her name out of a hat and decided she was the one I was going to run into tonight." ...|$|E
2500|$|The mood aboard Bismarck was mixed. Seaman Adolf Eich was {{off duty}} for some fresh air. He climbed {{up to the}} bridge {{for as long as}} nobody stopped him. When he got there he found the {{atmosphere}} pleasant. Lindemann was shaking the hand of Adalbert Schneider for his Knight's Cross award bestowed upon him for the destruction of Hood. Lütjens also looked pleased. As the morning wore on the atmosphere changed. Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann wearing a life jacket and watched as the captain ate his breakfast in silence. He did not return Müllenheim-Rechberg's salute. Müllenheim-Rechberg also met Lütjens as the Admiral {{made his way to the}} bridge. Lütjens returned his salute as <b>he</b> <b>brushed</b> past but said nothing. To Müllenheim-Rechberg it seemed as if the two men most responsible for Bismarck had retreated into their own private worlds. That morning, on the 27 May 1941, Lütjens sent a request for a U-Boat to pick up the ship's war diary. In this last transmission, Lütjens included: [...] "Ship no longer manoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the Führer". Lütjens did not hide their fate from his crew. He ordered the ships stores to be opened and allowed the crew to help themselves. It was a sign to all onboard Bismarck was doomed.|$|E

50|$|In {{referring}} to an action taking place regularly (and {{not limited to}} the future or to the past), the simple present is used: <b>He</b> <b>brushes</b> his teeth every morning. For an action taking place at the present time, the present progressive construction is used: <b>He</b> is <b>brushing</b> his teeth now. With some verbs expressing a present state, particularly the copula be and verbs expressing a mental state, the present simple is generally used: They are here; I know that. However other state verbs use the present progressive or present simple depending on whether the state is considered temporary or permanent: The pen is lying on the table; Paris lies on the Seine.|$|R
