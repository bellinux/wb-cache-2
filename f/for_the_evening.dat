40|$|Abstract. We adapt a {{basis of}} Habiro’s <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> Kauffman bracket skein module of S 1 ˆD 2 to define bases <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> and odd skein modules of S 1 ˆD 2 {{relative}} to two points.

These even and odd Kauffman bracket ideals are obstructions to tangle embeddings. Using our even and odd bases <b>for</b> <b>the</b> relative skein modules, we show how to compute a finite list of generators <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> and odd Kauffman bracket ideals of a genus- 1 tangle. We do this explicitly for three genus- 1 tangles. We relate these ideals to determinants of closures of genus- 1 tangles. 1...|$|R

5|$|During {{and after}} the war, Hutton worked for a paper manufacturer, but writing and journalism {{provided}} a more permanent career. Hutton worked with Thomas Moult, a journalist and writer, to produce a book of memoirs, Cricket is My Life in 1949, and he wrote for the News of the World while still playing. Following his cricketing retirement, Hutton worked in broadcasting until 1961, and after 1955, he wrote for the London Evening News until 1963. A second book, Just my story, followed in 1956 in collaboration with journalist, R. J. Hayter. In 1958–59, Hutton travelled to Australia to cover the MCC tour as correspondent <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Evening</b> News, again assisted by a professional journalist, while between 1963 and 1986, he wrote for The Observer. He wrote a third book, Thirty Years in Cricket, in 1984. Hutton's increasing commitments {{in the south of}} England meant he moved to North London in 1959. In 1960, Hutton was invited to join the engineering firm of J. H. Fenner, mainly working in a public relations capacity. Later, he moved into marketing and overseas promotion of products, became a director of the firm in 1973, and retired in 1984.|$|E

There, Disney {{attended}} the Benton Grammar School, {{where he met}} fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came {{from a family of}} theatre fans and introduced Disney to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures. Before long, he was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' house than at home. Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times. Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the Times before school and repeated the round <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> Star after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years. He attended Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute and also took a correspondence course in cartooning.|$|E
5|$|KaDee Strickland's character, Charlotte King, {{who would}} be {{introduced}} in the spin-off's first-season premiere, did {{not appear in the}} backdoor pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season. She did not have to audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes. Also not present in the backdoor pilot was McDonald, due to her character, Naomi Bennett, being portrayed by a different actress, Merrin Dungey. However, on June 29, 2007, ABC announced that Dungey would be replaced, with no reason given for the change. The drama was titled Private Practice, and its premiere episode followed {{the second part of the}} season debut of Dancing with the Stars, and provided a lead-in to fellow freshman series Dirty Sexy Money.

5|$|Throughout the {{following}} day, the US forces attempted to retake the lost positions {{in order to}} restore the integrity of their line. Fighting raged throughout the day into the early afternoon, by which time they had successfully recaptured several of the pillboxes, supported by mortar fire. In the evening, the Americans used indirect fire and searchlights to harass the Japanese, but by early morning, just before dawn, they struck again, and captured another pillbox. As morning progressed, the US commander requested tank support and four tanks from the 754th Tank Battalion were dispatched. In the meantime, minor counterattacks succeeded in regaining part of the line; by mid-morning the tanks joined the fighting and several more positions were retaken by the US troops in several attacks before and after lunch. Having run out of ammunition and running low on fuel, {{the first group of}} tanks was withdrawn and replaced with a fresh platoon of tanks with which the attack was resumed in the mid-afternoon. Fighting continued throughout the day until 7:30pm when the Japanese retired from the position <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> having been forced to give up all of their earlier gains by a determined American counterattack.|$|E
40|$|This paper refines {{previous}} {{work by the}} first author. We study the question of which links in the 3 -sphere can be obtained as closures of a given 1 -manifold in an unknotted solid torus in the 3 -sphere (or genus- 1 tangle) by adjoining another 1 -manifold in the complementary solid torus. We distinguish between even and odd closures, and define even and odd versions of the Kauffman bracket ideal. These even and odd Kauffman bracket ideals are used to obstruct even and odd tangle closures. Using a basis of Habiro's <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> Kauffman bracket skein module of the solid torus, we define bases <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> and odd skein module of the solid torus relative to two points. These even and odd bases allow us to compute a finite list of generators <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> and odd Kauffman bracket ideals of a genus- 1 tangle. We do this explicitly for three examples. Furthermore, we use <b>the</b> <b>even</b> and odd Kauffman bracket ideals to conclude in some cases that the determinants of all even/odd closures of a genus- 1 tangle possess a certain divisibility.
