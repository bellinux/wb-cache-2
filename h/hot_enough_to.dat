5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> overpower the cold menses, {{the child will}} be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E
5|$|All heavier {{elements}} (including those {{necessary for}} rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> fuse helium itself. All elements other than {{hydrogen and helium}} today account for only 2% {{of the mass of}} atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of the}} Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> do so farther out.|$|E

5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, it will never become <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> fuse helium in its core. It is thought that, over a lifespan that considerably exceeds {{the age of the}} Universe (c. 13.8 billion years), such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei. Due to the very long time this process takes, it is not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs. Rather, they are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are met by Phoebe Green, an {{investigator}} from London's Metropolitan Police and Mulder's former lover from Oxford University. Green explains that a serial arsonist is targeting the British aristocracy, burning his victims alive while leaving {{no trace of}} evidence. The only links between the crimes are the suspect's love letters to the victims' wives. His latest target is Sir Malcolm Marsden, who is visiting Cape Cod for protection after escaping an attack by the killer. Mulder and Scully visit a pyrotechnics expert who says that only rocket fuel can burn <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> destroy evidence of its origins.|$|E
5|$|Subglacial mounds (SUGM) of the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex are {{an unusual}} type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting overlying glacial ice {{at a time}} when this region was covered by glacial ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. These subglacial eruptions were not <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> melt a vertical pipe right through the overlying glacial ice, instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow-shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath the glacial ice field. Once the glaciers had retreated, the subglacial volcanoes would be revealed, with a unique shape {{as a result of their}} confinement within glacial ice.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a giant}} {{star with}} a stellar {{classification}} of G8 III; its outer envelope has expanded to about 14 times the radius of the Sun.

50|$|It is {{not clear}} why or how the walls were {{subjected}} to vitrification. Some antiquarians have {{argued that it was}} done to strengthen the wall, but the heating actually weakens the structure.

5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E
5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{convection}} zone {{extends from}} 0.7 solar radii (200,000km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> transfer the heat {{energy of the}} interior outward via radiation. Instead, {{the density of the}} plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks {{to the base of the}} convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).|$|E
50|$|Most {{hydronic}} systems require balancing. This involves measuring {{and setting}} the flow to achieve an optimal distribution {{of energy in the}} system.In a balanced system every radiator gets just <b>enough</b> <b>hot</b> water <b>to</b> allow it to heat up fully.|$|R

50|$|The protons of {{hydrogen}} combine to helium {{only if they}} have <b>enough</b> velocity <b>to</b> overcome each other's mutual repulsion sufficiently to get within range of the strong nuclear attraction. This means that fusion only occurs within a very hot gas. Hydrogen <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> for combining <b>to</b> helium requires an enormous pressure to keep it confined, but suitable conditions exist in the central regions of the Sun, where such pressure {{is provided by the}} enormous weight of the layers above the core, pressed inwards by the Sun's strong gravity. The process of combining protons to form helium is an example of nuclear fusion.|$|R
5|$|This is a {{relatively}} peaceful event, nothing akin to a supernova, which the Sun {{is too small to}} undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely. However, the star's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos, causing some to collide, others to be ejected from the Solar System, and still others to be torn apart by tidal interactions. Afterwards, all that will remain of the Sun is a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, 54% its original mass but only the size of the Earth. Initially, this white dwarf may be 100times as luminous as the Sun is now. It will consist entirely of degenerate carbon and oxygen, but will never reach temperatures <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> fuse these elements. Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool, growing dimmer and dimmer.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{collapse}} of a solar-mass protostellar nebula takes around 100,000years. Every nebula begins {{with a certain amount}} of angular momentum. Gas in the central part of the nebula, with relatively low angular momentum, undergoes fast compression and forms a hot hydrostatic (not contracting) core containing a small fraction of the mass of the original nebula. This core forms the seed of what will become a star. As the collapse continues, conservation of angular momentum means that the rotation of the infalling envelop accelerates, which largely prevents the gas from directly accreting onto the central core. The gas is instead forced to spread outwards near its equatorial plane, forming a disk, which in turn accretes onto the core. The core gradually grows in mass until it becomes a young hot protostar. At this stage, the protostar and its disk are heavily obscured by the infalling envelope and are not directly observable. In fact the remaining envelope's opacity is so high that even millimeter-wave radiation has trouble escaping from inside it. Such objects are observed as very bright condensations, which emit mainly millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave radiation. They are classified as spectral Class0 protostars. The collapse is often accompanied by bipolar outflows—jets—that emanate along the rotational axis of the inferred disk. The jets are frequently observed in star-forming regions (see Herbig–Haro (HH) objects). The luminosity of the Class0 protostars is high— a solar-mass protostar may radiate at up to 100 solar luminosities. The source of this energy is gravitational collapse, as their cores are not yet <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> begin nuclear fusion.|$|E
25|$|Like Pytheas, Posidonius {{believed}} {{the tide is}} caused by the moon. Posidonius was, however, wrong about the cause.

50|$|The {{climate of}} Bismarck in the U.S. state of North Dakota is humid {{continental}} (Köppen Dfb), caused {{primarily by the}} combination of its mid-level latitude and location {{not far from the}} geographic centre of the U.S. Its summers are <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> for it <b>to</b> border on having a Köppen Dfa classification, and precipitation is high <b>enough</b> for it <b>to</b> barely avoid being classified as semi-arid (Köppen climate classification BSk).

25|$|It is {{very hard}} to come up with another process that would produce {{deuterium}} other than by nuclear fusion.
