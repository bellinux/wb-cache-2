40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Mapping of snow cover using ERTS- 1 data {{proved to be}} six times faster than that done from U- 2 photography. However, NOAA- 2 VHRR snow cover mapping was almost as fast as ERTS- 1, and it is available more frequently. Ice conditions in the Great Lakes can be readily determined by ERTS- 1. Ice features characteristic of thawing conditions such as rotten ice, lack of pressure ridges, brash belts, and compacted ice edges can be identified. A great decrease in apparent reflectivity in band 7 as compared to band 4 also indicated melting conditions. Using sidelap from two successive ERTS- 1 images of Lake Erie (February 17 and 18, 1973) a measure of ice movement was made, agreeing closely with the estimate from conventional methods. The same imagery permitted tentative identification of the following features: shuga, light and dark nilas, fast ice, icefoot, ice breccia, brash ice, fracturing, ridging, rafting, sastrugi, thaw holes, rotten ice, ice islands, <b>dried</b> <b>ice</b> puddles, hummocked ice, and leads...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAqueous {{solutions}} equilibrated with supercritical CO(2) (150 degrees C {{and total}} pressure of 150 bar) were investigated {{in order to}} characterize their respective conditions of carbonation. Dissolution of olivine and subsequent precipitation of magnesite with a net consumption of CO(2) were expected. A quantified pure mineral phase (powders with different olivine grain diameter [20 - 80 mu m], [80 - 125 mu m], [125 - 200 mu m] and [> 200 mu m]), CO(2) (as <b>dried</b> <b>ice)</b> were placed in closed-batch reactors (soft Au tubes) {{in the presence of}} solutions. Different salinities (from 0 to 3400 mM) and different ratios of solution/solid (mineral phase) (from 0. 1 to 10) were investigated. Experiments were performed over periods from 2 to 8 weeks. Final solid products were quantified by the Rock-Eval 6 technique, and identified using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, electron microprobe and scanning electron microscopy. Gaseous compounds were quantified by a vacuum line equipped with a Toepler pump and identified and measured by gas chromatography (GC). Carbon mass balances were calculated. Olivine reacted completely with CO(2), trapping up to 57 +/- 2 % (eqC of initial CO(2)) as magnesite; some amorphous silica also formed. Olivine grain diameter and solution/mineral ratios appeared to be the primary controls on the reaction, salinity acting as a second order parameter. During the experiments, fluid analyses may not be performed with approach adopted but, geochemical modelling was attempted to give information about the solution composition. This showed an interesting mineral matrix evolution. Under the experimental conditions, olivine appeared to be a good candidate for CO(2) trapping into a geologically stable carbonate, magnesite. The possible use of mafic and ultramafic rocks for CO(2) sequestration is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Tomco Equipment Company {{has participated}} in the <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> (solid carbon dioxide, CO 2) {{cleaning}} industry for over ten years as {{a pioneer in the}} manufacturer of high density, <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> cleaning pellet production equipment. For over four years Tomco high density pelletizers have been available to the <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> cleaning industry. Approximately one year ago Tomco introduced the DI- 250, a new <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> blast unit making Tomco a single source supplier for sublimable media, particle blast, cleaning systems. This new blast unit is an all pneumatic, single discharge hose device. It meters the insertion of 1 / 8 inch diameter (or smaller), high density, <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> pellets into a high pressure, propellant gas stream. The <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> and propellant streams are controlled and mixed from the blast cabinet. From there the mixture is transported to the nozzle where the pellets are accelerated to an appropriate blasting velocity. When directed to impact upon a target area, these <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> pellets have sufficient energy to effectively remove most surface coatings through dry, abrasive contact. The meta-stable, <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> pellets used for CO 2 cleaning, while labeled 'high density,' are less dense than alternate, abrasive, particle blast media. In addition, after contacting the target surface, they return to their equilibrium condition: a superheated gas state. Most currently used grit blasting media are silicon dioxide based, which possess a sharp tetrahedral molecular structure. Silicon dioxide crystal structures will always produce smaller sharp-edged replicas of the original crystal upon fracture. Larger, softer <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> pellets do not share the same sharp-edged crystalline structures as their non-sublimable counterparts when broken. In fact, upon contact with the target surface, <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> pellets will plastically deform and break apart. As such, <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> cleaning is less harmful to sensitive substrates, workers and the environment than chemical or abrasive cleaning systems. <b>Dry</b> <b>ice</b> cleaning system components include: a <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> pellet supply, a non-reactive propellant gas source, a pellet and propellant metering device, and a media transport and acceleration hose and nozzle arrangement. <b>Dry</b> <b>ice</b> cleaning system operating parameters include: choice of propellant gas, its pressure and temperature, <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> mass flow rate, <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> pellet size and shape, and acceleration nozzle configuration. These parameters may be modified to fit different applications. The growth of the <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> cleaning industry will depend upon timely data acquisition of the effects that independent changes in these parameters have on cleaning rates, with respect to different surface coating and substrate combinations. With this data, optimization of cleaning rates for particular applications will be possible.
