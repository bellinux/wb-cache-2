5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the <b>farmhouse</b> to think. He sees old photographs, {{including}} one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the <b>farmhouse</b> to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the <b>farmhouse</b> – and they finally reconcile.|$|E

5|$|The farm {{buildings}} of Home Farm, including its dovecote, {{were built in}} the early-19th century, and feature Flemish bond brickwork. Sinderland House, also dating from the early-19th century, is another of Dunham Massey's listed farmhouses. Manor <b>Farmhouse,</b> on Station Road, was built by George Booth, 2nd Earl of Warrington; the building dates from the mid-18th century and features both Flemish and garden wall bond brickwork. The <b>farmhouse</b> on Station Road was built in 1752. The barn on Woodhouse Lane dates from the early 18th century and features garden wall bond brickwork, a slate roof, and upper cruck frames. Dog <b>Farmhouse,</b> also on Woodhouse Lane, was built in the early 19th century; however it may have been an adaptation of an earlier, possibly 18th-century, <b>farmhouse.</b>|$|E
5|$|The parish {{contains}} {{a total of}} seven Grade II listed buildings and one Grade II* listed building—the Church of All Saints. Some of the oldest parts of the church date from the 13th century, although the structure was virtually rebuilt afresh in 1877. The church roof consists of red tiles with a small broach spire and a wooden turret. The walls are made of flint with stone dressed buttresses and the windows date from the Restoration period. Other listed buildings in the vicinity include Southwood <b>Farmhouse,</b> Manor <b>Farmhouse</b> and the Upper <b>Farmhouse.</b> Southwood <b>Farmhouse</b> is two storeys high and dates from the 18th century. Its walls are made of red brick with cambered floor openings and its roof is steeply tiled. Manor <b>Farmhouse</b> lies {{to the south of}} the village and consists of a near-identical design with Southwood <b>Farmhouse,</b> although it was probably constructed in the early 19th century. The Upper <b>Farmhouse</b> lies in the centre of the village and is a house of mixed periods. The building itself dates from the 17th century, though expansions were made in the 18th and 19th centuries. The house has interior framing and a Victorian lighting system. Its taller expansions were made in the 18th century, and in between the expansions lies a 19th century gable with a brick porch at its north side.|$|E
25|$|In Westphalia {{all these}} <b>farmhouses</b> have a gable roof. In parts of Lower Saxony and in Holstein {{there is a}} mix of <b>farmhouses</b> with gable and hipped-gable roofs, and in Mecklenburg almost all have hipped-gables. A pure hipped roof is rare.|$|R

5|$|As {{well as the}} two churches {{dedicated}} to Saint Werburgh, there are 15 other GradeII listed buildings. The parish rooms and caretaker's house were built in 1889, and designed by John Douglas. Also built in the village by Douglas was the post office in 1893, and Warburton School in 1871–72; this has been converted to a residence but still features crucks supporting the roof. Some farm buildings in Warburton are also listed, including the <b>farmhouse</b> on Moss Lane. The barn is 18th-century but features crucks which may be 17th-century or earlier. The timber framed farm building on Park Road is 17th-century in origin; the late-18th-century <b>farmhouse</b> on Warburton Lane was made with Flemish bond brick and has a slate roof. The barn on Paddock Lane dates from the 17th century. Also on Paddock Lane are two farmhouses: one was built in 1717 by Thomas Egerton and features an inglenook fireplace; the other is Wigsey <b>Farmhouse</b> which was originally built in the 17th century with later additions, including a 19th-century porch. The building on Warburton Lane near Villa <b>Farmhouse</b> was originally a timber framed building from the 16th or early 17th century. The house features late-16th- or early-17th-century frescos of a woman, possibly St Werburgh, with two geese and a rose.|$|E

5|$|The leftmost division, {{advanced}} on La Haye Sainte. The <b>farmhouse</b> was {{defended by}} the King's German Legion. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out {{to either side}} and, {{with the support of}} several squadrons of cuirassiers, succeeded in isolating the <b>farmhouse.</b> The King's German Legion resolutely defended the <b>farmhouse.</b> Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.|$|E
5|$|Yew Tree <b>Farmhouse,</b> one of {{the oldest}} {{buildings}} in the area, is a cruck built <b>farmhouse</b> of which there are very few in North Somerset.
