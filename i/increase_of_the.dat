5|$|There are {{dynamical}} forces {{acting on}} the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, {{it was expected that}} the rate of <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hubble Constant would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day rate of <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{precipitation}} kinetics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GP zones in a supersaturated solid solution depends on <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> its supersaturation which induces a driving force. <b>The</b> magnitude <b>of</b> this driving force <b>increases</b> with <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> undercooling and <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solute supersaturation.

5|$|A direct {{relativistic}} effect {{is that as}} atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus {{as a result of}} the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though this is not quite applicable for dubnium): for example, the 7s orbital is contracted by 25% in size and stabilized by 2.6 eV.|$|E
5|$|A {{third round}} of {{guidelines}} was issued in April 2012 when the company {{announced that it would}} begin phasing in a plan to stop purchasing poultry and pork products from suppliers that caged animals. With this announcement, Burger King became the first American Fast food company to promise to purchase 100% of its eggs from companies that did not utilize wire battery cages and pork from suppliers that did not use gestational cages for sows. This is an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> percentage of cage free products from 9% of egg purchases and 20% of pork purchases the company made in 2008. The plan should be completed by 2017.|$|E

The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stellar radius from pole to equator.

5|$|Corzine, in {{attempting}} to pass his conceptual budget, came into conflict with fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's sales tax from 6% to 7% to fill a $4.5 billion budget gap. Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated {{that he would not}} accept a budget that did not include a sales tax increase. Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet period saw a rapid <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population, {{although}} most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads. The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization, including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements, and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized, largely due to its strategic position and {{the discovery of the}} vast apatite deposits in the 1920s. As a result, the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage, including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting.|$|E
50|$|For {{conventional}} cryptographic systems, we {{can improve}} <b>the</b> security <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protocol by <b>increasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key length.

However, the numbers of one of the subspecies, the Eastern white-bearded wildebeest (C. t. albojubatus) have seen a steep decline. Population density ranges from 0.15/km2. in Hwange and Etosha National Parks to 35/km2 in Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Serengeti National Park.|$|E
