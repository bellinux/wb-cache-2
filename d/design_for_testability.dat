50|$|Due to {{the high}} {{complexity}} of the sequential ATPG, it remains a challenging task for large, highly sequential circuits that do not incorporate any <b>Design</b> <b>For</b> <b>Testability</b> (DFT) scheme. However, these test generators, combined with low-overhead DFT techniques such as partial scan, have shown {{a certain degree of}} success in testing large designs. For designs that are sensitive to area or performance overhead, the solution of using sequential-circuit ATPG and partial scan offers an attractive alternative to the popular full-scan solution, which is based on combinational-circuit ATPG.|$|E
50|$|Test {{compression}} is {{a technique}} used to reduce the time and cost of testing integrated circuits. The first ICs were tested with test vectors created by hand. It proved {{very difficult to get}} good coverage of potential faults, so <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>testability</b> (DFT) based on scan and automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) were developed to explicitly test each gate and path in a design. These techniques were very successful at creating high-quality vectors for manufacturing test, with excellent test coverage. However, as chips got bigger the ratio of logic to be tested per pin increased dramatically, and the volume of scan test data started causing a significant increase in test time, and required tester memory. This raised the cost of testing.|$|E

We use a test strategy based on physical <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>testability</b> (to discover both open and short faults, which are difficult or even impossible to detect). Consequen-tially, layout level <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>testability</b> (LLDFI') rules have been developed, which prevent the faults, or at least reduce the chance of their appearing. The main purpose of this work is to apply a practical set of LLDFT rules to the library cells designed by the Centre Nacional de Microelectrbnica (CNM) and obtain a highly testable cell library. The main results of the application of the LLDFI ' rules (area overheads and performance degradation) are summarized and the results are significant since IC design is highly repetitive; a small effort to improve cell layout can bring about great improvement in design.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient register-transfer level partitioning approach for sequential circuits. It {{is based on}} the results of an testability analysis algorithm at register-transfer level. The testability is measured by the structure such as feedbacks, branches, fan-in and fanout, etc, the combinational and sequential depth from I/O ports and the testability characteristics of the components used in the design. It reflects the ATPG and test application time for achieving high test quality. The test quality can be improved significantly by independent test generation and test application for every partitioning.

40|$|Abstract—Conventional scan design imposes {{considerable}} {{area and}} delay overheads. To establish a scan chain {{in the test}} mode, multiplexers at the inputs of flip-flops and scan wires {{are added to the}} actual design. We propose a low-overhead scan design methodology that employs a new test-point insertion technique. Unlike the conventional test-point insertion, where test points are used directly to increase the controllability and observability of the selected signals, the test points are used here to establish scan paths through the functional logic. The proposed technique reuses the functional logic for scan operations; as a result, the design-fortestability overhead on area or timing can be minimized. We show an algorithm that uses the new test-point insertion technique to reduce the area overhead <b>for</b> the full-scan <b>design.</b> We also discuss its application to the timing-driven partial-scan <b>design.</b> Index Terms—Design <b>for</b> <b>testability.</b> I...|$|R
