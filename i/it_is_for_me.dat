5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E
500|$|On 18 January 2007, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin {{presented}} Pinter with France's highest civil honour, the Légion d'honneur, at {{a ceremony}} at the French Embassy in London. [...] De Villepin praised Pinter's poem [...] "American Football" [...] (1991) stating: [...] "With its violence and its cruelty, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{one of the most}} accurate images of war, one of the most telling metaphors of the temptation of imperialism and violence." [...] In response, Pinter praised France's opposition to the war in Iraq. [...] M. de Villepin concluded: [...] "The poet stands still and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry teaches us how to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live." [...] He said that Pinter received the award particularly [...] "because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [...] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly universal". Lawrence Pollard observed that [...] "the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual".|$|E
2500|$|For 60 {{years the}} Tonight Show has aired {{immediately}} following the late local news. I sincerely believe that delaying the Tonight Show into {{the next day to}} accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isn’t the Tonight Show. [...] So it has come to this: I cannot express in words how much I enjoy hosting this program and what an enormous personal disappointment <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to consider losing it. My staff and I have worked unbelievably hard and we are very proud of our contribution to the legacy of The Tonight Show. But I cannot participate in what I honestly believe is its destruction.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Master, do {{not think}} that I would {{question}} you. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to keep the fire alight, and the thatch close against the rain, and strong, lest the wind blow it among the trees; and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to take the heavy books from the shelves, and to lift from its corner the great painted roll with the names of the Sidhe, and to possess the while an incurious and reverent heart, for right well I know that God has made out of His abundance a separate wisdom for everything which lives, and to do these things is my wisdom.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{what use}} would <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to complain? In view {{of all that}} has {{happened}} we have been remarkably fortunate in getting away alive, and consequently there is very much to be thankful for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would at}} once, {{only for the}} business," [...] said Mr Rubb. [...] "If there's {{anything}} I hate, it's decorum. How pleasant <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to <b>be</b> asked in to take tea here in this social way!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Decades later, W.H. Auden {{wrote to}} his former professor, I don't think that I have ever told you what an unforgettable {{experience}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> as an undergraduate, hearing you recite Beowulf. The voice {{was the voice of}} Gandalf.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you have}} done well," [...] Petronius said courteously. [...] "It was but half conquered when you landed, it is wholly subdued now. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> only to gather the fruit of your victories." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” {{said the}} man, {{in a voice}} that was curiously expressionless, “you heard Miss Harding’s story. She was very fair—about Lucy Davidson—but you can realize how {{difficult}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to go into that?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so sad {{as others}} I have passed," [...] I answered, [...] "and perils are my daily bread {{in every sense}} of the word. Moreover, {{whatever}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> it is for you also." ...|$|E
60|$|Well had <b>it</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> if I {{had done}} so, and well <b>for</b> some who <b>were</b> yet unborn. Then {{they had never}} known death, nor I the land of exile, the taste of slavery, and the altar of sacrifice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lass, if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> you <b>were</b> asking my life I'd {{swear it}} yours for always, and I'd be a man," [...] he replied with bitterness; [...] "but not {{to save my}} soul would I ask {{anything}} of him." ...|$|R
5000|$|In another interview, Cameron Monaghan {{talked about}} his {{character}} getting killed, [...] "In many ways the episode <b>is,</b> at least <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> a love letter to the character and to 75 years of the character in that it's an acknowledgment that there's something about this personality that is infectious and seductive. It sticks in your brain {{in a way that}} it just lodges in there and it can burrow its way into a popular consciousness — obviously the character of the Joker has. So we see a reflection of that in that this man, this personality, it ripples across the city in some meaningful way. That’s what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> at least." ...|$|R
6000|$|The figure grinned. [...] "Surely; but, if thou standest upon punctilio, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>ME</b> to ask thine, most noble Freiherr," [...] said he, winking {{upon his}} retainers. [...] "Whom have I {{the honor of}} entertaining?" ...|$|E
60|$|Alors! I {{open the}} cage-door and {{disappear}} discreetly. It is not politic that I remain to witness what shall transpire. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to establish an}} alibi. I go to the drawing-room, where I remain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I may be, but you've got {{to indulge}} me. I've taken this fancy to her--of course I mean {{to see more}} of her. But--you know how hard <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> sometimes, since I've been left alone." ...|$|E
60|$|His hand {{opened and}} the {{handkerchief}} fell. I bent swiftly forward and seized a pistol, but the table, as I have said, was eight feet across, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> easier <b>for</b> this long-armed milord to reach the pistols than <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to judge--for me and her. I thought <b>it</b> would, and <b>was</b> {{willing to}} peril {{all in the}} trial. And so was she--willing at one time. But never mind; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> useless to talk of that." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> then, to say [...] "Oh!" [...] But I {{hope that}} no more than civil {{surprise}} appeared in my voice when I asked him to what, then, I owed the pleasure. [...] . He <b>was</b> reaching <b>for</b> an inside pocket leisurely.|$|R
