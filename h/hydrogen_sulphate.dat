40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine, and anti-cough drugs Clobutinol, Butamyrate and Pentoxyverine were studied and {{determined}} {{with the use}} of HPLC-reverse-phase. Initially, the chromatographic behaviour of each was determined in relation to certain parameters which change chromatographic conditions and influence duration of analysis, separation capability of determinated systems and measurement sensitivity. Specifically, the effect of polarity on the retention time of the solvent was studied. For mobile phase preparation, selected solvents were methanol and acetonitrile which were prepared in aqueous solution of various concentrations. It was observed that increased concentrations of mobile phase in organic solvents with little polarity resulted in increased solubility of the said mobile phase and, consequently a reduction in the required time for analysis of the analytes. Improvement in time required for analysis of these drugs and symmetry of chromatographic peaks was accomplished after exploring effects various salts (added in aqueous form) had on each mobile phase. Especially trialed were various types of regulating aqueous solutions of base salts CH 3 COONH 4, CH 3 COONa, CH 3 COOK and CH 3 COOMg, from which CH 3 COONH 4 was selected as being most suitable for the cases of anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine. The latter improved chromatographic peak symmetry and quite perceptively reduced the retention time of the analytes in question. For anti-cough Clobutinol, Butamyrate and Pentoxyverine, mobile liquid phases were studied which contained CH 3 COONH 4, tetraethylammonium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> or tetrabutylammonium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate.</b> It became evident that retention time co-efficients of anti-cough pharmaceuticals are influenced to a great degree by the concentration and the type of salt.

The organism is an obligately anaerobic Gram-negative rod which, {{in the presence of}} sulphate and 0. 1 % yeast extract, used only L- or malanine, DL-lactate, pyruvate or formate, but not 47 other compounds tested, as hydrogen donor for growth. Under these conditions the sulphate could be replaced by sulphite or thiosulphate. The yeast extract was replaceable by ferrous sulphate + p-aminobenzoic acid + biotin. Evidence is presented that alanine and lactate are metabolized via pyruvate which breaks down to form acetate and formate, the latter then being metabolized to form CO,.

It is used to breakdown organic matter into methane(CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2), <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> (H 2 S), and digested sludge, which is used for fertilizer, through four biodegradation stages. The rate of gas generation through mesophilic anaerobic digestion is generally higher, yet, the remaining dissolved gases in a digested sludge have a pejorative {{effect on the environment}} when they are eventually released, as well as causing operational difficulties. Moreover, the generation of biogas continuously in an already digested sludge increases cavitation phenomena and the accompanying pump load. Removal of these gases is investigated by a bubbling system. An airlift bioreactor (ALR) is used as anaerobic digester in the present research to remove produced methane, carbon dioxide and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> (H 2 S) from digested sludge, consequently, reducing pathogens and odour as well as improvement digested sludge for fertilizer. ALRs have many valuable benefits in comparison with stirred tanks for instance: there are no moving parts inside the reactor, low cost of installation and maintenance, and low energy required. In addition, using an airlift reactor enhances the mixing efficiency. The process preferable to agitation as in conventional stirred tanks on power consumption grounds.

Within most temperate and tropical areas the stream discharge and chemistry, during periods of rapid runoff, {{is dominated by the}} exfiltration of water and solutes from stream-side soils. The movement of water to stream-side or ‘riparian’ areas remains, however, an enigma. This paper attempts to explain how the riparian area might be rapidly recharged during storm events. Two analytical techniques, the free-surface method and tangent-continuity method, are applied to hydrological properties monitored on a steep coniferous hillslope, during a selected storm event. Comparison of the ionic concentrations of waters within each component of the hydrological system, is used to verify the hydrological analysis. Perched water-tables developed within the basal zones of the O/Ah and Eag soil horizons of the steep podzolic hillslope, during all major storm events. Most of the rapid response within the riparian zone could be explained by lateral flow in these near-surface soil horizons, particularly in the saturated basal zones. This pathway is corroborated by the similarity of riparian zone and near-surface (or topsoil) chemistries. Relatively low concentrations of monomeric aluminium and relatively high concentrations of chloride, sodium and hydrogen ion were observed within these zones, compared with the subsoil (Bsl and B/C) horizons...|$|R
