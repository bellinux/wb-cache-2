5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, amide bond <b>formation,</b> <b>and</b> imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide bond <b>formation,</b> <b>and</b> decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E

5|$|Juniata County lies over 16 {{different}} rock formations, some {{of which}} contain limestone. These rock formations come from the Ordovician Period, the Silurian Period, and the Devonian Period. The northernmost {{part of the county}} contains rocks of the Juniata Formation, the Bald Eagle <b>Formation,</b> <b>and</b> undivided Juniata and Bald Eagle formations. All of these formations primarily consist of sandstone. South of these formations lie the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation undivided, the Clinton Group, and the Tuscarora Formation. The first two of these consist mainly of shale, while the third is composed of quartzite. The rock formations in the southwestern part of the county include the Brallier and Harrell Formations undivided, the Hamilton Group, the Irish Valley member of the Catskill <b>Formation,</b> <b>and</b> others. The eastern part of the county lies almost entirely over the Hamilton Group, the Tuscarora <b>Formation,</b> <b>and</b> the Irish Valley member of the Cataskill Formation.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of decompression sickness {{are known to}} be caused by damage resulting from the <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other emboli consequential to bubble <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> tissue damage. The precise mechanisms of bubble <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> the damage they cause {{has been the subject of}} medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested. Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered to be acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.|$|E

5|$|Triceratops lived {{during the}} Late Cretaceous of North America, its fossils {{have come from}} the Evanston Formation, Scollard Formation, Laramie Formation, Lance Formation, Denver <b>Formation,</b> <b>and</b> Hell Creek Formation.

5|$|Vulcanoids, {{being an}} entirely new class of {{celestial}} bodies, would be interesting in their own right, but discovering {{whether or not they}} exist would yield insights into the <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> evolution of the Solar System. If they exist they might contain material left over from the earliest period of planet <b>formation,</b> <b>and</b> help determine the conditions under which the terrestrial planets, particularly Mercury, formed. In particular, if vulcanoids exist or did exist in the past, they would represent an additional population of impactors that have affected no other planet but Mercury, making that planet's surface appear older than it actually is. If vulcanoids are found not to exist, this would place different constraints on planet <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> suggest that other processes have been at work in the inner Solar System, such as planetary migration clearing out the area.|$|E

5|$|Because fossils {{identifiable}} as P. sternbergi {{are found}} {{exclusively in the}} lower layers of the Niobrara <b>Formation,</b> <b>and</b> P. longiceps fossils exclusively in the upper layers, a fossil lacking the skull can be identified based on {{its position in the}} geologic column (though for many early fossil finds, precise data about its location was not recorded, rendering many fossils unidentifiable).|$|E
