40|$|L 1 {{elements}} are human transposons which replicate via an RNA intermediate. At least 15 % {{of the human}} genome is composed of L 1 sequence. An important initial step in the transposition reaction is nicking of the genomic DNA by L 1 endonuclease (L 1 <b>EN).</b> In <b>vivo</b> much of the genome exists in the form of chromatin or is undergoing biochemical transactions such as transcription, replication or repair, which may alter the accessibility of the L 1 transposition machinery to DNA. To investigate this possibility we have examined the effect of substrate chromatinization on the ability of L 1 EN to nick DNA. We find that DNA incorporated into nucleosomes is generally refractory to nicking by L 1 EN. Interestingly, nicking of a minority of DNA sequences is enhanced when included in chromatin. Thus, dynamic epigenetic factors such as chromatinization are likely to influence the relatively permanent placement of L 1 and other retroelements in the human genome...|$|R
