5|$|After the season, disaffection {{within the}} Southern Conference {{prompted}} seven former members, including Maryland, {{to form the}} Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The schism was {{due in part to}} the ban on bowl participation, and the vast geographic dispersion of and <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sizes of member schools. Clemson, another founding ACC member, had likewise been forced to play outside the Southern Conference in 1952.|$|E
5|$|I {{have been}} {{increasingly}} perturbed over the blatant <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> major role which Negro women have played and are {{playing in the}} crucial grassroots levels of our struggle and the minor role of leadership they have been assigned in the national policy-making decisions. It is indefensible to call a national march on Washington and send out a call which contains the name of not a single woman leader.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a massive <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> East and West Divisions, it decided {{in the middle of}} the season to grant the fourth place Western team a playoff berth. There was speculation this was done in part to ensure Sacramento remained in playoff contention as long as possible and at the insistence of Ryckman, who preferred the revenue of two playoff games for his first place Stampeders over a first-round bye.|$|E

5|$|With trade tariffs with England now abolished, trade blossomed, {{especially}} with Colonial America. The clippers {{belonging to the}} Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Until the American War of Independence in 1776, Glasgow was the world's premier tobacco port, dominating world trade. The <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> wealth of the merchant classes of the Scottish Lowlands and the ancient clans of the Scottish Highlands grew, amplifying centuries of division.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is rare, with {{an estimated}} 3-4 cases per million annual incidence in adults. While it may occur in all age groups, it is most common in the third decade. 75% are female. Given that older studies show no difference in incidence between men and women, {{it has been suggested}} that the use of oral contraceptives in women is behind the <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sexes. A 1995 report from Saudi Arabia found a doubled incidence at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that Behçet's disease, which increases risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Many {{indigenous}} communities did not evenly {{share in the}} benefits of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E
30|$|As {{regards to}} caste-based discrimination, Madheswaran and Attewell (2007) find that SC/ST workers are {{discriminated}} against {{both in the}} public and private sectors. However, the discrimination effect is more pronounced in the private sector. The study uses the standard Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method and data from the NSSO’s employment and unemployment surveys. Kijima (2006) offers a comparative analysis of disparity in living standards (measured using monthly per capita expenditure) among SC, ST and non-ST/SC households. The study uses the Neumark’s wage decomposition method and the data from four rounds of the NSSO’s survey (1983, 1987, 1993 and 1999). The findings from the study show that about half of <b>the</b> welfare <b>disparities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> SCs and the non-SCs/STs and two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> STs and the non-SCs/STs are due to differences in characteristics. <b>The</b> characteristic <b>disparities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> STs and the non-SCs/STs are largely due to education and location differences. Further, there was little change in the contribution of the structural (returns) component <b>between</b> <b>the</b> SCs/STs and the non-SCs/STs during the period 1983 to 1999.|$|R

5|$|This <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> {{sizes of}} the megaliths is unparalleled {{among the other}} {{surviving}} stone circles in the Dorset area, {{and may have been}} a deliberate choice by the circle's builders, perhaps reflecting sexual symbolism. There are a number of similar circles in south-western Scotland, for example the Loupin' Stones, Ninestane Rigg, and Burgh Hill, all of which share the architectural feature of having two taller stones on their perimeters. Potentially supporting this link between Dorset and south-western Scotland {{is the fact that the}} Grey Mare and her Colts—a chambered long barrow located two and a half miles south-west of the Nine Stones—displays architectural similarities with the Clyde-Solway tradition of chambered long barrows.|$|E
5|$|When Mulder and Scully {{survey the}} crash site, {{they realize that}} there is a nine-minute <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> crash and the time on the victims' wristwatches, {{indicating}} missing time. Mulder believes that Max was abducted from the plane and that his body will not be found. Meanwhile, Scott Garrett, a Man in Black posing as an NTSB investigator, steals the zip gun from the assassin's body and erases his face and fingerprints with acid. Larold Rehbun, a passenger who sat next to Max, is found alive. His injuries indicate exposure to radiation.|$|E
5|$|While {{these reforms}} succeeded in forming an {{equilibrium}} {{between the old}} common law courts and the new courts, they were viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. While the King's Bench was more revolutionary, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. The <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> reformist King's Bench and conservative Common Pleas was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} the three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on how to cut costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited malleability while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E

40|$|Slovakia is {{characterized}} by large economic <b>disparities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> regions. Nowadays there {{is a change in}} living standards and the way in the quality of human life. This difference is even more marked <b>between</b> <b>the</b> regions of the West and the East of Slovakia. The causes of the heterogeneous development of regions go from historical, demographic and natural specificities. These regional disparities grow deeper in time, what signify the result of the development of these factors in the past. It is necessary and more urgent to resolve the regional problems. The main reasons were <b>the</b> growing <b>disparities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> regions, the need for the treatment strategies for regional development and the need to obtain the external resources. The aim of the contribution is based on the available evidence to assess the status of the Slovak regions based on the selected statistical indicators and to compare the economic performance of Slovak regions...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the disparity in population, {{there was also a}} great <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> fighting capabilities of the armed forces of the two countries. In 1977, Vietnam was estimated to have 615,000 soldiers and 900 tanks, supported by a 12,000-member air force with 300 combat aircraft, including one squadron of light bombers. In comparison, Kampuchea had an army of 70,000, only a few heavy tanks, 200 armoured vehicles, and limited air capability. Despite facing such heavy odds, Kampuchea showed no signs of hesitation as its military continued to assault Vietnam’s border regions. In January 1978, Kampuchean forces still held portions of Vietnamese territory and began overrunning Vietnamese outposts in Hà Tiên Province. On 27 January 1978, Vietnam started calling on the Kampuchean military along the border regions to overthrow the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) {{was held}} in Havana, where Castro was {{selected}} as NAM president, a position he held till 1982. In his capacity as both President of the NAM and of Cuba he appeared at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1979 and gave a speech on the <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> world's rich and poor. His speech was greeted with much applause from other world leaders, though his standing in NAM was damaged by Cuba's abstinence from the U.N.'s General Assembly condemnation of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Cuba's relations across North America improved under Mexican President Luis Echeverría, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents. Conversely, his relationship with China declined, as he accused Deng Xiaoping's Chinese government of betraying their revolutionary principles by initiating trade links with the U.S. and attacking Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Now that orca {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} for several decades, the exact age of many younger whales is known. The age of older orcas, such as Granny, is estimated by their offspring; they give birth around age 15, and stop having offspring around 40; by adding the generations together, ages can be estimated. Granny was photographed in 1971 with a male orca, J1 Ruffles, who was believed at the time to be her son. Ruffles was estimated as at least 20 years old, and as scientists believed him to be Granny's last offspring, her own age was estimated at about 60. It was later discovered that Ruffles was not Granny's son, but her age estimate was never changed. Granny's age was originally estimated with a margin of error of 12 years, but was the subject of an academic dispute in 2016 due to her original age being based on evidence now known to be incorrect, as well as a large <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> life expectancy of orcas with estimated ages and orcas with known ages. Analysis of fatty acids from a recent biopsy of Granny indicated that Granny may have only been 65-80 years of age.|$|E

5|$|The {{appearance}} of features from The Art of War in other historical texts {{is considered to}} be proof of his historicity and authorship. Certain strategic concepts, such as terrain classification, are attributed to Sun Tzu. Their use in other works such as The Methods of the Sima is considered proof of Sun Tzu's historical priority. According to Ralph Sawyer, it is very likely Sun Tzu did exist and not only served as a general but also wrote the core of the book that bears his name. It is argued that there is a <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> large-scale wars and sophisticated techniques detailed in the text and the more primitive small-scale battles that many believe predominated in China during the 6th century BC. Against this, Sawyer argues that the teachings of Sun Wu were probably taught to succeeding generations in his family or a small school of disciples, which eventually included Sun Bin. These descendants or students may have revised or expanded upon certain points in the original text.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the <b>disparity</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|E
