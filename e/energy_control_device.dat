Methods: 40 patients were studied, 25 paroxysmal AF and 14 persistent AF. One patient enrolled was later found to be in left atrial flutter and was excluded. The Cardima Revelation® TX catheter system with Intellitemp® Radiofrequency (RF) <b>energy</b> <b>control</b> <b>device</b> and a Medtronic Atakar® RF generator were used to place wide area circumferential ablations to achieve conduction block into the left and right sided pulmonary veins. Roof lines and mitral isthmus lines were also performed. In patients with persistent AF and in repeat procedures, right atrial compartmentalisation was performed with an anterior superior vena cava (SVC) to inferior vena cava (IVC) line and a septal SVC to IVC line. Results: At 6 months, 18 of the 39 patients were asymptomatic, 10 had improved symptoms and 22 were in sinus rhythm. In the paroxysmal group, 11 were asymptomatic, 7 had improved symptoms and 16 (64 %) were in sinus rhythm. In the persistent group, 7 were asymptomatic, 3 had improved symptoms and 6 (43 %) were in sinus rhythm. The total group AF burden was 37. 8 ± 5. 4  hrs pre-procedure and 23. 1 ± 5. 1  hrs at 6 months post procedure. Mean temperature, impedance and power recorded at each pole demonstrated effective power delivery at all poles. No catheter charring was observed, complication rates were comparable to standard AF ablation technique. Conclusion: Linear ablation in the left and right atria to mimic Cox’s Maze is feasible and safe using this ablating system...|$|E

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{controller}} for earthquake-excited building benchmark, {{it is common to}} inquire about the present relationships between controlled building performance and the considering soil-foundation-structure interaction (SFSI) effects for description of the earthquake excitation. The SFSI effects can drastically affect the response of the structures subjected to earthquake motion. The effects of embedment depth on the control of structures, under plane-strain conditions, have been studied by substructure approach for buildings supported by rigid foundations embedded into a homogeneous, isotropic and elastic half-space. It is assumed that <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> are installed on all the floors. It is concluded that deeply embedded structures may increase the <b>energy</b> dissipated by <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> for the case of considering SFSI effects than expected from the fixed-base model and decrease the H 2 norm of the system transfer function than control of structures with surface supported foundations. The effects are intensified for structures located on relatively soft soils. The inter-story drifts for control of squat structures with embedded foundations may reduce than the one controlled according to the fixed-base model, while it may increase the demand of inter-story drifts for the case of control of slender interacting systems. According to these results, considering SFSI effects on structural control can make some unexpected damages. Hence, for structures rested in or on soft soil that are controlled by active or semi-active <b>control</b> <b>devices,</b> SFSI effects in controller design should be considered. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|International audienceToday, {{reducing}} global {{greenhouse gas}} emissions has become a crucial issue for protecting the earth's environment. This requires the reduction of energy consumption in as many sectors as possible, including home networks. Indeed, in the home environment, networked devices consume {{a large proportion of}} household energy. There are three reasons that can explain the high energy consumption of home network devices. Firstly, devices are in idle state for hours when they are not in operation. Secondly, they cannot go to an ultra-low power consumption state when they are not needed. And last but not least, there is an increasing number of home network devices with soaring power consumption in our homes. These home network devices have a long switching time from idle state to sleeping state. Moreover, explicit user commands are required to switch the device from idle state to soft-off state. We can certainly gain energy if the device stays in sleeping state or soft-off state instead of idle state. We propose an Overlay <b>Energy</b> <b>Control</b> Network (OECN) which can switch devices from idle state to sleeping state much more quickly and from idle state to soft-off state automatically. The Overlay <b>Energy</b> <b>Control</b> Network (OECN) is formed by at least one overlay <b>energy</b> <b>control</b> node connected to each home network device. The OECN power management coordinates the power states of all home network <b>devices.</b> The overlay <b>energy</b> <b>control</b> nodes can exchange <b>energy</b> <b>control</b> messages. The <b>devices</b> can be turned on or turned off, or can return to their power states when they receive the OECN messages. So that the OECN can be adaptive to our home network devices, the OECN is developed in two ways: (i) all overlay <b>energy</b> <b>control</b> nodes in the home network are ZigBee nodes. This is a ZigBee Mandatory OECN Solution (ZMS); (ii) one or more devices become the overlay <b>energy</b> <b>control</b> nodes where there are no ZigBee modules on that device. This is a ZigBee Optional OECN Solution (ZOS). In our simulation, we will evaluate our overlay energy-saving solutions with a self-controlled energy solution in three metrics: energy consumption, delay and cost. In the self-controlled solution, the <b>device</b> <b>controls</b> its own power state. The proposed Overlay <b>Energy</b> <b>Control</b> Network provides an efficient energy-saving solution for home network devices. In our use case, the ZigBee Mandatory Solution can gain 21. 79 % energy on average compared to the self-controlled solution. It is an efficient energy-saving solution, but it has a relatively high delay compared to the ZigBee Optional Solution and the self-controlled solution...|$|R

This article proposes a novel strategy of harvesting damping <b>energy</b> from vibration <b>control</b> <b>devices.</b> A novel system, termed electromagnetic damper cum energy harvester, is employed to fulfill both vibration damping and energy harvesting functions. Electromagnetic damper cum energy harvester is essentially an electromagnetic device connected to a specially designed energy harvesting circuit, which is a buck-boost converter operating in a discontinuous conduction mode. The energy harvesting circuit can achieve satisfactory efficiency without any feedback loop. The effectiveness of the dual-function electromagnetic damper cum energy harvester is demonstrated through a numerical case study of bridge stay cables under wind excitations, in which the major parameters of electromagnetic damper cum energy harvester are determined through a simple design approach. Simulation results project average output power ranging from 82. 5 to 2396. 8 mW at a wind speed of 9 - 15 m/s, corresponding to an overall efficiency of 42. 3 %.

40|$|Smart Structures and Materials 2001 : Smart Systems for Bridges, Structures, and Highways, California, USA, March 2001 The {{present study}} {{attempts}} {{to develop a}} stochastic optimal coupling-control strategy for the seismic response mitigation of adjacent structures coupled with active <b>control</b> <b>devices.</b> The proposed <b>control</b> strategy {{is based on the}} combined use of the stochastic dynamical programming principle and the stochastic averaging method.

The seismic excitation spectrum is taken into account by use of the stochastic optimal dynamical programming principle.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} experimental investigations {{to actively}} modulate the nanoscale friction properties of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) assembly using an external electric field that drives conformational {{changes in the}} SAM. Such “friction switches” have widespread implications in interfacial <b>energy</b> <b>control</b> in micro/nanoscale <b>devices.</b> Friction response of a low-density mercaptocarboxylic acid SAM is evaluated using an atomic force microscope (AFM) {{in the presence of}} a DC bias applied between the sample and the AFM probe under a nitrogen (dry) environment. The low density allows reorientation of individual SAM molecules to accommodate the attractive force between the −COOH terminal group and a positively biased surface. This enables the surface to present a hydrophilic group or a hydrophobic backbone to the contacting AFM probe depending upon the direction of the field (bias). Synthesis and deposition of the low-density SAM (LD-SAM) is reported. Results from AFM experiments show an increased friction response (up to 300 %) of the LD-SAM system {{in the presence of a}} positive bias compared to the friction response in the presence of a negative bias. The difference in the friction response is attributed to the change in the structural and crystalline order of the film in addition to the interfacial surface chemistry and composition presented upon application of the bias...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Control {{systems are}} used to limit {{structural}} lateral deflections during large external loads such as winds and earthquakes. Most recently, the semi-active control approach has grown in popularity due to inexpensive <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> that consume little power. As a result, recently designed control systems have employed many semi-active <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> for the <b>control</b> of a structure. In the future, it is envisioned that structural control systems will be large-scale systems defined by high actuation and sensor densities. Decentralized control approaches {{have been used to}} control large-scale systems that are too complex for a traditional centralized approach, such as linear quadratic regulation (LQR). This paper describes the derivation of <b>energy</b> market-based <b>control</b> (EMBC), a decentralized approach that models the structural control system as a competitive marketplace. The interaction of free-market buyers and sellers result in an optimal allocation of limited control system resources such as <b>control</b> <b>energy.</b> The Kajima-Shizuoka Building and a 20 -story benchmark structure are selected as illustrative examples to be used for comparison of the EMBC and centralized LQR approaches.

Integration of distributed generation (DG), which can also be operated in voltage control mode, in distribution systems may introduce adverse effects including control interactions, operational conflicts and long term oscillations. The seamless operation of distribution systems embedded with DG for effective voltage control is one of the challenging tasks, mainly because (a) DG may interact with the conventional voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and (b) prioritised operation of different voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> depends on the network topology and real-time characteristics of the system. Coordinated operation involving multiple voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> (i. e., on-load tap changers and voltage regulators in addition to local capacitor banks) and DG units is one of the feasible technical solutions at medium voltage distribution system level.
