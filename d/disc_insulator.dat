50|$|Initially {{transmission}} lines {{were supported by}} porcelain pin-and-sleeve insulators {{similar to those used}} for telegraphs and telephone lines. However, these had a practical limit of 40 kV. In 1907, the invention of the <b>disc</b> <b>insulator</b> by Harold W. Buck of the Niagara Falls Power Corporation and Edward M. Hewlett of General Electric allowed practical insulators of any length to be constructed for higher voltages.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{suspension}} <b>disc</b> <b>insulator</b> {{units are}} 25 cm {{in diameter and}} 15 cm long, can support a load of 80-120 kN (18-27 klbf), have a dry flashover voltage of about 72 kV, and are rated at an operating voltage of 10-12 kV. However, the flashover voltage of a string {{is less than the}} sum of its component discs, because the electric field is not distributed evenly across the string but is strongest at the disc nearest to the conductor, which flashes over first. Metal grading rings are sometimes added around the disc at the high voltage end, to reduce the electric field across that disc and improve flashover voltage.|$|E
40|$|Ceramic/Porcelain {{suspension}} <b>disc</b> <b>insulators</b> {{are widely}} used in power systems to provide electrical insulation and mechanically support for high-voltage transmission lines. These insulators are subjected {{to a variety of}} stresses, including mechanical, electrical and environmental. These stresses act in unison. The exact nature and magnitude of these stresses vary significantly and depends on insulator design, application and its location. Due to various reasons the <b>insulator</b> <b>disc</b> can lose its electrical insulation properties without any noticeable mechanical failure. Such a condition while difficult to recognize, can enhance the stress on remaining healthy <b>insulator</b> <b>discs</b> in the string further may lead to a flashover. To understand the stress enhancement due to faulty discs in a string, attempt has been made to simulate the potential and electric field profiles for various <b>disc</b> <b>insulators</b> presently used in the country.

40|$|The {{flashover}} of insulator strings {{occurring at}} normal working voltages under contaminated/polluted conditions obviously deserves serious consideration. Though much {{research has been}} gone into pollution-induced flashover phenomena, grey areas still exist in our knowledge. In the present experimental study, the breakdown (flashover) voltages across gaps on insulator top surfaces and gaps between sheds (on the underside of an insulator) and the flashover studies on a single unit and a 3 -unit insulator strings were carried out. An {{attempt was made to}} correlate the values obtained for all the cases. Resistance measurement of individual units of a polluted 3 -unit string before and after flashover indicated that strongly different resistances could be the cause of flashover of ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>insulator</b> strings...|$|E

Kinds of powder used are sulphur, bicarbonate of soda, cement, zinc oxide, kaolin, cornstarch, flour, etc. Insulators used are ebonite, bakelite, fiber, glass, etc. As electrification changes by many factors, such as pressure with which powder strikes the insulator, temperature of the insulator, amount of powder, and humidity of air, we have made experiment, taking those facors into consideration. From many combinations and powders, electrification order has been found about powders.

40|$|The bulk {{of power}} {{transmission}} from the generating stations to the load centres is carried through overhead lines. The distances involved could span several hundreds of kilometres. To minimize line losses, power transmission over such long distances {{is carried out}} at high voltages (several hundreds of kV). A network of outdoor lines operating at diﬀerent voltages {{has been found to}} be the most economical method of power delivery. The <b>disc</b> <b>insulators</b> perform dual task of mechanically supporting and electrically isolating the live phase conductors from the support tower. These insulators have to perform under various environmental conditions; hence the electrical stress distribution along the insulators governs the possible ﬂashover, which is quite detrimental to the system. In view of this the present investigation aims to simulate the surface electric ﬁeld stress on diﬀerent types of porcelain/ceramic insulators; both normal and anti-fog type discs which are used for high voltage transmission/distribution systems are considered. The surface charge simulation method is employed for the ﬁeld computation to simulate potential, electric ﬁeld, surface and bulk/volume stress...|$|R
40|$|Use of high {{temperature}} conductors is being considered by {{more and more}} electric utilities {{as a means to}} increase transmission line capacity. Hence {{there is a need to}} investigate temperature rise of transmission line insulators when the current carried by the line conductor is high. This has raised questions regarding the effect of these increased temperatures on the performance of all components attached to the conductor, including the insulators. This paper presents the results of finite element simulation of transient thermal conduction analysis to determine the temperatures reached at various locations on the conductor attachment hardware, end fittings of cap and pin type ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>insulator</b> assembly by using commercially available software Ansys- 11. Remarkable temperature rise was not observed at porcelain and cement of insulators in spite of the high conductor temperature, suggesting almost no reduction in electrical and mechanical characteristics of insulators for short period of time but for longer period of time and varying environmental conditions there might be development of {{high temperature}} and chances of affects of this high temperatures of conductor on the insulator assembly and end fittings of insulator...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of defects in outdoor insulators ultimately {{results in the}} initiation of partial discharge (PD) activity. Because insulation failure and the consequent breakdown of power equipment can occur due to the cumulative adverse effects of partial discharges, {{it is important to}} detect PD activity in its early stages. Current techniques used in PD off-line analyses are not suitable for detecting defective insulators in the field. The work presented in this thesis involved the investigation of a number of cases of insulator defects, with the goal of developing an online RF-based PD technique for monitoring ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>insulators</b> that exhibit a variety of defects. The first three classes examined were an intentionally cracked ceramic <b>insulator</b> disc; a <b>disc</b> with a hole through the cap, which creates internal discharges; and a completely broken <b>insulator</b> <b>disc.</b> The fourth class involved an external corona noise using a point-to-plane setup. The defective discs were considered individually and were also incorporated into strings of 2, 3, and 4 insulators as a means of capturing the radiated RF signatures under external high voltage AC power. The captured RF pulses were processed in order to extract statistical, spectral, and wavelet packet based features. Feature reduction and selection is carried out and classification results pertaining to each feature-set type were obtained. To classify the discharges arising from different types of defects, an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was applied to the extracted features, and recognition rates of more than 90 % were reported for each class. In addition, the position of the defective insulator within the string was varied and high defect classification results exceeding 90 % were reported regardless of the position...|$|R

40|$|Surface charge {{accumulation}} on insulators under high {{dc voltage}} {{is a major}} factor that may lead to the reduction of insulation levels in gas insulated devices. In this paper, <b>disc</b> <b>insulators</b> made of Al 2 O 3 -filled epoxy resin were surface fluorinated using a F 2 /N 2 mixture (12. 5 % F 2) at 50 [*]°C and 0. 1 MPa for different durations of 15 min, 30 min and 60 min. A dc voltage was applied to the insulator for 30 min and the charge density on its surface was measured by an electrostatic probe. The results revealed significant lower surface charge densities on the fluorinated insulators in comparison with the original one. Surface conductivity measurements indicated a higher surface conductivity by over three orders of magnitude after fluorination, which would allow the charges to transfer along the surface and thus may suppress their accumulation. Further, attenuated total reflection infrared analysis and surface morphology observations of the samples revealed that the introduction of fluoride groups altered the surface physicochemical properties. These structure changes, especially the physical defects reduced the depth of charge traps in the surface layer, which was verified by the measurement of energy distributions of the electron and hole traps based on the isothermal current theory. The results in this paper demonstrate that fluorination can be a promising and effective method to suppress surface charge accumulation on epoxy insulators in gas insulated devices...|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} line from Newcastle, which operated at 33,000 volts, was becoming overloaded and in about 1946 the Railways decided {{to raise the}} voltage to 66,000 volts. This would enable four times the power to be transmitted. This was firstly done by adding two more <b>insulator</b> <b>discs</b> to the suspended insulators of the line, a pole at a time. Naturally the line had to be deadened {{for this to be}} done. To keep disruption to a minimum this work was carried out on a Sunday.|$|R
40|$|Pollution is {{the single}} largest cause of transmission/distribution line outages, next to lightning, which result in {{expensive}} power outages. A major significance {{of the problem is}} that it can repeatedly occur even at normal working voltages. As a result, it has become the most detrimental factor affecting the safe operation of extra and ultra high voltage (EHV/UHV) transmission lines and substations. In reality, the phenomenon of pollution-induced flashover is a very complex, and vexatious problem that continues to challenge high voltage engineers even today. In spite of knowing this phenomenon for the past several decades, a solution has remained still elusive. Although there exist some remedial measures, there are associated limitations, which will become evident on long runs. The guaranteed solution seems to be the washing and cleaning of insulators for which utilities spend significant amount of money. Therefore, there is a need to develop a suitable mitigation technique which is cost effective and yield better performance in the field. Motivated by this, the present study is undertaken and it essentially aims to seek simple alternative solutions for the problem for strings with ceramic <b>insulator</b> <b>discs.</b> All the ten types (normal and anti fog) ceramic insulators, which are commonly employed in our country, are considered in the study. Amongst the several controllable and uncontrollable physical quantities leading to the pollution flashover phenomena, the maximum surface field identified as on of the major influencing factor. In fact, the field concentration near the pin can lead to early formation of dry band and scintillation/partial arcs. Considering this, it is intended to seek possible minimization of the maximum surface field occurring at the pin region. This is expected to yield enhanced pollution/contamination flashover strength and in addition, show an improvement in normal operation. The intended study requires a detailed knowledge on field distribution. However, the required data is found to be rather scarce. In view of this a detailed study on field distribution is taken up for all the ten types of <b>disc</b> <b>insulators</b> used in our country. For the problem under investigation, the governing equation has been identified for both clean and polluted conditions along with pertinent boundary conditions. Considering the open geometry nature of the problem along with presence of multiple dielectrics, Surface Charge Simulation (SCSM) methodology was found to be most suitable and hence adopted for the work. In particular, the Galerkin method with piecewise linear interpolation function is employed in the formulation. The method employed and the codes developed are verified with suitable examples. First, a detailed quantification of the field distribution under clean conditions is made for all the ten types of discs in single disc and string configuration. Subsequently, the task of reducing the maximum surface field gradient, which occurs at the pin, is attempted. Several consideration lead to an artificial extension of pin as one of best feasible choice. However, any attempt to extend the pin would lead to some reduction in total creepage length, possible enhancement of bulk stress in air and enhancement of stress in triple junction. After a careful study, involving several experimental trials, a novel field control element (FCE) is developed both for normal and anti-fog types of <b>insulator</b> <b>discs.</b> From the electric field simulation study, it is shown that the use of field control element for uniform pollution deposition prevailing under laboratory test conditions yields a significant reduction of maximum surface field for discs by about 47 to 54 %. Similarly a reduction of about 37 % to 55 % in case of 3 -disc string (for 33 kV class), 30 % to 52 % in case of 9 -disc string (for 132 kV class), 27 % to 52 % in case of 14 -disc string (220 kV class), 27 % to 54 % in case of 23 / 20 disc string (for 400 kV class) and 41 % to 48 % in case of 35 / 29 disc strings (for 765 kV class) is achieved respectively for different strings. It is anticipated that this will lead to retardation in inception of scintillations/partial arcs, which in turn can reduce the risk of pollution induced flashover. Subsequently, it was aimed to experimentally evaluate the impact of field control element on the performance of disc/string under normal and that during polluted conditions. For this a national level unique artificial pollution test facility as per the international standards has been established for conducting pollution studies on disc insulator/strings up to 132 kV system voltage (The rating of test source: 150 kV/ 2 A, 100 kV/ 3 A, 50 kV/ 6 A of 300 kVA). Experimental investigations for the normal operation involving dry and wet power frequency flashover strengths, lightning impulse strength, radio interference level (RIV), visible discharge inception (Corona) level and voltage distribution along the string are carried out. The study showed that with the insertion of field control element, performance under normal condition is maintained and in fact noticeably improved in certain cases. Subsequently pollution flashover strength is evaluated using solid layer and cold fog methods. The pollution flashover strength exhibited an overall improvement 15 to 20 % for all types of discs considered in the study. Similarly an improvement of 16 to 19 % and 12 - 14 % is observed for 3 -disc string and 6 -disc string respectively. The reasons for relatively lower gain in the pollution flashover strength as compared to reduction in maximum surface field are investigated. In particular, the reduction in improvement with number of discs in a string is dealt with. The non-uniform wet-ting against highly non-uniform drying of <b>insulator</b> surface and <b>discs</b> in a string, are identified as the cause for deviation. For an experimental verification of the same, the pollution layer resistance of individual discs in a 3 -disc string is measured prior to and immediately after flashover. It is shown that the resistances of the different units become grossly different even though initial values were substantially the same. The values measured immediately after flashover show that the resistance of the top unit develops voltage enough to result in its flashover and subsequently, the flashover of the whole string. In summary, the main contribution of the present work is the development of novel field control element (FCE) for both normal and anti-fog type of ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>insulators,</b> which will enhance their pollution flashover strength. The actual cost of these elements is estimated to be about 1 - 2 % of the cost of the disc, while the gain in strength is shown to be more than 12 - 20 %...|$|R

This paper analyzes the effect of controlling stray capacitance (Kcsc), disc capacitance (Kcdc) and contaminated pollution (Kccp). In this paper research study considerations, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) 115 kV overhead transmission line power towers are simulated in EMTP/ATP drawing and the results were analyzed. As it was found that in the clean condition, when the constant (Kcsc) was conducted and adjustment when Kcsc value has low value (decreases), the string efficiency would be high value (increases) for instances Kcsc= 0. 01 string efficiency= 99 %, Kcsc= 0. 50 string efficiency= 64 %. When the constant (Kcdc) was adjusted; if Kcdc is low, the string efficiency will also be low for instances at Kcdc= 0. 01 string efficiency= 33 %, Kcdc= 0. 50 string efficiency= 40 %. Nevertheless, Kcdc adjustment utilizes the appropriate value gained from factory that the k= 0, so the value will be 90 % higher. As for the contaminated condition, when the constant (Kcsc) was adjusted as shown in Fig. 11, if Kcsc value is low, the string efficiency will be high for instances Kcsc= 0. 01 string efficiency= 99 %, Kcsc= 0. 05 string efficiency= 65 %.
