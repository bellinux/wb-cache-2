25|$|The {{impact of}} machine tools during the Industrial Revolution {{was not that}} <b>great</b> <b>because</b> other than firearms, {{threaded}} fasteners {{and a few other}} industries there were few mass-produced metal parts. The techniques to make mass-produced metal parts made with sufficient precision to be interchangeable is largely attributed to a program of the U.S. Department of War which perfected interchangeable parts for firearms in the early 19th century.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not yet}} known who {{is buried}} in the tomb, but the initial public {{speculation}} {{that it could be}} the tomb of Alexander the <b>Great,</b> <b>because</b> of its size and estimated cost of construction, was dismissed by the expert community when commenting on the published findings, as the available historical records mention Alexandria in Egypt as the last known location of Alexander's body; it has been supported instead, that a likely occupant could be either a wealthy Macedonian noble or a late member of the royal family.|$|E
25|$|The {{individuality}} of a {{being is}} a certain intricate form, not an enduring substance. In order to understand an organism, it must {{be thought of as}} a pattern which maintains itself through homeostasis – life continues by maintaining an internal balance of various factors such as temperature and molecular structure. While the material substances that compose a living being may be constantly replaced by nearly identical ones, an organism continues functioning with the same identity as long as the pattern is kept sufficiently intact. Since patterns can be transmitted, modified, or duplicated, they are therefore a kind of information. Based on this, Wiener suggests it should be theoretically possible to transmit the entirety of a living person as a message (which is practically indistinguishable from the concept of physical teleportation) – although he admits that the obstacles to such a process would be <b>great,</b> <b>because</b> of the enormous amount of information embodied in a person, and the difficulty of reading or writing it.|$|E

500|$|It was {{a century}} before a {{positive}} twist was put on Christopher Smart's time in asylum; the Victorian poet Robert Browning argued that A Song to David was <b>great</b> <b>because</b> Smart was mad at the time. In his poem Parleyings (1887), Browning claimed: ...|$|E
500|$|The British landed 30,000 men, they {{surrounded}} Copenhagen and {{the attack}} continued {{for the next}} three days, killing some 2,000 civilians and destroying most of the city. The devastation was so <b>great</b> <b>because</b> Copenhagen relied on an old defence-line whose limited range could not reach the British ships and their longer-range artillery.|$|E
500|$|In June 2010 {{during the}} Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010 Mark Rein (vice {{president}} of Epic Games) was showcasing a tech demo of Gears of War 2 in stereoscopic 3D running on an Xbox 360 {{thanks to the}} TriOviz for Games Technology."This technology’s <b>great</b> <b>because</b> it works on normal HD TVs, {{as well as the}} very high end 3DTVs," [...] Rein commented to Computer and Video Games. [...] "We're not planning to re-release this in 3D - unless Microsoft want us to - but I'm sure its technology may be keen to put in the games developed by our partners." ...|$|E

50|$|Rosa Lee's work {{is still}} {{relevant}} today and her paper is frequently cited, however her actual influence is <b>greater,</b> <b>because</b> some scientific authors simply refer to 'Rosa Lee's phenomenon' rather than correctly citing her publication.|$|R

500|$|Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a {{positive}} review, praising the intersecting storylines and {{the references to}} the previous season. [...] "More generally, [...] show that Veronica Mars has created a strong enough world that it can support much higher levels. I have been, and still somewhat am, dubious about the pace at which this season is moving. But {{this was a great}} episode, even with all its density {{and the fact that it}} was essentially all setup. And it was <b>great</b> <b>because</b> it was attached to the history of the show so far." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A".|$|E
500|$|Itsuno {{said in the}} Famitsu {{article that}} the visuals attempt to deliver a {{satisfying}} feel {{of being in the}} air, and that the actions of Nero's Devil Bringer could not be done on contemporary generation consoles, but they could be done on the new generation of consoles such as the PlayStation 3. Kobayashi stated that the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions would be identical, although he did not comment on the PC version. Kobayashi confirmed that the PC version [...] "would be <b>great,</b> <b>because</b> the same team is working on both". The PlayStation 3 version requires the user to install 5GB of game data, taking 20 minutes, which shortens the length of the loading screens throughout the game.|$|E
500|$|Losses were so <b>great</b> <b>because</b> Polk wrote off as {{total losses}} many films made under his predecessors; the company posted a $35,366,000 {{loss in the}} fiscal year ending August 31, 1969. [...] "Basically what we're really concentrating on at the moment is to really {{streamline}} this operation. There isn't much else to do when you're losing as much money as we are," [...] Aubrey told The New York Times in December 1969. [...] Aubrey said, [...] "we have determined that we're not going to continue to produce on the basis of forty acres and acres and acres of standing sets. Young people who are the major movie audience today, refer to that as the plastic world and that is almost a deterrent in the business today." ...|$|E

50|$|Mapungubwe predates the {{settlements}} at Great Zimbabwe, Thulamela and Dzata. It {{is believed that}} people left Mapungubwe for <b>Great</b> Zimbabwe <b>because</b> <b>Great</b> Zimbabwe was judged {{to have a more}} suitable climate.|$|R
50|$|Text-to-speech {{has been}} a part of every Mac OS X version. The Victoria voice was {{enhanced}} significantly in Mac OS X v10.3, and added as Vicki (Victoria was not removed). Its size was almost 20 times <b>greater,</b> <b>because</b> of the higher-quality diphone samples used.|$|R
500|$|Smart {{was left}} alone, {{except for his}} cat Jeoffrey and the {{occasional}} gawker. It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during this time and surely {{felt that he was}} in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space". In London, only a few of his works were still being published. However, not everyone viewed Smart's [...] "madness" [...] as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times. A century later, Robert Browning later remarked that A Song to David was <b>great</b> <b>because</b> Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats. It is no wonder that a few of his loyal friends did come to Mr. Potter's and freed him.|$|E
500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was <b>great</b> <b>because</b> it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E
500|$|The Killer was {{released}} in the United States on VHS by Fox Lorber in November 1992, in a dubbed and subtitled version. On 25 June 1996 Fox Lorber released The Killer along with Hard Boiled as a double feature on home video. The Killer {{was released}} on DVD by The Criterion Collection on 1 April 1998 in the original Cantonese language track with English subtitles. Bonus features on DVD included the trailer, production notes, and a commentary track. Woo was {{very happy with the}} film being included in the Criterion Collection stating, [...] "it was <b>great</b> <b>because</b> it would let people know what [...] are about...when I saw that Criterion Collection selected The Killer, I was very happy as The Killer and Bullet in the Head are my two favourites".|$|E
50|$|Spender was {{the eldest}} of four sons born to John Kent Spender, a doctor, and his wife, the novelist Lillian Spender. He was educated at Bath College and Balliol College, Oxford, where he did well in his studies but missed a first in <b>Greats</b> <b>because</b> of illness.|$|R
50|$|Glencairn's third Scottish Junior Cup win was {{in season}} 1926/27 and the {{satisfaction}} {{was all the}} <b>greater</b> <b>because</b> it was Cambuslang Rangers, their great local rivals, who were defeated 2-1.

50|$|In {{the case}} of the female, the opening of the {{superficial}} inguinal ring is smaller than that of the male. As a result, the possibility for hernias through the inguinal canal in males is much <b>greater</b> <b>because</b> they have a larger opening and therefore a much weaker wall through which the intestines may protrude.|$|R
500|$|Two songs, [...] "Low Down Freedom" [...] and [...] "Black Rose," [...] were {{produced}} by Ronny Light. [...] "We Had It All" [...] {{was produced by}} Jennings and Ken Mansfield. [...] Like the music within, the album cover was also {{at odds with the}} elaborate, often overwrought cover designs from Music Row, featuring an unpretentious shot of a smiling Jennings and his unkempt friends sat around a studio laughing and drinking. [...] In a 2008 interview with Dan MacIntosh, Shaver said of the LP, [...] "Oh, it was <b>great,</b> <b>because</b> the songs were bigger than me. And I couldn't possibly sing as good as Waylon. And at the time, Waylon was just great, so great, and I knew something was gonna happen good for him, and sure enough it helped me and it helped him, too, and that's a pretty good trade." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the band's improvisations on Black Beauty {{centered}} around vamps or themes Davis introduced and restated during the performance. According to Davis scholar Paul Tingen, {{the record is}} filled with [...] "coded phrases" [...] he played on his trumpet to signify a change from one composition to the next. [...] "The music would be continuous so Miles wouldn't have to speak and announce things to the audience", DeJohnette recalled. [...] "He'd just speak with his horn and just cue the numbers by stating the front part of the melody, and then we automatically knew, which was <b>great,</b> <b>because</b> {{he wanted it to}} be a seamless kind of thing." [...] Holland, who played both acoustic and electric bass at the show, elaborated on the tradition of using such musical signals in jazz and their use in Davis' group: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] {{became a}} Radio Disney hit, {{remaining}} at number one for 12 weeks. The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give me so much exposure. It's <b>great</b> <b>because</b> people have grown with me, even with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that. Because of that song, it actually inspired me to do my own musical animated artist {{because a lot of people}} thought I was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E
50|$|Holland's {{significance}} {{is that he}} and Bill Burl were the first Britons to ride the Tour de France. Holland's contribution was the <b>greater</b> <b>because</b> Burl lasted only two days. Holland and Burl are also the only Britons to have ridden as private entrants, something that was possible until {{the outbreak of the}} second world war but not afterwards.|$|R
50|$|People, who study, organize, teach, {{and through}} that also create law, often working at universities, are called jurists. In civil law countries, their role is <b>greater,</b> <b>because</b> they draft codes, which are major laws that govern whole areas of law. In common law countries, the {{creation}} and interpretation of law has traditionally been the domain of judges.|$|R
50|$|Tripolitania is Libya's {{most populous}} region (compared to Fezzan and Cyrenaica). Tripolitania's {{population}} has grown throughout years, {{as has the}} population of Libya as a whole. Libya's overall population, however, has grown at a rate slightly <b>greater.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, the percentage of Libya's population living within Tripolitania has decreased.Source: Gathered from bulletins of censuses 1964, 1973, 1995, 2006.|$|R
500|$|Bodie Chandler {{directed}} {{music for}} Quest, and Gary Lionelli, Thomas Chase, Stephen Rucker, Lawrence H. Brown, Guy Moon, Kevin Kiner, Christophe Beck, and Mark Koval wrote incidental music and cues. Lionelli conceived a new main theme {{based on the}} original 1960s Jonny Quest theme by Hoyt Curtin. Composer Guy Moon considered working for the show the [...] "hardest thing I've done in my life" [...] due to the producers' demands for epic music: [...] "They want a big orchestra with a good synth rig... It's <b>great</b> <b>because</b> they push me so much I'll probably replace my whole demo reel with 'Jonny Quest' music... It's hip and it's current." [...] Stephen Rucker and Thomas Chase (who later composed in The Powerpuff Girls) used MIDI to facilitate composing. Chase appreciated the producers' commitment to scoring, noting, [...] "For many kids, animation music is their first exposure to orchestral music." ...|$|E
500|$|The scene between Mark and Leslie at the pit was {{mirrored}} {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", which aired in May 2010 and was Mark's final appearance as a regular cast member. During that scene, the two overlook {{what was once the}} pit, but was now a filled-in lot, and Mark gives her construction plans for a park before kissing her goodbye on the cheek and leaving. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's <b>great</b> <b>because</b> Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale. Last year, they sat on the bench and kissed, and it seemed like they might be getting back together. This year, they sat on the bench and Mark kissed Leslie goodbye." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Drunk in Love" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Detail and Jay-Z, who appears as the {{featured}} artist on the track. Production of the song was handled by Boots and Beyoncé as well as Detail. [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] was recorded at Jungle City Studios and at Oven Studios in New York City. Detail approached Beyoncé with a beat he had created called [...] "Drunk" [...] inspired by different situations from being affected by alcohol. Beyoncé further helped {{in the production of}} the song, adding elements that Detail had missed. She and Jay-Z later free-styled their verses for the song and Timbaland contributed keyboards. J-Roc, Dre Moon, Brian Soko and Rasool Ricardo Diaz contributed to the production of the song. Elaborating on the conception of the song, Beyoncé said: [...] "We just kinda had a party. It was so <b>great,</b> <b>because</b> it wasn't about any ego, we weren't trying to make a hit record [...] we were just having fun...and I think you can hear that in the record." ...|$|E
60|$|He knew {{full well}} that unless some {{accident}} had befallen him, his father would have returned before dark; {{that he would not}} have allowed himself to be led so far away from the camping-place that he could not readily return; and the boy's sorrow was all the <b>greater</b> <b>because</b> it was impossible to console his mother.|$|R
60|$|And {{how was she}} to {{pronounce}} that sentence! Though her faith might be taken away, her love remained, and grew all the <b>greater</b> <b>because</b> he needed it. Yet she knew that no subterfuge or pretence would avail her to hide why she had come. She could not hide it. It must be spoken out now, though death was preferable.|$|R
