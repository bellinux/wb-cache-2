60|$|Scarcely {{knowing what}} he did, he walked towards the Earl like a machine, <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> within him and a great humming in his ears. As he drew near, the nobleman {{stopped for a moment}} and stared at him, and Myles, as in a dream, kneeled, and {{presented}} the letter. The Earl took it in his hand, turned it this way and that, looked first at the bearer, then at the packet, and then at the bearer again.|$|E
6000|$|Then a swish in the wheat, a soft thud, very low, unmistakably came to Kurt's ear. He listened, {{turning his}} ear to the wind. Presently he heard it again--a sound {{relating}} both to wheat and earth. In a hot flash he divined that some one had thrown fairly heavy bodies into the wheat-fields. Phosphorus cakes! Kurt held his breath while he peered down the gloomy road, <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounding,</b> his hands gripping the rifle. And when he descried a dim form stealthily coming toward him he yelled, [...] "Halt!" ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{hand was}} still in his as he rose and they were very close, and the man was still flushed with the contact of her body since he had carried her from the throne room of O-Tar. He felt <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> in his breast and the hot blood surging through his veins as he looked at her {{beautiful}} face, with its downcast eyes and the half-parted lips that he would have given a kingdom to possess, and then he swept her to him and as he crushed her against his breast his lips smothered hers with kisses.|$|E
60|$|Duane waited. The moments dragged endlessly. <b>His</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounded.</b> Longstreth entered, {{turned up}} the light, and, taking a box of cigars from the table, he carried it out.|$|R
5|$|Flashbacks {{throughout}} the episode show the attempts {{of a teenage}} Dexter (Devon Graye) to feel <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pound.</b> At {{the end of the}} episode, Debra turns on the television in Dexter's apartment and shows him the news: a team of scuba divers in Biscayne Bay has uncovered over 30 garbage bags, each containing parts of Dexter's mutilated victims. As he watches, <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> races.|$|R
5000|$|A hen {{leaves her}} eggs unguarded, and a mean-looking weasel stealthily creeps into the {{henhouse}} while the narrator frets. Just {{as he is}} about to grab the eggs, they all hatch at once, and the chicks shout [...] "BOO!" [...] in unison. The frightened weasel evokes a Joe Penner catch-phrase, [...] "Don't ever DOOO that!" [...] and gasps as <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounds.</b>|$|R
60|$|Lane rose to {{his feet}} with <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounding,</b> and a strange sense of expectancy. His little sister! Never during the endless months of drudgery, strife and conflict, and agony, had he {{forgotten}} Lorna. Not duty, nor patriotism, had forced him to enlist in the army before the draft. It had been an ideal which he imagined he shared with the millions of American boys who entered the service. Too deep ever to be spoken of! The barbarous and simian Hun, with his black record against Belgian, and French women, should never set foot on American soil.|$|E
6000|$|Happy Jack {{scrambled}} {{up on the}} old stone wall and looked this way and looked that way. He couldn't see a thing to be afraid of. He jumped down and ran a few steps. Then his heart failed, and he scampered {{back to the old}} stone wall in a panic. After a few minutes he tried again, and once more a foolish fear sent him back. The third time he gritted his teeth, said to himself over and over, [...] "I will! I will! I will!" [...] and ran with all his might. In no time at all he was across the dooryard and up in the big tree, <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> with excitement.|$|E
60|$|He set to work. The wall of ice {{was five}} {{feet above the}} ground on which the boat rested. First {{prospecting}} for the best launching-place, he found where a huge cake of ice shelved upward from the river that ran fifteen feet below {{to the top of the}} wall. This was a score of feet away, and at the end of an hour he had managed to get the boat that far. He was sick with nausea from his exertions, and at times it seemed that blindness smote him, for he could not see, his eyes vexed with spots and points of light that were as excruciating as diamond-dust, <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> up in his throat and suffocating him. Elijah betrayed no interest, did not move nor open his eyes; and Daylight fought out his battle alone. At last, falling on his knees from the shock of exertion, he got the boat poised on a secure balance on top the wall. Crawling on hands and knees, he placed in the boat his rabbit-skin robe, the rifle, and the pail. He did not bother with the ax. It meant an additional crawl of twenty feet and back, and if the need for it should arise he well knew he would be past all need.|$|E
6000|$|Cooper Creek. December, 1960. <b>His</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounded.</b> That was all {{he needed}} to know. He stood up, shaking himself, {{stamping}} {{his feet on the}} cold ground. The sun had moved across the sky to {{the very edge of the}} hills. He smiled. Already he had discovered the exact time and place. Now he needed only to go back, perhaps to November, to Cooper Creek-- ...|$|R
6000|$|He was surprised. He looked self-conscious. <b>His</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounded.</b> He {{was still}} more {{agitated}} when the ballots were counted and Gunch said, [...] "It's {{a pleasure to}} announce that Georgie Babbitt {{will be the next}} assistant gavel-wielder. I know of no man who stands more stanchly for common sense and enterprise than good old George. Come on, let's give him our best long yell!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Were {{you ever}} terribly, terribly frightened? That {{was the way}} Chatterer felt. He was caught; {{there was no doubt}} about it! His sharp teeth were of no use at all on those hard wires. He could look out between them, but he couldn't get out. He was too frightened to think. <b>His</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> against <b>his</b> sides until it hurt. He forgot all about that queer food he had so wanted to taste, and which was right before him now. Indeed, {{he felt as if he}} never, never would want to eat again. What was going to happen to him now? What would Farmer Brown's boy do to him when he found him there? ...|$|R
60|$|Wingate, {{notwithstanding}} his iron nerve, awoke with a start, in {{the grey}} {{of the following}} morning, to find <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> against his ribs and a chill sense of horror stealing into his brain. Nothing had happened or was happening except that one cry,--the low, awful cry {{of a man in}} agony. He sat up, switched on the electric light by his side and gazed at the round table, his fingers clenched around the butt of his pistol. Dredlinton, from whom had come the sound, had fallen with his head and shoulders upon the table. His face was invisible, only there crept from his hidden lips a faint repetition of the cry,--the hideous sob, it might have been, as of a spirit descending into hell. Then there was silence. Phipps was sitting bolt upright, his eyes wide open, motionless but breathing heavily. He seemed to be in a state of coma, neither wholly asleep nor wholly conscious. Rees was leaning as far back in his chair as his cords permitted. His patch of high colour had gone; there was an ugly twist to his mouth, a livid tinge in his complexion, but nevertheless he slept. Wingate rose to his feet and watched. Phipps seemed keyed up to suffering. Dredlinton showed no sign. Their gaoler strolled up to the table.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Halt!' The order {{came from}} a soldier {{sitting in front of}} the wooden walkway. Usama stopped, <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounding.</b> 'Open your suitcase!' The Israeli {{stretched}} out his hand and rifled the contents. 'What's this?' 'Librium.' 'Yeah, you people are crazy about that stuff.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 1977 {{article titled}} Modernism in the Novel, Kovilan talked {{about one of}} his most {{important}} concerns as a writer: [...] "To put a live human being on the post-mortem table in his fundamental state, without his clothes or make-up, to open him up like a frog in the zoology lab, with his chest and abdomen nailed flat, and <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> still, even after the studies - we have not had many such instances in our novels, to show the beats of human character in the raw like this... Hunger is a human being's primary craving... And the war pangs of hunger are the true nature of human beings. The ruckus that happens here in the pretext of â€˜modernism' is enough to drown these pangs of hunger. This is not literature, but literary vulgarity." [...] In another article written nearly a decade later, he said: [...] "Dialogues will never become literature. A writer cannot realise the vagaries of human life merely through dialogues. But, human being! It is never a single being. More masquerades than a chameleon. Never-ending masks. As the masks fall off one by one, the story touches you more and more deeply." ...|$|E
6000|$|She had {{the frank}} gesture and ready smile a kindly {{man would have}} used. Instantly his brain cleared, <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> ceased to <b>pound,</b> and the {{numbness}} left his limbs. He forgot himself utterly. He only saw and heard her. He found himself saying: ...|$|R
60|$|On one side, then, {{was this}} {{physical}} torture; {{on the other}} the old hell, terribly augmented at this crisis, in his mind. It seemed that thought and imagination {{had never been so}} swift. If death found him presently, how would it come? Would he get decent burial or be left for the peccaries and the coyotes? Would his people ever know where he had fallen? How wretched, how miserable his state! It was cowardly, it was monstrous for him to cling longer to this doomed life. Then the hate in <b>his</b> <b>heart,</b> the hellish hate of these men on his trail--that was like a scourge. He felt no longer human. He had degenerated into an animal that could think. <b>His</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounded,</b> <b>his</b> pulse beat, his breast heaved; and this internal strife seemed to thunder into his ears. He was now enacting the tragedy of all crippled, starved, hunted wolves at bay in their dens. Only his tragedy was infinitely more terrible because he had mind enough to see his plight, his resemblance to a lonely wolf, bloody-fanged, dripping, snarling, fire-eyed in a last instinctive defiance.|$|R
60|$|A fence loomed up gray in the obscurity. Jean vaulted it, darted {{across the}} lane into {{the shadow of}} the corral, and soon gained the first cabin. Here he leaned to regain <b>his</b> breath. <b>His</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> high and seemed too large for his breast. The hot blood beat and surged all over his body. Sweat poured off him. His teeth were clenched tight as a vise, and it took effort on his part to open his mouth so he could breathe more freely and deeply. But these {{physical}} sensations were as nothing compared to the tumult of his mind. Then the instinct, the spell, let go its grip and he could think. He had avenged Guy, he had depleted the ranks of the Jorths, he had made good the brag of his father, all of which afforded him satisfaction. But these thoughts were not accountable for all that he felt, especially for the bittersweet sting of the fact that death to the defiler of Ellen Jorth could not efface the doubt, the regret which seemed to grow with the hours.|$|R
40|$|Tony {{was only}} seven when it happened, but 10 years later it still haunts his dreams. He {{has had the}} same {{nightmare}} three times this week. In the dream it happens much as he remembers it. In {{the middle of the}} night he can hear his fatherâ€™s angry voice in the other room. His father is often angry, and Tony rarely knows why. He listens to his fatherâ€™s voice get louder, the words harsher. Suddenly, his father bursts into the room and drags him and his younger brother out of their beds. Then they are in a car, speeding toward their Uncle Rockyâ€™s house. Once they are inside, everything becomes a blur. There is blood on the couch and all over the living room floor and his father is screaming at his uncle, and again Tony does not know why. His brother starts screaming, too, and Tony wants to tell him it will be alright but his lips wonâ€™t form the words. Tony bolts upright in bed, covered in sweat, <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>pounding.</b> Again, he thinks, again. The rest of the night he lies awake, wondering if any of his roommates are also awake, staring at the ceiling in the darkness...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the first}} sharp up-raise {{in the way}} <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> began to <b>pound</b> and he swayed blindly to and fro, unable to proceed. For an instant he looked down in dismay at the rocky, waiting earth, a most inhospitable grave. A few minutes' rest against a tree, and his brain cleared. [...] "Higher--I must go higher," [...] he said to himself; [...] "they'll find me here." ...|$|R
60|$|Philip felt <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> cease its <b>pounding,</b> felt {{an immense}} sense of relief. It was a {{wonderful}} thing, this message. It cleared up one point on {{which he had been}} anxious and unsettled. It was taken for granted at the Works, then, that he had come straight to Liverpool. He walked up and down the deck on the side remote from the dock, driving this into his mind.|$|R
60|$|Hanscom smiled. He {{had seen}} other women hurrying {{to change their}} workaday dress for visitors, and he {{imagined}} Helen hastily putting on her shoes and smoothing her hair. He was distinctly less in awe of her by reason of this girlish action--it made her seem more of his own rough-and-ready world, and he dismounted at her door almost at his ease, although <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> had been <b>pounding</b> furiously as he rode down the ridge.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{realized}} the significance of it, and <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> began <b>pounding</b> and challenging him to play the lover with this woman {{who was not a}} spirit from other worlds but a mere woman with lips a cherry could stain. He trembled at the audacity of his thought; but all his soul was singing, and reason, in a triumphant paean, assured him he was right. Something of this change in him must have reached her, for she paused from her reading, looked up at him, and smiled. His eyes dropped from her blue eyes to her lips, and the sight of the stain maddened him. His arms all but flashed out to her and around her, {{in the way of his}} old careless life. She seemed to lean toward him, to wait, and all his will fought to hold him back.|$|R
60|$|The pursuit was renewed, {{till the}} water was again muddied. But he could not wait. He unstrapped the tin bucket and began to bale the pool. He baled wildly at first, {{splashing}} himself and flinging the water so short a distance that it ran back into the pool. He worked more carefully, striving to be cool, though <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> was <b>pounding</b> against <b>his</b> chest and his hands were trembling. At the end of half an hour the pool was nearly dry. Not a cupful of water remained. And there was no fish. He found a hidden crevice among the stones through which it had escaped to the adjoining and larger pool--a pool which he could not empty in a night and a day. Had he known of the crevice, he could have closed it with a rock {{at the beginning and}} the fish would have been his.|$|R
5000|$|After {{his first}} and only winless season at six, Shogun Lodge won the City Tatt's Lightning Handicap first-up as a seven-year-old (coincidentally, over the same course as his debut win, five years earlier), and was sent to Flemington for two further races. In {{the early stages of}} the second of these races, the Emirates Stakes, Shogun Lodge {{suffered}} a fatal <b>heart</b> attack. [...] <b>His</b> upset trainer, Bob Thomsen, said 'Oh God... I've probably handled the best horse this country's ever had. The best horse ever to put his head through a bridle was Tulloch and I handled him... <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> weighed 14-and-a-half (<b>pounds)...</b> I'll tell you what, Shogun wasn't far behind him...' ...|$|R
6000|$|She thrust {{her hand}} under {{his coat and}} laid it over <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b> [...] "You are tired out," [...] she said, and there was anguish in her voice. [...] "Your <b>heart</b> is <b>pounding</b> terribly. You mustn't do any more climbing. And, hark, there's a wolf!" ...|$|R

5000|$|A rabbit named Shorty with a fast {{high pitched}} voice is running from Pete Puma, until he stumbles down Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole. Shorty tells Bugs <b>his</b> problem ("My <b>heart</b> <b>pounded,</b> my legs trembled, I was frozen with fear"), and Bugs agrees {{to help him}} out. Bugs then {{proceeds}} to play various tricks on Pete who is now outside of Bugs' hole feeling around inside for the little rabbit. Bugs leaves a fake rabbit dynamite decoy which Pete grabs and pulls out of the hole, then BOOM! Bugs goes outside and engages in some small talk with Pete who offers him a cigar ("El Explodo"). After Bugs accepts it (and wisely puts it away before Pete can light it), he asks Pete to stay for tea. He pours tea into two cups, holds up the sugar bowl and asks Pete how many lumps he wants, to which Pete replies [...] "Oh, three or four". Bugs repeatedly hits Pete Puma {{on the head with}} a wooden mallet, producing five lumps on his head which is [...] "one too many". Bugs flattens the extra lump with a reflex hammer, then shoves the explosive cigar into Pete's mouth, lights it and runs off before the explosion.|$|R
60|$|When she {{returned}} with the grammar, she drew a chair near his--he wondered if he should have helped her with the chair--and sat down beside him. She turned {{the pages of the}} grammar, and their heads were inclined toward each other. He could hardly follow her outlining of the work he must do, so amazed was he by her delightful propinquity. But when she began to lay down the importance of conjugation, he forgot all about her. He had never heard of conjugation, and was fascinated by the glimpse he was catching into the tie-ribs of language. He leaned closer to the page, and her hair touched his cheek. He had fainted but once in his life, and he {{thought he was going to}} faint again. He could scarcely breathe, and <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> was <b>pounding</b> the blood up into his throat and suffocating him. Never had she seemed so accessible as now. For the moment the great gulf that separated them was bridged. But there was no diminution in the loftiness of his feeling for her. She had not descended to him. It was he who had been caught up into the clouds and carried to her. His reverence for her, in that moment, was of the same order as religious awe and fervor. It seemed to him that he had intruded upon the holy of holies, and slowly and carefully he moved his head aside from the contact which thrilled him like an electric shock and of which she had not been aware.|$|R

50|$|Keycase's luck changes when he blithely talks {{himself out}} of one tough spot by {{grabbing}} an ordinary-looking attache case, which belongs to the Duke and Duchess. He gets to a room, calms <b>his</b> <b>pounding</b> <b>heart,</b> and uses one of his key collection to open the case {{to see what it}} contains. The case is filled with cash. Counting himself lucky, Keycase heads for the elevator to leave. In the elevator, Keycase is joined by the Duke and other guests. The elevator stops between floors as the control relays and emergency brakes begin to fail. McDermott and his assistant manager take the adjacent elevator to the same level and transfer passengers through the roof. The Duke and Keycase are the last two in the failing car. Keycase refuses to leave his briefcase, which contains the stolen money. The Duke is able to wrestle the case away and help Keycase out of the car, but right then the brakes completely fail, sending the Duke to his death.|$|R
60|$|With <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> mightily, {{and face}} set and stern, {{he left his}} room and began {{descending}} the stairway, uncertain still {{of the way in}} which he should meet her.|$|R

5000|$|Tom {{can now be}} seen, {{attempting}} to smash Jerry with a broom, but instead repeatedly breaking lamps and glasses. Jerry hides in the one unbroken glass and runs away, but Tom picks up the glass and waits for Jerry to emerge from it. When he does, <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> starts <b>pounding</b> and extending out of his chest. Before Tom can club the mouse with the broken end of the broom handle, Cuckoo escapes from his cage by unlatching {{the base of the}} cage, which falls onto Tom, flattening his head with a cymbal noise. Tom pursues Jerry, chasing him into his mousehole, into which Tom's face gets caught, elongating his nose. Tom then spots Cuckoo, chasing it into his cage. The cat leaps for him, but instead gets himself caught inside the cage, which he then seals with the base. He flies onto a table and then runs away as Tom pursues him, but instead Tom pokes himself {{through the center of the}} table and swallows Cuckoo. Fortunately for him, the everpresent [...] "cuckoo...cuckoo...cuckoo" [...] gag allows the bird to escape. Tom runs after Cuckoo, and then rises into the air, beating his deltoids to stay afloat in the same matter as Cuckoo. Tom grins at Cuckoo until he runs into the wall and three potted plants hit him on the head. The cat recovers and sees Cuckoo pacing away under a fourth pot. He covers the pot and pokes his eye through the hole, and Cuckoo's heart extends out in the same manner as Jerry's. As Tom reaches under the pot to grab Cuckoo, Jerry inserts Tom's tail into the windowsill and snaps the cord. Tom untangles himself and storms after the mouse, and the canary dives down and gives him a lift. They enter the hole, and Tom's nose is once again elongated, but this time, he has swallowed the duo. The mouse and Cuckoo squeeze out and take sanctuary in the mousehole, where the two introduce each other with and handshake.|$|R
60|$|My <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> {{within my}} breast as I {{advanced}} toward her--tears {{came to my}} eyes--and the words that would have poured forth in a perfect torrent choked in my throat as I opened my arms and took into them once more the woman I loved--Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.|$|R
