40|$|How do {{learning}} processes {{escape from}} local optima? Doing so requires {{an exploration of}} the landscape at a range of the order of the landscape correlation length [...] a "long jump" in synapsis space. This brings up a dilemma: because of the high dimensionality of this space, the probability that a random long <b>jump</b> <b>lead</b> to a better optimum is nearly zero. We conjecture that "intelligent" coarse-grained learning operators emerge as a consequence of a self-organization process in neural systems, as follows. The presentation of a single new data vector stimulates the recall of other vectors, each of which generates a small displacement in synapsis space. The sum of these displacements constitutes a coarsegrained learning event. Although long jumps are occasionally needed to escape from local optima, they should be {{the exception rather than the}} rule. This leads us to propose a neural network model where the recall process self-organizes to a critical state and one has a power-law distribution in the number of data vectors recalled...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFully developed, {{steady state}} forced convection, in {{parallel}} plates micro-channels, {{filled with a}} porous medium saturated with rarefied gases at high temperatures, in local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) condition, is investigated for the first-order slip flow regime (0  Kn  0. 1). Both velocity and temperature jumps at the walls are accounted for. An analytic solution is proposed for the Darcy-extended Brinkman flow model with assigned uniform heat flux at the microchannel walls and viscous heat dissipation in the fluid phase. The solution for NTLE includes the shear work done by the slipping effects. A closed-form expression of the Nusselt number is derived. A validation analysis {{with respect to the}} case of channels filled with saturated porous medium is accomplished. The results show that the internal dissipation increases as the velocity slip increases. In addition, the heat dissipation strongly affects the fluid temperature profiles. The increases in velocity slip and temperature <b>jump</b> <b>lead</b> to decreases of temperature gradients in the fluid and solid along the sections. The heat transfer at channel walls is enhanced due to an increase in the bulk heat transfer...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{existence}} of a velocity slip and temperature jump on the solid walls, the heat transfer in microchannels significantly differs from the one in the macroscale. In our research, we have focused on the pressure driven gas flows in a simple finite microchannel geometry, with an entrance and an outlet, for low Reynolds (Re< 200) and low Knudsen (Kn< 0. 01) numbers. For such a regime, the slip induced phenomena are strongly connected with the viscous effects. As a result, heat transfer is also significantly altered. For the optimization of flow conditions, we have investigated various temperature gradient configurations, additionally changing Reynolds and Knudsen numbers. The entrance effects, slip flow, and temperature <b>jump</b> <b>lead</b> to complex relations between flow behavior and heat transfer. We have shown that slip effects are generally insignificant for flow behavior. However, two configuration setups (hot wall cold gas and cold wall hot gas) are affected by slip in distinguishably different ways. For the first one, which concerns turbomachinery, the mass flow rate can increase by about 1 % in relation to the no-slip case, depending on the wall-gas temperature difference. Heat transfer is more significantly altered. The Nusselt number between slip and no-slip cases at the outlet of the microchannel is increased by about 10 %...|$|E

40|$|URL] audienceBeing a {{combination}} of service utility, 'symbolisc good' and cultural ceremony, the funeral business offers a privileged insight into how heterogeneous values are produced and balanced by the various market stakeholders. How does this entwining of values play out in market practices? This paper draws upon {{the history of the}} funeral market over two centuries to examine the central role of 'market devices' in the process of combining, managing and ordering distinct (or even incommensurable) values. First, observing the constitutional phase of the private industry {{in the context of an}} extremely competitive appropriation of funerals by the Church and the State, the analysis examines the system of the "cortege classes" as a central device of 'managing dissonance' between conflicting interests. Then, a historical <b>jump</b> <b>lead</b> us to half way through the 20 th century to examine the market infrastructure formed by the system of care for the dead a powerful symbolic and material agencement which fostered a standardized way of dealing with death. As a third point, the exponential development of death insurance in recent years appears as a new form of mixing collective and private schemes in the funeral economy. Beyond describing these shifting forms of coordination, the analysis of the market devices' performativity highlights essential properties, that is: a) the "attachement" of human or non-human entities among them as a means to frame the interplay in market practices; b) the incorporating of a calculation formula - and consequently a price-setting mechanism - which set up both the profit sharing and the handling of moral/political issues (the common interest) ...|$|E
