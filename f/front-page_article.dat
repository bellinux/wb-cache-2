25|$|Tobin {{remained}} {{eager to}} heal the breach between AFL and CIO, however. Tobin had a strong relationship with John L. Lewis, and the AFL relied on this relationship in peace talks. Tobin {{was a member of}} the AFL committee involved in merger talks in 1936, 1937, and 1939, and helped negotiate the 1942 agreement which established a joint AFL-CIO jurisdictional disputes committee. In a <b>front-page</b> <b>article</b> which appeared in The New York Times on January 19, 1942, Lewis claimed that he and Tobin had agreed to merge the AFL and CIO on the condition that William Green retire, George Meany become president, and Philip Murray accept demotion to secretary-treasurer. He played an active role in the 1943 negotiations to get United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) back into AFL, and served on the Committee of Ten which negotiated the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955. Tobin had long opposed UMWA reaffiliation except on the terms dictated by the 1935 AFL Executive Council's trial of the CIO unions. But the growing influence of the CIO in government councils and in the eyes of the media mitigated Tobin's arguments and led the Executive Council to readmit the union in 1946.|$|E

The Washington Post printed a <b>front-page</b> <b>article</b> on the failures, commenting: [...] "The vaunted helicopters came to symbolise everything wrong with the Army as it enters the 21st century: Its inability to move quickly, its resistance to change, its obsession with casualties, its post-Cold War identity crisis".

Two RLI officers in dress uniform are portrayed in a Salisbury street, both turning angrily to see a uniformed RLI trooper chasing a crowd of terrified, screaming young women across the road.

500|$|Although Kaufman's {{book had}} a minimal {{impact in the}} United States, it {{achieved}} notoriety in Nazi Germany, where propagandists used it as evidence of an international Jewish plan to destroy the German people. On July 24, 1941, the Nazi Party's newspaper, Völkischer Beobachter, published a <b>front-page</b> <b>article</b> on the book titled: [...] "The Product of Criminal Jewish Sadism: Roosevelt Demands the Sterilization of the German People." [...] The newspaper alleged that Kaufman was a close ally of Samuel Irving Rosenman, a well-known advisor to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and that: [...] "Given the close relationship of the writer to the White House, this monstrous war program {{can be seen as}} a synthesis of genuine Talmudic hatred and Roosevelt’s views on foreign policy." [...] At the time, the German leadership was engaged in a propaganda campaign designed to rally popular support for the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Antisemitism in general, and Kaufman's ideas in particular, became a focus of this campaign.|$|E
500|$|The earliest-known {{telling of}} the tree's story comes from a <b>front-page</b> <b>article</b> {{entitled}} [...] "Deeded to Itself" [...] in the Athens Weekly Banner of August 12, 1890. The article explains that the tree had been located on the property of Colonel William Henry Jackson. William Jackson {{was the son of}} James Jackson (a soldier in the American Revolution as well as a Congressman, U.S. Senator, and Governor of Georgia), and the father of another James Jackson (a Congressman and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia). He was the brother of Jabez Young Jackson, also a Congressman. (William Jackson was reportedly a professor at the University of Georgia, and is sometimes given the title of Doctor. The nature of his military service and the source of the title [...] "Colonel" [...] are unknown.) Jackson supposedly cherished childhood memories of the tree, and, desiring to protect it, deeded to it the ownership of itself and its surrounding land.

In October 1930, he came forward and told his story in six <b>front-page</b> <b>{{articles}}</b> in the Washington Post.

The following day the San Francisco Chronicle published his obituary on its front page under the headline [...] "Le Roi est Mort" [...] ("The King is Dead"). In a tone tinged with sadness, the article respectfully reported that, [...] "n the reeking pavement, in the darkness of a moon-less night under the dripping rain..., Norton I, by the grace of God, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico, departed this life".

It {{has been suggested that}} he could have made a contribution to AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his situation and his fight against the disease. Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him, with Brian May confirming in a 1993 interview he had informed the band of his illness much earlier. Filmed in May 1991, the music video for [...] "These Are the Days of Our Lives" [...] features a very thin Mercury, in what are his final scenes in front of the camera. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, {{for an hour or two}} at a time. May says of Mercury: [...] "He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really." [...] Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, states: [...] "This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn't sad, it was very happy.

Lemański continued his activities, also took part in Przystanek Woodstock music festival.

[...] The Times reported that ex-Chief Donald O. Manning had not told other city agencies about Olde 23's continued operations, and Olde 23 had failed to turn over the income, as required by city law. Investigations by the Times and the City Controller also revealed that some filming fees had been paid in cash to James Croak, an American artist who leased the building from the City of Los Angeles from 1978–85, but no illegality was found as Mr. Croak had the right to sub-lease the property for short periods as long as he notified the landlord that he was doing so. Notably Mr. Croak used most of the money to replace missing brass fire poles, balustrades and other period fixtures that were missing. [...] Other fees were not accounted for, and Olde 23 the museum Non-Profit had even collected fees for use of other city fire stations as shooting locations. [...] Also, even after the city chose a new location for a fire department museum, the chief did not use the funds collected by [...] "Olde 23" [...] for the museum.
