The Leptomonas was more susceptible than C. fasciculata in all media, especially to phenanthridines (ethidium, prothidium, isometamidium) and diamidines (pentamidine, diminazene diaceturate [Berenil], <b>hydroxystilbamidine,</b> stilbamidine); concentrations of these drugs required for 50 % {{inhibition of}} the Leptomonas were < 5 μg/ml. In contrast, C. fasciculata was uninhibited by < 20 μg of diamidines per ml and was three- to sixfold less susceptible than the Leptomonas to isometamidium and prothidium. Both trypanosomatids were susceptible to nucleoside antibiotics, e. g., nucleocidin. Neither was inhibited by suramin, melarsen, melarsen oxide, or tryparsamide.

40|$|White matter {{injury is}} an {{important}} cause of functional disability of the brain. We comprehensively analyzed a modified endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) injection-induced white matter injury model in the rat which is very valuable for investigating the underlying mechanisms of subcortical ischemic stroke. ET- 1 was stereotactically injected into the internal capsule of the rat. To avoid complications with leakage of ET- 1 into the lateral ventricle, the safest trajectory angle to the target was established. Rats with white matter injury were extensively evaluated for structural changes and functional sequelae, using motor function tests, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, histopathology evolution, volume estimation of the lesion, and neuroanatomical identification of affected neurons using the retrograde tracer <b>hydroxystilbamidine.</b> Optimization of the trajectory of the ET- 1 injection needle provided excellent survival rate. MR imaging visualized the white matter injury 2 days after surgery. Motor function deficit appeared temporarily after the operation. Histological studies confirmed damage of axons and myelin sheaths followed by inflammatory reaction and gliosis similar to lacunar infarction, with lesion volume of less than 1 % of the whole brain. <b>Hydroxystilbamidine</b> injected into the lesion revealed wide spatial distribution of the affected neuronal population. Compared with prior ET 1 injection models, this method induced standardized amount of white matter damage and temporary motor function deficit in a reproducible and safe manner. The present model is valuable for studying the pathophysiology of not only ischemia, but a broader set of white matter damage conditions in the lissencephalic brain...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Hydroxystilbamidine</b> isethionate, a dye {{capable of}} binding to both DNA and RNA, {{has been found}} to be á {{powerful}} inhibitor of cellular ribonucleases. A procedure has been developed that, with the aid of this compound, permits the preparative isolation of giant silk fibroin polyribosomes from the posterior silk gland of Bombyx mori. The polyribosomes contain ^- 45 - 112 ribosomal particles, as judged by electron microscopy. Treatment of giant fibroin polyribosomes with EDTA releases a particle that sediments at 125 S. This mRNP particle contains biologically active silk fibroin mRNA, as judged by cell-free translation in an mRNA-dependent reticulocyte cell-free system. The isolation and characterization of cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNP) containing specific mRNA's has so far been achieved in relatively few biological systems. The two best studied examples are globin mRNP and myosin mRNP (see reference 1 for review). Insects remain relatively unexploited as model systems for the study ofmRNP structure and function. A promising system for such studies is the posterior silk gland of Bombyx mori, in which silk fibroin mRNA is by far the major mRNA present in the cell. The isolation of fibroin polyribosomes has so far proven difficult because of the lability of the very long mRNA molecule (2 - 4). In this paper I describe a method that utilizes a novel ribonuclease inhibitor, <b>hydroxystilbamidine</b> isethionate, to achieve the isolation of giant silk gland polyribosomes containing undegraded fibroin mRNA. I also present a preliminary characterization of fibroin-specific mRNP particles obtained from the giant polyribosome fraction.

40|$|International audienceLeptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, regulates {{food intake}} and body weight by acting principally on the hypothalamus, which {{displays}} the highest expression of leptin receptor (Ob-R). Nevertheless, {{other regions of}} the brain express Ob-R and constitute leptin's target sites. The dorsal vagal complex (DVC), an integrative centre of autonomic functions located in the caudal brainstem, is one of these structures. Leptin, by acting through the DVC, affects autonomic and neuroendocrine functions, such as control of food intake and gastric motility. In the present study, we observed Ob-R labelling within the DVC in cells that correspond to neuronal cell bodies. We showed for the first time Ob-R expression in a subpopulation of glial fibrillary acid protein positive cells located at the border between the area postrema and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). These glial cells exhibit an atypical morphology consisting of unbranched processes that radiate rostro-caudally from the fourth ventricle wall. In vitro, the glial cells exhibited both long and short Ob-R expression with a preferential expression of the Ob-Ra and-f isoforms. Interestingly, using i. v and i. c. v. injection of the fluorescent tracer <b>hydroxystilbamidine,</b> we provided evidence that these cells may constitute a diffusion barrier which might regulate entry of molecules into the NTS. Finally, modulation of energy status, by acute or chronic reduction of food intake, modulated especially the short Ob-R isoforms in the DVC. In the light of these results, we hypothesise that Ob-R positive glial cells of the DVC participate in the transport of leptin into the brainstem and thus contribute to regulation of energy homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} laser photocoagulation (LP) -induced ocular hypertension (OHT) on the survival and retrograde axonal transport of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), {{as well as on}} the function of retinal layers. Methods: Adult albino Swiss mice (35 – 45 g) received laser photocoagulation of limbal and episcleral veins in the left eye. Mice were sacrificed at 8, 17, 35, and 63 days. Intraocular pressure (IOP) in both eyes was measured with a Tono-Lab before LP and at various days after LP. Flash electroretinogram (ERG) scotopic threshold response (STR) and a- and b-wave amplitudes were recorded before LP and at various times after LP. RGCs were labeled with 10 % <b>hydroxystilbamidine</b> methanesulfonate (OHSt) applied to both superior colliculi before sacrifice and in some mice, with dextran tetramethylrhodamine (DTMR) applied to the ocular stump of the intraorbitally transected optic nerve. Retinas were immunostained for RT 97 or Brn 3 a. Retinas were prepared as whole-mounts and photographed under a fluorescence microscope. Labeled RGCs were counted using image analysis software, and an isodensity contour plot was generated for each retina. Results: IOP increased to twice its basal values by 24 h and was maintained until day 5, after which IOP gradually declined to reach basal values by 1 wk. Similar IOP increases were observed in all groups. The mean total number of OHSt + RGCs was 13, 428 ± 6, 295 (n= 12), 10, 456 ± 14, 301 (n= 13), 12, 622 ± 14, 174 (n= 21), and 10, 451 ± 13, 949 (n= 13) for groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively; these values represented 28 %, 23 %, 26 %, and 22 % of the values found in their contralateral fello...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) is {{the sole}} {{downstream}} adaptor of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, {{which is one of}} the major signaling pathways in immune cells leading to neuroinflammation in the central nervous system. Overexpression of TRIF may lead to activation of inflammatory responses, and contribute to pathophysiological progression in both acute and chronic neurodegenerative retinal diseases. In the present study, was aimed to elucidate the contributions of TRIF to optic nerve (ON) regeneration and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival following injury to the ON, a widely studied model of central nervous system injury and of degenerative diseases such as glaucoma. Methods We used retrograde labeling with a fluorochrome, <b>hydroxystilbamidine</b> (Fluorogold) to evaluate RGC survival, and immunostaining with growth-associated protein- 43 to evaluate axon regeneration in an ON crush model. Changes in microglial cytokines following RGC injury was examined with ELISA and real-time PCR. In vivo studies were carried out in wild-type and trif -/- mice. A Transwell co-culture system and migration test were used to mimic the crosstalk between microglia and RGCs. TRIF-associated downstream adaptors were determined by western blotting. Results Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, TRIF knockout (KO) mice displayed a robust ability to regenerate axons 3 or 7 days after nerve injury. In addition, RGC survival was considerably higher in trif -/- than in WT mice. ON lesion induced less microglial activation in trif -/- than in WT mice. and more WT microglia distorted and migrated toward the foramen opticum. In the transwell system, few trif -/- microglia migrated through the membrane when stimulated by the performed lesion on RGC axons in a transwell system. Inactivation of microglial cells in trif -/- mice was associated with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines, as detected with real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. Furthermore western blot analysis showed that activation of known downstream effectors of TRIF, including TBK 1, IKKε and NF-κB, were significantly inhibited by TRIF deficiency. Conclusion Our results indicate that TRIF deficiency promotes ON axon regeneration by attenuating microglial activation and consequently reducing the release of harmful cytokines via NF-κB inactivation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The DBA/ 2 J mouse is a {{model of}} ocular {{hypertension}} and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration, the main features of which are iris pigment dispersion (IPD) and iris stromal atrophy (ISA). These animals also experience glaucomatous changes, including an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) beginning at about 9 - 12 months of age and sectorial RGC death in the retina. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the onset of functional changes exhibited by DBA/ 2 J mice in the inner retina. This was performed by means of electroretinographic recordings (scotopic threshold response, STR) and their correlation with morphological changes (loss of RGCs). To this end, we recorded the scotopic threshold response in control C 57 BL/ 6 J and in DBA/ 2 J mice at different ages. The RGCs, in both DBA/ 2 J and C 57 BL/ 6 J animals, were identified at 15 months of age by retrograde tracing with an analogue of fluorogold, <b>hydroxystilbamidine</b> methanesulfonate (OHSt), applied on the superior colliculi. Whole mount retinas were processed to quantify the population of RGCs identified by fluorogold tracing and Brn 3 a immunodetection, and were counted using image analysis software; an isodensity contour plot was generated for each retina. DBA/ 2 J mice showed a significant reduction in the positive STR (pSTR) amplitudes at 12 months of age, as compared to control C 57 BL/ 6 J mice of the same age. The pSTR mean amplitude decreased to approximately 27. 82 % of the values recorded in control mice (p= 0. 0058). STR responses decreased in both strains as a result of the natural process of aging, but the decrease was more pronounced in DBA/ 2 J mice. Furthermore, quantification of the total number of RGCs identified by OHSt and Brn 3 a expression showed a reduced population of RGCs in DBA/ 2 J mice as compared to control mice. Regression analysis revealed significant correlations between the decrease in pSTR and a non-homogeneous reduction in the number of RGCs throughout the retina. Our results indicate the existence of a correlation between retinal function impairment and RGC loss. This functional and morphological analysis allows a reliable assessment of the progression of the disease...|$|E
