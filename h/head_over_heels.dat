25|$|The {{availability}} of small inexpensive computing platforms, LEDs, and compact powerful batteries allows special effects {{to be built}} into props, costumes, and scenery. Lighting, atmospherics, sounds, even motorized movement can be programmed into devices and controlled by the actors or remotely. WiFi and Bluetooth devices allow for wireless communication between the control console and the effect. For example, the LEDs built into a dress can be remotely illuminated; the console can even tell them what color to emit. Costumes in <b>Head</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Heels</b> (a musical by Lolita Snipes), The Wiz, and The Winter's Tale are recent examples of wireless control. Lanterns, candles, fireflies, and other effects built into props and scenery also utilize embedded electronics.|$|E
25|$|Knight Lore, an {{isometric}} {{sequel to}} Sabre Wulf, helped {{to establish the}} conventions of early isometric platformers. This formula would be repeated in later games like <b>Head</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Heels,</b> and Monster Max. These games were generally heavily focused on exploring indoor environments, usually {{a series of small}} rooms connected by doors, and have distinct adventure and puzzle elements. Japanese developers blended this gameplay style with that of Japanese action-adventure games like The Legend of Zelda to create games like Land Stalker and Light Crusader. While these games are more generally classified as action adventures, they are also isometric platformers and an evolution of earlier conventions in the genre. This influence would later travel to Europe with Adeline Software's sprawling epic Little Big Adventure, which blended RPG, adventure, and isometric platforming elements.|$|E

[...] She recalled, [...] "The next day he's on the same Pan Am flight I am, going to Paris. When I got out 19 hours later in Paris, I was <b>heads</b> <b>over</b> <b>heels</b> {{in love with this}} guy." ...|$|R
500|$|Another dilemma Beeman faced {{was keeping}} the {{performances}} realistic, and not [...] "over-the-top". Beeman believes that [...] "Tempest" [...] proves {{exactly what he}} thought about Smallville, that the show is [...] "seen and experienced {{from the point of view}} of a teenager". Beeman explains, [...] "If you’re in love, you’re <b>head</b> <b>over</b> <b>heels</b> in love. If you’re scared, you’re terrified. If you’re sad, you’re in grief. The emotions are strong, but it doesn’t mean that the performances are over-the-top." ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately afterwards, Ulf Findeisen {{fell out}} of the air on his jump, {{crashing}} down face-first from 9 m and flipping <b>head</b> <b>over</b> <b>heels</b> repeatedly along the slope, only coming to a stop several seconds later. Al Trautwig, commentating for American TV network ABC, likened Findeisen to [...] "a ragdoll" [...] after the fall. Former ski jumper Jeff Hastings, co-commentating, said: [...] "I'm feeling a little sick to my stomach, Al... I can't believe this. I've never seen ski flying like this... So many falls." [...] Findeisen was barely conscious and had to be stretchered away, later going into cardiac arrest but surviving.|$|E
500|$|This stage {{also saw}} a {{dramatic}} and life-threatening crash from Pedro Horrillo, on the Culmine di San Pietro. His bike skidded on wet leaves during the descent, causing him to lose control of his machine, slide into a guardrail, and tumble <b>head</b> <b>over</b> <b>heels</b> down the mountainside. Horrillo fell [...] and sustained fractures to his thighbones, kneecaps, and T12 and C3 vertebrae, {{as well as a}} punctured lung and internal bleeding. He was airlifted off the mountain and was then taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital. Horrillo woke up in the ambulance, but was put in a chemically induced coma to aid his treatment. He was taken out of the coma the next day, with scans revealing no brain damage. The peloton's protest of Stage 9 the next day was largely in reaction to Horrillo's serious injury.|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person is {{something you have to}} do to get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so <b>head</b> <b>over</b> <b>heels</b> in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{released}} teaser trailers first, and {{the full}} video premiered on June 27, 2011, 1 pm (Eastern Time), on the band's website.

[...] AOL's The Boot also liked the video, writing, [...] "If the storyline itself doesn't make you fall <b>head</b> <b>over</b> <b>heels,</b> the gorgeous scenery surely will, as the clip was shot in various picturesque places around the world." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Taste of Country noted that the video was [...] "heart-pinching". The Tennessean wrote that the [...] "sweet sentimentality should score with fans of ... 'Need You Now'." [...] However, Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed the video [...] "sugary". Robbie Daw of Idolator wrote, [...] "Lady A's [...] "Just A Kiss" [...] video got us choked up after one viewing. Clearly {{we need to get}} out more." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} notable games {{developers}} began their careers on the ZX Spectrum, including David Perry of Shiny Entertainment, and Tim and Chris Stamper (founders of Rare, formerly Ultimate Play the Game, maker of many games for Nintendo and Microsoft game consoles). Other prominent games developers include Julian Gollop ( [...] , Rebelstar, X-COM series), Matthew Smith (Manic Miner, Jet Set Willy), Jon Ritman (Match Day, <b>Head</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Heels),</b> Jonathan [...] "Joffa" [...] Smith (Ping Pong, , Mikie, Hyper Sports), The Oliver Twins (the Dizzy series), Clive Townsend (Saboteur), Sandy White (Ant Attack; I, of the Mask), Pete Cooke (Tau Ceti), Mike Singleton (The Lords of Midnight, War In Middle Earth), and Alan Cox. Although the 48K Spectrum's audio hardware {{was not as}} capable as chips in other popular 8-bit home computers of the era, computer musicians David Whittaker and Tim Follin produced notable multi-channel music for it.|$|E

6000|$|Palliser did {{not appear}} enthusiastic. “There are,” he said, “always drawbacks, and when there are none one {{generally}} makes them. The place is <b>over</b> <b>head</b> and <b>heels</b> in debt, and setting anything straight, especially if it entailed retrenchment, was never a favorite occupation of mine. Besides, a good deal depends upon my pleasing Godfrey Palliser, {{and there are times}} when it’s a trifle difficult to get on with him.” ...|$|R
500|$|Though {{isometric}} games {{had existed}} previously, in a retrospective review, Gillen (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) recalled that Knight Lore {{was the first}} game to offer a [...] "world" [...] with physical depth for exploration {{as opposed to the}} simple mechanics of arcade games. Jeremy Signor of USgamer agreed that Knight Lore felt more like a world than a painting and added that the game's innovative use of successive, single-screen rooms ("flip-screen") pre-dated The Legend of Zelda by years. Gillen said the game's punishing style (unforgiving gameplay, high difficulty, awkward controls) had become obsolete in the 30 years since its release and criticised Knight Lore as [...] "enormously innovative, incredibly atmospheric, and totally unplayable", suggesting that the similar <b>Head</b> <b>over</b> <b>Heels</b> (1987) had aged much better. Peter Parrish (Eurogamer), too, found the game frustrating, though well-made. Dan Whitehead of the same publication appreciated that the 2015 Rare Replay compilation version of Knight Lore emulated the original's choppy animations as the ZX Spectrum's processor once struggled to render the onscreen objects.|$|E
500|$|From 2004 to 2007, Higgins' sexual {{orientation}} {{was the subject}} of media speculation based partly on interpretations of her lyrics and her interviews. In an October 2007 interview with Australian lesbian magazine Cherrie, she was asked if she fell under the moniker of [...] "not-so-straight" [...] girls. She replied [...] "Um, yeah, definitely. ... I think sexuality is a fluid thing and it's becoming increasingly more acceptable to admit that you're that way." [...] In November her Myspace page reported, [...] "I've been in relationships with both men and women so I guess I fall most easily under the category 'Bisexual'". She {{went on to say that}} she wanted future interviews to focus on her music rather than her sexuality. In a March 2008 interview with AfterEllen.com, Higgins said that her song [...] "Secret" [...] was written about an ex-girlfriend who was not comfortable, at first, about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so <b>head</b> <b>over</b> <b>heels</b> in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|The isometric, flip-screen trend {{continued}} in Britain for several years. Apart from Fairlight, Sweevo's World and Get Dexter, other isometric flip-screen games included Jon Ritman's Knight Lore-inspired Batman (1986), <b>Head</b> <b>over</b> <b>Heels</b> (1987), The Last Ninja (1987), La Abadía del Crimen (1987), Cadaver (1990), and console games Solstice (1990) and Landstalker (1992). As players {{tired of the}} genre's similar reiterations, Ritman's games, in particular, brought new ideas. Sandy White, who developed the pre-Knight Lore isometric game Ant Attack, was impressed at Ultimate's in-game [...] "balance" [...] and gutsy design decisions. The developer of The Great Escape, another isometric game, considered Knight Lore to be more [...] "a rival title than an inspiration", but it still spurred him to spend nine months making Where Time Stood Still. Retro Gamer wrote that Knight Lore influence persisted 30 years later through titles such as Populous (1989), Syndicate (1993), [...] (1994), and Civilization II (1996). The style also spread to computer role-playing games like Baldur's Gate, , Diablo, and Fallout. Though GamesRadar Matt Cundy reported in 2009 that isometric perspective was no longer as prominent a topic in game design, in 2014, Chris Scullion of Vice traced Knight Lore isometric influence to The Sims 4 (2014) and Diablo III (2012).|$|E

5000|$|... "Head <b>Over</b> <b>Heels</b> in Love" [...] {{is a song}} by Kevin Keegan, {{the former}} {{football}} player and manager. It was released as a single on 9 June 1979, being Keegan's debut single. The single features another original song, [...] "Move on Down" [...] as the B-side, which unlike [...] "Head <b>Over</b> <b>Heels</b> in Love", {{is more of a}} hard rock song.|$|R

500|$|Snake Rattle 'n' Roll {{received}} some retrospective coverage {{years after its}} release. IGN ranked the game at #32 in its [...] "Top 100 NES Games" [...] list, calling it [...] "another of Rare's excellent pre-second-party efforts on the NES" [...] as well as [...] "Marble Madness turned into a platformer". Executive editor Craig Harris also noted the game's high level of difficulty and its excellent soundtrack. UK-based magazine Retro Gamer reviewed the game in its August2006 issue, calling {{it one of the}} best isometric games on the NES and [...] "an essential NES game". The two title characters of the game would be named [...] "Hero of the Month" [...] in the magazine's February2007 issue. In a 25th anniversary retrospective of Rare in December2010, the same magazine called the game [...] "an excellent platformer" [...] {{and was one of the}} games they wished would be released on Kinect; the magazine received a glimpse of a Marble Madness prototype on Kinect and wanted to see the control scheme in that game implemented in a new version of Snake Rattle 'n' Roll. The game was also ranked #23 on a readers' poll of top 25 games made by Rare. UK-based magazine Retro Gamer covered Snake Rattle 'n' Roll as part of its retrospective on isometric video games, saying that the game [...] "merged brilliantly the offbeat nature of games such as <b>Head</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Heels</b> with popular movement-based isometric action/puzzle titles like Marble Madness and Spindizzy". It was also covered in the GamesTM Retro book, where it was lauded as one of the more unheralded games in the NES library. The retrospective highly praised the its visuals and landscapes, as well as having a [...] "quirky humour" [...] and a [...] "unique charm". It concluded by saying that Snake Rattle 'n' Roll stands apart from other NES titles, as also did other Rare titles such as Cobra Triangle and R.C. Pro-Am.|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} was widely {{acclaimed}} in publications such as Publishers Weekly, MTV, Ain't it Cool News, Complex magazine, Comic Book Resources, iFanboy and ComicsAlliance; they all praised Vaughan's ability to incorporate elements of different genres, establishing the vast setting and mythology, and introducing characters that engaged the reader. Multiple reviewers likened {{the book to}} a combination of sci-fi/fantasy works such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings and classic works of literature such as Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and the New Testament. AICN singled-out the use of the newborn Hazel as a lone individual to chronicle large-scale events from a past perspective, and Alex Zalben of MTV Geek remarking that he could hear a John Williams score as he read the book. Multiple reviewers also lauded Vaughan for beginning the story with Hazel's birth rather than hurting the story's pace with copious exposition of Alana and Marko's initial meeting and courtship. Todd Allen of The Beat approved of the book's unique [...] "flavor", singling out the characters' motivations, the immersiveness of its surrealist setting, the strangeness of the story's various oddities and the timely nature of the story's political undertones. Both Alex Evans of Weekly Comic Book Review and P. S. Hayes of Geeks of Doom called the series a [...] "classic"; Hayes also praised Image Comics for publishing such an [...] "original" [...] series. Also widely praised was Fiona Staples' artwork, which was characterized as [...] "glorious", with Zalben predicting that readers would [...] "fall <b>head</b> <b>over</b> <b>heels</b> in love" [...] with it, and Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources positively comparing it to that of Leinil Francis Yu, specifically her use of delicate lines to frame characters with large, bold figures and Staples' mixture of the familiar and the foreign together in her character designs to create a visually cohesive universe. AICN singled out Staples' handling of grand, sweeping space shots and other genre trappings, as well as her mastery of facial expressions – which AICN felt was perfectly suited to Vaughan's subtle dialogue. Todd Allen of The Beat wrote that Staples' landscapes at times play as much a part in the story as the foreground.|$|E
