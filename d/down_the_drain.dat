5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>drain,</b> cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b> Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Minoan {{private homes}} had running water. A bathtub {{virtually}} identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos. Several Minoan private homes also had toilets, {{which could be}} flushed by pouring water <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b> The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets, which emptied into an extensive sewage system. The primary sewer in Rome was the Cloaca Maxima; construction began {{on it in the}} sixth century BCE and it is still in use today.|$|E
25|$|The {{water in}} the toilet bowl is {{connected}} to a pipe shaped like an upside-down U. One side of the U channel is arranged as a siphon tube longer than the {{water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The bottom of the drain pipe limits the height of {{the water in the}} bowl before it flows <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b> The water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas entering the building. Sewer gas escapes through a vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{concerns}} over external costs exist as well. In the United States, dental amalgam {{is the largest}} source of mercury received by sewage treatment plants. The mercury contaminates the treatment plant sludge, which is typically disposed of by land application, landfilling or incineration. Several states, including New Jersey, New York, and Michigan, have required the installation of dental amalgam separators prior to 2017. EPA promulgated an effluent guidelines regulation in 2017 which prohibits most dental practices from disposing amalgam waste <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b> Most dental offices nationwide are now required to use amalgam separators.|$|E

50|$|Economic {{breakdown}} {{and international}} anarchy threaten to destroy civilisation, which, if it persists, seems increasingly likely to {{pass into the}} control of those who regard the traditional ideals of democracy - freedom and equality {{and the right of}} citizens to live their lives without moral, religious, or political interference - with amused contempt. If democracy were to founder, the intellectuals {{would be the first to}} go <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> wreckage. Either Communism or Fascism would give them short shrift, and social and civil liberties... would be swept <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>drains</b> of <b>the</b> Corporate or the Communist State as the discarded refuse of an outworn social structure.|$|R
30|$|In Pakistan, {{groundwater}} contamination {{is mainly}} {{due to the}} byproducts of different industries, such as sugar processing, textile, dying, cement, leather, fertilizers, pesticides, food processing, and others.

25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b> If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E

500|$|The goal of {{each level}} is to collect {{all of the}} Chaos Emeralds and {{subsequently}} defeat the newly accessible boss located {{at the top of}} the level. Some Chaos Emeralds are blocked off by obstacles that require Sonic to hit certain switches or bumpers in order to create a clear path. The boss at the top of each level requires a specific strategy to defeat. A [...] "status strip" [...] {{at the top of the}} screen provides hints for defeating bosses as well as encouraging messages when the player makes progress. The strip also tells the player how many Chaos Emeralds are left to collect in a level. Following the defeat of a boss enemy, a bonus round is initiated. These rounds are shown as Sonic playing a regular pinball machine. The player is given three balls to shoot around the board, the object being to accumulate points by hitting as many bumpers and targets as possible. At any point in the bonus round, the player may trigger a tilt shake that rattles the table and affects the ball's trajectory. If the tilt shake is used too often, however, all flippers will lock out, leaving the ball to fall <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b> When the goal of the bonus round is fulfilled, or if all three balls fall through the flippers, the bonus round will end, and the next level will commence. When all of the game's Chaos Emeralds are collected and all four boss enemies are defeated, the player wins.|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts with}} a warning saying [...] "no men were harmed {{in the making of}} this video". In the opening, it shows Aguilera playing 1980's {{computer}} games on her computer when she gets an incoming message from an occult fortune teller. Opening the message, she asks [...] "Hey Oranum, what's my week look like?" [...] to which the occult fortune teller responds [...] "You're gonna have a killer week!". Aguilera coyly smiles to the camera and images are shown of Aguilera writhing around seductively on a bed and eating cereal whilst on the couch watching cartoons. In the clip, Aguilera plays a killer who kills men after seducing them. She goes on a ride with the first man and seduces him leading to a make-out session between the two, then after he falls asleep, she blows up his car in electric-pink flames. Next, she goes to a bar and seduces the second man in a bathroom stall, where she bludgeons him to death, leaving spatters of blue paint dripping from the walls. Finally, she seduces a third unlucky suitor (who was foretold by the same occult fortune teller that it was his unlucky day) by inviting him to a motel and then uses a baseball bat to kill him, [...] "showering the room in a mist of red confetti". The video ends with Aguilera washing off the red confetti splattered all over herself while looking in the mirror at her reflection and as the confetti goes <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>drain,</b> shows Aguilera in her trailer eating cereal while changing channels on her television set, settling on [...] "The Lucy Show" [...] before smiling and turning off her television.

2500|$|The saignée (French for [...] "bleed") {{method is}} the {{practice}} of removing ("bleeding off") some of the juice from the must in order to more deeply concentrate the phenolics, colour and flavour the red wine.

For some red winemakers, the juice bleed off is simply poured <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> or used as [...] "topping wine" [...] to fill the ullage (the headspace of barrels and tanks) during storage. Its use in rosé production is sometimes considered an afterthought, as a way to increase cash-flow by producing a second wine to a primary red wine that can be released much sooner and available to market. While many wineries have been able to produce critically acclaimed rosé using the saignée method, its use has provoked criticism from wine personalities such as François Millo, president of the Provence Wine Council (CIVP) who claim that saignée method rosés are “not true rosés" [...] because the bleeding process (which is not pressed with the must) is more of an afterthought.|$|E
