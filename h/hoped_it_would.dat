5|$|In 1931, Himmler {{organised}} an SS {{intelligence service}} which {{became known as}} the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service) under his deputy, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich. This organisation was tasked with locating and arresting communists and other political opponents. Himmler <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> eventually totally replace the existing police system. Himmler also established the beginnings of a parallel economy {{under the auspices of the}} SS Economy and Administration Head Office. This holding company owned housing corporations, factories and publishing houses.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, {{a council}} {{gardening}} scheme created a horticultural landscape {{next to the}} southern end of the M32. The project included planting of red poppies, cornflowers, and marigolds. A spokesman said they <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> enhance the view from the motorway and provide additional habitats for wildlife including bees and butterflies. The gardens were well-received by locals and led to a city-wide project called Meadow Bristol, to grow similar meadows elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its opening, it was the largest mall complex {{developed}} by CBL. In the first year, it was projected that the mall would employee 2,500 employees—instantly making it the largest employer in the city; this was expected to expand to 3,500 with the completion of the second phase. It was <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> generate $80 million in sales. In addition to helping to retain local shoppers who might otherwise travel the 2½ hours southeast to Houston for mall shopping, CBL and city officials expected the mall would draw shoppers from around the Brazos Valley. Before its opening, the city did not have a highly developed retail community. With the planned additions, then College Station city manager North Bardell said it was expected to generate $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, nearly equal to what the city collected in the previous fiscal year from all other sales. It would bring in another $120,000 in property taxes, a half-million in taxes for College Station Independent School District, and $1 million in electric bills. The increase in jobs was seen as good for the community, and the city <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> attract new civic groups to the area. Taking a year longer than originally planned, the expansion was completed in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Having had {{the crown}} {{restored}} to her daughter, Elizabeth immediately proceeded to reward {{those who had}} helped her, giving a castle in Gimes to Blaise Forgách, {{the master of the}} cupbearers, who had mortally wounded Charles. In April, Sigismund was brought to Hungary by his brother Wenceslaus and the queens were pressured into accepting him as Mary's future co-ruler by the Treaty of Győr. Having Charles murdered did not help Elizabeth as much as she <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would,</b> however, as Charles's supporters immediately recognized his son Ladislaus as heir and fled to Zagreb. Bishop Paul pawned church estates in order to collect money for an army against the queens.|$|E

5|$|In August 1922, a {{traveling}} salesman named Jack Eaton {{was arrested for}} allegedly assaulting several young girls. The girls' parents refused to press charges, and Eaton was released. Later, he was captured by a mob, who cut him several times and poured turpentine into his wounds. An investigation found that the Scott County sheriff had willfully delivered Eaton to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office. Though Eaton was a white man, blacks were elated with the removal because they <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{had been}} widely criticised, and even booed, by City fans at {{times during the}} {{previous}} season and Eriksson said that he <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not happen again and that he appreciated why Samaras could have {{found it hard to}} play under those circumstances. Samaras was behind the likes of Valeri Bojinov and Rolando Bianchi in the pecking order and was included in the squad for the first time only on 25 September, when he was selected for a League Cup match against Norwich City. He started the match and scored a last-minute winner to put Manchester City into the quarter-final.|$|E
5|$|The South Circular Road {{was planned}} by the Ministry of Transport {{in the early}} 20th century {{as part of a}} general {{programme}} of traffic improvements across London. In 1903, a proposal for new approach roads was submitted to the Royal Commission on London Traffic, but was rejected. The Road Board was formed in 1910 to address traffic issues, which led to the London Arterial Road Conferences in 1913–14 that revived the earlier plans. Progress was halted because of the war, but resumed in 1920, when it was <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> find work for demobilised soldiers.|$|E

Miek did not tell the Hulk <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> encourage the Hulk to keep destroying. Enraged, the Hulk and No-Name nearly killed Miek.

5|$|Aram Avakian was {{initially}} selected {{to be the}} film's director, but when he continually refused to do a sentimental-type dog story, he was replaced by Leslie H. Martinson. Lillie Hayward and Roberta Hodes wrote the screenplay for the film, adapting several of the short stories from the novel to create a single narrative, and adding in an all-purpose villain. The film was released on June 6, 1962. The studio <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be successful enough {{to be followed by}} a second film and a television series. Though praised by fans and modern reviewers, contemporary critiques felt Terhune's work did not translate well to film and it was considered a low budget, B-movie. It was released to home video in 1995.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, it was {{reported}} that Broadway producer Kevin McCollum had signed a deal two years earlier with Fox to develop some of the movies from its back catalog into musicals for the stage. Two he expressed particular interest in were Mrs. Doubtfire and The Devil Wears Prada. Early in 2017, McCollum announced that in partnership with Fox Stage Productions, he was developing a musical version of The Devil Wears Prada (based on both the movie and the book). Sir Elton John will be composing the score for the project with playwright Paul Rudnick, who had written some early scenes for the screenplay, mostly with Miranda, writing the book and lyrics. McCollum did not say when he expected it to premiere but <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> eventually play on Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Johnson wrote a {{considerable}} part of Irene in 1737 while teaching at Edial Hall School, the academy he had founded in 1735. Johnson spent his evenings {{working on his}} play while ignoring his wife Elizabeth (known as Tetty). This provoked David Garrick, his student, to perform a skit mocking the incidents, although the incidents he portrayed were more than likely his own fabrications. However, the play was written mostly for Mrs. Johnson; she was fond of it and <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a success. Her belief in the play inspired Johnson to finish it and push to have it performed. When Edial Hall failed, Johnson travelled to London and brought the unfinished manuscript with him. In 1737, Johnson tried to submit Irene to Charles Fleetwood, the owner-manager of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, but Fleetwood rejected it {{on the grounds that}} there was no patron and his theatre was catering to other types of performances. Johnson tried in 1741 to have the unperformed play printed, but this too failed. He seems to have continued to revise it over the next several years, since a manuscript notebook contains draft material made not earlier than June 1746.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe was paralysed in {{the second}} half of December. The weather, {{recorded}} as −42°C (–44°F), was a meteorological record. Logistical difficulties and freezing temperatures created technical difficulties until January 1942. In the meantime, the Luftwaffe had virtually vanished from the skies over Moscow, while the Red Air Force, operating from better prepared bases and benefiting from interior lines, grew stronger. On 4 January, the skies cleared. The Luftwaffe was quickly reinforced, as Hitler <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> save the situation. The Kampfgruppen (Bomber Groups) II./KG 4 and II./KG 30 arrived from refitting in Germany, whilst four Transportgruppen (Transport Groups) with a strength of 102 Junkers Ju 52 transports were deployed from Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet 4) to evacuate surrounded army units and improve the supply line to the front-line forces. It was a last minute effort and it worked. The German air arm was to help prevent a total collapse of Army Group Centre. Despite the Soviets' best efforts, the Luftwaffe had contributed enormously to the survival of Army Group Center. Between 17 and 22 December the Luftwaffe destroyed 299 motor vehicles and 23 tanks around Tula, hampering the Red Army's pursuit of the German Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{furniture}} store Haskins, which originated in Shepton Mallet in 1938, has its principal showroom in the High Street within Haskins Retail Centre, {{which also includes}} {{a number of others}} shops including Aldi supermarket, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Home, Pavers Shoes and an outlet clothing store. Retail jobs in the town increased in number in 2006–7 when a new shopping development, including a large Tesco supermarket, a clothes store and other retailers, was constructed on a site just south of the town centre, which had once been a factory making Clarks shoes and later Doc Martens boots. This development attracted national media attention when protesters occupied the site to try to prevent the felling of an avenue of trees dating back to the 19th century. It has also divided opinion in the town, between those who <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> help to revitalise the town, and others who feared that local traders would be unable to compete, leading to a further decline of Shepton Mallet's High Street. There is also the Mulberry Factory Shop located on Kilver Street, near to the former Mulberry headquarters.|$|E
