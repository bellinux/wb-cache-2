500|$|Inside No. 9, for Pemberton, {{offered the}} [...] "perfect vehicle" [...] for revisiting the {{possibility}} of dialogue-free television. Shearsmith said that, {{at the start of}} the writing process, the pair did not have the intention of scripting the entire episode without dialogue, and that it would be [...] "great" [...] to have ten minutes without it. However, Pemberton said it was easier to write once they had entered the correct [...] "mindset". Once half an episode had been written, Pemberton said, the pair thought [...] "we've just got to keep going". The only dialogue in the episode is right at the end; [...] "what a great thing to get to the end and <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> line of dialogue", Pemberton suggested, comparing the concept to that of the Mel Brooks film Silent Movie.|$|E

500|$|Gary Burton, of Berklee College of Music, {{noted the}} {{consistent}} innovation present throughout the album, stating: [...] "It wasn’t just one tune {{that was a}} breakthrough, it was the whole record. When new jazz styles come along, the first few attempts to do it are usually kind of shaky. Early Charlie Parker records were like this. But with Kind of Blue [...] all sound like they’re fully into it." [...] Along with the Dave Brubeck Quartet's Time Out (1959) and Coltrane's Giant Steps (1960), Kind of Blue has often been recommended by music writers as an introductory jazz album, for similar reasons: the music on both records is very melodic, and the relaxed quality of the songs makes the improvisation easy for listeners to follow, without sacrificing artistry or experimentation. Upon {{the release of the}} 50th anniversary collector's edition of the album, a columnist for All About Jazz stated [...] "Kind of Blue heralded the arrival of a revolutionary new American music, a post-bebop modal jazz structured around simple scales and melodic improvisation. Trumpeter/band leader/composer Miles Davis assembled a sextet of legendary players to create a sublime atmospheric masterpiece. Fifty years after its release, Kind of Blue continues to transport listeners to a realm all its own while inspiring musicians to create to new sounds—from acoustic jazz to post-modern ambient—in every genre imaginable." [...] Later in an interview, renowned hip-hop artist and rapper Q-Tip reaffirmed the album's reputation and influence when discussing the significance of Kind of Blue, stating [...] "It's like the Bible—you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> in your house." [...] The 2014 album Blue by Mostly Other People Do the Killing is a note-for-note reproduction of Kind of Blue.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Cox was {{nominated}} for an American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Female Performer in a TV Series. Although continuously praised for her performance, Cox never received an Emmy Award nomination for her role on Friends during its entire run, although each of her five co-stars did. Both female castmates Lisa Kudrow and Jennifer Aniston remain the show's only main cast members to have won the award, whose multiple nominations Cox especially [...] "had a hard time not taking ... personally", admitting to having been [...] "hurt" [...] by the snub. A number of media outlets cite Cox among several successful television actors whom they believe deserve but are yet to win an Emmy Award. The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' failure to acknowledge Cox prompted Jenna Mullins of E! to ask [...] "if Hollywood has something against honoring a fantastic comedic actress like Cox." [...] In 2014, SheKnows Media published an article explaining five reasons author Rita Loiacono believes Monica is [...] "the best character on Friends", citing her cleanliness, bluntness and role as [...] "the heart of the group", among others. Loiacono enthused that Monica [...] "didn't <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> defining aspect; she had many, {{and they were all}} equally hilarious. Not to mention, her ambition and vulnerability resulted in some of the show's most touching and heartbreaking moments". Additionally, Loiacono dismissed the fact that Cox has never received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance as Monica as [...] "downright criminal". In 2015, HitFix wrote a similar article entitled [...] "5 Reasons Monica Geller is the Best Friends Friend", published in tandem with Cox's 51 birthday. An article in The Birmingham News cited [...] "The One Where it All Began", [...] "", [...] "The One with the Prom Video", [...] "The One with Chandler in a Box", [...] "The One with the Embryos", [...] "The One with All the Thanksgivings", [...] "The One Where Everybody Finds Out", [...] "The One On the Last Night", [...] "The One with the Proposal", [...] "The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding" [...] and [...] "The Last One" [...] among Monica's best episodes; Cox herself acknowledged [...] "The One with the Embryos" [...] as her personal favorite. Meanwhile, BDCwire ranked “The One With The Routine”, [...] "The One With The Cheap Wedding Dress", [...] "The One With Monica’s Boots", [...] "The One With the Jellyfish" [...] and [...] "The One Where Monica Sings" [...] among the character's best.|$|E
2500|$|The studio {{brought in}} screenwriter W. D. Richter, a veteran script doctor (and {{director}} of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai) to extensively rewrite the script, {{as he felt}} that the Wild West and fantasy elements didn’t work together. The screenwriter modernized everything. Almost everything in the original script was discarded except for Lo Pan's story. Richter realized that [...] "what it needed wasn't a rewrite but a complete overhaul. It was a dreadful screenplay. This happens often when scripts are bought and there's no intention that the original writers will stay on". Richter used Rosemary's Baby as his template, presenting [...] "the foreground story in a familiar context [...] rather than San Francisco at the turn-of-the-century, which distances the audience immediately [...] and <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> simple remove, the world underground, you have a much better chance of making direct contact with the audience". He wrote his own draft in 10 weeks. Goldman contacted Richter and suggested that he should not work on the project. Richter told him, [...] "I'm sorry the studio doesn't want to go forward with you guys, but my turning it down {{is not going to get}} you the job. They'll just hire someone else".|$|E

2500|$|At {{least four}} veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) {{individuals}} were witnessed retrieving coconut shells, manipulating them, stacking them, transporting them some distance (up to 20 metres), and then reassembling {{them to use}} as a shelter. The octopuses use coconut shells discarded by humans which have eventually settled in the ocean. They probe their arms down to loosen the mud, then rotate the shells out. After turning the shells so the open side faces upwards, the octopuses blow jets of mud out of the bowl before extending their arms around the shell—or if they have two halves, stacking them first, one inside the other. They then stiffen their legs and move away in a manner which has been called [...] "stilt-walking". The octopuses eventually use the shells as a protective shelter in areas where little other shelter exists. If they <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> half, they simply turn it over and hide underneath. But if they are lucky enough to have retrieved two halves, they assemble them back into the original closed coconut form and sneak inside. This behaviour [...] The authors of the research article claimed this behaviour falls under the definition of tool use because the shells are carried for later use. However, this argument remains contested by a number of other biologists who state that the shells actually provide continuous protection from abundant bottom-dwelling predators in their home range.|$|E

60|$|Then {{a strange}} thing happened, which made it a sad and anxious home to the inmates for many long months, running to nigh on two years. They were fond of riding, and one {{afternoon}} {{when there was no}} visitor or any person to accompany them, the youngest girl said she would have her ride and ordered her horse to be brought from the paddock and saddled. Her elder sister, who was of a somewhat timid disposition, tried to dissuade her from riding out alone on the highway. She replied that she would <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> little gallop--a mile or so--and then come back. Her sister, still anxious, followed her out of the gate and said she would wait there for her return. Half a mile or so from the gate the horse, a high-spirited animal, took fright at something and bolted with its rider. The sister waiting and looking out saw them coming, the horse at a furious pace, the rider clinging for dear life to the pummel of the saddle. It flashed on her mind that unless the horse could be stopped before he came crashing through the gate her sister would be killed, and running out to a distance of thirty yards from the gate she jumped at the horse's head as it came rushing by and succeeded in grasping the reins, and holding fast to them she was dragged to within two or three yards of the gate, when the horse was brought to a standstill, whereupon her grasp relaxed and she fell to the ground in a dead faint.|$|E
