50|$|Molded nylon {{is used in}} hair combs and {{mechanical}} parts such as machine screws, gears and other low- to medium-stress components previously cast in metal. Engineering-grade nylon is processed by <b>extrusion,</b> <b>casting,</b> and injection molding. Type 6,6 Nylon 101 {{is the most common}} commercial grade of nylon, and Nylon 6 is the most common commercial grade of molded nylon. For use in tools such as spudgers, nylon is available in glass-filled variants which increase structural and impact strength and rigidity, and molybdenum disulfide-filled variants which increase lubricity. Its various properties also make it very useful as a material in additive manufacturing; specifically as a filament in consumer and professional grade fused deposition modeling 3D printers. Nylon can be used as the matrix material in composite materials, with reinforcing fibers like glass or carbon fiber; such a composite has a higher density than pure nylon. Such thermoplastic composites (25% to 30% glass fiber) are frequently used in car components next to the engine, such as intake manifolds, where the good heat resistance of such materials makes them feasible competitors to metals.|$|E

40|$|Spatial transformations (ST) {{provide a}} design {{framework}} {{to generate a}} required spatial distribution of electrical and magnetic properties of materials to effect manipulations of electromagnetic waves. To obtain the electromagnetic properties required by these designs, the most common materials approach has involved periodic arrays of metal-containing subwavelength elements. While aspects of ST theory have been confirmed using these structures, they are often disadvantaged by narrowband operation, high losses and difficulties in implementation. An all-dielectric approach involves weaker interactions with applied fields, but may offer more flexibility for practical implementation. This paper investigates manufacturing approaches to produce composite materials that may be conveniently arranged spatially, according to ST-based designs. A key aim is to highlight the limitations and possibilities of various manufacturing approaches, to constrain designs to those that may be achievable.

The typical alloying elements are copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon, tin and zinc.

About 85% of aluminium is used for wrought products, for example rolled plate, foils and <b>extrusions.</b> <b>Cast</b> aluminium alloys yield cost-effective products due to the low melting point, although they generally have lower tensile strengths than wrought alloys.

To address practical applications of microneedles, the ratio of microneedle fracture force to skin insertion force (i. e. margin of safety) was found to be optimal for needles with small tip radius and large wall thickness.

40|$|An uneven {{thickness}} distribution {{can cause}} serious problems in practical applications. In this report the deformation and thickness behavior of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film during transverse stretching in a tenter is discussed. The experiments were {{performed in a}} pilot plant with <b>extrusion,</b> <b>casting,</b> machine direction (MD) stretching, transverse direction (TD) stretching and thermosetting and winding processes. The thickness distribution of the PET film was measured after uniaxial orientation (MD stretched) and again after biaxial orientation (TD stretched in the tenter). The thickness behavior during the transverse stretching in the tenter was calculated by a finite element method (FEM), assuming a rigid-plastic or elastic-plastic constitutive law with parameters determined from the tensile stress-strain measurements. The tensile stress-strain tests were performed on MD stretched film in the transverse stretching direction. The FEM analysis was carried out using the measured initial thickness distribution of the uniaxially oriented film (MD stretched). It was estimated from this analysis that the (TD) stretching of the film in the tenter initiated near the tenter clip (edge of film), spread {{to the center of}} the film and then finally moved from the center to the edge of the film under the experimental conditions of this study.

40|$|<b>Cast</b> cure, <b>extrusion</b> <b>cast,</b> {{and paste}} {{extrudable}} explosives {{have not been}} designed for transferring through long tortuous paths or into fine three dimensional shapes. To allow the crystalline explosive to flow a lubricating fluid is required. The energetic liquid ethane trinitrate (TMETN) {{was used as the}} lubricant to maximize the explosive energy. TMETN is a liquid nitrate ester which requires stabilization with conventional free radical stabilizers such as 2 - nitrodiphenylamine, methyl-nitroanaline, or ethyl centrylite. Since these injection moldable explosives are expected to cure in place, a polyesterurethane binder based on polymeric isocyanate of hexamethylene diisocyanate and polycaprolactone polyols is dissolved in TMETN. The solubility of the polymer precursors in TMETN also reduces the energetic liquids sensitivity. The latent cure catalyst Dabco T- 131 was used to minimize shrinkage associated with thermal expansion, reduce cost associated with oven cures, to give 4 - 6 hour potlife and overnight cure to handling strength. The product RX- 08 -HD is a new, low-viscosity, injection moldable explosive that can be extruded into complex, void-free shapes.

That has significant potential in devices for diagnostics, healthcare monitoring and drug delivery by mechanically perforating the outer skin layer and allowing for transdermal drug absorption or fluid sampling. These processing techniques incorporate one or more technologies that enable the precise machining, <b>extrusion,</b> <b>casting,</b> and/or forming of from one to an array or grid of microneedles. Evolving microneedle systems will be well positioned to address a significant segment of the large –molecule biological drugs expected to emerge from the convergence of automated discovery and genome mapping. To overcome the problems of oral route skin has been extensively studied as an alternative route of drug delivery. Skin is a large and easily accessible organ that can be readily used to administer drugs into the blood capillaries lying just tens of microns beneath the skin's surface. Despite the advantages offered by skin for drug delivery, clinical drug delivery through the skin is severely limited by the presence of the top most layers of dead cells called the stratum corneum. This layer is just 10 - 20 µm in depth, but is the rate-limiting barrier and only allows low molecular weight molecules with moderate oil and water solubility to diffuse through. This in turn restricts the drugs that can be delivered via the skin into a very narrow range. As a result, presently only thirteen active molecules are approved for delivery through the skin by the Food and Drug Administration...|$|E

40|$|A {{blend of}} two {{polypropylene}} resins, different in molecular structure, one with linear chains {{and the other}} with long chain branches, was investigated to develop microporous membranes through melt <b>extrusion</b> (<b>cast</b> film process) followed by film stretching. The branched component significantly affected the row-nucleated lamellar crystalline structure in the precursor films. The arrangement and orientation of the crystalline and amorphous phases were examined by wide angle X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy methods. It was found that blending of a small amount of a long chain branched polypropylene improved the orientation of the both crystalline and amorphous phases in the precursor films. Annealing, followed by cold and hot stretching were consequently employed to generate and enlarge pores in the films as a result of lamellae separation. SEM micrographs of the surface of the membranes obtained from the blend revealed elongated thin fibrils and a large number of lamellae. The lamellae thickness for the blend was much shorter in comparison to that of the linear PP precursor film.
