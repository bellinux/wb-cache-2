5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{took the}} {{position}} that as the Germans had reported nondiscrimination to the IOC, and the IOC had accepted that report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that with the Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this issue that as only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it would <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{painted with}} small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed {{little time for}} {{reworking}} and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> discerned today.|$|E

5|$|The divine power seems {{originally}} to {{have designed}} Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities {{in their natural}} characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, {{and at the same}} time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there can <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.|$|E
5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case. If, then, we are to give any relief in this case, it is by a revision of {{the opinion of the}} Court, given {{in the course of a}} criminal trial, and thus asserting a right to control its proceedings, and take from them the conclusive effect which the law intended to give them. If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.|$|E
5|$|During {{the many}} {{changes in the}} {{operational}} plans for Fall Gelb the idea of leaving the Fortress Holland alone, just as the Dutch hoped for, was at times considered. The first version of 19 October 1939 suggested {{the possibility of a}} full occupation if conditions were favourable. In the version of 29 October it was proposed to limit the transgression to a line south of Venlo. In the Holland-Weisung (Holland Directive) of 15 November it was decided to conquer the entire south, but in the north to advance no further than the Grebbe Line, and to occupy the Frisian Isles. Hermann Göring insisted on a full conquest as he needed the Dutch airfields against Britain; also he was afraid the Entente might reinforce Fortress Holland after a partial defeat and use the airfields to bomb German cities and troops. Another rationale for complete conquest was that as the fall of France itself could <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> taken for granted, it was for political reasons seen as desirable to obtain a Dutch capitulation, because a defeat might well bring less hostile governments to power in Britain and France. A swift defeat would also free troops for other front sectors.|$|E

25|$|The summit plateau, {{about a mile}} across, sends two narrow eastern ridges to {{the north}} and south of Greenburn Bottom. The former leads to Steel Fell, while the {{southern}} spur passes over Gibson Knott before ending at Helm Crag. Southwest from Calf Crag the ground rises over rocky terrain to Sergeant Man and High Raise, although this could <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> termed a ridge.|$|E
25|$|Though the Mediterranean can <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> {{visible from}} the summit of Monte Rosa because of {{intervening}} mountains, the view to the south extends to the Apennines, the mountains of Corsica and the Maritime Alps. On the north side the view extends to the Jura and further to the Vosges, the Swiss Plateau being mostly hidden by the high range of the Bernese Alps.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} boundary {{is formed}} by Scale Beck and its tributary Black Beck. Mellbreak has a third much lower top overlooking this steep sided valley, Scale Kott (1,109ft). At {{the head of}} Black Beck is the connection to Starling Dodd, running south west from Scale Knott. This could <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> considered a ridge in walking terms, since it begins {{at the foot of}} an 800ft scree slope on the northern flank of Starling Dodd.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} murders {{that took place}} in the East End of London from August to November 1888 was blamed on an {{unidentified}} assailant who acquired the nickname Jack the Ripper. Since that time, the identity of the killer or killers has been hotly debated, and over one hundred Jack the Ripper suspects have been named. Though many theories have been advanced, experts find none widely persuasive, and some can <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> taken seriously at all.|$|E
25|$|The LBK did {{not begin}} with this range and only reached it {{toward the end of}} its time. It began in regions of densest {{occupation}} on the middle Danube (Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary) and spread over about 1,500km along the rivers in 360 years. The rate of expansion was therefore about 4km per year, which can <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> called an invasion or a wave by the standard of current events, but over archaeological time seems especially rapid.|$|E
25|$|The crew never {{realized}} {{the severity of}} the fire. The fire was already too severe and started to degrade the structural integrity of the lift wing. This caused the crew to <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> able to control the aircraft. The crew had to apply maximum aileron trim setting due to the reduction of the stiffness of the wing. The left wing then failed upwards, causing the aircraft to roll through 90 degree and crash, subsequently bursting into flames and killing everyone on board.|$|E

25|$|The {{first great}} English {{translation}} was the Wycliffe Bible (c. 1382), which showed {{the weaknesses of}} an underdeveloped English prose. Only {{at the end of}} the 15th century did the great age of English prose translation begin with Thomas Malory's Le Morte Darthur—an adaptation of Arthurian romances so free that it can, in fact, <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> called a true translation. The first great Tudor translations are, accordingly, the Tyndale New Testament (1525), which influenced the Authorized Version (1611), and Lord Berners' version of Jean Froissart's Chronicles (1523–25).|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Carl F.

However, Essig labeled these newer products as drugs of addiction, like barbiturates, whose habit-forming qualities were more widely known. He mentioned a 90-day study of chlordiazepoxide, which {{concluded that the}} automobile accident rate among 68 users was 10 times higher than normal. Participants' daily dosage ranged from 5 to 100 milligrams.|$|E
