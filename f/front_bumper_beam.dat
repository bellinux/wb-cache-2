40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} behavior of three selected steel materials which {{are considered to}} be the bulk material of <b>front</b> most <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> of a vehicle that is suddenly loaded in the quasi-static range. Thirty-six constant strain rate uniaxial tension tests were performed. The test was performed on a HUALONG electro-hydraulic universal testing machine at four strain rates (3. 33 × 10 - 3, 3. 33 × 10 - 2, 3. 33 × 10 - 1, 3. 33 s- 1). The FEM which is ABAQUS/CAE is used to simulate the bumper subsystem using the three selected steel. The outcome shows that ultimate tensile strength (UTS) increase with an increase in strain rate and high alloy steel (HAS) material has the maximum mean UTS. The FEM in the post -processing stage gives the minimum displacement and maximum strain energy for HAS material when compared to the other two materials. Finally, from both experimental and ABAQUS explicit analysis the result shows HAS material is better suit for the <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> application...|$|R

40|$|Bumper {{is divided}} in two types, they are <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> and rear bumper. Main {{function}} {{both of them}} are for absorbing impact by reducing damage and to the potential for bodily injury during an accident. Rear car bumper system has three main components. They are the fascia, energy absorber and <b>bumper</b> <b>beam.</b> The fascia is the outer cover in this system. It is attaches to the quarter panels and rear end panel of the system. The energy absorber attaches to the <b>bumper</b> <b>beam.</b> The <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> is mounted directly to the vehicle body. These components were reviewed for differences in shape and construction prior to being assembled to the vehicles. For this project, rear bumper of PROTON Persona car was chosen to be benchmarking. Then, the new rear bumper was design by using SOLIDWORK Software in dimensional of PROTON Persona car. By using FEA tools that is ALGOR software, the new design was analyzed at three different parts and constant force.

40|$|The <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> {{today is}} {{generally}} {{made of steel}} via stamping. The structural and Complexity potential of such parts is very high but investments and variable costs are significant. A process offering an economic and flexible alternative is roll forming. In this paper, a simulation {{has been done in}} order to compare between roll forming and stamping <b>bumper</b> <b>beam.</b> CAD softwares have been used for the simulation and analysis which are Solidwork 2005 and finite element analysis software Algor version 21. The <b>bumper</b> <b>beams</b> have been design in Solidwork and the Algor has been used to make stress analysis to the <b>bumper</b> <b>beams.</b> The static stress with linear material model has been applied to the both <b>bumper</b> <b>beams</b> that are from stamping and roll forming for comparison. The surface loads that have been applied to the <b>bumper</b> <b>beams</b> are calculated from the velocity of Gen- 2 car at 80 km/h to 120 km/h. From the analysis the maximum stress for stamping <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> is 282. 82 MPa and 243. 29 MPa for roll forming <b>bumper</b> <b>beam.</b> After that, the analysis about costs to produce each <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> has been done. The costs that have been considered for this thesis are costs from man, machines and materials.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> {{inner plate}} was {{researched}} based on contrastive {{analysis of the}} crashworthiness considering using 22 MnB 5, a typical hot forming AHSS (Advanced High Strength Steel) and DP 590, a kind of general high strength steel. In this paper, we contrasted energy absorption, section force, and maximum displacement of the two different <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> systems in low-speed collision. The analysis shows the <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> inner plate using hot forming AHSS can improve the crashworthiness of automobiles {{and make it more}} balanced and reasonable to transfer collision energy and force. As a result, the maximum displacement of the <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> system decreases and other parts such as front side rails can be safer. Thus, using hot forming AHSS in designing a <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> inner plate can improve the passive safety of automobiles...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bumper</b> <b>beam</b> {{absorbs the}} {{accidental}} kinetic energy by deflection in low-speed impact and by deformation in high-speed impact. The safety regulations "low-, and high-speed, and pedestrian impacts" along with new environmental restrictions "end-of-life vehicles" increased the complexity level of bumper system design. The new bumper design must be {{flexible enough to}} reduce the passenger and occupant injury and stay intact in low-speed impact besides being stiff enough to dissipate the kinetic energy in highspeed impact. The reinforcement beam plays {{a vital role in}} safety and it must be validated through finite-element analysis (FEA) and experimental tests before mass production. The careful design and analysis of <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> effective parameters can optimize the strength, reduce the weight, and increase the possibility of utilizing biodegradable and recyclable materials to reduce the environmental pollution. Developing the correct design and analysis procedures prevents design re-modification. On the other hand, analysis of the most effective parameters conducive to high <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> strength increases the efficiency of product development. Cross section, longitudinal curvature, fixing method, rib thickness, and strength are some of the significant design parameters in <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> production. This study critically reviews the related literature on bumper design {{to come up with the}} optimal <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> design process. It particularly focuses on the effective parameters in the design of <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> and their most suitable values or ranges of values. The results can help designers and researchers in performing functional analysis of the <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> determinant variables. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
