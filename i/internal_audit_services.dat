Results suggest that internal audit outsourcing is largely adopted for non-financial reasons such as lack of technological know-how and service quality rather than financial reasons. Deficiencies of current governance arrangements concerning internal audit outsourcing include (1) a lack of audit committee involvement in outsourcing processes, particularly in co-sourcing entities, and (2) inadequate segregation of duties whereby the same senior management is involved in key arrangements including selection, approval, negotiation and evaluation of contractual performance. <br /...|$|E

The outsourcing of these Internal Audit Function (IAC) is advantageous to both the audit firm and the audit client. But, {{there are a number of}} problems envisaged and the major one is impairment of Auditors independence. This study is an empirical one that considers Audit Independence and Internal Audit outsourcing. The paper looks at the reason for outsourcing and the benefits and problems of outsourcing the IAF. A five-point Likert scale was prepared and sent out to the public testing their perception of the effect of internal audit outsourcing on auditors ’ independence. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique was used to analyze responses from the questionnaire. Results from this analysis show that there is significant different in the perception of auditors independence when they perform full IAF, partial IAF, another audit firm performs the IAF, a separate department within the same audit firm performs the IAF. This result indicates that auditors will not be perceived to be independent if they provide <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> to organizations. But, since this practice is already in existence in other parts of the world, we feel that it will definitely be practiced in Nigeria. It was therefore recommended that when taking up this responsibility, the external auditor should not act or appear to act as a member of management or as an employee of the client and external auditors should ensur...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{approaches}} {{to measure the}} performance of the internal audit function. Based upon three proposed dimensions of formal internal audit performance - material performance, cost and risk - it uses competence research methodology to characterize and structure internal audit competence as the prerequisite for material performance that can be measured by instruments of service quality measurement. A second approach to measure formal internal audit performance is taken by linking the other two dimensions in the context of make or buy decisions, where activity-based costing can be used to analyze <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> and cluster this service portfolio according to transaction costs or risks associated with them. Whereas the first approach uses management's expectation as a benchmark for material performance and allows for deeper analysis of deviations between the expected and the actual performance, the second approach uses the comparison of actual costs with costs of outsourcing solutions adjusted for the specific risks incurred. Both approaches are subject to further inquiry as their validity for practical and theoretical problems has not yet been evaluated.

It examines the extent of outsourcing, the rationales for outsourcing, the preferred external service provider(s) for an outsourced {{internal audit}} function (IAF), {{as well as the}} status of outsourced IAFs. Data were gathered using questionnaires to interview the heads of IAFs, namely chief audit executives (CAEs), and the users of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>services,</b> namely the chairpersons of the audit committees (CACs), as well as the accounting officers (AOs) of national government departments in South Africa. The findings indicate that the respondents preferred in-house IAFs to outsourced IAFs, because of the perceived commitment to governance by in-house IAFs. However, {{due to a lack of}} technical expertise and a shortage of competent internal auditors, the IAF is often outsourced to external audit service providers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide {{empirical}} evidence relevant to perceptions of internal auditor independence. Specifically, this study investigates how the auditor practitioners (both internal and external auditors) perceive the importance of five selected factors that characterize the organizational settings of an <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> department. Role theory is the frame of reference used to develop the conceptual model for this study in which the judgment of internal auditor independence is viewed as the role perception of internal auditors. A modified version of the Brunswik's lens model was developed to provide "paramorphic" representation of judgment of independence. The research methodology of this study is based upon a laboratory experiment in which a replicated factorial design was used to elicit the subjects' judgments of independence. The data collected from this experiment were analyzed by three statistical methods: conjoint measurement, multiple regression, and cluster analysis. The major findings follow. First, the five selected factors were not perceived as equally important by the subjects. In general, internal auditor's scope of <b>audit.</b> scope o^ <b>service,</b> and reporting level were perceived as more important than adequacy of organizational support. and formalization of audit policies. Second, the two groups of auditors disagree, significantly, on the relative importance of scope of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>service.</b> Third, while large individual differences existed on the relative importance of the five selected factors, the degree of judgment consensus, in general, is high within each auditor group. Fourth, the internal auditor's perceived role conflict and role ambiguity were inversely related to his perceived level of professional autonomy. Finally, the internal auditors' judgments were not notably affected by the perceptions of their own organizational environment. However, as evidenced by the different types of experienced role conflict and ambiguity, the nature of these auditors' environment varied considerably, Given the above findings, the following implications are suggested: First, the organizational settings are critical of internal auditor independence. Improperly structured settings not only affect the perceived independence but also are detrimental to professional autonomy — de facto independence. Second, rule making bodies should provide more explicit guidelines concerning <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> independence evaluation, particularly, in the area of scope of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>service.</b> Third, while the auditor's reporting level is an important factor to independence, it should not be the only consideration.
