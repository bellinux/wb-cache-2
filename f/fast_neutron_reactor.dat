25|$|The PRC's first commercial-scale, 800 MWe, <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactor,</b> to be {{situated}} near Sanming in Fujian province {{will be a}} SFR. In 2009 {{an agreement}} was signed that would entail the Russian BN-800 reactor design {{to be sold to}} the PRC once it is completed, this would be the first time commercial-scale fast neutron reactors have ever been exported. The BN-800 reactor became operational in 2014.|$|E

25|$|Some transuranium {{elements}} such as plutonium, neptunium and americium can form volatile fluorides, but these compounds are not stable when the fluorine partial pressure is decreased. Most of the plutonium {{and some of the}} uranium will initially remain in ash which drops {{to the bottom of the}} flame fluorinator. The plutonium-uranium ratio in the ash may even approximate the composition needed for <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactor</b> fuel. Further fluorination of the ash can remove all the uranium, neptunium, and plutonium as volatile fluorides; however, some other minor actinides may not form volatile fluorides and instead remain with the alkaline fission products. Some noble metals may not form fluorides at all, but remain in metallic form; however ruthenium hexafluoride is relatively stable and volatile.|$|E
500|$|Neptunium is fissionable, {{and could}} {{theoretically}} {{be used as}} fuel in a <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactor</b> or a nuclear weapon, with {{a critical mass of}} around 60 kilograms. In 1992, the U.S. Department of Energy declassified the statement that neptunium-237 [...] "can be used for a nuclear explosive device". It is not believed that an actual weapon has ever been constructed using neptunium. As of 2009, the world production of neptunium-237 by commercial power reactors was over 1000 critical masses a year, but to extract the isotope from irradiated fuel elements would be a major industrial undertaking.|$|E

50|$|China {{wants to}} {{maximize}} self-reliance on nuclear reactor technology manufacturing and design although international cooperation and technology transfer are also encouraged. Advanced pressurized water reactors {{such as the}} Hualong One and the AP1000 are the mainstream technology in the near future. By mid-century <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactors</b> are seen as the main technology. More long-term plans for future capacity are 120-150 GW by 2030. <b>Fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactors</b> are planned to contribute 1400 GW by 2100.|$|R
500|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} from normal light water {{reactors}} contains plutonium, {{but it is}} a mixture of plutonium-242, 240, 239 and 238. The mixture is not sufficiently enriched for efficient nuclear weapons, but can be used once as MOX fuel. Accidental neutron capture causes the amount of plutonium-242 and 240 to grow each time the plutonium is irradiated in a reactor with low-speed [...] "thermal" [...] neutrons, so that after the second cycle, the plutonium can only be consumed by <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactors.</b> If <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactors</b> are not available (the normal case), excess plutonium is usually discarded, and forms the longest-lived component of nuclear waste. The desire to consume this plutonium and other transuranic fuels and reduce the radiotoxicity of the waste is the usual reason nuclear engineers give to make <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactors.</b>|$|R

50|$|Enrico Fermi {{described}} an alternative solution: Consume all actinides in <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactors,</b> leaving only fission products, which require special custody {{for less than}} 300 years. This requires continuous fuel reprocessing. PUREX separates plutonium and uranium, but leaves other actinides with fission products, thereby not addressing the long-term custody problem. Pyroelectric refining, as perfected at EBR-II, separates essentially all actinides from fission products. U.S. DOE Research on pyroelectric refining and <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactors</b> was stopped in 1994.|$|R

50|$|Fast neutron {{reactors}} use {{fast fission}} to produce energy, unlike most nuclear reactors. In a conventional reactor, a moderator {{is needed to}} slow down the neutrons so that {{they are more likely to}} fission atoms. A <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactor</b> uses fast neutrons, so it does not use a moderator. Moderators may absorb a lot of neutrons in a thermal reactor, and fast fission produces a higher average number of neutrons per fission, so fast reactors have better neutron economy making a plutonium breeder reactor possible. However, a <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>reactor</b> must use relatively highly enriched uranium or plutonium so that the neutrons have a better chance of fissioning atoms.|$|E

50|$|The Soviet BN-600 is sodium cooled. The BN-350 and U.S. EBR-II {{nuclear power}} plants were sodium cooled. EBR-I used a liquid metal alloy, NaK, for cooling. NaK is liquid at room temperature.
