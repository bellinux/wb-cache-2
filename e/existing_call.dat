In this paper, we present a call admission control protocol for cellular wireless networks. Our protocol depends on degrading the <b>existing</b> <b>calls</b> by reducing the bandwidth allocated to them in order to admit “important ” calls. Our protocol assign priorities for the incoming calls, and in the same time assign priorities to the <b>existing</b> <b>calls,</b> both admitted calls are admitted according to their priorities and the <b>existing</b> <b>calls</b> are degraded according to their priorities. We show simulation results for the relation between network utilization, call-blocking probability, and average assigned bandwidth during the life of the call.

40|$|Abstract—It is {{well known}} that power control can help to improve {{spectrum}} utilization in cellular wireless systems. However, many existing distributed power control algorithms do not work well without an effective connection admission control (CAC) mechanism, because they could diverge and result in dropping <b>existing</b> <b>calls</b> when an infeasible call is admitted. In this work, based on a system parameter defined as the discriminant, we propose two distributed CAC algorithms for a power-controlled system. Under these CAC schemes, an infeasible call is rejected early, and incurs only a small disturbance to <b>existing</b> <b>calls,</b> while a feasible call is admitted and the system converges to the Pareto optimal power assignment. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of our algorithms.

50|$|Implementing tail call {{elimination}} {{only for}} tail recursion, {{rather than for}} all tail calls, is something significantly easier. For example, in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), tail-recursive calls can be eliminated (as this reuses the <b>existing</b> <b>call</b> stack), but general tail calls cannot be (as this changes the call stack). As a result, functional languages such as Scala that target the JVM can efficiently implement direct tail recursion, but not mutual tail recursion.|$|E

5000|$|The station began {{broadcasting}} July 11, 1948 as WPJB, {{owned by}} The Providence Journal. [...] WPJB was initially {{one of the}} few FM stations to not be co-owned with an AM station, but in 1951 the Journal purchased WFCI (1420 AM) and changed its call letters to WPJB; this resulted in the FM station changing to WPJB-FM. [...] The Journal would shut down WPJB on October 9, 1954 after purchasing WEAN (790 AM; now WPRV) from General Teleradio; as WEAN did not operate an FM station, WPJB-FM remained on the air with classical music, though both stations retained their <b>existing</b> <b>call</b> letters.

50|$|This {{system of}} allocating call signs was for AM radio {{stations}} only, {{the very few}} FM radio stations that were operating had 3 letters in the cal lsign, the first number remained the same. Radio stations that were originally on AM but began broadcasting on FM often kept the AM call sign name or an additional letter {{was added to the}} <b>existing</b> <b>call</b> sign name. Some examples are 2ZM in Wellington became 2ZZM (but at this point branded as ZMFM) and 1XX in Whakatane became 1XXX but remained branded as One Double X. Call signs for these stations were often an abbreviation of the stations brand name. The FM call signs assigned to Concert FM usually followed the format of the area number, the first letter of the city or region and then the letters CP (Concert Programme), for example 1ACP in Auckland and 4DCP in Dunedin. National Radio was not broadcasting on FM when stations were allocated call signs so no call signs were ever allocated to National Radio's FM frequencies.|$|E

50|$|Environmental factors {{play a role}} in {{communication}} by affecting the frequency of the signal and how far the signal can travel and still be audible to communicate the desired message. Since the pygmy marmoset is often found in the rain forest, plant life, and the humid atmosphere, add to the normal absorption and scattering of sound. Because low frequency calls are affected less by the disturbances than their high frequency counterparts, they are used for communication across longer distances. The pygmy marmoset changes the characteristics of its calls when its social environment is changed. Adult marmosets will show modifications in the structure of their calls which mimic that of their group members. In addition to changes of <b>existing</b> <b>calls,</b> novel calls may be heard from marmosets after pairing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As Scala gains popularity, {{there is}} growing {{interest}} in pro-gramming tools for it. Such tools often require call graphs. However, call graph construction algorithms in the literature do not handle Scala fea-tures, such as traits and abstract type members. Applying <b>existing</b> <b>call</b> graph construction algorithms to the JVM bytecodes generated by the Scala compiler produces very imprecise results due to type information being lost during compilation. We adapt <b>existing</b> <b>call</b> graph construc-tion algorithms, Name-Based Resolution (RA) and Rapid Type Analysis (RTA), for Scala, and present a formalization based on Featherweight Scala. We evaluate our algorithms on a collection of Scala programs. Our results show that careful handling of complex Scala constructs greatly helps precision and that our most precise analysis generates call graphs with 1. 1 - 3. 7 times fewer nodes and 1. 5 - 18. 7 times fewer edges than a bytecode-based RTA analysis. ...|$|E
