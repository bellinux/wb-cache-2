5|$|Shannon was {{discharged}} from the RAAF as a squadron leader on 15December 1945. He remained in England and became an executive with Shell and later Cunard. Shannon no longer flew after the war, but <b>did</b> <b>like</b> to drive fast cars. He also {{served as chairman of}} the No.617 Squadron Association, helping to raise funds for the Dambusters memorial at Woodhall Spa near RAF Scampton. His wife Ann died in 1990, and he married Eyke Taylor. On 8April 1993, shortly before a planned fiftieth anniversary reunion of surviving Dambusters, Dave Shannon died at his home in Sydenham, South London, aged seventy. The last of the nine pilots {{who took part in the}} first wave of the dams raid, he was survived by his second wife and his daughter by Ann.|$|E

It was a box office {{disappointment}} on initial release in the US but proved hugely popular in Europe {{and was very}} durable. It led to Brynner signing a three-picture deal with the Mirisches. He made a cameo in Goodbye Again (1961).|$|E

However, he resigned both posts {{at the end}} of 1919 after the Government refused to create a Secretary of State for Air (as it later <b>did).</b> <b>Like</b> many Lloyd George Liberals Seely lost his seat at Ilkeston at the November 1922 General Election.|$|E

25|$|Between 1878 and 1898, European states {{partitioned}} and conquered most of Africa. For 400 years, European {{nations had}} mainly limited their involvement to trading stations on the African coast. Few dared venture inland from the coast; those that <b>did,</b> <b>like</b> the Portuguese, often met defeats {{and had to}} retreat to the coast. Several technological innovations helped to overcome this 400-year pattern. One was the development of repeating rifles, which were easier and quicker to load than muskets. Artillery was being used increasingly. In 1885, Hiram S. Maxim developed the maxim gun, {{the model of the}} modern-day machine gun. European states kept these weapons largely among themselves by refusing to sell these weapons to African leaders.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{there was an}} {{exchange}} between judges and academics in the United Kingdom and United States comparing the process of appeal used in both nations. Although the British judges found the emphasis on written arguments unattractive, they <b>did</b> <b>like</b> the idea of pre-reading; that the court should read the pleadings of counsel, the case being appealed and the judgment from the lower court before delivering their judgment. After a trial in the Court of Appeal, despite the success of this, the idea was quietly scrapped. The court which Lord Denning presided over from 1962 to 1982 was under no pressure and had no inclination to modernise, with liaisons and management handled by clerks with little knowledge. This changed in 1981 with {{the appointment of a}} Registrar, John Adams, an academic and lawyer, who significantly reformed the internal workings of the Court.|$|E

He passed his examinations, and in March 1887, he was posted to Hounslow {{where he was}} {{promoted}} to captain. He was given more public engagements, visited Ireland and Gibraltar, and opened the Hammersmith suspension bridge. Of his private life, a childhood friend of Albert Victor later recalled that it was uneventful: [...] "his brother officers had said {{that they would like to}} make a man of the world of him. Into that world he refused to be initiated." [...] However, letters dated 1885 and 1886 from Albert Victor to his doctor at Aldershot (known only as [...] "Roche") detail that he was taking medicine for 'glete' (gleet), then a term for gonorrhea discharge.|$|E

500|$|Richard Garfield was a {{doctoral}} candidate at University of Pennsylvania {{when he first}} started to design the game. [...] During his free time he worked with local volunteer playtesters to help refine the game. [...] He had been brought on as an adjunct professor at Whitman College in 1991 when Peter Adkison (then CEO of Wizards of the Coast games company) first met with Garfield to discuss Garfield's new game RoboRally. Adkison saw the game as very promising, but decided that Wizards of the Coast lacked the resources to produce it at that point. He <b>did</b> <b>like</b> Garfield's ideas and mentioned {{that he was looking}} for a portable game that could be played in the downtime that frequently occurs at gaming conventions. Garfield returned and presented the general outline of the concept of a trading card game. Adkison immediately saw the potential of this idea and agreed to produce it. [...] Magic: The Gathering underwent a general release on August 5, 1993.|$|E
500|$|... "Heavy Competition" [...] {{was written}} by Ryan Koh and {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham. It was the fifth of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba {{said he did not}} watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." [...] Rainn Wilson said he liked the episode because it demonstrated growth for his character and the relationship between Michael and Dwight; he said [...] "I like the way they let characters grow and change on the show," [...] and said of his character, [...] "It's not the same acolyte ass kissing as season 2". Wilson said the moment Dwight spun around the HarperCollins secretary saying [...] "Spin move", which was included in the script, {{was one of the most}} popular moments of the episode among the writers. Wilson said of filming the move, [...] "We <b>did</b> <b>like</b> five spin moves and once I did a somersault. I thought I was being all nimble and quick, but no. I watch it and it looks like a manatee doing ballet at SeaWorld." ...|$|E

Although Futterman said Will [...] "expertly hits the falsetto notes", she didn't [...] "feel the chemistry" [...] until the final kiss. Benigno, on the other hand, said that the chemistry between them was [...] "palpable", called the cover [...] "pretty great", and gave it a [...] "B+". Roberts praised the [...] "real sex appeal" [...] Morrison brought to the number, but deemed Paltrow's tango rigid. Burns commented that white people ought to be deterred from performing Prince. He called the music [...] "uninteresting and soulless", and was dismayed that the tango was [...] "just white with white people tango dancing".

500|$|In {{his review}} of the album, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times writes: [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>like</b> the driving, {{collective}} muscle of the band, though, very much," [...] but he also describes its aesthetics as [...] "cluttered and gaudy". For PopMatters, Associate Music Editor Justin Cober-Lake writes: [...] "In many ways, it's a supreme accomplishment with difficult technique passages and broad soundscapes; on the other hand, it's a journey that's too long to take." [...] In {{his review of}} Corea's later work The Ultimate Adventure, Will Friedwald of The New York Sun writes: [...] "'To the Stars' was trite, electronic bubblegum music {{that sounded like a}} cheesy video-game soundtrack." [...] Writing in The Times, John Bungey comments that [...] "many of the pieces are straitjacketed into the cosmic concept", concluding his review with: [...] "If you prefer hi-fi to sci-fi, then you will be hoping that Corea leaves the space helmet at home next time." [...] John L. Walters gave the album a negative review in The Guardian, writing that the album [...] "cries out for warning stickers - 'this album contains dangerously high levels of Scientology'", and that it [...] "drags some perfectly fine jazz musicians ... through conceptual purgatory".|$|E
500|$|Jim Bambra of White Dwarf {{reviewed}} the adventure in the magazine's [...] "Open Box" [...] feature {{and gave it}} an overall rating of 5 out of 10, commenting that while presentation of the module was quite good (8/10), {{it seemed to be}} [...] "hastily thrown together". [...] Bambra gave the adventure playability and enjoyment ratings of 5/10, and skill and complexity ratings of 6/10. [...] He felt the adventure was [...] "very mundane" [...] and [...] "lacks any real cohesion". [...] Bambra noted that parts of the adventure were created for tournament play. [...] The tournament section deals with getting into the city, and he felt the rest of the module seemed to be tacked on to that. [...] He <b>did</b> <b>like</b> the mini-campaign included in the adventure, and the ideas included on how to expand on it. [...] However, he felt that any Dungeon Master who used Dwellers of the Forbidden City would have to expend so much effort to make it more than [...] "just a series of encounters," [...] that they were better off [...] "starting from scratch". Bambra concluded that this adventure was [...] "just not worth considering" [...] with all the other better quality modules available from TSR.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} [...] "after {{three months of}} strike-enforced exile, [...] 30 Rock {{generated}} the expectations and excitement normally reserved for a season premiere," [...] also saying that [...] "the show [...] in midseason form."

[...] Webb Mitovich {{went on to say that}} [...] " [...] <b>did</b> <b>like,</b> though — and thought they should have done a lot more with — the [...] "parallels" [...] between the MILF events and the strategizing staff." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that [...] "It's almost as if this was the season opener" [...] and that this episode was [...] "ambitious." [...] Michael N of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a grade of B. Robert Canning of IGN said that [...] "the overall story arc was less than what we had anticipated from this critical favorite making its post-writers-strike return, the episode was still pretty damn funny." [...] Canning also said that this was [...] "an episode that was divided between a less-than-average story and many hilarious moments." [...] Canning criticized how [...] "30 Rock has never really given [...] (the character or the actor) the showcase that he deserves." ...|$|E

500|$|Scott Derrickson {{did not see}} a lookbook for Doctor Strange, instead putting {{together}} his own presentation, with concept art and storyboards by himself and professionals he hired, to sell himself and {{his vision of the}} film to Marvel. In contrast, Marvel shared several different ideas for what Thor: Ragnarok could be with prospective filmmakers, who then went away and developed what they thought the film should be from that. Taika Waititi created a sizzle reel using clips from other films to present his vision based on Marvel's ideas, a practice that Marvel discourages as they [...] "oftentimes can be really terrible". However, Marvel thought Waititi's was [...] "amazing". Derrickson and Waititi were both eventually hired for the films. For Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Joe and Anthony Russo met with the studio four times over two months before they were hired, during which they [...] "kept getting more and more specific about what our vision was", {{putting together}} [...] "reference videos, storyboards, script pages, you name it. We <b>did</b> <b>like</b> a 30-page book that had everything that we’d do with the character, from the theme of the movie to the tone of the film to the fighting style to what we liked about the character and what we didn’t like".

500|$|Following {{the first}} {{minutes of the}} drama, {{reactions}} on Twitter were mixed. Nicole Golden from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5 stars out of 5.0.

[...] She also wrote the concept worked in part because it was new but noted [...] "the format would probably not have the same effect if used in future episodes." [...] Even though Boston Heralds critic Mark Perigard was not a fan of the concept, saying [...] "the Grey's Anatomy event proved how tricky it is for an established show, especially a drama, to pull off a musical episode," [...] he <b>did</b> <b>like</b> several actors's performances. He wrote: [...] "Chandra Wilson and Chyler Leigh (whom I never have anything good to say about) delivered some impressive vocal work.

[...] Lyneka Little of The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "If Glee and ER had a baby it would be tonight’s episode of the medical drama Grey’s Anatomy titled “Song Beneath the Song.”" [...] In his review of the episode Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote [...] "Like Grey's Anatomy as a whole, some parts were unintentionally silly, others were surprisingly powerful, and it was rarely dull, at least." ...|$|E
