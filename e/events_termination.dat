40|$|The role of {{equatorial}} oceanic {{waves on}} the evolution of the 2007 positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) event was evaluated using available observations and output from a quasi-analytical linear wave model. It was found that the 2007 pIOD event was a weak and short-lived event: developed in the mid-summer (July), matured in the early-fall (September), and terminated in the mid-fall (October). The evolution of the 2007 pIOD event was linked to the equatorial wave dynamics. The event development was associated with the generation of upwelling equatorial Kelvin waves (westward current anomalies) generated by easterly wind anomalies. The <b>event</b> <b>termination</b> was associated with the occurrence of eastward zonal current anomalies resulting from a complex interplay between the wind-forced down welling Kelvin waves and the eastern-boundary-reflected Rossby waves. Results from a quasi-analytical linear wave model show that during the event development and maturation, the wind-forced Kelvin waves played a dominant role in generating zonal current anomalies along the equatorial Indian Ocean, while the easternboundary-reflected Rossby waves tended to weaken the wind-forced Kelvin wave signals. During the <b>event</b> <b>termination</b> our model shows that the initiation of anomalous eastward current resulted from the reflected Rossby waves at the eastern boundary. The wind-forced Kelvin waves associated with the seasonal reversal of the monsoon further strengthened the eastward zonal currents generated by the boundary-generated Rossby waves in late-October/early-November. This highlights the importance of the eastern-boundary-reflected Rossby waves on the IOD <b>event</b> <b>termination...</b>|$|R

40|$|Climate-driven Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) {{expansions}} in the geologic record {{provide an}} opportunity to characterize the spatial and temporal scales of OMZ change. Here we investigate OMZ expansion through the global-scale warming event of the most recent deglaciation (18 - 11 ka), an event with clear relevance to understanding modern anthropogenic climate change. Deglacial marine sediment records were compiled to quantify the vertical extent, intensity, surface area and volume impingements of hypoxic waters upon continental margins. By integrating sediment records (183 - 2, 309 meters below sea level; mbsl) containing one or more geochemical, sedimentary or microfossil oxygenation proxies integrated with analyses of eustatic sea level rise, we reconstruct the timing, depth and intensity of seafloor hypoxia. The maximum vertical OMZ extent during the deglaciation was variable by region: Subarctic Pacific (~ 600 - 2, 900 mbsl), California Current (~ 330 - 1, 500 mbsl), Mexico Margin (~ 330 - 830 mbsl), and the Humboldt Current and Equatorial Pacific (~ 110 - 3, 100 mbsl). The timing of OMZ expansion is regionally coherent but not globally synchronous. Subarctic Pacific and California Current continental margins exhibit tight correlation to the oscillations of Northern Hemisphere deglacial <b>events</b> (<b>Termination</b> IA, Bølling-Allerød, Younger Dryas and Termination IB).

40|$|Two {{competing}} <b>events,</b> <b>termination</b> and readthrough (or nonsense suppression), {{can occur}} when a stop codon reaches the A-site of a translating ribosome. Translation termination results in hydrolysis {{of the final}} peptidyl-tRNA bond and release of the completed nascent polypeptide. Alternatively, readthrough, in which the stop codon is erroneously decoded by a suppressor or near cognate transfer RNA (tRNA), results in translation past the stop codon and production of a protein with a C-terminal extension. The relative frequency of termination versus readthrough is determined by parameters such as the stop codon nucleotide context, the activities of termination factors and the abundance of suppressor tRNAs. Using a sensitive and versatile readthrough assay in conjunction with RNA interference technology, we assessed the effects of depleting eukaryotic releases factors 1 and 3 (eRF 1 and eRF 3) on the termination reaction in human cell lines. Consistent with the established role of eRF 1 in triggering peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, we found that depletion of eRF 1 enhances readthrough at all three stop codons in 293 cells and HeLa cells. The role of eRF 3 in eukarytotic translation termination is less well understood as its overexpression {{has been shown to}} have anti-suppressor effects in yeast but not mammalian systems. We found that depletion of eRF 3 has little or no effect on readthrough in 293 cells but does increase readthrough at all three stop codons in HeLa cells. These results support a direct role for eRF 3 in translation termination in higher eukaryotes and also highlight the potential for differences in the abundance or activity of termination factors to modulate the balance of termination to readthrough reactions in a cell-type-specific manner...|$|E

It is shown that the meridional wind movement and its discharging effect increase with increasing El Nino amplitude, while both remain relatively small regardless of La Nina amplitude.

Cyclic anomalies and temporal trends in periodicity from the Lower to the Upper Holocene are extracted by combining Lomb-Scargle Fourier-transformed spectra with bootstrapping. Results were cross-checked by counting events in the time series. Main outcomes are: First, the propensity of the climate system to fluctuations is a region specific property. Many records of adjacent sites reveal a similar change in variability although they belong to different proxy types (e. g., &delta; 18 O, lithic composition). Secondly, at most sites, irreversible change occured in the Mid-Holocene. We suggest that altered ocean circulation together with slightly modified coupling intensity between regional climate subsystems around the 5. 5 kyr BP <b>event</b> (<b>termination</b> of the African Humid Period) {{were responsible for the}} shift. Fluctuations especially intensified along a pan-American corridor. This may have led to an unequal crisis probability for early human civilizations in the Old and New World.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that episodes of inspiratory flow {{limitation}} can be clinically important. We have challenged the hypothesis that patients with the “upper airway resistance syndrome” have more episodes of inspiratory flow limitation, associated with greater swings in pleural pressure and more arousals from sleep than normal subjects. We thus studied eight symptomatic patients with UARS (ESS > 10, AHI < 15) and eight matched asymptomatic subjects. All had overnight polysomnography with recording of pleural pressure and airflow derived from nasal pressure. Events scored visually using nasal pressure were termed flow limitation events and those using both signals “resistive events. ” The patients with UARS had no more episodes of flow limitation or resistive events than the controls. However, pleural pressure swings at resistive <b>event</b> <b>termination</b> were significantly more negative in the patient group (− 15 [IQR 9 – 19]; − 11 [8 – 12] cm H 2 O; p = 0. 02) and the number of cortical arousals associated with resistive events was higher in the patients (median, 10 [5 – 15]; 3 [1 – 9]/h slept; p = 0. 02). This study confirms that patients with UARS have periods of increased upper airway resistance associated with significant sleep fragmentation.

40|$|Drought {{termination}} can {{be associated}} with dramatic transitions from drought to flooding. Greater attention may be given to these newsworthy and memorable <b>events,</b> but drought <b>terminations</b> that proceed gradually also pose challenges for water resource managers. This paper defines drought termination as a distinctive phase of the event. Using observed river flow records for 52 UK catchments, a more systematic and objective approach for detecting drought terminations is demonstrated. The parameters of the approach are informed by a sensitivity analysis that ensures a focus on terminations of multi-season to multi-year droughts. The resulting inventory of 467 drought terminations provides an unprecedented historical perspective on this phenomenon in the UK. Nationally and regionally coherent drought <b>termination</b> <b>events</b> are identifiable, although their characteristics vary both between and within major episodes. Contrasting drought <b>termination</b> <b>events</b> in 1995 – 1998 and 2009 – 2012 are examined in greater depth. The data are also used to assess potential linkages between metrics of drought termination and catchment properties. The duration of drought termination is moderately negatively correlated with elevation (r s [*]=[*] − 0. 47) and catchment average rainfall (r s [*]=[*] − 0. 42), suggesting that wetter catchments in upland areas of the UK tend to experience shorter drought terminations. More urbanized catchments tend to have gradual drought terminations (contrary to expectations of flashy hydrological response in such areas), although this may also reflect the type of catchments typical of lowland England. Significant correlations are found between the duration of the drought development phase and both the duration (r s [*]=[*] − 0. 29) and rate (r s [*]=[*]  0. 28) of drought termination. This suggests that prolonged drought development phases tend to be followed by shorter and more abrupt drought terminations. The inventory helps to place individual events within a long-term context. The drought termination phase in 2009 – 2012 was, at the time, regarded as exceptional in terms of magnitude and spatial footprint, but the Thames river flow record identifies several comparable events before 1930. The chronology could, in due course, provide a basis for exploring the complex drivers, long-term variability, and impacts of drought <b>termination</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
