50|$|In fiber-optic communication, an <b>intramodal</b> <b>dispersion,</b> is a {{category}} of dispersion that occurs within a single mode optical fiber. This dispersion mechanism {{is a result of}} material properties of optical fiber and applies to both single-mode and multi-mode fibers. Two distinct types of <b>intramodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> are: chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion.|$|E
50|$|Dispersion Shifted Fiber {{is a type}} of {{single-mode}} {{optical fiber}} with a core-clad index profile tailored to shift the zero-dispersion wavelength from the natural 1300 nm in silica-glass fibers to the minimum-loss window at 1550 nm. The group velocity or <b>intramodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> which dominates in single-mode fibers includes both material and waveguide dispersion. Waveguide dispersion can be made more negative by changing the index profile and thus be used to offset the fixed material dispersion, shifting or flattening the overall <b>intramodal</b> <b>dispersion.</b> This is advantageous because it allows a communication system to possess both low dispersion and low attenuation. However, when used in wavelength division multiplexing systems, dispersion-shifted fibers can suffer from four-wave mixing which causes intermodulation of the independent signals. As a result, nonzero dispersion shifted fiber is often used.|$|E
40|$|Dispersion {{equalisation}} of {{the modes}} of cylindrically symmetric few-mode optical fibres is investigated using equivalent planar waveguide representations. A numerical analysis based on the Characteristic Matrix Method has identified what {{we believe to be}} the first practical three-mode fibre with zero intermodal dispersion. This implies that the group velocities of each of the fibreâ€™s three linearly polarized modes are equivalent. Dispersion equalisation is also confirmed in a power-law profile, as well as a novel two-mode fibre which operates within the third telecommunications windows. These few-mode fibres could potentially be used for long-haul telecommunications data links. In the case where the modes are not distinguished and are equally excited, the few-mode fibres could be used as larger core-radius alternatives to traditional single-mode fibres. If the modes are distinguished, each mode could in theory be considered an independent data channel. All modal data channels would be equivalent for such dispersion-free few-mode fibres, notwithstanding differences in <b>intramodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> and mode crosstalk. Nicolas Riesen and John D.
