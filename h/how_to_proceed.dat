5|$|Five SAO Krajina police {{officers}} were prosecuted by Knin District Court in 1992 {{for the murder of}} the Rakić family. The investigation was spurred on by requests from relatives of the victims, who threatened the RSK authorities that they would notify the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) unless the RSK authorities continued searching, which led Đuro Kresović, president of Knin District Court to write to the Minister of the Interior of the RSK asking for instructions on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed,</b> stating that any attempt to retrieve the bodies of the Rakić family would uncover numerous other bodies in the Golubnjača Pit. He requested instructions on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> with the investigation and what to do if the UNPROFOR found out about the bodies in the pit. Even though the RSK investigation was completed, trial of those suspected of involvement in the murders did not begin before 2010 in Belgrade. The trial and the appeals process were concluded in 2013, resulting in four convictions: Čedo Budisavljević was sentenced to thirteen years in prison, while Mirko Malinović, Milan Bogunović and Bogdan Gruičić were sentenced to twelve, ten, and eight years in prison respectively.|$|E

Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate. Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction. E/R Partners spent $50 million securing One Meridian Plaza and spent up to $500,000 a month on security guards, utilities and inspections by engineers as the building stood empty.|$|E

After Savimbi's death, the government {{came to a}} crossroads over <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed.</b> After initially indicating the counter-insurgency might continue, the government announced it would halt all military operations on 13 March. Military commanders for UNITA and the MPLA met in Cassamba and agreed to a cease-fire. However, Carlos Morgado, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said the UNITA's Portugal wing had been under the impression General Kamorteiro, the UNITA general who agreed to the ceasefire, had been captured {{more than a week}} earlier. Morgado did say that he had not heard from Angola since Savimbi's death.

5|$|Riley Abel (Yaani King) is Ellie's best friend. Appearing in the Left Behind {{additional}} content, Ellie and Riley {{became friends}} at the military boarding school where Ellie was sent when she turned thirteen, where at some point Riley left to join the Fireflies. At the start of Left Behind, she returns after a long absence, and ambushes Ellie in her room. The two go to their old hangout in an abandoned shopping mall, where they fight over Riley's revelation that she will soon be posted to another city. Ellie eventually supports her decision, but as the two dance together before parting, Ellie becomes tearful, and begs Riley not to leave. Without hesitation, Riley rips her dog tags off, deciding to choose Ellie instead of the Fireflies. Moved, Ellie impulsively kisses her, which she returns.

5|$|The British {{capture of}} Martinique in 1809 marked a {{critical}} point for the French on Guadeloupe; blockaded on all sides by the naval forces of the British, the French civilians and soldiers were reduced to near starvation. In January 1810, the British initiated an invasion of Guadeloupe; Sir Alexander Cochrane's naval force landed 11,000 British troops {{under the command of}} Lieutenant General George Beckwith at the so-called Capesterre, or {{the eastern side of the}} islands. Attacked on three sides at the end of January, Ernouff's force mounted a spirited, although short, defense and capitulated on 6February 1810, after which he was transported to Britain. He was repatriated to France in a prisoner exchange in 1811. Irritated at the loss of Guadeloupe to the British, Napoleon accused him of abuse of power, embezzlement, and treason. Ernouf spent 23months in captivity in France while the courts debated <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed.</b>|$|E

5|$|Development of Silent Hill {{started in}} September 1996. The game {{was created by}} Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce a game that would be {{successful}} in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for Silent Hill. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer Akira Yamaoka, the developers did not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> with the Silent Hill project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of Silent Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill a game that would appeal to the emotions of players instead.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed his idea of what can make for a great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were outweighed by the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E

Once Avellone was able to, he contacted Arkane to offer his help on the narrative. Besides other parts of the narrative, Avellone was responsible for designing the non-player characters and the various missions that would involve these characters. Avellone felt these characters and their missions created dilemmas for the player <b>to</b> determine <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceeding,</b> helping the player to define their version of Morgan as well as expanding on the game's universe. Avellone worked with Arkane on the story from June to about November 2016.|$|R
