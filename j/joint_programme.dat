The aircraft were built under licence in both Belgium and the Netherlands in a <b>joint</b> <b>programme,</b> some using US offshore funding. SABCA and Avions Fairey built 64 aircraft in Belgium and a further 48 {{were built in the}} Netherlands by Fokker. The Hunters were used by Nos. 1, 3 and 9 Wings but did not serve for long; the aircraft with 1 Wing were replaced in 1958 by the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck, and most were scrapped afterwards.|$|E

40|$|According to the {{strategy}} for Nordic co-operation {{in education and}} research the Nordic countries should remove obstacles for free movement for students and researchers in the Nordic region. One goal with this report has been to identify obstacles for organizing <b>joint</b> <b>programmes</b> on master level. The Nordic Council of Ministers has until now financed, in co-operation with universities, 23 Nordic Master Programmes. Minimum of three higher education institutions develop <b>joint</b> <b>programmes,</b> that will attract both Nordic and non-Nordic students. The report gives {{an overview of the}} legislation in relation to joint degrees in the Nordic countries. It also has recommendations for the Nordic Master Programme and offers separate thematic documents like a template for a joint diploma. The report will hopefully serve as practical guide book for those in the process of planning or building up <b>joint</b> master <b>programmes.</b> Hopefully, the report also makes a contribution to developing other international <b>joint</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
60|$|So far as I can discover, Chinese Constitutionalists {{are doing}} {{the best thing that}} is {{possible}} at the moment, namely, concerting a <b>joint</b> <b>programme,</b> involving the convoking of a Parliament and the cessation of military usurpation. Union is essential, even if it involves sacrifice of cherished beliefs on the part of some. Given a programme upon which all the Constitutionalists are united, they will acquire great weight in public opinion, which is very powerful in China. They may then be able, sooner or later, to offer a high constitutional position to some powerful general, on condition of his ceasing to depend upon mere military force. By this means {{they may be able to}} turn the scales in favour of the man they select, as the student agitation turned the scales in July 1920 in favour of Wu-Pei-Fu against the An Fu party. Such a policy can only be successful if it is combined with vigorous propaganda, both among the civilian population and among the soldiers, and if, as soon as peace is restored, work is found for disbanded soldiers and pay for those who are not disbanded. This raises the financial problem, which is very difficult, because foreign Powers will not lend except in return for some further sacrifice of the remnants of Chinese independence. (For reasons explained in Chap. X., I do not accept the statement by the American consortium bankers that a loan from them would not involve control over China's internal affairs. They may not mean control to be involved, but I am convinced that in fact it would be.) The only way out of this difficulty that I can see is to raise an internal loan by appealing to the patriotism of Chinese merchants. There is plenty of money in China, but, very naturally, rich Chinese will not lend to any of the brigands who now control the Government.|$|E
