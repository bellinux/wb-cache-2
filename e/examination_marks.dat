The student ranked first was then assigned a moderated assessment mark equal to the highest <b>examination</b> <b>mark</b> scored by that group of students, regardless of who scored it, and similarly the student ranked last would receive the lowest <b>examination</b> <b>mark.</b> The rest of the students had their assessment marks moderated between these two values, with the proportional difference between the marks remaining the same (for instance, the gap of 10 between two marks spread over a range of 20% would be halved if the range was further halved to 10%).|$|R

For this investigation the test group was the 1981 -intake of students at the PU for CHE who studied in the hutr. ani ties field of study and completed their studies at the end of 1984. The theoretical background of the investigation was obtained by the study of authoritative literature regarding the cognitive and non-cognitive factors which have an influence on academic achievement. An ex post facto-approach was used for the experimental design. The data used was obtained from the Senior Aptitude Test and the final standard ten examin 8. tion marks of the students concerned as well as their final academic achievement in the HDE-post graduate course. The data has been analysed by means of a computer programme. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the combined and individual influence of the independant variables (Senior Aptitude Test and final standard ten <b>examination</b> <b>mark)</b> on the dependant variable (HDE-achievement). From the results of the investigation it becomes clear that the combined and separate influence of the independant variables on the dependant variable is very low and of no significant practical value for the prediction of academic success. The conclusion can thus not be drawn that the Senior Aptitude Test and final standard ten <b>examination</b> <b>mark</b> are good predictors of academic achievement in a post graduate HDE-course in the humanities field of study. Various factors, cognitive as well as non-cognitive, should be used in combination for the best prediction of academic achievement at tertiary level. Master...|$|R
