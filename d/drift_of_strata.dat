There was something that stirred his imagination deeply in that stealthy, noiseless descent. The obscurity deepened for a time, the last fading star on the horizon vanished, and he felt the cold presence of cloud. Then suddenly the glow beneath assumed distinct outlines, became flames, and the Vaterland ceased to descend and hung observant, and it would seem unobserved, just beneath a <b>drifting</b> <b>stratum</b> <b>of</b> cloud, a thousand feet, perhaps, over the battle below.|$|R

40|$|Underground coal {{extraction}} causes failure and movement <b>of</b> overlying <b>strata,</b> which could also {{result in the}} dislocation of vertical surface boreholes. Investigating the correlation between the dislocation of surface boreholes and the broken <b>of</b> overlying <b>strata</b> is <b>of</b> great significance in deducing the mining-induced dynamic movement <b>of</b> overlying <b>strata,</b> which cannot be seen inside the ‘black box’. Field measurement, laboratory experiment and theoretical analysis were employed to study the mechanism of the mining-induced dislocation of surface boreholes, and its relationship with the movement <b>of</b> overlying <b>strata.</b> Due to different deflection angles <b>of</b> adjacent <b>strata,</b> the horizontal movement <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> varies, and this contributes primarily to the dislocation of borehole wall. As the development <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> movement from the mining level towards surface, the position of borehole dislocation also occurred upwards, and the highest borehole dislocation occurred at the same position <b>of</b> overlying Key <b>Stratum</b> (KS). In other words, when a KS breaks, borehole dislocation will occur and develop from the bottom of this KS until the bottom of an upper KS. These key findings can provide a theoretical basis for deducing the mining-induced movement <b>of</b> overlying <b>strata,</b> determining the KS position and assessing the water conductivity <b>of</b> broken <b>strata...</b>|$|R

40|$|Balanced {{sampling}} is a {{very efficient}} sampling design when the variable of interest is correlated to the auxiliary variables on which the sample is balanced. A procedure to select balanced samples in a stratified population has previously been proposed. Unfortunately, this procedure becomes very slow as the number <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> increases and it even fails to select samples for some large numbers <b>of</b> <b>strata.</b> A new algorithm to select balanced samples in a stratified population is proposed. This new procedure is much faster than the existing one when the number <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> is large. Furthermore, this new procedure {{makes it possible to}} select samples for some large numbers <b>of</b> <b>strata,</b> which was impossible with the existing method. Balanced sampling can then be applied on a highly stratified population when only a few units are selected in each stratum. Finally, this algorithm turns out to be valuable for many applications as, for instance, for the handling of nonrespons...|$|R
