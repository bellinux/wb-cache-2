Millions of desperate refugees from Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and sub-Saharan Africa are overwhelming the Middle East and Europe with needs for safety, food and shelter. Their language skills are not viewed as an imperative in the current chaos and yet they remain significant tools for escaping the poverty and misery of refugee life and obtaining employment in <b>host</b> countries. The <b>author</b> <b>profiles</b> how <b>host</b> EU and Middle Eastern countries have addressed refugeesâ€™ language needs in the past and present. Suggestions are made for possible strategies for addressing language instruction for refugees. Refugees; Language instruction; Middle East; European Union...|$|R

40|$|The task of {{analyzing}} a text {{of interest in}} order to find demographicinformation of an unknown author based on how the text is written,called <b>author</b> <b>profiling,</b> has become a problem of growing interest. <b>Author</b> <b>profiling</b> can for instance be used in crime investigations togain more information about a possible suspect, which could forexample be a potential violent lone actor that reveals an intentionof committing targeted violence. Machine learning algorithms offers an efficient approach to performauthor profiling. Previous work in <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> have mostly usedtraditional machine learning algorithms where features are manuallyextracted, which the algorithms base their prediction on. However,in this thesis we compare two different approaches towards authorprofiling, one where the features are manually extracted using thelearning algorithms Support Vector Machine and Feed-Forward NeuralNetworks and one where the features are learned from raw datausing the learning algorithms Convolutional Neural Networks and LongShort-Term Memory. These learning algorithms were used to predictthe gender, age and native language from a text of an unknown author. Also, to get an understanding of how well <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> works inthe wild, we tested our models on a different domain than they weretrained on. The results showed that in our setting, manually extracted featuresworked better for <b>author</b> <b>profiling.</b> Also, applying learning algorithms toa different domain than they were trained on significantly decreased theperformance. In addition, the results showed that the characteristics ofthe datasets and the chosen hyperparameters for each learning algorithmwere essential for the performance...|$|R

40|$|<b>Author</b> <b>Profiling</b> is {{the task}} of {{predicting}} characteristics of {{the author of a}} text, such as age, gender, personality, native language, etc. This is a task of growing importance due to the potential applications in security, crime detection and marketing, among others. An interesting point is to study the robustness of a classifier when it is trained with a data set and tested with others containing different characteristics. Commonly this is called cross domain experimentation. 							Although different cross domain studies have been done for data sets in English language, for Spanish it has recently begun. In this context, this work presents a study of cross domain classification for the <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> task in Spanish. The experimental results showed that using corpora with different levels of formality we can obtain robust classifiers for the <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> task in Spanish language.

40|$|This paper gives a brief {{description}} on the methods adopted for the task of author-profiling {{as part of the}} competition PAN 2016. <b>Author</b> <b>profiling</b> is the task of predicting the author's age and gender from his/her writing. In this paper, we follow a two-level ensemble approach to tackle the cross-genre <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> task where training documents and testing documents are from different genres. We use the soft-voting approach to build the classification ensemble. To include various feature sets, we first train logistic regression models using the extracted word n-gram, character n-gram, and part-of-speech n-gram features for each genre. We then ensemble single-genre predictive models trained on the blog, social media and Twitter data sources, to build our multi-genre ensemble approach. The experimental results indicate that our approach performs well in both single-genre and cross-genre <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> tasks. status: publishe...|$|R
