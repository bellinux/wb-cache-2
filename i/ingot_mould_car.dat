50|$|In metal casting, a tundish is a broad, open {{container}} {{with one or}} more holes in the bottom.

The tundish allows a reservoir of metal to feed the casting machine while ladles are switched, thus acting as a buffer of hot metal, as well as smoothing out flow, regulating metal feed to the moulds and cleaning the metal. Metallic remains left inside a tundish are known as tundish skulls and need to be removed, typically by mechanical means (scraping, cutting). A casting tundish is lined with refractory bricks specific to the liquid metal which is being cast.|$|R
50|$|A hot top, {{also known}} as a , is a {{specialized}} riser, used to help counteract the formation of pipes when casting ingots. It is essentially a live open riser, with a hot ceramic liner instead of just the mold materials.

40|$|While {{manufacturing}} different {{grades of}} steel in an alloy and special steel plant, it is practically impossible to allocate {{the cost of}} major operational materials such as refractories, electrodes and nipples, <b>ingot</b> <b>moulds</b> etc. to each grade of steel.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{critical}} challenges encountered when modeling a thermo-mechanical problem {{in the context of}} steel casting processes, is to achieve a concurrent and efficient computation of fluid flow (<b>ingot</b> <b>mould</b> filling, nozzle jet in continuous casting) and solid mechanics (stress-strain in solidified regions). This is of crucial importance in industry for the prediction of surface or sub-surface cracks for instance that may initiate in solidified regions during the filling stage of ingot casting, or in the mould region during continuous casting. The current state-of-the-art [15 - 17 - 21] consists in separating the analysis in two distinct stages: fluid flow using CFD codes and stress-strain analysis using structural codes. This induces several drawbacks regarding practical use and computational efficiency. A monolithic formulation, treating the fluid-solid interaction (FSI) may be investigated but is not adapted to the context of solidification, because of huge differences between liquid viscosity and solid consistency. It is then preferable to consider this FSI problem as a weak interaction problem, for which a partitioned formulation is more efficient than a monolithic one. Therefore, a two-step resolution strategy combining fluid flow and solid mechanics has been developed. Liquid flow (natural convection or filling flow), thermal dilatation as well as thermally induced deformation of the solid phase are accounted for...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{capacity}} of alloys (metals) {{is one of}} the crucial thermophysical parameters used for process behaviour prediction in many applications. Heat capacity is an input variable for many thermodynamical (e. g. Thermocalc, Pandat, MTData, …) and kinetic programs (e. g. IDS-Solidification analysis package, …). The dependences of heat capacity on common variables (temperature, pressure, [...] .) are also commonly used as the input data in software packages (e. g. ProCast, Magmasoft, ANSYS Fluent, …) that are applicable in the field of applied research for simulations of technological processes. It follows from the above that the heat capacities of materials, alloys in our case, play a very important role in the field of basic and applied research. Generally speaking, experimental data {{can be found in the}} literature, but corresponding (needed) data for the given alloy can very seldom be found or can differ from the tabulated ones.

Design/methodology/approach: In order to confirm the theoretical assumptions we have performed a series of the laboratory scale experiments (for the filter slenderness ratio SF 1 λ = 1. 67 and SF 2 λ = 8. 36). Findings: The influence of the filter slenderness on the filtration process efficiency has been determined through variations in quantities and surface shares of the non-metallic inclusions in the filtrated steel {{in relation to the}} non-filtered steel. We present also the results of researches on the separating surfaces between the liquid steel and the ceramic filter material, which in form of photos and scanning microscope microanalyses are put together in the publication.

40|$|Trial {{excavations}} from 1998 - 2003 {{showed that}} Birnie (near Elgin) {{was the site}} of an important, long-lived later prehistoric settlement complex and subsequently a medieval village. The later prehistoric site was a local power centre in contact with the Roman world far to the south - as seen most spectacularly in two hoards of Roman silver coins, and a range of other Roman finds. Funding has now been secured for a four-year larger-scale excavation, from 2004 - 2007. The aim each year is to tackle a roundhouse, a medieval building, and one or two other areas. In 2004 the probable medieval building in area P was fully excavated. It was a two-phase structure with very insubstantial foundations, a worn sub-rectangular floor hollow, and a central cooking pit later replaced by an external one. To the north lay an iron-working areas, as yet of unknown date. One roundhouse (area M) was of ring-groove construction, 11. 5 m in diameter, with an internal structural post ring. The wall was probably of wattle panels, with a more solid post-built structure flanking the east-facing double door. It had a central cooking pit surrounded by various other features, with a series of radial chambers or small rooms around the edges.

To the south-west an unsuspected large charcoal-rich spread was uncovered, perhaps another house, but time did not allow further investigation.

40|$|Purpose: One of {{the reasons}} behind the {{interest}} in copper titanium alloys was development of new materials to substitute copper beryllium alloys. The reason for selecting that material for studies {{was that in the}} early stages of decomposition of CuTi 4 alloy a spinodal transformation takes place and ordering processes begin. Proper selection of heat treatment and plastic working conditions provides possibilities to produce very wide range of sets of properties by formation of the required alloy microstructure. Therefore the main objective of the study was to capture the changes in precipitation kinetics, especially in the relations between supersaturation and ageing or between supersaturaion, cold deformation and ageing in connection to the changes in microstructure and functional properties (mainly changes in hardness and electrical conductivity). Design/methodology/approach: Melting of the charge material was conducted in medium-frequency induction furnace, in a graphite crucible. The melted material after bath preparation was poured into a cast iron <b>ingot</b> <b>mould</b> (with graphite grease applied on the inside) of dimensions 35 x 120 x 250 mm. The ingots after casting were peeled. The treated ingots were heated in resistance furnace at 900 ºC for 1. 5 hour and rolled down on a reversible two-high mill. Findings: Decomposition of supersaturated solid solution in that alloy is similar to the alloys produced in laboratory scale. The observed differences in microstructure after supersaturation were related to the presence of undissolved Ti particles and increased segregation of titanium distribution in copper matrix including microareas of individual grains. The mentioned factors influence the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and subsequently the produced wide ranges of functional properties of the alloy. Research limitations/implications: Cold deformation (50 % reduction) of the alloy after supersaturation changes the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and provides possibilities for production of broader sets of functional properties. It is expected that widening of the cold deformation range should result in more complete characteristics of material properties, suitable for the foreseen applications. Similar effects can be expected after application of cold deformation after ageing. Practical implications: The elaborated research results present some utilitarian qualities since they can be used in development of process conditions for industrial scale production of strips from CuTi 4 alloy of defined properties and operating qualities. Originality/value: The mentioned factors influence the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and subsequently the produced wide ranges of functional properties of the Cu-Ti alloys...|$|R
