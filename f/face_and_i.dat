Returning to Star Trek, but appearing {{for the first time in}} Enterprise, was Leland Orser, who played Loomis. The actor had previously appeared in the [...] episode [...] "", as well as the [...] episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who would later become better known for portraying Denny Duquette in medical drama Grey's Anatomy and as The Comedian in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, strongly disliked portraying a Xindi Reptilian in [...] "Carpenter Street". He later explained to Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I had to pay my bills. I knew I'd play some guy saying some stuff. Then I got a call saying I needed to go in for a prosthetic fitting. I remember them dripping goop on my <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had straws sticking out of my nose. I couldn't eat lunch. I was claustrophobic. I'd go home in tears. This was the job that made me want to quit acting." ...|$|E
500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were talking to me about going different routes. I could feel people up in my <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was picking up on bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E

60|$|Then the man spoke {{words of}} hope to the boy, as I could understand, by the {{expression}} on both their <b>faces,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> waited with finger on the trigger of the rifle lest the savages should make one desperate effort to accomplish their cruel work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Marie!" [...] I gasped at length; and at {{that word}} the blood rushed to her <b>face</b> <b>and</b> brow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw her draw in her breath as though to scream.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the subject}} of his religion, Hawke {{previously}} wrote, while attending the 1952 World Christian Youth Conference in India, that [...] "there were all these poverty stricken kids at the gate of this palatial place where we were feeding our <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just had this struck by this enormous sense of irrelevance of religion to the needs of people". He subsequently abandoned his Christian beliefs. By the time he entered politics he was a self-described agnostic. Hawke told Andrew Denton in 2008 that his father's Christian faith had continued to influence his outlook, saying [...] "My father said if you believe in the fatherhood of God you must necessarily believe in the brotherhood of man, it follows necessarily, and even though I left the church and was not religious, that truth remained with me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In many respects, Orville Hungerford, {{known for}} his honesty and industriousness, epitomized the self-made man of the nineteenth century. [...] Decades after his death, a {{journalist}} aptly stated that [...] " [...] had rare financial talents, and was a first-class business man." [...] In politics, he learned the ultimate lesson: rectitude will kill a career trying to serve the people. He was unafraid of voicing his opinion though. On February 21, 1846, the U.S. House of Representatives deliberated whether to break for two days in honor of George Washington's birthday. A voice demurred. Representative William L. Yancey, the Southern secessionist and duelist, was so enraged that he shouted out for the dissenter to make himself known. Hungerford retorted: [...] "I show my <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> object. Are you satisfied?" [...] Alas, as time has gone by, Hungerford's achievements have faded along with the pages of old history books.|$|E
2500|$|Sophia Bush portrays Brooke Davis. [...] "What I do {{like about}} her– {{the things that}} I have had to portray her going through– you always learn a lesson from Brooke", stated Bush. [...] "She always manages to pick herself up when she falls on her <b>face.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> respect that. She is not all high and mighty and she doesn't act like she is always right. She {{has a lot of}} {{convictions}} and she is [...] really loyal friend. I appreciate how loyal she is. She doesn't take betrayal lightly and she doesn't think it is OK to lie to someone." [...] Brooke is the beautiful captain of the high school cheerleading squad, and the best friend of Peyton, and close friend of Haley. She has twice been a girlfriend to Lucas. Though her life appears perfect at the beginning, she is seen to suffer from having to deal with her distant parents, her friends' inability to take her seriously, and the betrayal of Lucas and Peyton when they date behind her back leaving her hurt. She eventually overcomes the betrayal and is determined to live a full, happy life.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Hogan of The Telegraph {{noted that}} [...] "Capaldi {{is back to}} his charismatic best" [...] in [...] "The Pilot", stating [...] "devoted Whovian is keen {{to go out with}} a bang", and {{described}} his character as [...] "mercurial, magical and kind". Patrick Mulkern praised Sarah Dollard's writing of the Doctor in [...] "Thin Ice", noting how she [...] "examines his moral code; the ideals he aspires to and the crimes and misdemeanors he's prepared to indulge". Capaldi's performance in [...] "Extremis" [...] received praise, with Alasdair Wilkins stating [...] "Peter Capaldi is perilously close to becoming my unqualified pick for favorite Doctor, he underplays the moment, making small choices to signal both his compassion and his heartbreak". He also praised the interactions between him and Missy, noting how they recall [...] "a more emotionally complex version of the repartee that Jon Pertwee’s Doctor and Roger Delgado’s Master had during their many encounters". Patrick Mulkern praised Capaldi’s performance in [...] "The Lie of the Land" [...] proclaiming [...] "he wavers between downright nasty and at best disconcerting. He’s world-weary — specifically, Earth-weary. You can almost believe he’s working for the dark side, so great is his disenchantment with the human race". After the broadcast of World Enough and Time, Steven Moffat paid a special tribute to Capaldi, “Peter only has to think at the screen and you know what he’s thinking,” he said. “He only has to move his <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know the particular blend of Scottish torment he’s feeling right now. Despite trying to fight his emotions, he has given us the most emotional Doctor.” [...] Capaldi received overwhelming praise for his performance in [...] "The Doctor Falls" [...] with Patrick Mulkern noted the episode as a story dedicated to the character and how he [...] "stands tall", along with Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror highlighting the twelfth Doctor, praising how he [...] "simply shines". Flickering Myth stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is a magnificent Doctor, a person who captures the wisdom, madness, caring and frustration of a two-thousand year old Time Lord". Digital Spy praised Capaldi's [...] "Where I stand is where I fall" [...] speech, noting it as quite possibly the actor's finest moment to date. Simon Brew of Den of Geek heavily praised the actor's performance stating: [...] "The majestic, wonderful, brilliant Peter Capaldi. If you needed a reminder of just how much he’s going to be missed when he finally departs Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} year, his outstanding work here was precisely that. When he was blasted, apparently mortally, and he kept holding off his regeneration I found myself saying out loud “I don’t want you to go”". Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine agreed, admitting that [...] "the man’s been a revelation. I love Peter Capaldi. He has without a doubt been my Doctor for this new incarnation of Doctor Who that’s wrapping up its tenth season, and we have been nothing short of fortunate to have been blessed with his talents. I don’t want you to go either, Peter".|$|E
60|$|She {{looked him}} in the <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can still see those black eyes of hers {{softening}} before the gaze.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked into}} his smug <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was within an ace of {{striking}} him. Then I controlled myself, and my will was snapped.|$|E
60|$|Oh, how {{beautiful}} she looked {{there in the}} flame! No angel out of heaven could have worn a greater loveliness. Even now my heart faints before the recollection of it, as she stood and smiled at our awed <b>faces,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would give half my remaining time upon this earth to see her once like that again.|$|R
60|$|And {{in a while}} out of that {{numerous}} company stepped one whom by his primrose <b>face</b> <b>and</b> mien <b>I</b> took to be Mounsieur Mustardseed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> followed after him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Peter," [...] {{the elder}} brother said, [...] "open our lantern. The night is quite still.

60|$|By way of answer {{he lifted}} or {{unwrapped}} the cloth from about his <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{saw that the}} Kalubi himself stood before us.|$|E
60|$|Again that inexplicable smile {{passed over}} Lucy's <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was {{resolved}} to ask its meaning, when the approaching footstep of Mr. Hardinge prevented it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{danced with}} him, sir, but I {{was too much}} terrified to look in his <b>face.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> saw his cocked hat over the thorn hedge." ...|$|E
6000|$|Velez. Aye, 'twas {{the morning}} thou didst try to cheer me [...] With a fond gaiety.

2500|$|In April 2007, Geico Auto Insurance used [...] "Strange <b>Faces</b> <b>and</b> Noises <b>I</b> Can Make III" [...] {{in their}} {{television}} commercial. After {{a portion of}} the video plays, apparently on a computer screen, a narrator says, [...] "There may be better ways to spend 15 minutes online." [...] Hardesty's Strange <b>Faces</b> <b>and</b> Noises <b>I</b> Can Make video was parodied in the MTV sketch show Human Giant. In the sketch, Aziz Ansari portrayed a character who made a similar funny faces video like Hardesty's.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a Scotchy {{name for}} such a <b>face</b> <b>and</b> eyes. <b>I</b> should rather have {{expected}} Guiseppe or Angelo. The boy looks like an Italian." ...|$|R
