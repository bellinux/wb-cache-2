60|$|Finding no sort of {{principle}} of coherence {{with each other}} in the nature and constitution of the several new republics of France, I considered what cement the legislators had provided for them from any <b>extraneous</b> <b>materials.</b> Their confederations, their spectacles, their civic feasts, and their enthusiasm I take no notice of; they are nothing but mere tricks; but tracing their policy through their actions, I think I can distinguish the arrangements by which they propose to hold these republics together. The first is the confiscation, with the compulsory paper currency annexed to it; the second is the supreme power of the city of Paris; the third is the general army of the state. Of this last I shall reserve what I have to say, until I come to consider the army as an head by itself.|$|E

40|$|The “sun meat” is a {{handmade}} product, combining surface {{techniques of}} salting and dehydration, commonly used by {{people from the}} North and Northeast regions of Brazil. The sun meat cooking process lacks in sophisticated technology and official standards of procedure and quality. Thus, production, sale and distribution under unsatisfactory sanitary conditions are risky to the consumers’ health. This paper is aimed at evaluating the sanitary conditions of “sun meat” sold at the “houses of the north” {{for the presence of}} <b>extraneous</b> <b>materials.</b> Analysis of 44 samples of “sun meat” from 22 “houses of the north” located in “Diadema District” (SP, Brazil) had been carried out. The product conditions of exposure and sale in the “houses of the north” were evaluated and provided additional information to assess the degree of food safety of this product. In 44 samples were found various types of <b>extraneous</b> <b>materials</b> such as whole insects and debris, larvae, exuvia, mites, rodent hairs, bird feather pieces, fungi, and sharp objects. Mechanical vectors were observed at 11 locations of the sale area. The results indicated that 90. 9 % of the “sun meat” has unsatisfactory sanitary conditions, caused by the presence of physical hazards of contamination. These results, associated with conditions found in the “houses of the north”, indicated that these products can put the health of consumers at risk...|$|E
