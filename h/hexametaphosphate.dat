5000|$|Polyphosphates {{constitute}} {{a wide variety}} of compounds that have beneficial effects on oral health, the most effective of these are the <b>hexametaphosphates,</b> tripolyphosphates and pyrophosphates and may be attached with an alkali metal, alkaline metal, ammonium or a salt. [...] Sodium tripolyphosphates as an example, are able to bind directly to the enamel as well as the mineralized sections of the teeth where it takes up the binding sites for calcium to attach, and interacts with calcium already bonded to enamel, to prevent it being able to form crystals. Calcium mixed in the saliva can also be bound by sodium tripolyphosphates thus further preventing crystal formation. Sodium tripolyphosphates are also beneficial for stain prevention, and can be broken down in the digestive tract and provide a source of phosphorus and allows the undeposited calcium to be available for whole body metabolism.|$|R

X-ray diffraction studies display that the structural configurations of metaphosphate acids are dictated by strong hydrogen bonding interactions.

Metaphosphate anhydrides result from the dehydration of metaphosphate acids. They can undergo hydrolysis to regenerate metaphosphate acids, or alternatively alcoholysis to generate metaphosphate esters. Alcoholysis of metaphosphiate anhydrides presents a novel method to quantitatively phosphorylate organic substrates, of particular interest are substrates of biological significance such as nucleosides. The phosphorylating ability of metaphosphate anhydrides makes them promising candidates for biological phosphorylation. by Khetpakorn Chakarawet. Thesis: S.

5000|$|Warmed-over flavor can be {{prevented}} {{by the addition of}} preservatives to processed meat. Many of the preservatives are antioxidants, ranging from tocopherols (related to vitamin E) to plum juice to industrial additives such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and propyl gallate. [...] Other preservatives such as sodium pyrophosphate and sodium <b>hexametaphosphate</b> may work by binding iron and preventing it from catalyzing the chemical reactions which lead to warmed-over flavor; as these compounds are generally more soluble in water than the fat-soluble antioxidant preservatives, they may be more readily used to prevent oxidative decomposition in meat. Nitrites, a curing agent for meat, may prevent the development of warmed-over flavor by preventing the release of iron during cooking.|$|E

In this study, the feasibility of using sodium <b>hexametaphosphate</b> as a dispersant in the electrodeposition of Ni–SiC composite coating has been investigated. The effect of sodium <b>hexametaphosphate</b> and probe sonication on the microhardness, microstructure and wear resistance of the electrodeposited Ni–SiC composite coating has been studied. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the coatings showed the absence of Na and P elements from sodium <b>hexametaphosphate</b> in the bath. Ni–SiC coating deposited using probe sonication followed by the addition of sodium <b>hexametaphosphate</b> exhibited microhardness as high as 680 HK. The microstructure of the coatings varied with probe sonication and SHMP addition and Ni–SiC–PS–SHMP coating possessed lowest roughness.

40|$|U. S. meat {{processors}} {{are currently}} looking for intervention methods for preventing growth of L. monocytogenes {{during and after}} cooking of Ready-to-Eat (RTE) meat products. RTE meat products do not require further heat treatment before consumption and are often eaten directly out of the package. Phosphates, already a common ingredient in meat, have shown varying degrees of inhibition of different pathogens. At high concentrations, some phosphates have caused off-flavors in meat products. Due to its neutral pH, sodium <b>hexametaphosphate</b> (HMP) causes less flavor problems. Sodium <b>hexametaphosphate</b> has shown some inhibitory effectiveness with S. typhimurium, S. aureus and C. botulinum. With L. monocytogenes, only 0. 5 % HMP in agar has been studied; additional {{research needs to be}} conducted on the use of HMP and Listeria in actual meat products. The objective was to determine if HMP addition in fully-cooked meat products had an antimicrobial effect on L. innocua growth over time. The effect of phosphate concentration was also analyzed.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{the effect}} of sodium <b>hexametaphosphate</b> on the {{hematite}} was studied and the mechanism was analyzed.

40|$|International audienceHypothesesMontmorillonite, an {{abundant}} raw material, {{is a good}} candidate to obtain textured nanocomposites. However, the resulting structure of the composite depends on the dispersant used. This work aims at investigating the effect of organic polysaccharides, namely carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) or chitosan (Ch) differing by their side groups, on the resulting structure of montmorillonite-based nanocomposites. ExperimentsThe effect of sodium <b>hexametaphosphate</b> and of two polysaccharide derivatives (carboxymethylcellulose and chitosan) combined with montmorillonite on the structure and microstructure of resulting composite films was investigated using particle size analysis, rheological measurements, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and flexural properties measurements of the textured films. FindingsResults showed that the film structure and microstructure depend on the additive. The high organization (and resulting toughness) of the montmorillonite/sodium <b>hexametaphosphate</b> films results from an exfoliated then layered microstructure, whereas the addition of polysaccharide derivatives leads to the particle agglomeration.

40|$|Surface free {{energies}} of dental hard tissues, including salivary conditioning films on enamel, {{play a crucial}} role in mineralization, dissolution and adhesion processes at the tooth surface. These mineralization reactions at oral surfaces control the development and progression of various diseases. In this paper, we compare the surface {{free energies}}, as derived from measured contact angles with liquids, of salivary conditioning films on enamel after exposure to dentifrices with and without anti-calculus additives, such as <b>hexametaphosphate,</b> pyrophosphate or zinc citrate trihydrate. Measured contact angles were converted to surface free energies using the concept of Lifshitz-Van der Waals and Lewis acid base components. Nearly all dentifrices yield film properties with a negative interfacial tension against an aqueous phase, which thermodynamically opposes mineralization. Concurrent with negative interfacial tensions, are positive values of the interfacial free energy of adhesion for octacalcium-phosphate (OCP) to the film surfaces, indicating that adhesion of newly mineralized, calcium-phosphate rich phases is thermodynamically unfavorable. Interestingly, two out of the three dentifrices with anti-calculus additives containing <b>hexametaphosphate</b> and pyrophosphate cause most positive interfacial free energies for OCP adhesion of 5. 8 and 2. 6 mJ/mZ, respectively. In summary, surface thermodynamical analyses indicate that anti-calculus effects of commercial dentifrice formulations are consistent with more negative interfacial tensions of salivary conditioning films on enamel surfaces and thus with more positive values for the interfacial free energy of adhesion toward newly formed mineral phases. A dentifrice containing <b>hexametaphosphate</b> yielded thermodynamic properties of salivary conditioning films most unfavorable for calculus formation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.
