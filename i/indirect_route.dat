5|$|On 3 January 1944, VMF-214 {{was among}} 75 U.S. {{aircraft}} raiding near Rabaul {{when they were}} surprised by 300 Japanese aircraft. Boyington was shot down and parachuted into the St. George's Channel. The next day, Bolt led a flight of four Corsairs from VMF-214 in search of Boyington. Despite hazy weather {{and the need to}} take an <b>indirect</b> <b>route</b> to avoid Japanese radar, Bolt managed to lead the flight to the area where the battle had taken place the day before. Although they did not spot Boyington, they discovered and engaged a flotilla of Japanese barges, destroying six of them. Bolt also claimed his sixth victory against a Japanese aircraft attempting to defend the barges.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of castles {{in relation to}} high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources. Also often found near a castle, sometimes within its defences, was the parish church. This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, {{one of the most}} important institutions of medieval society. Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military could be used for display. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England– comprising a moat and several satellite ponds– forced anyone approaching a water castle entrance to take a very <b>indirect</b> <b>route,</b> walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway. Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer around the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 a new {{direct line}} to Clifton Hill was opened {{from the central}} Princes Bridge station at the {{southern}} edge of the CBD though the inner eastern suburb of Abbotsford. This meant that Heidelberg-bound trains could run direct to their destination, removing the need for the reversal manoeuvre at Victoria Park. The Preston suburban service also ran via the new line. However, Whittlesea trains continued to use the more <b>indirect</b> <b>route</b> via the Inner Circle, albeit only from Spencer Street station.|$|E

500|$|In attacking Lang Phuoc Hai the Viet Cong had likely {{intended}} {{to draw out}} and ambush any relief force as it approached the village; a standard tactic they had employed on previous occasions. Indeed, early on 17 February two companies of Viet Cong had established an ambush between Dat Do and Lang Phuoc Hai. That morning the South Vietnamese had subsequently dispatched 189 RF Company from Hoi My, yet the ambush subsequently failed when the RF company commander elected to move by an <b>indirect</b> <b>route</b> {{to the east of}} the road, striking the Viet Cong flank just after first light. Although outnumbered, the South Vietnamese had caught the Viet Cong by surprise and were able to fight their way clear, forcing the communists to withdraw to the north-east. Later that day Murphy had taken a similar precaution, moving A Squadron cross-country over the paddy fields to the LZ Amber. Several days after the battle uncorroborated information was received which suggested that in so doing, the Australians may have also avoided a large area ambush on Route 44 between Hoi My and Lang Phuoc Hai by up to two main force battalions, with the convoy perhaps passing within [...] of the Viet Cong command group without realising it. Murphy subsequently deduced that the two-company Viet Cong force that had earlier contacted 189 RF Company may have been flank protection or a blocking force for the larger ambush. By inserting into LZ Amber it was probable that 6 RAR had unknowingly also avoided this ambush, yet had subsequently clashed with a large group of Viet Cong resting in the dense jungle adjacent to the landing zone. This force was likely either a reserve or flank security element, and was {{not a part of the}} main force that had attacked Lang Phuoc Hai.|$|E
2500|$|Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms {{chemical}} {{bonds with}} almost all other free elements at elevated temperatures to give corresponding oxides. However, some elements, such as iron which oxidises to iron oxide, or rust, , readily oxidise at standard conditions for temperature and pressure (STP). The surface of metals like aluminium and titanium are oxidized {{in the presence}} of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion.

2500|$|Plant virus {{transmission}} {{from generation}} to generation occurs in about 20% of plant viruses. When viruses are transmitted by seeds, the seed is infected in the generative cells and the virus is maintained in the germ cells and sometimes, but less often, in the seed coat. When the growth and development of plants is delayed because of situations like unfavourable weather, there is an increase in the amount of virus infections in seeds. [...] There {{does not seem to be}} a correlation between the location of the seed on the plant and its chances of being infected. [...] Little is known about the mechanisms involved in the transmission of plant viruses via seeds, although it is known that it is environmentally influenced and that seed transmission occurs because of a direct invasion of the embryo via the ovule or by an <b>indirect</b> <b>route</b> with an attack on the embryo mediated by infected gametes. [...] These processes can occur concurrently or separately depending on the host plant. It is unknown how the virus is able to directly invade and cross the embryo and [...] boundary between the parental and progeny generations in the ovule.|$|E
2500|$|Lee and his {{principal}} subordinates {{knew that the}} sound of gunfire {{from the direction of}} Appomattox Station on April 8 meant that Union cavalry were ahead of them. After discussing the situation with Lieutenant General Longstreet and Major Generals Gordon and Fitzhugh Lee, including mentioning Grant's generous term of parole of the army upon its surrender to them, General Lee decided to attempt a breakthrough toward Lynchburg on the morning of April 9 if his army only had to confront Union cavalry. If Union infantry were also ahead of them, they would need to reconsider their actions. Gordon and Fitzhugh Lee were assigned the task of clearing the Union troopers off the road to Lynchburg. Lee wanted to press on for Danville by an <b>indirect</b> <b>route</b> through Campbell Court House. The plan was for the Confederate troops to hurry through the Union cavalry blockade with only essential supplies. The wagon train would head toward Lynchburg by a circuitous route without an escort. Surplus wagons and supplies again would be burned. If Union infantry also blocked the way, Lee asked his subordinates to inform him so a flag of truce could be sent to Grant [...] "to accede to the only alternative left to us." ...|$|E
2500|$|A turnpike {{was built}} in 1836 {{connecting}} St Leonards-on-Sea to the main road to London (the present A21), cutting out the former <b>indirect</b> <b>route</b> via Hastings, Ore and The Ridge. [...] St Leonards Warrior Square railway station was opened nearby in February 1851, and this inland part of St Leonards-on-Sea became a new growth area housing mostly working-class people. [...] The construction of an Anglican place of worship, Christ Church, in 1860, was soon followed by {{the establishment of a}} Nonconformist community who needed a church of their own: Protestant Nonconformity was thriving in the Hastings area by the mid-19th century, in common with many other parts of Sussex. [...] James Griffin, a local Congregationalist, founded the church in 1863, and building work started on 23 February 1864 when the foundation stone was laid. [...] The first service at St Leonards-on-Sea Congregational Church was held on 27 October of that year. [...] Thomas Spalding, the owner of Ore Place (formerly the manor house of the nearby village of Ore), donated locally quarried sandstone, and the design and building work were credited to William Habershon and his pupil Edgar Brock. As a Grade II listed building it is mistakenly credited to Edward Habershon's brother William; but it was Edward who was employed in the Habershon-Brock partnership. [...] The partnership were prolific in the mid-19th century; most of their work was on Anglican churches such as the new St Helen's Church at Ore, St Andrew's Church (now demolished) in central Hastings and the former St Peter's Church at Baldslow, and further afield in Sussex in places such as Hove (St John the Baptist's Church), Ebernoe, Copthorne, Ashurst Wood and Scaynes Hill.|$|E

6000|$|From this divide two roads lead to {{the ruins}} of Umm Ámil: one makes a {{considerable}} detour up a branch-valley {{in order to avoid}} an ugly Pass on the direct line. I again refused the camel-men permission to proceed by the <b>indirect</b> <b>route,</b> well knowing that they would do their best to miss us. On March 4th, at six a.m., a long descent and a similar rise led us to a Col, which presently became a broad open plain, 2100 feet above sea-level (aner. 28.85). Tents were scattered about the valleys; the lads tended their goats, and we greatly admired one fellow who had fallen asleep in the hot ascending steams. Here the old guide halted us, and declared that {{on the top of the}} dark trap-block the left (south) was a Mashghal, or [...] "work-place," [...] with a strew of quartz and nothing else. Thus ended the [...] "built well." [...] Descending to a lower plane, bounded in front by low rolling hills, I sent Lieutenant Amir to examine the [...] "Convent" [...] and the [...] "written stones." [...] He came up with us at the halt; having been led over a rough divide by an abominable path; and he had seen only a few ruined heaps and three Arab Wusúm.

60|$|After {{my first}} visit to Leamington Spa, I went by an <b>indirect</b> <b>route</b> to Lichfield, and put up at the Black Swan. Had I known where to find it, I would much rather have {{established}} myself at the inn formerly kept by the worthy Mr. Boniface, so famous for his ale in Farquhar's time. The Black Swan is an old-fashioned hotel, its street-front being penetrated by an arched passage, in either side of which is an entrance door to the different parts of the house, and through which, and over the large stones of its pavement, all vehicles and horsemen rumble and clatter into an enclosed courtyard, with a thunderous uproar among the contiguous rooms and chambers. I appeared to be the only guest of the spacious establishment, but may have had a few fellow-lodgers hidden in their separate parlors, and utterly eschewing that community of interests which is the characteristic feature of life in an American hotel. At any rate, I had the great, dull, dingy, and dreary coffee-room, with its heavy old mahogany chairs and tables, all to myself, and not a soul to exchange a word with, except the waiter, who, like most of his class in England, had evidently left his conversational abilities uncultivated. No former practice of solitary living, nor habits of reticence, nor well-tested self-dependence for occupation of mind and amusement, can quite avail, as I now proved, to dissipate the ponderous gloom of an English coffee-room under such circumstances as these, with no book at hand save the county-directory, nor any newspaper but a torn local journal of five days ago. So I buried myself, betimes, in a huge heap of ancient feathers (there is no other kind of bed in these old inns), let my head sink into an unsubstantial pillow, and slept a stifled sleep, infested with such a fragmentary confusion of dreams that I took them to be a medley, compounded of the night-troubles of all my predecessors in that same unrestful couch. And when I awoke, the musty odor of a bygone century was in my nostrils,--a faint, elusive smell, of which I never had any conception before crossing the Atlantic.|$|E

50|$|In the {{free-living}} cycle, the rhabditiform larvae {{passed in}} the stool can either molt twice and become infective filariform larvae (direct development) or molt four times and become free-living adult males and females that mate and produce eggs from which rhabditiform larvae hatch. In the direct development, first-stage larvae (L1) transform into infective larvae (IL) via three molts. The <b>indirect</b> <b>route</b> results first {{in the development of}} free-living adults that mate; the female lays eggs, which hatch and then develop into IL. The direct route gives IL faster (three days) versus the <b>indirect</b> <b>route</b> (seven to 10 days).
