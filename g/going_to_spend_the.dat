5|$|The first {{target of}} the WSGA was Nate Champion, {{who was at the}} KC Ranch (also known as Kaycee) at that time. They were tasked to perform the {{assassination}} that others had failed to carry out five months before. The group traveled to the ranch late Friday, April 8, 1892, quietly surrounded the buildings, and waited for daybreak. Three men besides Champion were at the KC. Two men who were evidently <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> night on their way through were captured as they emerged from the cabin early that morning to collect water at the nearby Powder River, while the third, Nick Ray, was shot while standing inside the doorway of the cabin. As the gunmen opened fire on the cabin, Champion grabbed the mortally wounded Nick Ray back to the cabin. The latter died hours later, and Champion was left besieged inside the log cabin alone.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} half of 1994, the K Foundation {{attempted}} to interest galleries in staging Money: A Major Body of Cash, but even old friend Jayne Casey, director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. The Tate, in Liverpool, {{wanted to be part of}} the 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from... the gallery curator, informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly", leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. An exhibition at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been set for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. [...] "Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do." [...] Cauty: [...] "We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare." ...|$|E

On May 13, 2012, CSI: Miami was canceled. Series star Emily Procter later stated that [...] "the cancellation was kind of shocking for everyone because they had given an indication that [...] might go, so people would have been prepared and we just weren't prepared." [...] Procter had previously commented on the longevity of the series, commenting that [...] "I remember sitting around with David in the parking lot during season one, getting ready for the first episode to air.

2500|$|Upon {{his capture}} {{outside the city}} of Monterrey, Nuevo León, the drug lord was flown to Mexico City where U.S. federal agent took him on a private plane to Houston, Texas. Wearing slacks and a striped shirt, García Ábrego was {{immediately}} extradited to the United States where he was interviewed by a FBI agent, and confessed to have [...] "ordered people murdered and tortured," [...] bribed top Mexican officials, and smuggled tons of narcotics into the United States. His prosecutors, however, tried García Ábrego as an U.S. citizens because he also had an American birth certificate, although Mexican authorities claimed the certificate was [...] "fraudulent." [...] He also had an official birth certificate that claimed García Ábrego was indeed born in Mexico. According to The Brownsville Herald, García Ábrego went into the courtroom grinning and talking animatedly with his lawyers who helped him translate his words from Spanish into the English language. Hours after the judge told García Ábrego that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of his life}} in prison, the death penalty was out of the question for the prosecutors.|$|E
2500|$|Brigham Young {{had planned}} on moving the Mormons west that summer, but {{circumstances}} were against his plan. He saw several possible advantages to the Saints {{in the proposed}} federal service. Their enlistment would be a public relations victory for the church, demonstrating additional evidence of its loyalty to the United States. As the men were given a uniform allowance at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., of US$42 each, paid in advance, for their one-year enlistment and as {{they were allowed to}} wear their civilian clothing for the march, the bulk of those funds were immediately donated to a general Church fund. These funds were used to purchase wagons, teams, and other necessities for the American exodus (Actual wages paid over the next year to the Mormon Battalion totaled nearly $30,000). Having been forced to leave farms and homes in Nauvoo, the Latter-day Saints were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> winter {{on the banks of the}} Missouri River. Raising a group of able-bodied men would be difficult. Many men had already scattered to outlying areas where they sought jobs with wages to help support the group.

2500|$|The film {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} by Wood's friend, psychic Criswell: [...] "Greetings my friends! We are all {{interested in the}} future, For that is where you and I are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> rest of our lives! ...". (This line appears in the narration for the General Motors' [...] "Futurama" [...] ride and its accompanying film, To New Horizons, {{that were part of}} the 1939 New York World's Fair—years before Criswell's own television program.) At the time of filming, Criswell was the star of the KLAC Channel 13 (now KCOP-13) television series, Criswell Predicts. The introduction could be an allusion to the opening lines of his show, but since no episodes of the television show are known to survive, a comparison is impossible. Craig suggests that Criswell's public persona was based on the style of a charismatic preacher, perhaps influenced by early televangelists. Criswell addresses the viewers repeatedly as [...] "my friends", as if attempting to establish a bond between the speaker and the audience. The line is likely to derive from his show, and would not be out of place in a segment where a televangelist addresses his congregation. Another phrase of the introduction, [...] "Future events such as these will affect you in the future", served as a signature line for Criswell. He used it repeatedly in his newspaper and magazine columns, and probably his show as well.|$|E

[...] Jackson also disclosed previously unreported details about his financial history and past drug use, saying he wanted to [...] "reveal as many of my weaknesses and shortcomings as a curious press and my opposition might want to look into," [...] and by doing so, [...] "maybe save you and your colleagues some further research." [...] In regards to claims that he thinks birth defects are caused by parents' sins, Jackson said, [...] "I do not believe that birth defects are caused by parents' sin unless, of course, there's a direct scientific connection between the parents' behavior and the disabilities of the child," [...] such as a child who might develop birth defects if his or her mother was addicted to heroin. He also denied that he had said yoga leads to Satanism: [...] "I do not believe that yoga leads to Satanism. One of my ministers is a yoga instructor. What I said was that Christian meditation does not involve emptying oneself but filling oneself ... with the spirit of God. That is classic Biblical Christianity." ...|$|E
