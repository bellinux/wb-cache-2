5|$|Three {{mainstream}} narratives emerged {{after the}} shooting. The early view that Israeli gunfire {{had killed the}} boy developed into the position that, because of the trajectory of the shots, Palestinian gunfire {{was more likely to}} have been responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of L'Express, and , a former France2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage. A third perspective, held by Arlette Chabot, France 2's news editor, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> can know who fired the shots.|$|E
25|$|Atiyah {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some geometric object that the groups act on and then classifying these geometric structures. The problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has been able to suggest an easy way to find such a geometric structure associated to a simple group. In some sense the classification does work by finding geometric structures such as BN-pairs, but this only comes {{at the end of a}} very long and difficult analysis of the structure of a finite simple group.|$|E
25|$|I {{know that}} some people are getting very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one,</b> not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E

So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with {{the concerns of the}} ordinary citizen.

[...] "What surprised me about Microsoft <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has any conception of an afterlife. There is so little thought given to eternal issues that their very absence make them pointedly there. These people are so locked into the world, by default some sort of transcendence is located elsewhere, and obviously machines become the totem they imbue with sacred properties, wishes, hopes, goals, desires, dreams. That sounds like 1940s SF, but it's become the world." ...|$|E

[...] Second, under the majority's holding that standard would apply across the board to all sentence appeals, including those that involved no legal error.

"If {{nature has}} made {{any one thing}} less {{susceptible}} than all others of exclusive property, it is {{the action of the}} thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it.

For the first time, we get a definitive ruling to the phrase 'day to day'." [...] Karpal approvingly cited the Lock-Up Rules, which only allow the interrogation of prisoners between 6.30am and 6.30pm, and noted that the decision meant Teoh's family could sue the MACC for his false imprisonment as well.

2500|$|Chapter 1 {{begins with}} a promise by the narrator to engage the reader with an {{analysis}} of contemporary thought, [...] "but the grand scheme degenerates immediately into nonsensical and ignorant chatter."

[...] According to Erdman, [...] "the contrast between appearance and reality {{in the realm of}} communication lies at the centre of Blake's satiric method."

"In {{traveling}} through the section about Dalton, embracing particularly {{the lower part of}} Chatooga, the upper part of Floyd and Walker, Catoosa and Murray counties, I was astonished to find what a hold the Mormons have on various communities. In each of these counties they have staunch believers and in most of them small congregations. Elders canvas through these counties continually and preach regularly. Every few months they send off bunches of converts for Utah. One of the strangest features of the whole matter <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> can explain why the Mormon elders have chosen this section for their field of operations. They can be heard of no where in Georgia, Alabama or the Carolinas outside of this mountainous area, covering a dozen or so counties. It may be because these counties are off the railroad, comparatively inaccessible and inhabited in certain localities by uneducated people." ...|$|E

[...] The story also stated that [...] "The U.S. military did not get all the additional American forces into Iraq until June 15, so it would be premature to draw a final statistical picture of the effect of the added troops."

2500|$|In 2005, {{the then}} Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, long in {{conflict}} with the London Evening Standard, then wholly owned by the same media group as the Mail, branded the Mail titles [...] "the most reprehensibly edited" [...] publications in the world. The Mail's treatment of asylum seekers and members of other vulnerable groups is a particular source of grievance for many critics, not only Livingstone. [...] "Maybe we anti-racists have been naive to think that [...] was anything more than an aberration," [...] suggests Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, adding: [...] "wouldn't it be better if this extraordinary editor decided to use his influence to create just a little more understanding of why refugees leave their countries, and what most of them bring to our nation?" [...] Stephen Fry in August 2013 called Dacre a [...] "frothing autocrat" [...] and hypocrite who [...] "sends his son to Eton" [...] but mocked Fry [...] "for being posh". Fry added: [...] "He decries indecency on one page and pushes his male readers into a semi over a semi-nude actress on another. His cancer scare, miracle cure stories are sickeningly anti-science and the only good thing to be said about his Mail <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> decent or educated believes in it". Dacre's defence against his paper's critics in October 2013 was to decry the existence of [...] "an unpleasant intellectual snobbery about the Mail in leftish circles, for whom the word 'suburban' is an obscenity. They simply cannot comprehend how a paper that opposes the mindset they hold dear can be so successful and so loved by its millions of readers. Well, I'm proud that the Mail stands up for those readers".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} for Screen Crush, Kevin Fitzpatrick stated, [...] "The honest {{truth is that}} Iron Fist needed {{to be so much}} weirder than it {{actually}} is, akin to how Doctor Strange essentially re-told the Iron Man story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. Iron Fist starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode... but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when {{the vast majority of the}} principal characters feel so spectacularly underdeveloped." [...] Fitzpatrick felt that Henwick's Colleen Wing was [...] "the most fully-realized character" [...] with [...] "a rich supporting performance" [...] that is overlooked in the early episodes. Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall felt of the first six episodes, [...] "Iron Fist is virtually all talk — most of it painfully dull — and the fighting is both brief and unconvincing. It’s easily the worst of the Netflix Marvel shows — where the others tend to start off well and then run into massive pacing problems around episode 8 or 9, Iron Fist begins as if it’s already at that sag point — and an unfortunate illustration of the perils of miscasting." [...] He also criticized Jones' fighting ability and the way the fights were filmed and edited. Some of the few positive for the season were the appearances of Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth and Dawson. Sepinwall concluded, [...] "the biggest problem with the new show <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> involved seems to have any kind of take on the material. They’re just making a mostly faithful but personality-free adaptation because someone at Marvel decided four years ago that Danny (who often partners with Luke in the comics) had to be the final member of the team... we got a show that’s so lifeless that I have no interest in finishing out the season".|$|E
2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a C, saying [...] "In the Shrek films, the joke of Puss in Boots, with his trilled consonants and penchant for chest-puffing sword duels, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> this cuddly {{should try to}} be this dashing. But in Puss in Boots, that joke wears out its welcome in 15 minutes." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots doesn't break any new ground in the {{storytelling}} department, and its reliance on go-go-go state-of-the-art action sequences grows wearying by the end, but the movie has a devilish wit that works for parent and child alike." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "It's always a pleasure to find a family film that respects its audience {{all the way up the}} line." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Remember that toy where you yank a string and hear the sound of a barnyard animal? [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] has about half as much entertainment value." [...] Olly Richards of Empire gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Like most kittens, it's not always perfectly behaved, but at least this new Puss adventure doesn't have you reaching for the cinematic spray bottle. And thank goodness the spin-off does nothing to neuter the charismatic cat's appeal." [...] Stan Hall of The Oregonian gave the film a B, saying [...] "Puss in Boots isn't particularly deep, nor does it take itself seriously -- it just wants to seek glory, win affection and cash in. Done, done and done." ...|$|E
