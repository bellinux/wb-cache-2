25|$|The city of Asheville {{is home to}} a Duke Energy Progress {{coal power}} plant near Lake Julian. This power plant is {{designated}} as having Coal Combustion Residue Surface Impoundments with a High <b>Hazard</b> <b>Potential</b> by the EPA. In 2012 a Duke University study found high levels of arsenic and other toxins in North Carolina lakes and rivers downstream from the Asheville power plants coal ash ponds. Samples collected from coal ash waste flowing from the ponds at the Duke Energy Progress plant to the French Broad River in Buncombe County contained arsenic levels more than four times higher than the EPA drinking water standard, and levels of selenium 17 times higher than the agency's standard for aquatic life. In March 2013 the State of North Carolina sued Duke Energy Progress in order to address similar environmental compliance issues. In July 2013 Duke Energy Corp. and North Carolina environmental regulators proposed a settlement in the lawsuit that stated coal ash threatened Asheville's water supply. The settlement called for Duke to assess the sources and extent of contamination at the Riverbend power plant in Asheville. Duke would be fined $99,100 if the settlement is approved. Following the coal ash spill in Eden, NC resulting in 82,000 tons of coal ash leaking into the Dan River, the North Carolina DENR cancelled all previous settlements with Duke Energy. Duke said a stormwater drainage pipe under the utility's Dan River Steam Station lagoon ruptured Feb 2, allowing ash slurry to pour into the river. Duke Energy faces future legislation by Tom Apodaca, republican NCGA Senate leader forcing them to clean up their south Asheville coal ash ponds. Tom Apodaca expects the legislation will be filed as soon as the General Assembly returns to session in May 2014. Apodaca expects the ponds will be cleaned up in 5–10 years under his law.|$|E
40|$|Background: Activities in CDU III {{are very}} risk to any hazards potential; {{because of that}} <b>hazards</b> <b>potential</b> is much needed in {{controlling}} the <b>hazards</b> <b>potential</b> to decrease the accidents and occupational diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the controlling of <b>hazards</b> <b>potential</b> in CDU III PT. Pertamina (Persero) RU III Plaju in 2011. Method: This study was a qualitative study. The methods of data collection were using in-depth interview and observation. The total of informants in this study was 7 people. Results: <b>Hazards</b> <b>potential</b> in CDU III were noise, fire, risk of falling from height, falling objects, electric shock, risk of H 2 S and CO, NH 3, being hit and squeezed, chief stumbling, hand scraped, stumbling, slipped, and flash. The controlling of <b>hazards</b> <b>potential</b> in PT. Pertamina was good enough, even though there were still some constraints in the implementation. Conclusion: The controlling techniques applied in PT. Pertamina were elimination, substitution, isolation, maintenance and broken equipments repair. The administrative controlling applied in PT. Pertamina were SIKA, training, safety talk, working time arrangements, hazard warning signs, and CSMS. The personal protective equipments provided by PT. Pertamina were goggles, welding goggles, face shield, safety helmet, ear plug, ear muff, air-filtering mask, full mask, SCBA, cotton coverall, flame retardant coverall, chemical resistant gloves, heat resistant gloves, rubber gloves, safety shoes, safety boots, and body harness...|$|R
