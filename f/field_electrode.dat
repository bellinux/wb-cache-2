50|$|EPSPs {{are usually}} {{recorded}} using intracellular electrodes. The extracellular signal {{from a single}} neuron is extremely small and thus next to impossible to record in the human brain. However, {{in some areas of}} the brain, such as the hippocampus, neurons are arranged {{in such a way that}} they all receive synaptic inputs in the same area. Because these neurons are in the same orientation, the extracellular signals from synaptic excitation don't cancel out, but rather add up to give a signal that can easily be recorded with a <b>field</b> <b>electrode.</b> This extracellular signal recorded from a population of neurons is the field potential. In studies of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), figures are often given showing the field EPSP (fEPSP) in stratum radiatum of CA1 in response to Schaffer collateral stimulation. This is the signal seen by an extracellular electrode placed in the layer of apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. The Schaffer collaterals make excitatory synapses onto these dendrites, and so when they are activated, there is a current sink in stratum radiatum: the field EPSP. The voltage deflection recorded during a field EPSP is negative-going, while an intracellularly recorded EPSP is positive-going. This difference is due to the relative flow of ions (primarily the sodium ion) into the cell, which, in the case of the field EPSP is away from the electrode, while for an intracellular EPSPs it is towards the electrode. After a field EPSP, the extracellular electrode may record another change in electrical potential named the population spike which corresponds to the population of cells firing action potentials (spiking). In other regions than CA1 of the hippocampus, the field EPSP may be far more complex and harder to interpret as the source and sinks are far less defined. In regions such as the striatum, neurotransmitters such as dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA and others may also be released and further complicate the interpretation.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between impulse breakdown stress and stressed oil volume {{has been extensively}} investigated for uniform <b>field</b> <b>electrodes.</b> In large high voltage transformers {{it is essential to}} extend this relationship to paper insulated non-uniform field situations which are more frequently encountered in practice. This paper develops the stated relationship by experimental tests, using insulated cable to plane configurations, and statistical methods. These tests show that the impulse breakdown strength of an insulated cable to plane or nonuniform field system has a two parameter Weibull distribution, when the oil is considered to be the weak-link of the system. A non-linear regression analysis is then used to find that the Weibull parameters for insulated non-uniform <b>field</b> <b>electrodes</b> are approximately the same as the parameters for the uninsulated uniform <b>field</b> <b>electrodes</b> provided their stressed oil volumes are equivalent. Statistical calculations are used to derive the fundamental {{relationship between}} the Weibull parameters for any stressed oil volume and the Weibull parameters for the unit oil volume. With this relationship it is possible for design engineers to approximately determine the probability of electrical breakdown of any insulated cable to plane configuration in large power transformers.

40|$|Uniform <b>field</b> <b>electrodes</b> are {{generally}} employed to effect glow discharge with large cross-sections {{in the operation}} of TE gas lasers. In practice, electrodes have finite boundaries. The discharge electric field is obtained by dividing the applied voltage to the electrodes by the inter electrode distance. This is really true, for two infinite parallel plates. Practical electrodes with finite boundaries will have much enhanced field at the edges compared to that at the center. The sharper the edges, the higher is the resulting field, for the same potential. In case of uniform <b>field</b> <b>electrodes,</b> the edge has a designed (calculated) profile, such that the field is maximum at the center, and gradually diminish towards the edges. As the breakdown voltage of the gap is a strong function of E/p (E being the field, and p is the pressure), the discharge is constrained within a region, at whose boundaries, the field is 97 % of the central field (1). Beyond this region, to contain the size of the electrodes, one deviates from the calculated profile, and the electrode is rounded off. This rounding is done at a point, where the field has reduced to at least 70 % of the field (2) at the center.
