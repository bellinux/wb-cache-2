5|$|The plan {{to set up}} a {{shantytown}} in Washington, D.C., {{was carried}} out soon after the April 4 assassination.

5|$|As Double Dare grew messier, a green slime {{substance}} {{became more}} commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, You Can't Do That on Television. Double Dares high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids' Choice Awards, a slime geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including Wild & Crazy Kids and Figure <b>It</b> <b>Out.</b> <b>The</b> relationship of Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Kunis {{auditioned for}} but failed to get {{the role of a}} Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly. Instead, she was cast in the {{secondary}} role of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role. That '70s Show ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.|$|E

Bart enters Lisa's bedroom and tries to grab the saxophone from her, but he inadvertently tosses <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window.

In a period of mourning, Lisa reveals she cannot remember ever not having that saxophone, so Homer recounts the instrument's origins.|$|E
5|$|The {{impending}} {{dinner with}} Mr. Burns divides the Simpson household. Homer pragmatically supports Mr. Burns, while Marge and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Mr. Burns's advisers prepare {{the family for}} the event, even giving them pre-written questions to ask in lieu of conversation. Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns tries {{to act as if}} it does not bother him, but is not able to keep from spitting <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, {{and by the time the}} chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his governatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite Mr. Burns saying that Homer's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily get together again.|$|E
5|$|In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was {{published}} in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved {{in a manner similar}} to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.|$|E

5|$|The first update {{was tied}} with April Fools' Day, with the {{addition}} of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with the pranks one normally sees on that day. Throughout the ARG, the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat, forums, and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort. This allowed, for example, Two Tribes to prepare for Jake_R's visit, and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log into one of the puzzles. In another example, another chat room user, following a red herring, visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy. Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner. While many puzzles of the ARG included cross-game cluessuch as finding the password for one of the Aperture Science login screens from another gameNeuse felt they could have increased the cross-game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation. During the second phase, one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG. Newell then fed the image with the encrypted message to media outlets. Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions, including calling some of the players out by name.|$|E

25|$|However, {{just as the}} {{librarian}} cannot go wrong with the first master catalogue, he is doomed to fail with the second.

However, if the librarian leaves <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> catalogue is incomplete. Either way, it can never be a true master catalogue of catalogues that do not list themselves.|$|E

25|$|When {{hostilities}} commenced {{between the}} Austrian Empire and Imperial France, Johann von Hiller led an Austrian army {{to attack the}} Illyrian Provinces. The Austrians made rapid gains in the south, but in Carinthia, Hiller's first bridgehead across the Drava River at Villach was eliminated by the Franco-Italian army of Eugène de Beauharnais, the viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy. When the Austrian general established a second bridgehead at Feistritz, Eugène sent Grenier to wipe <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> minor victory only delayed the inevitable, {{and within a few}} weeks Eugène was compelled to abandon Illyria and fall back to the borders of the Kingdom of Italy.|$|E

After the Bavarians mauled Chasteler's regulars at Wörgl, the Austrian general abandoned the Tyrol and attempted to join with the retreating army in Hungary. The victory allowed the Bavarians to temporarily reoccupy Innsbruck, though not without additional fighting. The Tyrolean Rebellion, however, was far from over. Even after the regular Austrian armies met defeat at the Battle of Wagram in early July, the revolt resisted all efforts to stamp <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> back of the rebellion was finally broken in November and only fizzed out in February 1810.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the bolt}} is locked into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the bolt carrier backward a short distance. As the bolt carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, the bolt cam pin, riding in a slot on the bolt carrier, forces the bolt to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the bolt is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the bolt carrier. The bolt's rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the bolt's spring-loaded ejector forces <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|E
