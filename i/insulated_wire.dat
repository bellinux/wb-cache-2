A study on application of these wires in aircraft is also made, and finds the potential of the PTFE/PI tape wrapped <b>insulated</b> <b>wires</b> in weight saving and design optimizing...|$|R

25|$|Creep {{can cause}} gradual {{cut-through}} of wire insulation, especially when stress is concentrated by pressing <b>insulated</b> <b>wire</b> against a sharp edge or corner. Special creep-resistant insulations such as Kynar (polyvinylidene fluoride) {{are used in}} wirewrap applications to resist cut-through due to the sharp corners of wire wrap terminals. Teflon insulation is resistant to elevated temperatures and has other desirable properties, but is notoriously vulnerable to cold-flow cut-through failures caused by creep.|$|E
25|$|In a WRIM, {{the rotor}} winding {{is made of}} many turns of <b>insulated</b> <b>wire</b> and is {{connected}} to slip rings on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power {{that would otherwise be}} wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.|$|E
25|$|From 1836–7 Wheatstone {{had thought}} {{a good deal}} about {{submarine}} telegraphs, and in 1840 he gave evidence before the Railway Committee of the House of Commons on the feasibility of the proposed line from Dover to Calais. He had even designed the machinery for making and laying the cable. In the autumn of 1844, with the assistance of Mr. J. D. Llewellyn, he submerged a length of <b>insulated</b> <b>wire</b> in Swansea Bay, and signalled through it from a boat to the Mumbles Lighthouse. Next year he suggested the use of gutta-percha for the coating of the intended wire across the English Channel.|$|E

25|$|Henry {{excelled at}} his studies (so much so, {{that he would}} often help his {{teachers}} teach science) and in 1826 was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at The Albany Academy by Principal T. Romeyn Beck. Some of his most important research was conducted in this new position. His curiosity about terrestrial magnetism led him to experiment with magnetism in general. He {{was the first to}} coil <b>insulated</b> <b>wire</b> tightly around an iron core {{in order to make a}} more powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon's electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire. Using this technique, he built the strongest electromagnet at the time for Yale. He also showed that, when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery, it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel, but when using a set-up with multiple batteries, there should be only one single long coil. The latter made the telegraph feasible. Because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit Henry with discoveries pre-dating Faraday and Hertz, however, Henry is not credited due to not publishing his work.|$|E
500|$|Having {{lost his}} parents, {{his father in}} 1800 and his mother in 1805, Crosse took over the {{management}} of the family estates at the age of 21. Among his experiments Crosse erected [...] "an extensive apparatus for examining the electricity of the atmosphere," [...] incorporating at one point an <b>insulated</b> <b>wire</b> some [...] long, later shortened to , suspended from poles and trees. Using this wire he was able to determine the polarity of the atmosphere under various weather conditions. His results were published by his friend George Singer in 1814, as part of Singer's Elements of Electricity and Electro-Chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|Initially these {{telegraph}} {{lines were}} only constructed for temporary use {{because of the}} brittle exposed copper wire that was used. [...] But, after <b>insulated</b> <b>wire</b> began to be used, permanent lines were built. [...] The Telegraph Construction Corps would load a coil of this wire on a mule's back and lead it straight forward to unreel the wire. [...] As the mule moved forward unwinding the wire, two men followed and hung the line on fences and bushes {{so that it would}} not be run over until it was propped up with pikes. [...] Because these lines were so vulnerable to Confederate wire tapping and cutting, cavalry patrols kept guard of the wires when they were being built in an area lacking in Union soldiers. [...] Over the course of the war, the Telegraph Construction Corps built a total of 15, 389 miles of field, land, and submarine telegraph lines.|$|E

We were to start a little after sundown, that is, within an hour, and, having made ready my own baggage and assisted Higgs with his, we went to look for Orme and Quick, whom we found very busy {{in one of the}} rooms of an unroofed house. To all appearance they were engaged, Quick in sorting pound tins of tobacco or baking-powder, and Orme in testing an electric battery and carefully examining coils of <b>insulated</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
60|$|Among {{the other}} things which I sent to Innes was over five hundred miles of double, <b>insulated</b> <b>wire</b> of a very fine gauge. I had it packed on a special reel at his suggestion, as it was his idea that he could fasten one end here before he left and by paying it out {{through the end of}} the {{prospector}} lay a telegraph line between the outer and inner worlds. In my letter I told him to be sure to mark the terminus of the line very plainly with a high cairn, in case I was not able to reach him before he set out, so that I might easily find and communicate with him should he be so fortunate as to reach Pellucidar.|$|E
60|$|The {{attendance}} at the electrocution was a very small one. We {{four members of the}} committee were, of course, present with the executioner, who was to act under their orders. The others were the United States Marshal, the governor of the gaol, the chaplain, and three members of the press. The room was a small brick chamber, forming an out-house to the Central Electrical station. It had been used as a laundry, and had an oven and copper at one side, but no other furniture save a single chair for the condemned man. A metal plate for his feet was placed in front of it, to which ran a thick <b>insulated</b> <b>wire.</b> Above, another wire depended from the ceiling, which could be connected with a small metallic rod projecting from a cap which was to be placed upon his head. When this connection was established Duncan Warner's hour was come.|$|E

"I'll be careful, Bob.--Well then, {{you must}} know that from the year 1840 {{submarine}} cables had been tried and laid, and worked with more or less success, {{in various parts of}} the world.

Anyhow, he, being Superintendent of Electric Telegraphs in India in 1839, hauled an <b>insulated</b> <b>wire</b> across the Hooghly at Calcutta, and produced what they call `electrical phenomena' at the other side of the river. In 1840 Mr Wheatstone brought before the House of Commons the project of a cable from Dover to Calais. In 1842 Professor Morse of America laid a cable in New York harbour, and another across the canal at Washington. He also suggested the possibility of laying a cable across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1846 Colonel Colt, of revolver notoriety, and Mr Robinson, laid a wire from New York to Brooklyn, and from Long Island to Correy Island. In 1849--" ...|$|E
