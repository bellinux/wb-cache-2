50|$|Quinine has a {{long history}} {{stretching}} from Peru, and the discovery of the cinchona tree, and the potential uses of its bark, to the current day and a collection of derivatives that are still frequently used in the prevention and treatment of malaria. Quinine is an alkaloid that acts as a blood schizonticidal and weak <b>gametocide</b> against Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae. As an alkaloid, it is accumulated in the food vacuoles of Plasmodium species, especially Plasmodium falciparum. It acts by inhibiting the hemozoin biocrystallization, thus facilitating an aggregation of cytotoxic heme. Quinine is less effective and more toxic as a blood schizonticidal agent than chloroquine; however, it is still very effective and widely used in the treatment of acute cases of severe P. falciparum. It is especially useful in areas where there is known to be a high level of resistance to chloroquine, mefloquine, and sulfa drug combinations with pyrimethamine. Quinine is also used in post-exposure treatment of individuals returning from an area where malaria is endemic.|$|E
40|$|Induction of male {{sterility}} by deployment of male gametocides holds immense potential in heterosis breeding of wheat. The efficacy {{of a new}} class of male <b>gametocide</b> for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is described: ethyloxanilates, the most active example of this class being ethyl 4 -fluorooxanilate (E 4 FO). E 4 FO induces {{male sterility}}, specifically, without detectable effects on various agronomic features and female fertility. The plants sprayed once with 0. 15 % E 4 FO exhibited 100 % pollen and floret sterility without causing a significant reduction in total yield. E 4 FO was screened on 29 genotypes of wheat at 0. 15 % test concentration and was observed to induce 99. 76 ± 0. 37 % male sterility. Thirteen F 1 -hybrids of wheat were produced using the <b>gametocide</b> in Winter 2000 – 2001 and were evaluated for their agronomic performance in Winter 2001 – 2002. The cross combinations viz., lines WR 544 · HW 2046 and HW 2044 · WR 956 hav...|$|E

40|$|Three {{derivatives}} of ethyl oxanilate were synthesized {{in order}} to test their application as <b>gametocides</b> on the hermaphrodite plants like common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A substituent at para position (F, Br, CN) of aniline defined its reactivity towards diethyl oxalate 2. Classical reaction in toluene was not selective and amidation occurred also at the second carbonyl groups of 2. Alternative synthesis under solvent-free conditions with application of low pressure for removal of EtOH provided selectively with ethyl oxanilate 3 a and 3 b. 4 -Cyanoaniline did not react selectively and the corresponding ethyl oxanilate 3 c was prepared from mono acid chloride of oxalic acid. Fluoro derivative 3 a was found to be the only one that gives stable aqueous suspension for its application as chemical hybridizing agent for common wheat, while bromo- 3 b and cyano- 3 c analogues were not soluble enough and suspension was stable for less than 2 hours. Fluoro derivative had shown the best induction of male sterility, while in comparison with standard chemical hybridizing agent they were substantially less toxic for plant...|$|R
40|$|Background: Acetolactate synthase (ALS) -inhibiting {{herbicides}} amidosulfuron (Hoestar) is {{an efficient}} <b>gametocide</b> that can induce male sterility in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). We conducted an integrated study of cytological, transcriptomic, and physiological analysis {{to decipher the}} gametocidal effect of amidosulfuron. Results: In the first several days after exposure to amidosulfuron at a gametocidal dose of ca. 1 μg per plant, the plants showed the earliest symptoms including short retard of raceme elongation, slight chlorosis on leaf, and decrease of photosynthesis rate. Chloroplasts in leaf and anther epidermis, and tapetal plastids were deformed. Both tapetal cell and uni-nucleate microspore showed autophagic vacuoles and degenerated quickly. The amidosulfuron treatment caused reduction of photosynthetic rate and the contents of leaf chlorophyll, soluble sugar and pyruvate, as well as content alteration of several free amino acids in the treated plants. A comparison of transcriptomic profiling data of the young flower buds of the treated plants with the control identified 142 up-regulated and 201 down-regulated differential expression transcripts with functional annotations. Down-regulation of several interesting genes encoding PAIR 1, SDS, PPD 2, HFM 1, CSTF 77, A 6, ALA 6, UGE 1, FLA 20, A 9, bHLH 91, and putative cell wall protein LOC 106368794, and up-regulation of autophagy-related protein ATG 8 A indicated functional abnormalities about cell cycle, cell wall formation, chloroplast structure, and tissue autophagy. Ethylene-responsive transcription factor RAP 2 - 11 -like was up-regulated in the flower buds and ethylene release rate was also elevated. The transcriptional regulation in the amidosulfuron-treated plants was {{in line with the}} cytological and physiological changes. Conclusions: The results suggested that metabolic decrease related to photosynthesis and energy supply are associated with male sterility induced by amidosulfuron. The results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of gametocide-induced male sterility and expand the knowledge on the transcriptomic complexity of the plants exposure to sulfonylurea herbicide...|$|E
