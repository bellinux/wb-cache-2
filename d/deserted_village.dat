5|$|For {{several days}} the men {{attempted}} {{to salvage the}} tools and provisions that had been loaded on the Aimable, but a bad storm prevented them from recovering more than food, cannons, powder, and {{a small amount of}} the merchandise. The ship sank on March 7. The French watched the Karankawa loot the wreckage. As French soldiers approached the Native American village to retrieve their supplies, the villagers hid. On discovering the <b>deserted</b> <b>village,</b> the soldiers not only reclaimed the looted merchandise but also took animal pelts and twocanoes. The angry Karankawa attacked, killing twoFrenchmen and injuring others.|$|E
5|$|The flora of {{the island}} {{is typical of the}} Outer Hebrides with heather, {{sphagnum}} moss, sedges, grass and bracken predominating. There is but a single tree– a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff overlooking Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has grown on Mingulay since at least the late nineteenth century, and sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and seagull manure. In spring and summer there are profusions of wild flowers around the <b>deserted</b> <b>Village.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{park was}} {{established}} {{next to the}} castle; a park was highly prestigious and it enabled Thomas to engage in hunting, provided the castle with a supply of venison as well as generating income. Most of the village of Wittenham had to be destroyed {{to make way for}} the park and the site eventually became a <b>deserted</b> <b>village.</b> A new parish church, St Leonard's Chapel, was built by Thomas just outside the castle, after he had demolished the earlier, simpler 12th-century church during the construction of the inner court. Thomas died in 1397 and was buried in the newly built St Anne's Chapel, forming the north transept of St Leonard's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some}} of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a <b>deserted</b> <b>village,</b> as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and had never heard of King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E

25|$|At Ailt, Kildownet, {{you can see}} {{the remains}} of a similar <b>deserted</b> <b>village.</b> This village was deserted in 1855 when the tenants were evicted by the local {{landlord}} so the land could be used for cattle grazing, the tenants were forced to rent holdings in Currane, Dooega and Slievemore.

25|$|Valle Piola is a <b>deserted</b> <b>village</b> in the {{province}} of Teramo, in the Abruzzo region of central Italy. It is a frazione of the comune of Torricella Sicura. Having been abandoned in 1977, all that remains are 9 abandoned houses, a church, and the ruins of a shepherds' shelter. The village has recently received renewed interest from the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park authorities with the aim of restoring and revitalizing the village and its environs.|$|E
50|$|After Hoskins left Leicester the {{research}} work was continued by the <b>Deserted</b> Medieval <b>Village</b> Research Group {{based at the}} same university. The group published a list of Leicestershire <b>Deserted</b> Medieval <b>Villages</b> edited by J. G. Hurst and M. W. Beresford, in the Transactions of the Society in 1964.

25|$|No one {{has lived}} in these houses {{since the time of}} the Famine, however, the {{families}} that moved to Dooagh and their descendants, continued to use the village as a 'booley village'. This means that during the summer season, the younger members of the family, teenage boys and girls, would take the cattle to graze on the hillside and they would stay in the houses of the <b>Deserted</b> <b>Village.</b> This custom continued until the 1940s. Boolying was also carried out in other areas of Achill, including Annagh on Croaghaun mountain and in Curraun.|$|E
25|$|If {{one looks}} at the fields around the <b>Deserted</b> <b>Village</b> and right up the mountain, one can see the tracks in the fields of 'lazy beds', which is the way crops like {{potatoes}} were grown. In Achill, as in many areas of Ireland, a system called 'Rundale' was used for farming. This meant that the land around a village was rented from a landlord. This land was then shared by all the villagers to graze their cattle and sheep. Each family would then have two or three small pieces of land scattered about the village, which they used to grow crops.|$|E
25|$|If {{there were}} any Frisii left in Frisia, they fell victim {{to the whims of}} nature, civil strife and piracy. After several hundred years of {{favorable}} conditions, the natural environment in the low-lying coastal regions of northwestern Europe began to deteriorate c. 250 AD and gradually worsened over the next 200 years. Rising sea levels and storm surges combined to flood some areas. Many <b>deserted</b> <b>village</b> sites were silted over. The situation was probably aggravated by a shift to a cooler, wetter climate in the region {{as well as by the}} introduction of malaria and other epidemic diseases.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{villages in}} Ireland have been {{abandoned}} during the Middle Ages or later: Oliver Goldsmith's poem [...] "The Deserted Village" [...] (1770) being a famous commentary on rural depopulation. Notable <b>deserted</b> <b>villages</b> include: ...|$|R

25|$|Oliver Goldsmith (1730?1774) {{started his}} {{literary}} {{career as a}} hack writer in London, writing on any subject that would pay enough to keep his creditors at bay. He came {{to belong to the}} circle of Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke and Sir Joshua Reynolds. His reputation depends mainly on a novel, The Vicar of Wakefield, a play, She Stoops to Conquer, and two long poems, The Traveller and The <b>Deserted</b> <b>Village.</b> The last of these may be the first and best poem by an Irish poet in the English pastoral tradition. It has been variously interpreted as a lament for the death of Irish village life under British rule and a protest at the effects of agricultural reform on the English rural landscape.|$|E
25|$|In Troina Sandro {{questions}} the chemist {{who claimed to}} have sold tranquilizers to Anna. Claudia arrives and they learn that the woman identified by the chemist left on a bus to Noto in southern Sicily. Sandro and Claudia resume their search together and drive south. Outside Noto they stop at a <b>deserted</b> <b>village,</b> and then find a hill overlooking the town where they make love while a train goes by. Later in town they go to the Trinacria Hotel where they believe Anna is staying. Claudia asks Sandro to go in alone. While Claudia waits outside, a crowd of men gather around her. When she thinks she sees Sandro and Anna coming down the stairs she runs into a paint store, but Sandro follows and confirms that Anna is not there. Claudia remains torn between her feelings for Sandro and her friendship with Anna.|$|E
25|$|Marcel Janco {{began his}} main Israeli project in May 1953, {{after he had}} been {{mandated}} by the Israeli government to prospect the mountainous regions and delimit a new national park south of Mount Carmel. In his own account (since disputed by others), he came across the <b>deserted</b> <b>village</b> of Ein Hod, which the Palestinian Arabs had largely discarded during the 1948 exodus. Janco felt that the place should not be demolished, obtaining a lease on it from the authorities, and rebuilt the place with other Israeli artists who worked there on weekends; Janco's main residence continued to be in the neighborhood of Ramat Aviv. His plot of land in Ein Hod was previously owned by the Arab Abu Faruq, who died in 1991 at the Jenin refugee camp. Janco became the site's first mayor, reorganizing it into a utopian society, art colony and tourist attraction, and instituted the strict code of requirements for one's settlement in Ein Hod.|$|E
