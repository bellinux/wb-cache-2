40|$|INTRODUCTION : L <b>INSULINORESISTANCE,</b> FORTEMENT FAVORISEE PAR L OBESITE, EST L UN DES FREINS MAJEURS A L OBTENTION D UN BON EQUILIBRE GLYCEMIQUE DANS LE DIABETE DE TYPE 2. LA CHIRURGIE BARIATRIQUE ET LES REGIMES TRES BASSES CALORIES SE SONT RECEMMENT DEVELOPPES DANS LE TRAITEMENT DE L OBESITE, AMELIORANT AUSSI L <b>INSULINORESISTANCE.</b> LES OBJECTIFS DE CE TRAVAIL SONT D ETUDIER LES EFFETS D UN REGIME TRES BASSES CALORIES SUR LE POIDS ET L EQUILIBRE GLYCEMIQUE CHEZ DES PATIENTS OBESES ET DIABETIQUES DE TYPE 2, EN ECHEC THERAPEUTIQUE. PATIENTS ET METHODES : IL S AGIT D UNE ETUDE MONOCENTRIQUE, PROSPECTIVE ET INTERVENTIONNELLE. LES PATIENTS ONT ETE INCLUS ENTRE JANVIER 2012 ET JANVIER 2013. ILS ONT BENEFICIE D UNE PRISE EN CHARGE PAR UNE DIETETICIENNE. ILS ONT ETE EVALUES, AU MOYEN D UN EXAMEN CLINIQUE ET D UNE PRISE DE SANG, AVANT, A 3 MOIS ET A 6 MOIS DE L INSTAURATION D UN REGIME TRES BASSES CALORIES. UN QUESTIONNAIRE TELEPHONIQUE LEUR A ETE SOUMIS A LA FIN DE L ETUDE. RESULTATS : 20 PATIENTS ONT ETE INCLUS, DONT UN A ETE PERDU DE VUE. L HEMOGLOBINE GLYQUEE INITIALE EST PASSEE DE 10, 69 +- 1, 54 % A 9, 59 +- 1, 75 % A 6 MOIS (P 0, 0001). LE POIDS INITIAL EST PASSE DE 106, 87 +- 15, 5 KG A 104, 64 +- 15, 9 KG A 3 MOIS (P= 0, 043). LES DOSES D INSULINE BASALE QUOTIDIENNES INITIALES SONT PASSEES DE 46, 53 +- 32, 71 UNITES INTERNATIONALES (UI) A 38, 8 +- 33, 13 UI A 6 MOIS (P= 0, 008). LE REGIME A ETE BIEN VECU. CONCLUSION : LE REGIME TRES BASSES CALORIES EST UNE OPTION THERAPEUTIQUE INTERESSANTE ET BIEN TOLEREE CHEZ LE PATIENT DIABETIQUE DE TYPE 2 OBESE, EN ECHEC THERAPEUTIQUE.

40|$|Dementia and Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) {{are major}} health problems nowadays. DM {{leads to a}} significant cognitive decline and {{increases the risk of}} dementia, mostly Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) by 50 - 100 % and 100 - 150 %, respectively. Amyloid beta (Abeta), the main pathogenic factor in AD development, is eliminated by advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and degraded by insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) for which it competes with insulin. Insulin stimulates secretion of Abeta and promotes brain inflammation. DM I and II cause slowing down of mental speed, lowering of mental flexibility and DM II learning and memory disturbances. DM acts both directly by hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia and by the blood vessel changes. Hyperglycaemia changes synapse plasticity and leads to cognitive decline. AGEs disrupt the neuron function and bonding to Abeta increases its aggregability. Glycation of tau protein promotes production of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), the main intracellular pathogenic factor in AD. AGE 2 in DM causes pathological angiogenesis and apoptosis of neurons. AGE receptor (RAGE) is also the specific Abeta receptor with which it produces reactive oxygen species that has, as a result, disruption of mitochondrial function and reduction of neuronal energy resources. <b>Insulinoresistance</b> is linked with the dysexecutive syndrome, and hyperinsulinaemia increases the risk of AD especially by enhancing phosphorylation of tau protein and formation of NFT. Application of insulin showed improvement of memory, behaviour and affect in AD patients. Good glycoregulation emerged as an important factor in dementia prevention, and a better insight in relations of DM and brain function will lead to new potential dementia therapies. ...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} (syndrome X, Reaven's syndrome) {{is frequently}} occurring disease in Czech Republic. The diagnosis often detected only separated parts of metabolic syndrome {{which are usually}} not connected with complex of MS. Medical conditions co-occurred within this syndrome are following: elevated fasting plasma glucose (<b>insulinoresistance),</b> abdominal (central) obesity (women waistline > 88 cm, men waistline > 102 cm), elevated blood pressure, high serum triglycerides (> 1, 7 mmol/l), and low high-density cholesterol (HDL) levels (women 1, 25 mmol/l, men 1, 0 mmol/l). The incidence of MS {{can be divided into}} the prevalence of MS itself (this correspond with 30 %) and the prevalence of each individual part of MS which correspond with 80 % population. The most frequently reasons of MS are so called environmental impacts as e. g. central obesity, insulinoresustance syndrome, fatty liver, systemic inflammation, intestinal alterations, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, foetal malnutrition, low basal energetic outcome, sleep apnoea syndrome, changes of gut flora, hyperglycaemia and cumulation of visceral fat. This bachelor´s work is concerned with eating habits, life style and other factors which could be reason of described metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study is evaluation of eating habits and life style of patients suffered from MS before syndrome outbreak, as well as participation of obesity in MS outbreak assessment. Two explorative questions were formulated on the basis of described goals: First research question: Did the MS patients follow principles of healthy eating before syndrome outbreak? Second research question: Does obesity {{have a significant effect on}} MS outbreak? Definition and characterization of MS in relation to diet is described in theoretical part of my work as well as explanation for reasons of MS outbreak, descriptions of each separated diseases of MS complex and their treatment. Metabolic syndrome in connection with obesity and its classification into each level is defined inthis part. Obesity treatment together with prevention and treatment of MS are suggested in terminal part of this section. In practical part of work, the results of own research are presented. This section is focused on: 5. evaluation of eating habits before MS outbreak; 6. obesity incidence in MS patients; 7. patient´s life style; 8. the presence of individual diseases participate in MS. Research part of my bachelor´s work is prepared with using of quantitative assessment, which was done by questionnaire investigation in southbohemian and westbohemian region. Research population consists of thirty gender-nonspecific and age various patients diagnosed as having MS. The research questions were focused on mapping of respondent´s eating habits, life style (smoking, movement activity, daily eating portions and breakfast regularity), previous and current illnesses as well as diseases of respondent´s relations. The aim of described investigation was evaluation of obesity, life style and diet participations in MS outbreak. The results did not prove observance of healthy eating principles in MS patients before and after syndrome outbreak, while most of respondents were overweight or obesity. It can be assumed that genetic predispositions play role in MS outbreak. Additionally, very interesting is detected occurrence of MS in many individuals younger then forty years old. The present work extended the knowledge about risk factors of MS outbreak together with eating habits, obesity and MS outbreak connections. When reasons of MS seem to be more clear, it is easier to establish new more effective prevention. On the basis of the results, it can be arranged diet suggestions useable as effective prevention of MS outbreak...|$|E
