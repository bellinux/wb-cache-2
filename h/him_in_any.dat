5|$|Although Fuchs {{had given}} Ruth his {{unconditional}} release, no major league team {{expressed an interest}} in hiring <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> capacity. Ruth still hoped to be hired as a manager if he could not play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement {{and the end of the}} 1937 season. Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner Alva Bradley replied negatively.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Odessa, {{where he}} {{discovered}} {{that no one would}} employ <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> job other than as an actor. In 1882, he put together a troupe of his own with Keni Liptzin, and brought Rosenberg in as a partner. This troupe toured to Rostov, Taganrog, around Lithuania, to Dünaburg (now Daugavpils, Latvia). Aiming to bring the troupe to Saint Petersburg, they brought back their sometime manager Chaikel Bain. They were in Riga in August 1883 when the news arrived that a total ban was about to be placed on Yiddish theater in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the tournament}} in Poland and Ukraine, Balotelli {{was interviewed by}} a {{newspaper}} about racism amongst fans in the host countries. During the interview, Balotelli reiterated his threat to walk off the pitch {{if any of the}} opposition fans racially abused <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way, and said that he would 'kill' anyone that threw a banana at him. He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan. During the build-up to the competition Manchester City's manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, but he and footballer Daniele De Rossi believed that Mario would need to grow up and mature {{if he was going to}} become the centrepiece of future Italian success.|$|E

5|$|Nasr {{was one of}} the few Muslim {{leaders to}} {{distinguish}} himself in the disastrous Battle of the Defile in July 731. In 734 he was appointed as governor of Balkh, after arresting the previous governor. There he faced the rebellion of the local Khurasani troops under al-Harith ibn Surayj, who called for reforms in taxation and the ending of discrimination towards the native converts (mawali). Ibn Surayj marched on Balkh and took the city with only 4,000 followers, even though Nasr commanded 10,000 men. It is unclear from the sources whether the town was seized from Nasr, or whether it was captured in his absence and then successfully held against <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>any</b> case, Nasr and his army remained passive for the remainder of the revolt; they did not aid the provincial capital, Merv, when the rebels attacked it, and this stance encouraged several local tribes to join the uprising. Eventually however the rebels were defeated by Juday' al-Kirmani, with Ibn Surayj fleeing across the Oxus to the Turgesh.|$|E
5|$|Podgorny's {{life after}} his {{resignation}} {{is not well}} documented. The last mention of <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> major Soviet media was his meeting with Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland. There was never any explanation given, nor a denunciation of him, by the Soviet authorities. Podgorny retained his seat in the Supreme Soviet after his downfall. He was seen at the 61st anniversary reception of the October Revolution at the Grand Palace of the Kremlin in November 1978 by Tokichiro Uomoto, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Podgorny spoke to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and then to Andrei Gromyko, all of whom looked embarrassed {{by the presence of}} Podgorny, according to Uomoto. Soon after this incident, Podgorny lost his seat in the Supreme Soviet. In Tretyakov Gallery, Podgorny was removed from the 1977 painting of the Soviet leaders at the Red Square by Dmitriy Nalbandyan in which Podgorny stood between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Podgorny died of cancer on 12 January 1983, and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery.|$|E

25|$|Commentators such as Leo Strauss {{have gone}} so far as to name Machiavelli as the {{deliberate}} originator of modernity itself. Others have argued that Machiavelli is only a particularly interesting example of trends which were happening around <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>any</b> case Machiavelli presented himself at various times as someone reminding Italians of the old virtues of the Romans and Greeks, and other times as someone promoting a completely new approach to politics.|$|E

25|$|In August 2007, Vander Ark was {{contacted}} by Roger Rapoport, President of RDR Books, and {{asked about the}} possibility of publishing a for-profit print version of the site.

To further pacify Vander Ark's concerns, he added an addendum to the contract that stated that RDR Books would act to defend <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> future lawsuits.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his return}} from the Hungarian expedition, Godfrey of Lorraine began seeking out allies, among them Henry of France, to support <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> {{possible}} act of overt insurrection. Seeing this, the emperor summoned Godfrey to Aachen for a trial by his peers of Lower Lorraine. He was condemned, and his duchy and county of Verdun (a royal fief) were seized. He immediately fled the scene and began arming for revolt. Henry wintered at Speyer, with civil war clearly in view on the horizon.|$|E
25|$|In the 1770s, Crabbe {{began his}} career as a doctor's apprentice, later {{becoming}} a surgeon. In 1780, he travelled to London to make a living as a poet. After encountering serious financial difficulty and being unable to have his work published, he wrote to the statesman and author Edmund Burke for assistance. Burke was impressed enough by Crabbe's poems to promise to help <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way he could. The two became close friends and Burke helped Crabbe greatly both in his literary career and in building a role within the church.|$|E

25|$|Aurangzeb {{received}} the embassy of Abbas II of Persia in 1660 and returned them with gifts. However {{relations between the}} Mughal Empire and the Safavid dynasty were tense because the Persians attacked the Mughal army positioned near Kandahar. Aurangzeb prepared his armies in the Indus River Basin for a counteroffensive, but Abbas II's death in 1666 caused Aurangzeb to end all hostilities. Aurangzeb's rebellious son, Sultan Muhammad Akbar, sought refuge with Suleiman I of Persia, who had rescued him from the Imam of Musqat and later refused to assist <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> military adventures against Aurangzeb.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Taylor's {{relationship}} with Khánh had already broken {{down over the}} issue of the HNC, and the U.S. became more intent on a regime change as Khánh was reliant on Buddhist support, which they saw as an obstacle to an expansion of the war. Knowing that he was close to being forced out, Khánh tried to start negotiations with the communists, but this only increased the plotting. In early February, Taylor told Kỳ, who then passed on the message to colleagues in the junta, that the United States was “in no way propping up General Khanh or backing <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> fashion.” Taylor thought his message had been effective.|$|E
25|$|The merchants of Lisbon allied {{themselves}} with the lower and the middle Portuguese nobility and entreated the Duke of Braganza to accept the throne. According to some historians he was really as indifferent as he seemed {{and it was the}} ambition of his wife and of his allies that made him king. Some of them assert as well that the duke was hesitant because he, {{like the rest of the}} high nobility, benefited by Madrid's rule, but that the prospect of becoming king finally persuaded <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>any</b> event, on 1 December 1640, the conspirators assailed the royal palace and the citadel of Lisbon, and meeting little resistance, acclaimed the duke as the new King of Portugal, John IV (João IV).|$|E

25|$|Samāvartanam (Sanskrit: समावर्तनम्). Most of {{the fourth}} canto deals with {{description}} of nature, especially the rainy season and the Āśrama of Jamadagni in the forest. Śiva permits Paraśurāma to leave in order to returns to his parents' home. When Paraśurāma is leaving, Śiva requests the Rāma Avatāra to forgive him if he disrespected <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way while instructing him as a guru. On hearing this, Paraśurāma has tears in his eyes. After bowing to Śiva and Pārvatī, and meeting their sons Gaṇeśa and Kārttikeya, Paraśurāma sets out to return. The rainy season arrives as Paraśurāma is returning home, and it is described in 44 verses (4.7–4.50). Paraśurāma enters the Āśrama of Jamadagni, which is described in 21 verses (4.61–4.81). Jamadagni and Reṇukā are elated to see their son back. Paraśurāma starts living in the Āśrama and with his actions and character, pleases all the monks and hermits in the Āśrama.|$|E
25|$|In the 1992–1993 Total International Series in South Africa (involving Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa), he took 5 wickets against South Africa {{and got his}} 200th wicket in his 143rd match. Akram took 46 wickets in {{calendar}} year 1993, his best year ever in ODIs. His average was less than 19, with an economy rate of less than 3.8 runs per over.

In the 1996 Cricket World Cup, Akram missed the quarterfinal match against India which Pakistan lost and {{went out of the}} World Cup. Wasim's great career was often tainted by controversy, not least in the Caribbean in April 1993, his maiden tour as Pakistan's captain. During the team's stop-over in Grenada, he was arrested along with three teammates—Waqar Younis, Aaqib Javed and Mushtaq Ahmed—and two female British tourists; he was charged with possession of marijuana.
