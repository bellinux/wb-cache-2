50|$|Pig iron {{had been}} {{exported}} from Virginia and Maryland since the 1720s, but little came from other colonies, nor did <b>bar</b> <b>iron.</b> The continuance {{of this was}} encouraged, as was the production and export of <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> (which required a finery forge using a helve hammer not a trip hammer).|$|R

50|$|<b>Bar</b> <b>iron</b> thus {{continued}} normally to be {{made with}} charcoal pig iron until the mid-1750s. In 1755 Abraham Darby II (with partners) opened a new coke-using furnace at Horsehay in Shropshire, and {{this was followed by}} others. These supplied coke pig iron to finery forges of the traditional kind for the production of <b>bar</b> <b>iron.</b> The reason for the delay remains controversial.|$|R

50|$|Wood (for charcoal) {{came from}} the nearby chases of Bringewood, Mocktree and Darvel. Though the {{possibility}} of mining locally is mentioned in some leases, {{it is probable that}} the main source of ore was Titterstone Clee Hill. Pig <b>iron,</b> <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> and blackplate, made in the works were carried by land to Bewdley for sale, so far as not sold locally. Bringewood <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> enjoyed a high reputation as being tough.|$|R

50|$|Hot bar sealers- have heated tooling kept at a {{constant}} temperature (also known as Direct Contact Thermal Sealing). They use one or more heated <b>bars,</b> <b>irons,</b> or dies which contact the material to heat the interface and form a bond. The <b>bars,</b> <b>irons</b> and dies have various configurations and can be covered with a release layer or utilize various slick interposer materials (i.e. Teflon films) to prevent sticking to the hot tooling.|$|R

The project was concerned {{with the role of}} international commerce and mercantile networks in the early phases of British industrialisation. Specifically, it was concerned with the operation of the market for malleable <b>bar</b> <b>iron.</b> Between 1650 and 1800 domestic ironmasters were unable to meet the growing demand for <b>bar</b> <b>iron.</b> The shortfall was made good by imports from the Baltic, first from Sweden, then from Russia. The objective of the project was to uncover the links in the global commodity chain that stretched from the mining district of central Sweden to Britain and beyond. By doing so, the destination of <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> imports can be plotted, allowing regional markets and specialised production zones to be detected, illuminating the operation {{of one of the most}} important industrial commodity markets of the era. As a further step, the role of mercantile networks in Britain in developing new patterns of metalware manufacture, orientated upon export markets in the Atlantic world, is brought to light. Main Topics : The data collection comprises a complete record of <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> sales by the Bristol iron merchant Graffin Prankard between 1732 and 1739. The date of the transaction, the name of the buyer, his or her location, the type of <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> sold, its weight, and its price (per ton) have been recorded. Each buyer is allotted a code to facilitate the sorting of this data by region...|$|R

50|$|The species largely {{feeds on}} {{crustaceans}} and bivalve molluscs that it excavates from the seabed. Other items in its diet include polychaete worms, gastropod molluscs, sea pens and small fish. Instead of having pointed teeth, it has flattened <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bars</b> and plates {{arranged in a}} mosaic pattern on its jaws; with these, it crushes the shells of its prey.|$|R
5000|$|Such <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> {{might be}} carried {{coastwise}} or by land {{from there to}} Royal Navy dockyards, but otherwise not beyond 10 miles from London.|$|R
50|$|The town {{sits on a}} rich iron deposit, and {{the region}} once {{produced}} pig <b>iron</b> and <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> for farm tools and cast iron ware.|$|R
500|$|Another 19th-century {{steelmaking}} process was the Siemens-Martin process, which complemented the Bessemer process. [...] It consisted of co-melting <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> (or steel scrap) with pig iron.|$|R
50|$|Puddling was {{one step}} {{in one of}} the most {{important}} processes of making the first appreciable volumes of high-grade <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> (malleable wrought iron) during the Industrial Revolution. In the original puddling technique, molten iron in a reverberatory furnace was stirred with rods, which were consumed in the process. It was one of the first processes for making <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> without charcoal in Europe, although much earlier coal-based processes had existed in China. Eventually, the furnace would be used to make small quantities of specialty steels.|$|R

50|$|The {{limitation}} of imported <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> to London and the dockyards was partly repealed in 1757 by 30 Geo. II c.16, duty-free imports to {{any part of}} Great Britain being permitted. A clause requiring <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> to be marked was similarly repealed as unnecessary. A part of the act was also repealed by the American dominions (Trade with) Act 1765, (5 Geo. III c.45). The whole Act was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1867, due to the replacement of colonial rule with the Dominion of Canada.|$|R

50|$|Shingling was a {{stage in}} the {{production}} of <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> or steel, in the finery and puddling processes. As with many ironmaking terms, this is derived from the French - cinglage.|$|R
50|$|Dannemora is the {{location}} of an important iron ore mine, the Dannemora mine, which {{formed the basis of}} the iron industry in Uppland. It provided the raw material for about 20 finery forges that produced <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> for export. In England, iron produced from Dannemora ore, was known as oregrounds iron, after the port town of Öregrund. <b>Bar</b> <b>iron</b> from these forges was considered the best raw material for producing blister steel by the cementation process, owing mainly to the extremely low levels of sulphur and phosphorus in the ores but also to the relatively high manganese content.|$|R
5000|$|In the 16th {{century and}} the early 17th century, the Weald was {{a major source of}} iron for {{manufacture}} in London, peaking at over 9000 tons per year in the 1590s. [...] However, after 1650, Wealden production became increasingly focused on the production of cannon; and <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> was only produced for local consumption. This decline may have begun as early as the 1610s, when Midland ironware began to be sold in London. Certainly after Swedish iron began to be imported in large quantities after the Restoration, Wealden <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> seems to have been unable to compete in the London market.|$|R
5000|$|Oregrounds iron—a {{particularly}} pure {{grade of}} <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> made ultimately from iron ore from the Dannemora mine in Sweden. Its most important use was as {{the raw material}} for the cementation process of steelmaking.|$|R
50|$|A {{cementation}} furnace {{might be used}} to convert the <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> (if it was pure enough) into blister steel by the cementation process, either {{as an end in itself}} or as the raw material for crucible steel.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bar</b> <b>iron</b> is {{a generic}} term {{sometimes}} used to {{distinguish it from}} cast iron. It {{is the equivalent of}} an ingot of cast metal, in a convenient form for handling, storage, shipping and further working into a finished product.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from some}} {{production}} of puddled steel, English steel {{continued to be}} made by the cementation process, sometimes followed by remelting to produce crucible steel. These were batch-based processes whose raw material was <b>bar</b> <b>iron,</b> particularly Swedish oregrounds iron.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the Industrial Revolution was the development of large-scale methods of producing forgeable metal (<b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> or steel). The puddling furnace was initially a means of producing wrought iron, but was later applied to steel production.|$|R

50|$|By 1786, {{when the}} {{operators}} were Baille, Pocock and Co., the site had two blast furnaces, which could each produce 40 tons of iron a week, air furnaces, two <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> forges and three steam engines. The site manufactured cannon.|$|R
50|$|One {{common type}} of wrench is shown on the right. The loop of chain is placed around the filter, and the bar is turned {{anticlockwise}} by hand until the chain wraps itself tightly around the filter. A socket wrench or adjustable spanner is then used to turn the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bar</b> further in the same direction. This increases {{the tension in the}} chain, which bites into the soft metal casing of the oil filter which helps prevent slippage.|$|R
