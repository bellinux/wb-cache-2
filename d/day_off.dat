5|$|Four {{days after}} the Scotland Test the All Blacks faced West of Scotland in Glasgow. The cities' {{secondary}} schools were given half a <b>day</b> <b>off</b> to watch the match. The All Blacks scored six tries {{on the way to}} a 22–0 victory. The team then travelled to Ireland, for their third Test.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Two {{intensified}} over open waters, the season's third {{storm was}} identified on August9. Initially tracking westward, the hurricane turned sharply north, maintaining an intensity of 85mph (140km/h) during its known existence. Briefly slowing on August11, the system quickly picked up forward speed {{as it turned}} northwestward, paralleling the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula. On August14, the hurricane turned north once more; however, it lost its identity the following <b>day</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Baja California.|$|E
5000|$|The Ten <b>Days</b> <b>Off</b> Festival {{is held in}} Ghent, Belgium. The Five <b>Days</b> <b>Off</b> {{music and}} arts festival in Amsterdam Netherlands was spun off from the Ten <b>Days</b> <b>Off</b> event in 2001. Started in 1995, [...] "'10 Days Off'" [...] began as a 10-day-long Belgian celebration of techno music which has since grown to be a yearly club event. Acting {{on the idea of}} Rudy Ackaert, 10 <b>days</b> <b>off</b> started with a small [...] "trial" [...] event and grew into a large techno event. Takes place in several concert venues in the cities of Ghent, Belgium and Amsterdam, The Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|... 10 <b>Days</b> <b>Off</b> {{began as}} 10 Days Of Techno in 1995. A {{couple of years}} later the name was changed to 10 <b>Days</b> <b>Off</b> and since then all genres of {{electronic}} music could be seen, heard and experienced at the festival.|$|R

5|$|Brookwood {{was one of}} the few cemeteries {{to permit}} burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend {{funerals}} without the need to take a <b>day</b> <b>off</b> work. As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time, it also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason, to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{said that}} {{the day of the}} fire, about a month after Farrar's last release from the hospital, he had taken the <b>day</b> <b>off</b> from work—the first day of what he {{intended}} to be a week-long vacation to recover some strength after restarting his job post-hospital. He had spent the afternoon with Margaret Hacker and then picked up Tim and Kelly for Tim's hockey game. After dropping the children back off with their mother at about 8:45, he had dinner with Hacker, leaving her around 11:15 in the evening.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dolores was {{regarded}} as the worst hurricane to strike Acapulco since 1938. Developing on June13, 1974, the system rapidly organized into a tropical storm the next <b>day</b> <b>off</b> the southern coast of Mexico. Over the following day, Dolores developed an eye-like feature and attained hurricane status. With peak winds of 80mph (130km/h), the storm made landfall near Acapulco. Once onshore, Dolores rapidly dissipated and was last noted on June17.|$|E

5|$|On Christmas Day, the Expedition 1 {{crew were}} given the <b>day</b> <b>off</b> work. They opened {{presents}} delivered by Endeavour and the Progress supply ship. They also each took turns speaking to their families. In the following days they did several video downlinks, some with Russian TV stations. The crew had a quiet New Year. Citing a Naval tradition, for the New Year's entry of the station's log, Shepherd provided a poem {{on behalf of the}} crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{search and}} rescue efforts for Holloway began immediately. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined in the effort. During {{the first days of}} the search, the Aruban {{government}} gave thousands of civil servants the <b>day</b> <b>off</b> to participate in the rescue effort. Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline. Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams. Beth Twitty was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she coincidentally stayed in the same room her daughter had occupied. She subsequently stayed at the nearby Wyndham Hotel's presidential suite.|$|E
50|$|One {{shift system}} may allow many shift plans. For example, the twelve-hour, 2nW:2nF system with n = 1 allows twelve {{different}} plans in three serially-identical sets. Within a set, DONO {{has the same}} sequence as NODO. DNOO is the preferred sequence because <b>days</b> <b>off</b> follow night work {{and there are two}} consecutive <b>days</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R

Scrooge, an old miser, hates Christmas and refuses an invitation to Christmas dinner from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men who seek a donation from him in order to provide food and heating for the poor, and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas <b>Day</b> <b>off</b> with pay to conform to the social custom.|$|E
5|$|When the Germans invaded France on 10 May 1940, Panthère {{was being}} {{refitted}} at Toulon {{and her sisters}} were still escorting convoys. Jaguar, Léopard and Chacal {{were assigned to the}} Northern Command on 22 May to support Allied forces on the French coast. Jaguar was sunk the next <b>day</b> <b>off</b> Dunkirk and Chacal on the evening of 23/24 May near Boulogne by German bombers. Léopard remained in the area and bombarded advancing German forces near the northern French coast. After the surrender of France, she was seized by the British in July and turned over to the Free French the following month.|$|E
5|$|Affected by her {{association}} with Cheng Shuyao, Shangguan {{did not play}} any major role for several years. This changed in 1955, when she starred in the film Storm on the Southern Island. Director Bai Chen (白沉) chose her to play the leading role as a heroic nurse, {{a far cry from}} her traditional roles of socialites and rich wives. She adjusted to her new role well, and portrayed a wide variety of characters in many films including It's My <b>Day</b> <b>Off</b> (1959), Spring Comes to the Withered Tree (1961, director Zheng Junli), Early Spring in February (1963, director Xie Tieli), and Stage Sisters (1965, director Xie Jin).

They took their traditional on-orbit crew portrait, and spoke with reporters from around the world in a news conference. The crew also had the opportunity to speak with the Expedition 19 crew on board the International Space Station, in a conference call routed through satellites. The station crew congratulated them on a very successful mission, and {{the crew of}} Atlantis expressed their gratitude to the station crew for all the work they do during their long duration stays on the station.|$|E
5|$|After the German Army {{captured}} much of Belgium {{following the}} Battle of the Frontiers in 1914, the Allied forces were left holding a thin strip of coastline {{to the west}} of the Yser. The remainder of the Belgian coast came under the occupation of German Marine Divisions, including the important strategic ports of Antwerp and Bruges. A network of canals connected Bruges with the coast at Ostend and Zeebrugge, through which small warships such as destroyers, light cruisers and submarines could travel and find a safe harbour from which to launch raids into the English Channel and along the coasts of southeast England. U-boats could also depart from Bruges at night, cutting a <b>day</b> <b>off</b> the journey to the Western Approaches, more easily avoiding the North Sea Mine Barrage and allowing U-boat captains to gain familiarity with the net and mine defences of the English Channel, through which they had to pass to reach the main battlegrounds of the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in California, Hershberger {{attended}} Fullerton Union High School {{where he was a}} baseball standout. He was signed by the New York Yankees and was part of their minor league system for eight years. He was traded after the 1937 season to the Cincinnati Reds, where he found a place on the major league roster as a backup behind Ernie Lombardi. For three seasons, Hershberger played in relief of Lombardi, stepping in if he needed a <b>day</b> <b>off</b> or was injured. After a slump in late July and early August, Hershberger committed suicide on August 3, 1940 in his hotel room; the Reds {{went on to win the}} 1940 World Series in his honor.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{algorithm}} is {{developed for the}} problem of assigning <b>days</b> <b>off</b> to full-time staff given a cyclic seven-day demand pattern. The formulation assumes that employees are entitled to two consecutive <b>days</b> <b>off</b> each week and that {{the objective is to}} find a minimum staff size capable of meeting the requirements. The algorithm involves only hand calculations, and its computing effort is predictable. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies a {{two-phase}} decomposition {{approach to}} solve the personnel scheduling problem. The first phase creates a <b>days</b> <b>off</b> schedule, indicating working <b>days</b> and <b>days</b> <b>off</b> for each employee. The second phase assigns shifts to the working days in the <b>days</b> <b>off</b> schedule. This decomposition is motivated {{by the fact that}} personnel scheduling constraints are often divided in two categories: one specifies constraints on working <b>days</b> and <b>days</b> <b>off,</b> while the other specifies constraints on shift assignments. To assess the consequences of the decomposition approach, we apply it to public benchmark instances, and compare this to solving the personnel scheduling problem directly. In all steps we use mathematical programming. We also study the extension that includes night shifts in thefirst phase of the decomposition. We present a detailed results analysis, and analyze the effect of various instance parameters on the decompositions' results. In general, we observe that the decompositions significantly reduce the computation time, and that they produce good solutions for most instances...|$|R
