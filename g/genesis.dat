5|$|Form critics {{variously}} assign passages like <b>Genesis</b> chapter 26, verses 6–11, to the Jahwist source, and <b>Genesis</b> chapter 20 verses 1–7, chapter 21, verse 1 to chapter 22, verse 14 and chapter 22, verse 19 to the Elohist. According to the compilation hypothesis, the formulaic use of {{the word}} toledoth (generations) indicates that <b>Genesis</b> chapter 11, verse 27 to chapter 25, verse 19 is Isaac's record through Abraham's death (with Ishmael's record appended), and <b>Genesis</b> chapter 25, verse 19 to chapter 37, verse 2 is Jacob's record through Isaac's death (with Esau's records appended).|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the band's studio albums from Trespass to Calling All Stations were {{digitally}} remastered by Nick Davis {{across three}} box sets: <b>Genesis</b> 1970–1975, <b>Genesis</b> 1976–1982 and <b>Genesis</b> 1983–1998. Each album {{is presented as}} a two-disc set containing a CD/Super Audio CD of a new stereo mix and a DVD with a 5.1 surround sound mix and bonus features including previously unreleased live performances, interviews, and concert programs.

5|$|It was {{announced}} that TecToy has developed a new <b>Genesis</b> console that not only looks almost {{identical to the original}} model of the Sega <b>Genesis</b> known as the <b>Genesis</b> III, but also has a traditional cartridge slot and SD card reader which will be released in June 2017.|$|E
5|$|Sega sold 30.75 million <b>Genesis</b> units worldwide. Of these, 3.58 million {{were sold}} in Japan, and sales in Europe and the U.S. are roughly {{estimated}} at 8 million and 18 million as of June 1997 (at which time Sega was no longer manufacturing the system) respectively. In 1998, Sega licensed the <b>Genesis</b> to Majesco Entertainment in North America so it could re-release the console. Majesco began reselling millions of formerly unsold cartridges at a budget price, together with 150,000 units of the second model of the <b>Genesis.</b> It released the Sega <b>Genesis</b> 3, projecting to sell 1.5 million units of the console {{by the end of}} 1998. An estimated 3 million <b>Genesis</b> units were sold by Tec Toy in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Genesis</b> {{version of}} the game sold 1.02 million copies in the United States. While Sonic 1s {{worldwide}} sales have been estimated at 15 million and Sonic 2s at 6 million, Sonic 3, unlike these two, was not bundled with the <b>Genesis</b> console itself. However, Sonic 3 {{is still one of}} the best-selling <b>Genesis</b> games of all time.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Genesis</b> was {{the first}} Sega console to receive {{third-party}} versions. Its first variants were released before any Master System variants, even though the <b>Genesis</b> was released {{three years after the}} Master System. Working with Sega Enterprises, JVC released the Wondermega, a Mega Drive and Mega CD combination with high quality audio, in Japan on April 1, 1992. The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. A Pioneer LaserActive add-on pack, developed by Sega, allows the system to play <b>Genesis</b> and Sega CD games. Aiwa released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox. Several companies added the <b>Genesis</b> to personal computers, mimicking the design of Sega's TeraDrive; these include the MSX models AX-330 and AX-990 distributed in Kuwait and Yemen, and the Amstrad Mega PC distributed in Europe and Australia. After the <b>Genesis</b> was discontinued, Majesco Entertainment released the <b>Genesis</b> 3 in North America as a budget version of the console in 1998. Majesco also released a budget version of the Sega Pico in North America in August 1999.|$|E
5|$|With its sequels for the <b>Genesis,</b> Sonic the Hedgehog {{has been}} ported {{for a wide}} range of home and {{handheld}} consoles and personal computers through compilations. The first collection the game appeared in was Sonic Compilation (1995) for the <b>Genesis.</b> The game has since appeared in Sonic Jam (1997) for the Sega Saturn, Sonic Mega Collection (2002), Sonic Mega Collection Plus (2004), Sega <b>Genesis</b> Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PSP, Sonic's Ultimate <b>Genesis</b> Collection (2009) for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Sonic Classic Collection (2010) for the Nintendo DS, and Oculus Arcade for the Oculus Rift.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 900 people {{attended}} <b>Genesis.</b> Canadian Online Explorer writer Corey David Lacroix rated the entire event an 8 out of 10, which {{was higher than}} the 2006 edition with 5 out of 10 from Bob Kapur. The <b>Genesis</b> ranking was lower than Bound for Glory's rating, which received a 9 out of 10 from Bob Kapur. TNA's next PPV event Turning Point was ranked lower than Genesis; it received a 7 out of 10 from Bob Kapur. <b>Genesis</b> was ranked higher than TNA's Victory Road held the previous November. Victory Road was given a 5 out of 10 from Jason Clevett. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) Survivor Series PPV event, <b>Genesis</b> out-performed it, as it was given a 6.5 out of 10 by Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk.|$|E
5|$|Among most scholars, {{the traditions}} of <b>Genesis</b> are no longer {{regarded}} as being historically reliable.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{accounts}} of ancient breeds of piebald sheep {{is the story}} of Jacob from the first book of the Hebrew Bible, called by Christians the Old Testament. According to the Book of <b>Genesis</b> (<b>Genesis</b> 30:3143), Jacob took every speckled and spotted sheep from his father-in-law's (Laban's) flock and bred them. Due to the resemblance to the animal described in <b>Genesis,</b> the Jacob sheep was named for the Biblical figure of Jacob sometime in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} two predecessors, Sonic 3 was a {{critical}} and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. It sold over one million copies in the United States; though this makes {{it one of the}} best-selling <b>Genesis</b> games, its predecessors, bundled with the <b>Genesis</b> in some regions, had sold a combined 21million. The game has been re-released in compilations and download releases for various platforms, including Sonic Mega Collection for the GameCube and Sonic's Ultimate <b>Genesis</b> Collection for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|By this time, <b>Genesis</b> were {{suffering}} from press attention being exclusively directed towards frontman Gabriel {{at the expense}} of the rest of the band, a notable factor that ultimately led to Gabriel leaving the group in 1975. They took an extended break in 1974 following the Selling England by the Pound tour; Collins joined a side project, Brand X, while Rutherford worked with former <b>Genesis</b> guitarist Anthony Phillips.|$|E
5|$|Compilations {{that include}} the game are Sonic Compilation (1995) for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis; Sonic Jam (1997) for the Sega Saturn; Sonic Mega Collection (2002) for the Nintendo GameCube; Sonic Mega Collection Plus (2004) for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC; Sega <b>Genesis</b> Collection (2006) for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable; Sonic's Ultimate <b>Genesis</b> Collection (2009) for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3; and Sonic Classic Collection (2010) for the Nintendo DS.|$|E
5|$|<b>Genesis</b> (2005) was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion that took place on November13, 2005 at the Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the first event under the <b>Genesis</b> name and eleventh event in the 2005 TNA PPV schedule. Seven professional wrestling matches and two pre-show matches were featured on the event's card, one of which involved a championship.|$|E
5|$|<b>Genesis</b> {{have been}} {{estimated}} to have sold between 100–150 million albums worldwide. Their total certified album sales include 21.5 million in the US, 7.2 million in the UK, 5.6 million in Germany, and 3.4 million in France. <b>Genesis</b> have been awarded with eleven Gold and four Multi-Platinum albums in the UK, while in the US they have seven Gold, two Platinum, and four Multi-Platinum albums.|$|E
5|$|George Harrison first {{worked with}} <b>Genesis</b> Publications on his 1980 autobiography, I Me Mine, for which his friend Derek Taylor served as editor and narrator. Harrison {{subsequently}} edited Taylor's memoir, Fifty Years Adrift, which <b>Genesis</b> published in its customary, limited-edition, deluxe format in 1984. That year, Brian Roylance, {{the owner of}} <b>Genesis</b> Publications, met a New Zealand-based botanical artist named Keith West, whose work Roylance considered might be suitable for a proposed illustrated book of Harrison's songs.|$|E
5|$|Mega ranked it {{the fifth}} best <b>Genesis</b> game ever in November 1994. In 2014, GamesRadar ranked Sonic 3 & Knuckles as the seventh best <b>Genesis</b> game; Jeremy Parish of US Gamer ranked the {{combined}} title eighth {{on a similar}} list in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{because of}} its <b>Genesis</b> bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog contributed to the console's {{popularity}} in North America. During October–December 1991, the <b>Genesis</b> outsold the Super NES by a two-to-one ratio, and at its January 1992 peak claimed 65 {{percent of the market}} for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually again overtook Sega, {{this was the first time}} since December 1985 that the company did not lead the console market.|$|E
5|$|SOLDIERs Zack Fair and Angeal Hewley are {{dispatched}} to Wutai {{to support the}} Shinra war effort. However, during the fighting, Angeal disappears, and Zack is appointed to find both him and an already missing SOLDIER, <b>Genesis</b> Rhapsodos. Zack, accompanied by Tseng, finds that <b>Genesis</b> and Angeal have betrayed Shinra, and, as such, Zack and Sephiroth are assigned to kill them. With help from Dr. Hollander, a scientist with a vendetta against Shinra, <b>Genesis</b> creates an army of clones to attack Shinra headquarters. After the forces are defeated, Zack and Sephiroth track down Hollander's secret laboratory, and learn that Hollander had used both <b>Genesis</b> and Angeal as part of Project G, an attempt to create soldiers infused with Jenova cells. Sephiroth faces off against <b>Genesis,</b> whilst Zack pursues Hollander. However, Angeal is intent on keeping Hollander alive as he wants {{to find a way}} to return to normal, and so he prevents Zack from killing the doctor by knocking Zack into the slums of Midgar.|$|E
5|$|Songs by George Harrison was {{published}} on 15 February 1988, with the <b>Genesis</b> Publications catalogue number SGH 777. The print run {{was limited to}} 2500, with each copy signed by Harrison and West. The book was priced at £235 and available via mail order only. <b>Genesis</b> also offered the book as a limited-edition series of enlarged prints.|$|E
5|$|The 32X is {{considered}} a commercial failure. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price {{of the system and}} power expansion to the <b>Genesis.</b> Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the <b>Genesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Genesis</b> Awards {{are awarded}} {{annually}} by The Humane Society of the United States. Megadeth {{has received the}} award once.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Genesis</b> version sold 1.24 {{million copies}} in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Sega CD {{can only}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a <b>Genesis</b> system, attaching through an expansion slot {{on the side of the}} main console. Though the Sega CD is an add-on, it does require its own separate power supply. In addition to playing its own library of games in CD-ROM format, the Sega CD can also play compact discs, karaoke CD+G discs, and can also be {{used in conjunction with}} the 32X to play 32-bit games that utilize both add-ons. The second model, also known as the Sega CD 2, also includes a steel joining plate to be screwed into the bottom of the <b>Genesis,</b> as well as an extension spacer to work with the original model of the <b>Genesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sega CD {{received}} several variations during its lifetime, of which Sega constructed three. The original model utilized a front-loading motorized disc tray and sat underneath the <b>Genesis.</b> Sega later released the second {{model of the}} Sega CD, which was redesigned {{to sit next to}} the <b>Genesis</b> console and featured a top-loading disc tray in place of the motorized tray of the original model. In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released the <b>Genesis</b> CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console was a combination of the <b>Genesis</b> and Sega CD in one unit and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable compact disc player.|$|E
5|$|The Sega <b>Genesis,</b> {{initially}} {{released in}} Japan as the Mega Drive in 1988, was Sega's {{entry into the}} 16-bit era of video game consoles. The console was then released as the <b>Genesis</b> in 1989 for the North American market, with releases in other regions following a year later.|$|E
5|$|The main CPU of the Sega CD is a 12.5MHz 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor, {{which runs}} 5MHz {{faster than the}} <b>Genesis</b> processor. It {{contains}} 1 Mbit of boot ROM, allocated for the CD game BIOS, CD player software, and compatibility with CD+G discs. 6 Mbit of RAM are allocated to data for programs, pictures, and sounds; 512 Kbit to PCM waveform memory; 128 Kbit to CD-ROM data cache memory; and an additional 64 Kbit are allocated as the backup memory. Additional backup memory {{in the form of}} a 1 Mbit Backup RAM Cartridge was also available as a separate purchase, released near the end of the system's life. Audio is able to be supplied through the Ricoh RF5C164, and two RCA pin jacks allow the Sega CD to output stereophonic sound separate from the <b>Genesis.</b> Combining stereo sound from a <b>Genesis</b> to either version of the Sega CD requires a cable between the Genesis's headphone jack and an input jack on the back of the CD unit. This is not required for the second model of the <b>Genesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The number-one {{contender}} to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship {{was determined}} at Turning Point, with Christian Cage being pitted against Monty Brown. At <b>Genesis,</b> Brown defeated Jeff Hardy to become number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Also at <b>Genesis,</b> Christian Cage made his {{debut in the}} company, proclaiming he came to TNA to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On the November19, 2005 episode of Impact!, Cage reiterated his statement from <b>Genesis,</b> which angered Brown in the storyline. Brown said that Cage {{would have to go}} through him {{in order to get a}} title shot before the segment resulted in a fight between the two. Cage requested the match against Brown from NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko on the November26, 2005 episode of Impact!, which he was granted.|$|E
