50|$|Mounted at approx half {{span the}} <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> were {{designed}} for minimum interference with the wing aerodynamics.

40|$|An {{empirical}} method for integrating the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> on a wing-fuselage-fin(s) configuration has been described. This method {{is based on}} Whitham theory and Seebass and George sonic-boom minimization theory, With it, both reduced sonic-boom as well as high aerodynamic efficiency methods {{can be applied to}} the conceptual design of a supersonic-cruise aircraft. Two high-speed civil transport concepts were used as examples to illustrate the application of this engine-nacelle integration methodology: (1) a concept with <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> mounted on the aft-fuselage, the HSCT- 1 OB; and (2) a concept with <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> mounted under an extended-wing center section, the HSCT- 11 E. In both cases, the key to a significant reduction in the sonic-boom contribution from the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> was to use the F-function shape of the concept as a guide to move the nacelles further aft on the configuration...|$|R

50|$|Operational {{use of the}} G.IV {{demonstrated}} that the incorporation of the fuel tanks into the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> was a mistake. In a crash landing the tanks could rupture and spill fuel onto the hot engines. This posed a serious problem because landing accidents caused 75% of operational losses. In response Gothaer produced the G.V, which housed its fuel tanks inside the fuselage. The smaller <b>engine</b> <b>nacelles</b> were mounted on struts above the lower wing.|$|R

40|$|An {{aircraft}} wing has an inboard section and an outboard section. The inboard section is attached (i) {{on one side}} thereof to the aircraft's fuselage, and (ii) on an opposing side thereof to an inboard side of a turbofan <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> in an over-the-wing mounting position. The outboard section's leading edge has a sweep of at least 20 degrees. The inboard section's leading edge has a sweep between - 15 and + 15 degrees, and extends from the fuselage to an attachment position on the nacelle that is forward of an index position defined as an imaginary intersection between the sweep of the outboard section's leading edge and the inboard side of the nacelle.

40|$|A {{parametric}} investiagation of the aeroelastic flutter stability behaviour of a swept-back half-wing with a pylon-mounted <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> in inviscid {{subsonic flow}} is performed. The equations of motion, and therefrom the aeroelastic stability equations, are derived {{in terms of}} generalized coordinates in modal form, applying the Rayleigh-Ritz method with assumed mode functions. Two specific mode shapes - a fundamental wing bending mode together with each of three different <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> pitching modes - are combined individually to compose a binary flutter system with two degrees of freedom. For the computation of the motion-induced unsteady (generalized) airloads, a panel technique is used for both the wing and the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle</b> that is replaced by an annular wing. For a configuration representative of modern large transport aircraft, numerical results are presented {{for a variety of}} systematic parameter variations and Mach numbers. Thereby, for each binary combination of mode shapes, special emphasis is placed on the effects of the frequency ratio of the respective modes and the location of the wing torsional node lines of the various engine pitching modes, together with the effects of the motion-induced unsteady airloads on the <b>engine</b> <b>nacelle...</b>|$|R
