40|$|AbstractBackgroundCalcium (Ca 2 +) {{oscillations}} are ubiquitous signals {{present in}} all cells that provide efficient means to transmit intracellular biological information. Either spontaneously or upon receptor ligand binding, the otherwise stable cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration starts to oscillate. The resulting specific oscillatory pattern is interpreted by intracellular downstream effectors that subsequently activate different cellular processes. This signal transduction can occur through frequency modulation (FM) or amplitude modulation (AM), much similar to a radio signal. The decoding of the oscillatory signal is typically performed by enzymes with multiple Ca 2 + binding residues that diversely can regulate its total phosphorylation, thereby activating cellular program. To date, NFAT, NF-ÎºB, CaMKII, MAPK and calpain {{have been reported to}} have <b>frequency</b> <b>decoding</b> properties. Scope of reviewThe basic principles and recent discoveries reporting <b>frequency</b> <b>decoding</b> of FM Ca 2 + oscillations are reviewed here. Major conclusionsA limited number of cellular <b>frequency</b> <b>decoding</b> molecules of Ca 2 + oscillations have yet been reported. Interestingly, their responsiveness to Ca 2 + oscillatory frequencies shows little overlap, suggesting their specific roles in cells. General significanceFrequency modulation of Ca 2 + oscillations provides an efficient means to differentiate biological responses in the cell, both in health and in disease. Thus, it is crucial to identify and characterize all cellular <b>frequency</b> <b>decoding</b> molecules to understand how cells control important cell programs...|$|E
40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) mediates {{control of}} reproduction. It is {{secreted}} in pulses and acts via intracellular effectors to activate gonadotrophin secretion and gene expression. Sub-maximal GnRH pulse frequency can elicit maximal responses, yielding bell-shaped frequency-response curves characteristic of genuine frequency decoders. GnRH <b>frequency</b> <b>decoding</b> is therapeutically important (pulsatile GnRH can drive ovulation in assisted reproduction whereas sustained activation can treat breast and prostate cancers), but the mechanisms are unknown. Here, {{we consider the}} possibility that it is due to convergence of distinct pulsatile signals at the transcriptome. We develop a model that mirrors wet-laboratory data for activation and nuclear translocation of GnRH effectors (extracellular signal regulated kinase and nuclear factors of activated T-cells) and incorporates transcription. The model predicts genuine <b>frequency</b> <b>decoding</b> when two transcription factors (TFs) converge at a cooperative gate, and shows how optimal pulse frequency could reflect TF activation kinetics and affinities. Importantly, this behaviour is revealed as an emergent feature of the network, rather than an intrinsic feature of a given protein or pathway, and since such network topology is extremely common, may well be widespread in biological systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} automotive radars employ multidimensional discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) {{in order}} to estimate various target parameters. The DFT is implemented using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), at sample and computational complexity of O(N) and O(N N), respectively, where N {{is the number of}} samples in the signal space. We have recently proposed a sparse Fourier transform based on the Fourier projection-slice theorem (FPS-SFT), which applies to multidimensional signals that are sparse in the frequency domain. FPS-SFT achieves sample complexity of O(K) and computational complexity of O(K K) for a multidimensional, K-sparse signal. While FPS-SFT considers the ideal scenario, i. e., exactly sparse data that contains on-grid frequencies, in this paper, by extending FPS-SFT into a robust version (RFPS-SFT), we emphasize on addressing noisy signals that contain off-grid frequencies; such signals arise from radar applications. This is achieved by employing a windowing technique and a voting-based <b>frequency</b> <b>decoding</b> procedure; the former reduces the frequency leakage of the off-grid frequencies below the noise level to preserve the sparsity of the signal, while the latter significantly lowers the frequency localization error stemming from the noise. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically...|$|E

40|$|The local {{descriptors}} {{have been}} the backbone {{of most of the}} computer vision problems. Most of the existing local descriptors are generated over the raw input images. In order to increase the discriminative power of the local descriptors, some researchers converted the raw image into multiple images with the help some high and low pass frequency filters, then the local descriptors are computed over each filtered image and finally concatenated into a single descriptor. By doing so, these approaches do not utilize the inter frequency relationship which causes the less improvement in the discriminative power of the descriptor that could be achieved. In this paper, this problem is solved by utilizing the decoder concept of multi-channel decoded local binary pattern over the multi-frequency patterns. A <b>frequency</b> <b>decoded</b> local binary pattern (FDLBP) is proposed with two decoders. Each decoder works with one low frequency pattern and two high frequency pattern. Finally, the descriptors from both decoders are concatenated to form the single descriptor. The face retrieval experiments are conducted over four benchmarks and challenging databases such as PaSC, LFW, PubFig, and ESSEX. The experimental results confirm the superiority of the FDLBP descriptor as compared to the state-of-the-art descriptors such as LBP, SOBEL_LBP, BoF_LBP, SVD_S_LBP, mdLBP, etc. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures, 3 table...|$|R

We introduce {{a principle of}} parallel optical processing to significantly enhance analysis capabilities. In a commercial microfluidic chip, a plug of DNA molecules was injected and the DNA molecules were CE-separated with a high relative sizing accuracy of > 99 %. Through an optical waveguide inscribed by femtosecond-laser writing a laser was launched perpendicularly into the microfluidic channel. A photomultiplier collected the fluorescence signals from a small detection window with a limit of detection of ~ 8 DNA molecules. In our approach, different sets of exclusively end-labeled DNA fragments are unambiguously identified by simultaneously launching several continuous-wave lasers, each modulated with a different frequency, detection of the frequency-encoded signals at different fluorescence wavelengths by a single ultrasensitive, albeit color-blind photomultiplier, and Fourier-domain <b>frequency</b> <b>decoding.</b> As a proof of principle, fragments from independent human genomic segments, associated with genetic predispositions to breast cancer and anemia, are simultaneously analyzed in a single flow experiment. This novel method of modulation-frequency-encoded fluorescence excitation opens new opportunities in genetic diagnostics.

40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) acts via G-protein-coupled receptors on gonadotrophs {{to stimulate}} {{synthesis}} and secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. It is secreted in pulses, {{and its effects}} depend on pulse frequency, but decoding mechanisms are unknown. Here we have used an extracellular signal regulated kinase-green fluorescent protein (ERK 2 -GFP) reporter to monitor GnRH signaling. GnRH caused dose-dependent ERK 2 -GFP translocation to the nucleus, providing a live-cell readout for activation. Pulsatile GnRH caused dose- and frequency-dependent ERK 2 -GFP translocation. These responses were rapid and transient, showed only digital tracking, and did not desensitize under any condition tested (dose, frequency, and receptor number varied). We also tested {{for the effects of}} cycloheximide (to prevent induction of nuclear-inducible MAPK phosphatases) and used GFP fusions containing ERK mutations (D 319 N, which prevents docking domain-dependent binding to MAPK phosphatases, and K 52 R, which prevents catalytic activity). These manipulations had little or no effect on the translocation responses, arguing against a role for MAPK phosphatases or ERK-mediated feedback in shaping ERK activation during pulsatile stimulation. GnRH also caused dose- and frequency-dependent activation of the alpha-gonadotropin subunit-, luteinizing hormone beta-, and follicle-stimulating hormone beta-luciferase reporters, and the latter response was inhibited by ERK 1 / 2 knockdown. Moreover, GnRH caused frequency-dependent activation of an Egr 1 -luciferase reporter, but the response was proportional to cumulative pulse duration. Our data suggest that <b>frequency</b> <b>decoding</b> is not due to negative feedback shaping ERK signaling in this model...|$|E

This dynamic model selection approach, coupled with a one-pass, leftto-right POS tagging algorithm, is evaluated on corpora from seven different genres. Even with this simple tagging algorithm, our system shows comparable results against other state-of-the-art systems, and gives higher accuracies when evaluated on a mixture of the data. Furthermore, our system is able to tag about 32 K tokens per second.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new Bit Flipping (BF) decoder, called Probabilistic Parallel Bit Flipping (PPBF) for Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes on the Binary Symmetric Channel. In PPBF, the flipping operation is proceeded with a probabilistic behavior which {{is shown to}} improve significantly the error correction performance. The advantage of PPBF {{comes from the fact}} that, no global computation is required during the decoding process and from that, all the computations can be executed in the local computing units and in-parallel. PPBF provides a considerable improvement of the <b>decoding</b> <b>frequency</b> and complexity, compared to other known BF decoders, while obtaining a significant gain in error correction. One improved version of PPBF, called non-syndrome PPBF (NS-PPBF) is also introduced, in which the global syndrome check is moved out of the critical path and a new terminating mechanism is proposed. In order to show the superiority of the new decoders in terms of hardware efficiency and decoding throughput, the corresponding hardware architectures are presented {{in the second part of}} the paper. The ASIC synthesis results confirm that, the <b>decoding</b> <b>frequency</b> of the proposed decoders is significantly improved, much higher than the BF decoders of literature while requiring lower complexity to be efficiently implemented...|$|R

40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) acts via 7 transmembrane region receptors on gonadotrophs {{to stimulate}} {{synthesis}} and secretion of the luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. It is secreted in pulses, {{and its effects}} depend on pulse <b>frequency,</b> but <b>decoding</b> mechanisms are unknown. Here we have used (nuclear factor of activated T-cells 2 (NFAT 2) -emerald fluorescent protein) to monitor GnRH signaling. Increasing [Ca 2 +](i) causes calmodulin/calcineurin-dependent nuclear NFAT translocation, a response involving proteins (calmodulins and NFATs) that <b>decode</b> <b>frequency</b> in other systems. Using live cell imaging, pulsatile GnRH caused dose- and frequency-dependent increases in nuclear NFAT 2 -emerald fluorescent protein, and at low frequency, translocation simply tracked GnRH exposure (albeit with slower kinetics). At high frequency (30 -min intervals), failure to return to basal conditions before repeat stimulation caused integrative tracking, illustrating how the relative dynamics of up- and downstream signals can increase efficiency of GnRH action. Mathematical modeling predicted desensitization of GnRH effects on [Ca 2 +](i) and that desensitization would increase with dose, frequency, and receptor number, but no such desensitization was seen in HeLa and/or L beta T 2 cells possibly because pulsatile GnRH did not reduce receptor expression (measured by immunofluorescence). GnRH also caused dose-and frequency-dependent activation of alpha GSU, luteinizing hormone beta, and follicle-stimulating hormone beta luciferase reporters, effects that were blocked by calcineurin inhibition. Pulsatile GnRH also activated an NFAT-responsive luciferase reporter, but this response was directly related to cumulative pulse duration. This together {{with the lack of}} desensitization of translocation responses suggests that NFAT may mediate GnRH action but is not a genuine decoder of GnRH pulse frequency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Frequency {{analysis}} {{is the fundamental}} cryptanalytic technique besides brutal force, threat, blackmail, torture, bribery, etc. [1]. Conventionally, it is applied on monogram, bigram and trigram together with anagramming technique [2]. The efficiency of anagramming depends on the cryptanalyst's depth of knowledge in different language features. Hence anagramming is a trial-and-error approach due to huge deviation in different fields, e. g. military, diplomatic, commercial, legal and daily languages. The frequency fluctuations among the normal frequency order of the characters trigger the crossover problem for monogram frequency analysis. Meanwhile bigram and trigram frequency analyses are found to give little help. Higher orders {{are unlikely to be}} useful. In 1994, George Hart introduced a novel frequency analysis approach based on word <b>frequency</b> to <b>decode</b> the enhanced <b>frequency</b> analysis for systematic decryption of English ciphertext [3].

This analysis divided the H. 264 /AVC decoder into six parts, these are CABAC, RD-Lagrangian optimization, B-frames, Hadamard transform, deblocking filter, and displacement vector resolution. And it analyzes these parts in detail from the access <b>frequency</b> aspect and <b>decoding</b> time aspect.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{software}} audio decoder for processors supporting multiple discrete voltage-frequency operating points. The proposed decoding scheme allows {{the user to}} switch between multiple output quality levels, where each level {{is associated with a}} different rate at which the processor consumes energy. This will be an attractive feature in battery-powered portable audio players and mobile phones, where battery-life is often more crucial than the output quality, especially in noisy environments. Towards this, the frequency range of the decoder is partitioned into multiple groups, in accordance with their perceptual relevance. When a longer battery life is desired, only the most relevant <b>frequency</b> components are <b>decoded,</b> which allows the processor to be run at a lower voltage and frequency. We have implemented this scheme using the MP 3 decoder and obtained up to 95 % savings in the energy consumed by the processor for AM quality output (in contrast to CD quality output, which is associated with the maximum energy consumption). This scheme is easy to implement, has no runtime overhead and does not involve any runtime voltage or frequency scaling. ...|$|R
