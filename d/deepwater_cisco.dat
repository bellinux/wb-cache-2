50|$|The <b>deepwater</b> <b>cisco</b> (Coregonus johannae) {{was one of}} {{the largest}} ciscoes in the Great Lakes. Its average length was 30 cm (12 inches) and it was about 1.0 {{kilogram}} (2.2 pounds) in weight. Occurring only in Lakes Huron and Michigan, and inhabited waters between 50 and 150 metres deep, it was difficult to distinguish from other ciscoes and was possibly the same species as the shortjaw cisco (Coregonus zenithicus). The <b>deepwater</b> <b>cisco</b> was distinguished by usually having fewer than 33 gill rakers, relatively long pectoral fins, and unpigmented jaws. It was a silvery colour with a pink or purple lustre and a green or blue back. It spawned in August and September, earlier than most other ciscoes and, because of its large size, the <b>deepwater</b> <b>Cisco</b> was heavily fished commercially.|$|E
50|$|In lake Superior, the shortjaw cisco {{has been}} part of <b>{{deepwater}}</b> <b>cisco</b> fisheries. The deepwater ciscoes there also comprise Coregonus hoyi and Coregonus kiyi.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>deepwater</b> <b>cisco</b> fishery caught longjaw ciscoes {{and sold}} them as [...] "smoked herring". The {{commercial}} catch peaked around the 1930s when {{about one-third of the}} catch of ciscoes was this species.|$|E
50|$|The last {{specimens}} of <b>deepwater</b> <b>ciscoes</b> {{were recorded in}} Lake Huron in 1952 and Lake Michigan in 1951. The main reasons for its extinction were competition from the invasive alewife and predation by the introduced sea lamprey.|$|R
50|$|Two {{subspecies}} of kiyi {{have been}} recognised based on morphological characteristics and distribution. The nominate subspecies Coregonus kiyi kiyi, or the Upper Great Lakes kiyi, {{was found in}} Lakes Superior, Huron and Michigan. The Lake Ontario kiyi, C. kiyi orientalis, was only found in Lake Ontario. However, recent examination of the ciscos as a group using genetic techniques has suggested that some recognized species are not genetically distinct form others, {{and it has been}} suggested that the <b>deepwater</b> <b>ciscos</b> in general may be forms of the northern cisco C. artedi adapted to life in different ecological niches. The distinction between the subspecies of kiyi has been rendered academic, however, by the extinction of the Lake Ontario form, which has not been seen since the 1960s and has been extinct since 2005. The subspecies was driven to extinction by commercial exploitation, predation and competition by introduced species.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{assessed}} abundance, size, {{and species}} composition of forage fish and zooplankton communities of western Lake Superior during August 1996 and July 1997. Data were analyzed for three ecoregions (Duluth-Superior, Apostle Islands, {{and the open}} lake) differing in bathymetry and limnologi-cal and biological patterns. Zooplankton abundance was three times higher in the Duluth-Superior and Apostle Islands regions than in the open lake due to {{the large numbers of}} rotifers. Copepods were far more abundant than Cladocera in all ecoregions. Mean zooplankton size was larger in the open lake due to dominance by large calanoid copepods although size of individual taxa was similar among ecoregions. Forage fish abundance and biomass was highest in the Apostle Islands region and lowest in the open lake ecoregion. Lake herring (Coregonus artedi), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and <b>deepwater</b> <b>ciscoes</b> (Coregonus spp.) comprised over 90 % of the abundance and biomass of fishes caught in midwater trawls and recorded with hydroacoustics. Growth and condition of fish was good, suggesting they were no...|$|R
50|$|Coregonus hoyi (bloater) is {{a species}} or form of {{freshwater}} whitefish {{in the family}} Salmonidae. It is a silvery-coloured herring-like fish, 25.5 cm long. It is found {{in most of the}} Great Lakes and in Lake Nipigon, where it inhabits underwater slopes. This fish is {{not to be confused with}} the extinct <b>deepwater</b> <b>cisco</b> (Coregonus johannae), a large fish that shared a common name with the bloater.|$|E
50|$|The kiyi (Coregonus kiyi) is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} whitefish, a <b>deepwater</b> <b>cisco,</b> endemic to the Great Lakes of North America. It previously inhabited Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake Ontario, but is now believed to persist only in Lake Superior where it is common. The various deepwater ciscos are also called chubs (not {{to be confused with}} the various species of Cyprinidae also called chubs). The kiyi is part of the large group of related northern ciscos known as the Coregonus artedi complex.|$|E
50|$|Like {{all of the}} Great Lakes, {{the ecology}} of Lake Huron has {{undergone}} drastic changes in the last century. The lake originally supported a native deepwater fish community dominated by lake trout, which fed {{on a number of}} deepwater ciscos as well as sculpins and other native fishes. Several invasive species, including sea lamprey, alewife and rainbow smelt, became abundant in the lake by the 1930s. The major native top predator, lake trout, were virtually extirpated from the lake by 1950 due to a combination of overfishing and the effects of sea lamprey. Several species of deepwater ciscos were also extirpated from the lake by the 1960s; the only remaining native <b>deepwater</b> <b>cisco</b> is the bloater. Nonnative Pacific salmon have been stocked in the lake since the 1960s, and lake trout have also been stocked in an attempt to rehabilitate the species, although little natural reproduction of stocked trout has been observed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Herein {{we examine}} {{scientific}} {{questions related to}} successful re-establishment of native deepwater fish communities in the Laurentian Great Lakes, and we (1) propose a conceptual model for native deepwater fish communities; (2) review current research and identify research hypotheses for lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, pelagic ciscoes Coregonus spp., and sculpins (Cottus spp. and Myoxocephalus spp.); (3) pose research questions emerging at community and ecosystem levels; and (4) identify high-priority research topics related to population re-establishment. The conceptual model {{is based on a}} generalized life cycle nested within processes at the population, metapopulation, community, and ecosystem levels. The conceptual model assumes that variation in population abundance is a natural phenomenon and that biodiversity contributes to ecosystem stability. Key research topics related to lake trout re-establishment include understanding recruitment variation over space and time, identifying sources of early life history mortality, determining the level of genetic differentiation among morphotypes and populations, and comparing the life history and ecology of lean lake trout with those of other lake trout morphotypes. Key research topics related to re-establishing <b>deepwater</b> species of <b>cisco</b> include resolving uncertainties in species identifications, understanding processes maintaining distinctiveness among species, understanding processes leading to cyclic and erratic recruitment, and developing effective propagation methods.

40|$|Animals {{raised in}} captivity {{typically}} exhibit reproductive dysfunction of varying degrees ranging from diminished to absent reproduction. This observation {{holds true for}} the bloater (Coregonus hoyi); a <b>deepwater</b> <b>cisco</b> extirpated from Lake Ontario. Efforts to rear bloaters in captivity have met with complications including the absence of egg expression in females and asynchronous gamete expression between sexes. As such, I examined whether the injection of an exogenous hormone (LHRHa) could induce gamete expression in both males and females. Also, I began {{the development of a}} sperm cryopreservation protocol for bloaters to overcome the observed asynchronous gamete expression. The exogenous hormone injections were effective at inducing the gamete expression of females, more so than males. Additionally, although the cryopreservation freezing rates examined were successful for closely-related species, they were not appropriate for bloater spermatozoa. However, all four extenders examined are suitable for bloater spermatozoa as none of them were biologically toxic...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the functional-physiological {{influences on the}} depth distribution of <b>deepwater</b> <b>cisco</b> (bloater), Coregonus hoyi, in the Laurentian Great Lakes, we compared their gas bladder anatomy with the putative ancestor, shallowwater cisco, C. artedi, from a shallow inland lake. There were no general differences in the gas bladder anatomy—both coregonines possessed simple micro retia (counter-current gas multipliers) and an open pneumatic duct connection between the bladder and esophagus. Bloater possessed a significantly smaller duct diameter relative to body size in comparison with shallowwater cisco, yet the estimated {{resistance to air flow}} through the duct of bloater was ∼ 7. 2 times lower than that of cisco. In light of these findings, we discuss evidence for two modes of gas bladder inflation in bloater: 1) gas deposition via micro retia at depth, and 2) gas acquisition via aquatic surface gulping (ASG). Because the hypolimnetic distribution of adult bloater precludes them from using ASG, we infer that these fish utilize micro retia to deposit gas into their bladders. We hypothesize that bloater compensate for relatively modest rates of gas deposition by not voiding excess gas. This “gas bladder conservation (GBC) hypothesis” for bloater is supported by four pieces of evidence: 1) deepwater habitation with no access to the surface to perform ASG, 2) a lack of extensive retia and modest gas deposition rates in coregonines, 3) a tendency to bloat when brought from depth to the surface, and 4) previous findings of a confined depth range, centered around the depth of neutral buoyancy.
