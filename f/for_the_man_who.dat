5|$|Mulholland Drive premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival in May {{to major}} {{critical}} acclaim. Lynch {{was awarded the}} Best Director prize at the festival, sharing it with co-winner Joel Coen <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> Wasn't There. It drew positive reviews from many critics {{and some of the}} strongest audience reactions of Lynch's career.|$|E
5|$|François Truffaut as Claude Lacombe, a French {{government}} {{scientist in}} charge of UFO-related activities in the United States. Gérard Depardieu, Philippe Noiret, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Lino Ventura were considered for the role. Internationally renowned as a film director, this was Truffaut's only acting role in a film he did not direct {{as well as his}} only role in an English language film. During filming, Truffaut used his free time to write the script <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> Loved Women. He also worked on a novel titled The Actor, a project he abandoned.|$|E

5|$|During the bell-making, the skomorokh {{from the}} first {{sequence}} makes a reappearance amongst the crowds {{who have come to}} watch the bell being raised up and he threatens to kill Andrei, whom he mistakes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> denounced him years earlier and therefore led to his arrest, torture and prison sentence. Kirill intervenes on behalf of the silent Andrei and later privately confesses that his sinful envy of Andrei’s talent dissipated once he heard Andrei had abandoned painting and that it was he, Kirill, who had denounced the skomorokh. Kirill then criticises Andrei for allowing his God-given talent for painting to go to waste and pleads with him to resume his artistry, to no response.|$|E
5|$|In 1066, {{the comet}} {{was seen in}} England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings; {{it was a bad}} omen for Harold, but a good omen <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{defeated}} him, William the Conqueror. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts from the period describe it as appearing to be four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Halley came within 0.10AU of Earth at that time.|$|E

In 1981, NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray surmised that it was cut—"in 10 days of feverish activity"—when Bowie decided {{that there was no}} hope of his producing a soundtrack <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> Fell to Earth. More recent scholarship contends that the album {{was recorded}} over a couple of months—with the sessions beginning in late September or early October 1975 and ending in late November—so that it was in the can before Bowie began his abortive sessions on the soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|Ray {{gathered}} an inexperienced crew, {{although both}} his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta {{went on to}} achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur actors. He started shooting in late 1952 with his personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some passages shot, but did not succeed on his terms. As a result, Ray shot Pather Panchali over three years, an unusually long period, based on when he or his production manager Anil Chowdhury could raise additional funds. He refused funding from sources who wanted a change in script or supervision over production. He also ignored advice from the government to incorporate a happy ending, but he did receive funding {{that allowed him to}} complete the film. Ray showed an early film passage to the American director John Huston, who was in India scouting locations <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> Would Be King. The passage was of the vision which Apu and his sister have of the train running through the countryside, the only sequence which Ray had yet filmed due to his small budget. Huston notified Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) that a major talent was on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|He left Vale Park on a free {{transfer}} in June 1993 and {{turned down a}} move to Cyprus outfit AC Omonia to return to former club Hartlepool United. Injury meant he did not play <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> signed him, Viv Busby, and instead he made his second debut for the club under John MacPhail. Houchen went on to score eight goals in 37 games as Hartlepool were relegated into the bottom tier of the Football League in 1993–94, finishing a massive 17 points behind Blackpool, who were one point above the relegation zone. MacPhail was quickly sacked and replaced by David McCreery; MacPhail blamed {{the fact that the}} club was sometimes unable to pay the player's wages as a reason for poor results on the field. Houchen was a coach at the club, but quickly fell out with temporary 'advisory coach' Sandy Clark. Houchen scored a hat-trick against Bury, though was later sent off in the match for allegedly swearing at referee Kevin Lynch; {{at the time of the}} incident Houchen was receiving treatment for knee ligament damage which would keep him out of action for six weeks. McCreery resigned on 20 April 1995, and chairman Harold Hornsey appointed Houchen as his replacement; he became the 23rd manager at the club in 38 years. He appointed his former boss Billy Horner as youth team coach and also employed Brian Honour and Mick Tait. His first game in charge was a 4–0 home win over Hereford United, and a 3–0 defeat at Preston North End and a final day 3–2 victory over Mansfield Town ensured Hartlepool an 18th-place finish. As a player, he was the club's top scorer with 14 goals in 39 appearances in 1994–95, and was voted Player of the Year by the club's supporters.|$|E

25|$|The director, Manmohan Desai, {{altered the}} ending of Coolie after Bachchan's accident.

Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident.|$|E

25|$|On {{his way to}} Syria, Gaius paid a {{visit to}} Tiberius who had {{abandoned}} politics and retired to Rhodes. According to Suetonius, he had met Tiberius with a cold reception on the isle of Samos. Tiberius was alienated at the meeting, both by the behavior of Lollius and his centurions. Suetonius continued, saying Tiberius wrote to the Emperor that Lollius be replaced. Lollius' rivalry with Tiberius continued even after Gaius' entourage arrived in the east. Lollius strove to turn Gaius against him: Gaius, in any case, had no affection <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had contributed, directly or indirectly, to the ruin of his mother. On one occasion, Lollius offered to decapitate Tiberius if Gaius gave the word. Suetonius says that it is Lollius' growing influence that compelled Tiberius to plea with Augustus for his return to Rome.|$|E

Tom avoids being spotted and the family leaves the Keene Ranch without further incident. After driving for a while, they have to stop {{at the top of a}} hill when the engine overheats due to a broken fan belt; they have little gas, but decide to try coasting down the hill to some lights. The lights are from a third type of camp: Farmworkers' Wheat Patch Camp (Weedpatch in the book), a clean camp run by the Department of Agriculture, complete with indoor toilets and showers, which the Joad children had never seen before.|$|E
25|$|The same year, Lynch {{approached}} ABC {{once again}} with ideas for a television drama. The network gave Lynch the go-ahead to shoot a two-hour pilot for the series Mulholland Drive, but disputes over content and running time led to the project being shelved indefinitely. However, with seven million dollars from the French production company StudioCanal, Lynch completed the pilot as a film, Mulholland Drive. The film, a non-linear narrative surrealist tale of {{the dark side of}} Hollywood, stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring and Justin Theroux. The film performed relatively well at the box office worldwide and was a critical success, earning Lynch a Best Director prize at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival (shared with Joel Coen <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> Wasn't There) and a Best Director award from the New York Film Critics Association. In addition, Lynch received his third Academy Award nomination for Best Director. In 2016, the film was named the top film of the 21st century by the BBC following a poll of 177 film critics from 36 countries.|$|E

500|$|Monroe Wheeler, {{head of the}} {{department}} of exhibitions and publications at New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), who was in Calcutta in 1954, heard about the project and met Ray. He considered the incomplete footage to be of very high quality and encouraged Ray to finish the film so that it could be shown at a MoMA exhibition the following year. Six months later, American director John Huston visited India for some early location scouting <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> Would Be King (eventually made in 1975). Wheeler had asked Huston to check the progress of Ray's project. Huston saw excerpts of the unfinished film and recognised [...] "the work of a great film-maker".

In the sixth-season finale, he finally catches up with Nunn, who claims to be yet another pawn with no idea why Trudy was killed. This turns out {{to be part of a}} larger plot to have Nunn set up another bombing and then frame Monk for killing him; he is shot before Monk can have him arrested or convince him to surrender the name of his employer in Trudy's murder. Once Monk is cleared in Nunn's death, the police find correspondence from Nunn dating back to the era of Trudy's death. There are no names discovered, but there is a reference to the person responsible, referred to as [...] "The Judge".
