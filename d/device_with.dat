40|$|Abstract　To find optimum {{parameters}} of a bistable wall attachment amplifier having higher recovery pressure, an experimental research {{is performed using}} <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> {{two different types of}} splitter. <b>Devices</b> <b>with</b> a wedge type splitter(1),(3) are not so good for obtaining higher recovery pressure because of mixing reattached flow with surrounding fluid in the output duct. For avoiding this phenomenon and getting higher recovery pressure, <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> a pentagonal splitter(2),(4) was originated so as to obtain the optimum output duct width free from the position of the splitter tip. As compared <b>with</b> <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> the wedge type splitter, the remarkable merits of <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> the pentagonal splitter are observed. The recovery pressure gaind by closing the output duct is in most cases less 45 % of the supply for <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> the wedge type splitter, but over 45 % for <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> the pentagonal splitter. 　　側壁付着型２安定素子の設計には数多くの変数があって，その設計基準を定めるのは非常に困難である。本報では高い回復圧を得ることを目的として，スプリッタの形を楔形と駒形の 2 通りに変え，その各々に対してベント位置，スプリッタ角を変えて実験を行なった。　　楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，出力端で再付着流とまわりの流休とが混り合うために一般的に高い回復圧が得られ難い。ところが駒形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子が起す上記のような現象はなく，下記に示すような著しい利点がみられた。　(1) スプリッタの位置に関係なく出カダクト巾を一定にできるので，統一的な実験が行なえる。　(2) 回復圧が非常に高い（楔形の場合は 45 %以下,駒形の場合ほ 45 %以上）。　(3) メモリタイプの素子が多く得られる。　　又，ベントに関しては， 3 次元方向にベントを開けた場合には，製作が容易であるいう利点があるが，積重ねて使用することができない，回復圧が低くメモリタイプの素子が少ないなどの欠点が多いことから，ペントは 2 次元方向に開けるのが望ましいということがわかった...|$|R

40|$|The radiation-induced {{degradation}} of high frequency npn bipolar transistors with low stress LPCVD silicon nitride as the surface isolation is investigated {{for the first}} time. The results are compared <b>with</b> those for <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> silicon dioxide as the isolation. The total dose {{degradation of}} the devices is observed to be {{a reduction in the}} current gain I-C/I-B because of increase in the base current I-B and no change in the collector current I-C. <b>Devices</b> <b>with</b> lower perimeter-to-area ratio are observed to be more rad-hard compared to <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> higher perimeter-to-area ratio. The degradation of both type of devices is found to be qualitatively similar, but the degradation is more severe for <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> nitride as the surface isolation. The results presented in this paper indicate that radiation-induced degradation of bipolar transistors is primarily because of damage to the surface isolation layer over the emitter-base junction region due to irradiation. The larger degradation of bipolar <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> nitride as surface isolation compared to <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> oxide as isolation suggests the presence of more traps in the nitride layer...|$|R

5|$|Lake {{initially}} thought Microsoft was {{not particularly}} enthusiastic about the idea, but had accepted the pitch mainly because of Microsoft's vision of having Xbox One as an entertainment <b>device</b> <b>with</b> rich TV features at that time. However, as the TV show {{was not part of}} Microsoft's project, the closure of Xbox Entertainment Studios did not affect the progress of the TV show production. It was created by Lifeboat Productions, who worked closely with Remedy through Skype conversation and screenplay review. Many scenes had to be shot twice due to the game's alternate content and branching nature. Three writers from Remedy also contributed to the TV show content.|$|E

They argue, and he states that if Gwen is working to safeguard ordinary life then she has not been successful. Returning to Torchwood's headquarters, Gwen interrupts Jack and fellow Torchwood employee Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) during a sexual encounter. After apologising, she tells Jack that she wants to continue the investigation. Jack refuses to help, but Ianto later gives Gwen a GPS <b>device</b> <b>with</b> coordinates to a hidden location, leading Gwen to a facility on Flat Holm, a sort of care home for seventeen individuals taken by the riftwho have returned. Gwen finds Jack there, and demands access to Jonah. An older Jonah (Robert Pugh) is shown to have been physically deformed whilst on a burning planet {{in the midst of a}} burning solar system. Jack reveals that he set up the facility when he first took command of Torchwood, in order to care for the victims of the rift, who had previously been locked away in the Torchwood vaults.|$|E

5|$|The game {{proceeds}} {{according to}} the Courier's decisions and involves many different events, factions, and characters. The main storyline follows the Courier's pursuit of Benny to both settle the score and retrieve the Platinum Chip. Along the way, the Courier encounters many groups of people with various problems that they can choose to assist with, ignore, or otherwise sabotage, resulting in positive or negative karma. Eventually, after finding Benny and the Chip, the Courier finds themselves {{in the middle of}} a conflict between three major factions: Caesar's Legion, a group of Roman-esque slavers, the New California Republic (NCR), an expansionist democratic federation, and Mr. House (voiced by René Auberjonois), the enigmatic de facto ruler of New Vegas, in command of an army of Securitron robots that patrols the city. Each of the three sides aim to control the Hoover Dam, which is still operational and supplying the Southwest with power and clean, non-irradiated water; thus, control of the dam means effective control of the region. It is revealed that Mr. House, a human from before the Great War and surviving via a contained life support chamber, ordered the Platinum Chip's delivery before the war. The Chip is a data storage <b>device</b> <b>with</b> a program that can upgrade the Securitrons to a greater level of combat effectiveness, and was stolen by Benny as part of a scheme to take over House's security and claim New Vegas for himself with the help of a reprogrammed Securitron named Yes Man.|$|E
