"The Distance", an {{original}} song written by Shawn Craig, {{is explained by}} him as [...] "The idea is that God couldn't stand the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>us,</b> so He came near. There's a bit of hyperbole in that, but the principle is true. God shows His love in spanning the canyon between mankind and Himself with the humble cross. I feel as strongly about that lyric as any I've written." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{three main}} issues were RCA {{position}} on homosexuality, {{the adoption of}} the Belhar confession and complementarianism. Beyond the three reasons University Reformed Church mentioned: [...] "We have a deep desire to belong to a family of churches where who we are as a congregation fits squarely with what our denomination does and believes." [...] "We want to raise up pastors who do not fear that the ordination process is against them"."We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "We {{want to be in a}} denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, notsome extreme right flank". [...] "The denomination(RCA) has moved away from churches like ours." [...] "We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "In practice, the RCA is already well down this path [...] and that given the way our classical structure works those who stand for biblical orthodoxy can do little to stop it. We believe laboring in such a mixed denomination undermines the true nature of biblical unity, hinders our witness for Christ, and does not represent the most effective avenue for ministry for URC in the years and decades ahead." [...] "URC would be able to serve with greater integrity and disciple our people (especially ministerial candidates) more effectively if we were in a denomination that shares our complementarian convictions, rather than in one that is moving full speed ahead in the other direction." [...] "We(URC) are troubled by the weak form of confessional subscription in the RCA, the process for examining ministerial candidates, and our formal ecumenical ties with liberal denominations like the UCC, ELCA and PCUSA". [...] "We have often heard from visitors that though they lived in Lansing for years they never thought to visit URC because it was an RCA church or because of things they had heard about liberal leanings in the RCA. How many others might be staying away because our denominational affiliation gives them the wrong idea about who we are and what we believe?"We do not recommend our RCA seminaries. [...] "We want to be in a denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, not some extreme right flank". [...] "The RCA connection inhibits interest in planting churches, the vision for training up pastors, and placement for new pastors." [...] "we also feel a measure of <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>us</b> and most churches in the denomination".|$|E

These cognitive maps are prone to various distortions (e. g., alignment and hierarchical effects) caused by basic cognitive factors (such as perceptual and conceptual reorganization) but also by affectively loaded and attitudinal influences.

Europeans who had a positive attitude towards Obama’s first presidential program estimated <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>US</b> and European cities as being much smaller than did people who were skeptical or negative towards Obama's ideas. On the basis of this result and existing literature, arguments on the non-unitary and flexible nature of cognitive maps are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MA (VA) (Visual Arts)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This thesis {{considers}} {{radical and}} reactionary political strategies for questioning systems of gender/sexuality categorisation and finds both wanting {{in terms of}} the cultural insularity and mainstream assimilation each respectively engenders. An alternative is posited in the form of radical assimilation, a theory borrowing the best elements from both approaches. The remainder of the study is focussed on the search for personal and iconographic strategies to pursue a politic of radical assimilation in my creative production. These strategies are finally exemplified and manifested via discussions of the practical corpus of artworks that aided in the formation of this politic. The discursive framework in which this theorization occurs includes considerations of queer theory and photography (especially domestic photography and portraiture) and subjective contextualization (invoking the domestic uses of images), and all should be seen as constituting a personal discursive framework: an attempt to counter the reductive scope an uncontextualised analysis of my work allows. This study is accordingly an explication of the processes that turn the personal into the political; a critical affirmation of difference; and an attempt to narrow the <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>us...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} based on the {{reflection}} and/or absorption of ultrasound (US) waves in some materials that {{can be found in the}} indoor environment. Sound and ultrasound waves are defined as longitudinal pressure waves in the medium in which they are travelling. This medium can be air, water, steel, concrete, granite blocks, the human body, etc. Targets/subjects whose dimensions are larger than the wavelength of the colliding sound waves will reflect these waves; the reflected waves are called “echo”. Using the timeof-flight (TOF) technique, we can measure the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>US</b> system and the target. But there are some materials which can absorb the US waves and the system will not find any obstacle, but in reality the obstacle is there...|$|R

Our study indicates that, for both US imports and exports, the trade-enhancing effect of immigrants partially offsets the trade-inhibiting effect of cultural distance. Further, decomposing our measure of cultural distance into two component dimensions and revisiting the immigrant-trade relationship, we find significant variation in {{the extent to which}} immigrants counter the trade-inhibiting influences of the underlying dimensions of culture for both US imports and exports. Our findings have the implication that by countering the trade-inhibiting influences of cultural differences between their home and host countries, immigrants exert pro-development effects.

It {{has none of}} the things which make good Frenchmen love Paris; it has only the things which make unspeakable Englishmen love it. It has the part which is cosmopolitan--and narrows; not the part which is Parisian--and universal. You can find there (as commonly happens in modern centres) the worst things of all nations--the DAILY MAIL from England, the cheap philosophies from Germany, the loose novels of France, and the drinks of America. But there is no English broad fun, no German kindly ceremony, no American exhilaration, and, above all, no French tradition of fighting for an idea. Though all the boulevards look like Parisian boulevards, though all the shops look like Parisian shops, you cannot look at them steadily for two minutes without feeling the full <b>distance</b> <b>between,</b> let <b>us</b> say, King Leopold and fighters like Clemenceau and Deroulède.|$|R
