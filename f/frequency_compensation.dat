25|$|Widlar {{disposed}} with hybrid technology, {{and used}} only diffused resistors formed within the silicon die. Each {{of the nine}} NPN transistors was sized and shaped according to its function, contrary to an earlier practice of employing standard minimal-area patterns. Widlar introduced three innovations: interfacing a long-tail with a single-ended stage without losing half of the gain, shifting the DC level using only NPN transistors, and optional <b>frequency</b> <b>compensation</b> with an external capacitor. Compensation increased bandwidth of the device to 25-30MHz, an unprecedented breakthrough for monolithic amplifiers at that time. Widlar did not consider the μA702 prototype good enough for production, but Fairchild decided otherwise and rushed the chip into production in October 1964. The device set the direction for the industry for decades, despite poor common-mode rejection ratio, weak output drive capabilities, and a price of $300. According to Jack Gifford, the top management of Fairchild noticed the novelty and learned of Widlar's existence only after receiving enthusiastic feedback from the market.|$|E
25|$|Gifford {{said that}} Widlar and Talbert were {{actually}} {{the founders of}} National Semiconductor, and that Sporck joined them later. The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on voltage regulators {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased input current, and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox input stage, employing NPN input transistors emitter coupled to PNP transistors in a common base arrangement. The high reverse breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 V. Its <b>frequency</b> <b>compensation</b> was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized die area and current drain, and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditions. The items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|E

From 1964 to 1970, Widlar, together with David Talbert, created the first mass-produced operational amplifier ICs (μA702, μA709), the first integrated voltage regulator ICs (µA723 in Fairchild launched in 1967, later LM100 for National), the first operational amplifiers employing single capacitor <b>frequency</b> <b>compensation</b> (LM101), an improved LM101 with FET internal current control (LM101A), and super-beta transistors (LM108).

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a joint Doppler <b>frequency</b> shift <b>compensation</b> and data {{detection}} method using 2 -D unitary ESPRIT algorithm for SIMO-OFDM railway communication systems over fast time-varying sparse multipath channels. By creating the spatio-temporal array data matrix utilizing the ISI-free part of the CP (cyclic prefix), we first propose a novel algorithm for obtaining auto-paired joint DOA and Doppler frequency shift estimates of all paths via 2 -D unitary ESPRIT algorithm. Thereafter, based on the obtained estimates, a joint Doppler <b>frequency</b> shift <b>compensation</b> and data detection method is developed. This method consists of three parts: (a) the received signal is spatially filtered to get the signal corresponding to each path, and the signal corresponding to each path is compensated for the Doppler frequency shift in time domain, (b) the Doppler frequency shift-compensated signals of all paths are summed together, and (c) the desired information is detected by performing FFT on the summed signal after excluding the CP. Moreover, we prove that the channel matrix becomes time-invariant after Doppler <b>frequency</b> shift <b>compensation</b> and the ICI is effectively avoided.

40|$|Abstract—A <b>frequency</b> offset <b>compensation</b> {{method for}} OFDM-FDMA, that can correct offsets after the DFT via {{circular}} convo-lution, is proposed {{as an alternative}} to the direct method that cor-rects frequency offsets by multiplying the complex exponents of the offset estimates before the DFT. In contrast to the direct method whose complexity increases proportional to the number of users, the computational load of the proposed scheme decreases as the number of users increases. It is shown that the proposed method is simpler to implement than the direct method when the number of users is greater than two. Furthermore, the former can outper-form the latter, because a <b>frequency</b> offset <b>compensation</b> for one user after the DFT does not affect the data of other users.
