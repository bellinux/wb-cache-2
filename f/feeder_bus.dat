50|$|A key {{proposal}} of the Station Area Traffic Improvement Scheme (SATIS) was {{the integration of}} the metro rail system with the BEST. The BEST and the BMC jointly worked towards relocating existing bus stops. BEST <b>bus</b> <b>feeder</b> routes were created along the metro corridor.

Bus-to-bus and metro to bus transfers do not cost extra. Bus-to-metro transfers costs $20 (approx. US$0.04) during Horario Valle (low-use hours) and $80 (approx.

This paper promotes the view that integrated multi-modal systems that provide frequency and connectivity in a network-based framework offer the best way forward.

5000|$|The LRT-2 {{has always}} {{presented}} {{itself as a}} safe system to travel in, which was affirmed in a 2004 World Bank paper prepared by Halcrow describing the overall state of metro rail transit operations in Manila as being [...] "good". With an estimated daily ridership of 200,000 passengers, the LRT-2 operates significantly below its designed capacity of between 570,000 and 580,000 passengers per day. Operating under capacity since 2004, government officials have admitted that system extensions are overdue, although {{in the absence of}} major investment in the system's expansion, LRT-2 management has resorted to experimenting with and/or implementing other solutions to maximize the use of the system, including having <b>bus</b> <b>feeder</b> lines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{family of}} {{parameters}} {{to evaluate the}} anti-fault ability of distribution networks is put forward. The total anti-fault ability {{is defined as the}} product of the anti-fault parameter of the network structure and the anti-fault parameter restricted by the limitation of electrical devices. Faults are assumed on each <b>feeder,</b> each <b>bus,</b> each substation and each transmission line, respectively. In each case, a novel approach with the index of minimum load shielding is adopted to restore the load as much as possible. A load balancing method is also discussed. The shielded load due to the network structure and the limitation of the electrical devices are analyzed, respectively. A distribution network anti-fault ability table is used to show the influence range and extend of the various types of faults. A load shielding table ordering the influence extent in turn and a feeder-fault related table showing in which cases a certain feeder section will be shielded due to network structure or security considerations are also presented. An example is given showing that the evaluation of anti-fault ability is helpful for distribution network planning and emergency adjustments...|$|R
500|$|As {{the network}} has expanded, high {{ridership}} in new trains have led to increasing instances of overcrowding and delays on the Delhi Metro. To alleviate the problem, 8 coach trains have been introduced in Yellow line and Blue line {{and an increase in}} the frequency of trains has been proposed. Infrequent, overcrowded and erratic <b>feeder</b> <b>bus</b> services connecting stations to nearby localities have also been reported as an area of concern.|$|E
500|$|Fish {{from the}} North Sea ports and whisky from the distilleries of Speyside became {{important}} goods traffic. The Royal Family used the Deeside Line for travel {{to and from}} Balmoral Castle {{and when they were}} in residence a daily special 'Messenger Train' ran from Aberdeen; for most of the railway's life this was its only Sunday service. The company ran three hotels, and a network of <b>feeder</b> <b>bus</b> services was developed in the early 20th century. In 1923, it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway as its Northern Scottish area, passing on [...] of line and 122 steam locomotives, most of them 4-4-0 tender locomotives. Although the railway had several branches, its remoteness has resulted in only its main line remaining today as part of the Aberdeen to Inverness Line.|$|E

50|$|Combined, the Market-Frankford Line and Broad Street Line {{have the}} sixth highest {{ridership}} of rapid transit {{systems in the}} United States, with a daily ridership of 316,253. The rapid transit system has a total length of 25 mi and 50 stations. <b>Feeder</b> trolley and <b>bus</b> systems connect to the terminals of the Market-Frankford Line. At 69th Street Transportation Center, the Norristown High Speed Line, SEPTA Route 101, and SEPTA Route 102 connect to nearby suburbs, and a large bus depot handles SEPTA suburban bus routes. Near the eastern terminus of the Market-Frankford Line, three trackless trolley lines and multiple diesel bus lines converge. In addition, several regional rail lines stop at the Fern Rock Transportation Center of the Broad Street Line.|$|R
50|$|The {{line has}} six trains {{running in the}} morning and evening rush hour periods, and limited service on {{weekends}} and holidays. <b>Bus</b> <b>feeder</b> lines, including the Northstar Link from St. Cloud to Big Lake station, bring residents along the corridor to the nearest train station. Once in downtown, commuters can walk upstairs to the METRO Blue and Green Lines, take a bus into other areas of the city, or go into one of the nearby buildings integrated into the Minneapolis skyway system. In the first year, 2010, Metro Ridership fell well short of its goal of 3,400 weekday trips from this station.

40|$|AbstractFor {{rational}} {{estimation of}} users’ benefit, {{it is necessary}} to understand users’ willingness-to-pay (WTP). In several WTP studies, stated preference data have been analyzed using Mixed Logit (ML) model specification. In ML models, {{it is necessary to}} make an assumption regarding the distribution of random parameters. Researchers have developed ML models with different distributional assumptions of random parameters. However, the effect of distributional assumptions of random parameters in ML model on goodness-of-fit and WTP values has not been studied adequately. In the present work, an investigation is carried out in this regard taking reference to a case study of <b>feeder</b> service to <b>bus</b> stop in rural India. Various Mixed Logit models were attempted with different distributional assumptions of random parameters such as normal, log normal, triangular, uniform, constrained normal, constrained triangular, constrained uniform, etc. Variation of goodness of fit statistics and WTP values are observed across different ML models. The work indicates the importance of distributional assumption while developing ML model in WTP studies. The work also indicates that it is desirable to develop several ML models with different distributional assumptions and then select the superior one based on goodness of fit statistics...|$|R
