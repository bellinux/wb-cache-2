To evaluate {{the effect of}} "cheap talk," they consider two communication structures (one-way and two-way communication) and two types of coordination games (one with a cooperative strategy and a second in which one strategy is less "risky"). In games with a cooperative strategy, one-way communication increases play of the Pareto-dominant equilibrium relative to the no communication baseline; two-way communication does not always decrease the <b>frequency</b> of <b>coordination</b> failures.

Finally, we investigate whether the various characteristics of an intervention - its size, <b>frequency,</b> or <b>coordination</b> - can increase the probability of success. We find that intervention did tend to moderate same-day exchange-rate movements relative to the previous day, but this effect is not robust across subperiods or currencies and it occurs infrequently.

We assess whether information about the interaction partner helps eliminate the imperfect equilibrium. Our treatments involve three information-enhancing mechanisms: repetition and two kinds of individual signals: messages from partner or observation of his past choices. Repetition-based learning increases the frequencies of the most efficient outcome and the most costly strategic mismatch. Moreover, it is superseded by individual signals. Like previous empirical studies, we find that signals provide a screening of partners' intentions that reduces the <b>frequency</b> of <b>coordination</b> failures. Unlike these studies, {{we find that the}} transmission of information between partners, either via messages or observation, does not suffice to significantly increase the overall efficiency of outcomes.
