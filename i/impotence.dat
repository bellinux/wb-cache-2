5|$|Krishna (dark/black): A fraudster, a {{trespasser}} {{and one who}} causes <b>impotence</b> is {{cast into}} this hell.|$|E
5|$|Goriot, {{supportive}} of Rastignac's {{interest in his}} daughter and furious with her husband's tyrannical control over her, finds himself unable to help. When his other daughter, Anastasie, informs him {{that she has been}} selling off her husband's family jewelry to pay her lover's debts, the old man is overcome with grief at his own <b>impotence</b> and suffers a stroke.|$|E
5|$|Green Wing {{had some}} plot lines {{that were never}} used. Unused storylines {{included}} Alan having an 80-year-old wife and step-grandchildren as old as him, and Guy suffering from <b>impotence.</b> Pile originally wanted the show to cover the entire hospital, not just doctors, but also porters, car park attendants and kitchen staff. However, she eventually decided that they had enough material with the eight main doctors and human resources workers.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund married Maria Christierna of Habsburg, a niece of RudolphII, on 6August. However, the {{marriage}} was never consummated. Sigismund accused Margaret Majláth (who {{was the mother of}} his executed cousin, Balthasar Báthory) of witchcraft, causing his <b>impotence.</b> Historian László Nagy notes that Sigismund's contemporaries made no reference to his relationship with women, showing that Sigismund was homosexual.|$|E
5|$|The Country Wife is more neatly {{constructed}} {{than most}} Restoration comedies, but {{is typical of}} its time and place in having three sources and three plots. The separate plots are interlinked but distinct, each projecting a sharply different mood. They may be schematised as Horner's <b>impotence</b> trick, the married life of Pinchwife and Margery, and the courtship of Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E
5|$|A luxurious ball {{followed}} the wedding on 20 May. Louis Stanislas found his wife repulsive; she was considered ugly, tedious, and {{ignorant of the}} customs of the court of Versailles. The marriage remained unconsummated for years. Biographers disagree about the reason. The most common theories propose Louis Stanislas' alleged <b>impotence</b> (according to biographer Antonia Fraser) or his unwillingness to sleep with his wife due to her poor personal hygiene. She never brushed her teeth, plucked her eyebrows, or used any perfumes. At {{the time of his}} marriage, Louis Stanislas was obese and waddled instead of walked. He never exercised and continued to eat enormous amounts of food.|$|E
5|$|A {{widespread}} misconception {{has arisen}} in Pakistan that polio vaccine contained Haram ingredients and could cause <b>impotence</b> and infertility in male children, leading some less-educated parents {{not to have}} their children vaccinated. This belief is most prevalent in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the FATA region, where {{people are likely to}} be influenced by conservative teachings. There also have been attacks on polio vaccination teams. This is hampering international efforts to eradicate polio in Pakistan and globally since the virus can be carried by travelers.|$|E
5|$|Permanent seed {{implantation}} {{is suitable}} for patients with a localised tumour and good prognosis and {{has been shown to}} be a highly effective treatment to prevent the cancer from returning. The survival rate is similar to that found with EBRT or surgery (radical prostatectomy), but with fewer side effects such as <b>impotence</b> and incontinence. The procedure can be completed quickly and patients are usually able to go home on the same day of treatment and return to normal activities after 1 to 2 days.|$|E
5|$|She {{identifies}} the UN as the book's villain and criticizes the UN's practise of moral equivalency that treats both sides equally even though {{one side is}} clearly dominant and brutally oppressive. It results in the requirement of its personnel to remain neutral but Off questions how a peacekeeper can remain neutral while watching people being killed. The book treats this as a reality of international relations, which places precedence on state sovereignty over human rights, and a factor in making the UN slow, ineffectual, and inappropriately bureaucratic. She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps diminish the sense of <b>impotence</b> in being unable to intervene.|$|E
5|$|The storylines {{follow the}} three couples {{as they try}} to stay {{faithful}} to each other. They are held back by issues such as <b>impotence,</b> infidelity, and unplanned pregnancy. Their lives are further complicated by their jobs, money troubles, and moving in together. Bullen embellished the scripts with events from his own personal life. The directors and producers made additional contributions, with the intent to keep the fiction in the programme as true to life as possible. The series was filmed in Greater Manchester {{in the first half of}} 1998, using Granada Television's studios, and exterior locations.|$|E
5|$|The High Seas Fleet, {{particularly}} its wartime <b>impotence</b> {{and ultimate}} fate, strongly influenced the later German navies, the Reichsmarine and Kriegsmarine. Former Imperial Navy officers continued {{to serve in}} the subsequent institutions, including Admiral Erich Raeder, Hipper's former chief of staff, who became the {{commander in chief of the}} Reichsmarine. Raeder advocated long-range commerce raiding by surface ships, rather than constructing a large surface fleet to challenge the Royal Navy, which he viewed to be a futile endeavor. His initial version of Plan Z, the construction program for the Kriegsmarine in the late 1930s, called for large number of s, long-range light cruisers, and reconnaissance forces for attacking enemy shipping, though he was overruled by Adolf Hitler, who advocated a large fleet of battleships.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{campaign}} over Romania {{and against}} the synthetic oil plants in the Ruhr—in which most oilfields had been destroyed, captured or damaged by 1945—triggered a critical fuel shortage from the autumn of 1944 onwards which denied the Luftwaffe the resources to capitalise on its numerical strength. Paradoxically, production was able to replace the relatively small losses and operational serviceability reached an all-time high since ground crews had more opportunity to work on machines. The Luftwaffe was still capable of taking a toll on Bomber Command on occasion, but unless more powerful radars and communications could be introduced in time it was doubtful British air superiority at night could be challenged. The <b>impotence</b> of the night fighter force as an organisation was demonstrated during the attack on Dresden when the second wave of Allied bombers was hardly opposed. Operation Clarion, launched later that month, was not adequately opposed either.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, after {{studying}} butterfly coloration, Theodor Eimer (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, On Orthogenesis: And the <b>Impotence</b> of Natural Selection in Species Formation. Eimer claimed there were trends in evolution with no adaptive significance {{that would be}} difficult to explain by natural selection. To supporters of orthogenesis, in some cases species could be led by such trends to extinction. Eimer linked orthogenesis to neo-Lamarckism in his 1890 book Organic Evolution as the Result of the Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics According to the Laws of Organic Growth. He used examples such as the evolution of the horse to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a materialist who rejected any vitalist or teleological approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new species.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{was first}} {{observed}} to be radioactive in 1898, by the German chemist Gerhard Carl Schmidt and later that year, independently, by the Polish-French physicist Marie Curie. It {{was the second}} element that {{was found to be}} radioactive, after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by French physicist Henri Becquerel. Between 1900 and 1903, British physicists Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements. This observation led to the identification of the half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity. The biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903. The newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity excited scientists and the general public alike. In the 1920s, thorium's radioactivity was promoted as a cure for rheumatism, diabetes, and sexual <b>impotence.</b> In 1932, most of these uses were banned in the United States after a federal investigation into the health effects of radioactivity. Public interest in radioactivity had declined {{by the end of the}} 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Incidence of <b>impotence</b> is {{approximately}} 85 percent higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers, {{and it is}} a key cause of erectile dysfunction (ED). Smoking causes <b>impotence</b> because it promotes arterial narrowing.|$|E
25|$|Uro-genital, as {{frequent}} urination, urinary urgency, dyspareunia, or <b>impotence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{side effects}} include galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, <b>impotence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{apparent}} <b>impotence</b> of the documents, {{they continued to}} be widely publicized in American conservative circles.|$|E
25|$|On 5 September, Task Force Alpha was {{weakened}} to <b>impotence</b> when GM 31 {{was withdrawn}} to Savannakhet for refurbishing.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Medlow (Byron Webster)—psychiatrist for Burt Campbell in Season 1, he {{attempts}} to assist Burt with his <b>impotence</b> and then his perceived invisibility.|$|E
25|$|Sexual arousal {{disorders}} {{were previously}} known as frigidity in women and <b>impotence</b> in men, though these {{have now been}} replaced with less judgmental terms. <b>Impotence</b> {{is now known as}} erectile dysfunction, and frigidity has been replaced with a number of terms describing specific problems that can be broken down into four categories as described by the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: lack of desire, lack of arousal, pain during intercourse, and lack of orgasm.|$|E
25|$|The {{abdominal}} approach {{carries a}} small risk of <b>impotence</b> in males (e.g. 1-2% in abdominal rectopexy). Abdominal operations may be open or laparoscopic (keyhole surgery).|$|E
25|$|Less common {{side-effects}} include {{red skin}} (erythema), dry skin, damaged fingernails, a dry mouth (xerostomia), water retention, and sexual <b>impotence.</b> Some medications can trigger allergic or pseudoallergic reactions.|$|E
25|$|An Indian {{study of}} 500 men ages 18 to 60 {{published}} in the International Journal of <b>Impotence</b> Research found flaccid, stretched and erect length to be 8.21cm, 10.88cm and 13.01cm, respectively.|$|E
25|$|One {{possibly}} serious, but rare, {{side effect}} with vardenafil is heart attack. Also, in rare cases, vardenafil use may cause priapism, {{a very painful}} emergency condition that can cause <b>impotence</b> if left untreated.|$|E
25|$|Potassium nitrate {{was once}} thought to induce <b>impotence,</b> and is still falsely rumored to be in {{institutional}} food (such as military fare) as an anaphrodisiac; however, {{there is no scientific}} evidence for such properties.|$|E
25|$|In December 1893 the <b>impotence</b> of the Giolitti cabinet {{to restore}} public order, menaced by {{disturbances}} in Sicily and the Banca Romana scandal, {{gave rise to}} a general demand that Crispi should return to power.|$|E
25|$|Hypogonadism, a {{decrease}} in male sex hormones may manifest as <b>impotence,</b> infertility, loss of sexual drive, and testicular atrophy, and can result from primary gonadal injury or suppression of hypothalamic/pituitary function. Hypogonadism is associated with cirrhosis due to alcoholism or hemochromatosis.|$|E
25|$|A {{standardised}} questionnaire which studies sexual <b>impotence</b> problems. It {{is made up}} of 62 items (48 of {{them are}} meant for both partners while 14 are meant exclusively for the dysfunctional patient). The scoring and the clinical evaluation must have done with the traditional method.|$|E
25|$|Many people {{affected}} by multiple system atrophy experience dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, which commonly manifests as orthostatic hypotension, <b>impotence,</b> loss of sweating, dry mouth and urinary retention and incontinence. Palsy of the vocal cords {{is an important}} and sometimes initial clinical manifestation of the disorder.|$|E
25|$|Seminal vesiculitis (also {{known as}} spermatocystitis) is an {{inflammation}} of the seminal vesicles, most often caused by bacterial infection. Symptoms of seminal vesiculitis can include vague back or lower abdominal pain; penile, scrotal, or perineal pain; painful ejaculation; hematospermia; irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms; and <b>impotence.</b>|$|E
25|$|He was {{a member}} of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders task forces on sexual {{disorders}} for the DSM-III-R, DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR editions. He is editor of the Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy and on the editorial board of the International Journal of <b>Impotence</b> Research.|$|E
25|$|Side {{effects of}} {{radiation}} therapy might occur {{after a few weeks}} into treatment. Both types of radiation therapy may cause diarrhea and mild rectal bleeding due to radiation proctitis, as well as potential urinary incontinence and <b>impotence.</b> Symptoms tend to improve over time except erections which typically worsen as time progresses.|$|E
25|$|The Yongle Emperor {{may have}} {{suffered}} from undisclosed <b>impotence</b> in his later life. He is remembered very much for his cruelty, just like his father. He killed most of the Jianwen Emperor's palace servants, tortured many of his nephew's loyalists to death, killed or by other means badly treated their relatives. His successor freed most of the survivors.|$|E
25|$|Each {{treatment}} has disadvantages that limit {{its use in}} certain circumstances. Although orchiectomy is a low-risk surgery, the psychological impact of removing the testicles can be significant, and sterility is certain. The loss of testosterone can cause hot flashes, weight gain, loss of libido, enlargement of the breasts (gynecomastia), <b>impotence,</b> penile atrophy, and osteoporosis. GnRH agonists eventually cause the same side effects as orchiectomy but may cause worse symptoms {{at the beginning of}} treatment. When GnRH agonists are first used, testosterone surges can lead to increased bone pain from metastatic cancer, so antiandrogens or abarelix is often added to blunt these side effects. Estrogens are not commonly used because they increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and blood clots. In general, the antiandrogens do not cause <b>impotence,</b> and usually cause less loss of bone and muscle mass. Ketoconazole can cause liver damage with prolonged use, and aminoglutethimide can cause skin rashes.|$|E
25|$|It {{consists}} of two questionnaires (i.e. a male and a female questionnaire) with 28 items each. It studies sexual dysfunctions in heterosexual subjects. It provides a total score and subscales scores: intercourse frequency, incommunicability, dissatisfaction, avoiding sexual intercourse, absence of sexuality, anorgasmia and vaginismus (only in the female version), <b>impotence</b> and premature ejaculation (only in the male version).|$|E
