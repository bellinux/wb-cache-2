50|$|An unfunded credit {{derivative}} is {{one where}} <b>credit</b> <b>protection</b> is bought and sold between bilateral counterparties without the protection seller having to put up money upfront or {{at any given time}} during the life of the deal unless an event of default occurs. Usually these contracts are traded pursuant to an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreement. Most credit derivatives of this sort are credit default swaps. If the credit derivative is entered into by a financial institution or a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and payments under the <b>credit</b> derivative are <b>funded</b> using securitization techniques, such that a debt obligation is issued by the financial institution or SPV to support these obligations, this is known as a <b>funded</b> <b>credit</b> derivative.|$|R

40|$|Credit {{derivatives}} {{allow for}} buying protection on corporate debt, {{but also on}} sov-ereign debt. In this paper we examine the implications for sovereign debt crises.

40|$|We {{present a}} static general {{equilibrium}} model of an open economy where agents are heterogeneous in terms of observable wealth and there are endogenous credit constraints due to imperfect creditor <b>protection.</b> Improved <b>credit</b> <b>protection,</b> harder assets, and more efficient bankruptcy procedures increase output, investment, and credit penetration. Better <b>credit</b> <b>protection</b> and harder assets lead to higher interest rate spreads. In a capital constrained (unconstrained) economy, greater (lower) wealth inequality leads to higher (lower) investment and output. Interest rate spreads are lower in richer and more unequal economies {{in terms of their}} wealth distribution. We also show that increased labour protection leads to lower wages and output in the presence of credit market imperfections. Nevertheless, increased protection benefits workers in (and owners of) firms with strong balance sheets.
