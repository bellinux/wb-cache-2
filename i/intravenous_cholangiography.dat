40|$|Abstract Background/Purpose In {{anomalous}} {{arrangement of}} the pancreaticobiliary duct (AAPBD), there is anatomical diversity of the cystic duct. In this study, we evaluated {{the influence of the}} level of insertion of the cystic duct into the extrahepatic bile duct on the pathophysiology of AAPBD. Methods Thirty-two children with AAPBD were examined using cholangiopancreatography. If the cystic duct entered the hepatic duct at the lower middle point of the extrahepatic bile duct, it was defined as low confluence; otherwise, it was considered as high confluence. Clinical details and radiological variables were compared between these 2 groups. Results Low confluence was noted in 8 of the 32 patients. Seven of the 8 had fusiform-type or nondilatation-type choledochus, and the cystic-type was significantly less frequent than in the high-confluence group. The diameter of the common bile duct was significantly smaller and the main pancreatic duct was significantly greater than in the high-confluence group. Pancreatitis was more common and biliopancreatic reflux on computed tomography combined with <b>intravenous</b> infusion <b>cholangiography</b> was more often seen in the low-confluence group than in the high-confluence group. Conclusions Bile juice could regurgitate into the pancreatic duct via the low confluence of the cystic duct, resulting in severe pancreatitis in patients with AAPBD...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{investigated}} the preoperative feasibility of using spiral computed tomography (SCT) after <b>intravenous</b> infusion <b>cholangiography</b> (IVC-SCT) for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the aberrant or unusual {{anatomy of the}} bile duct and severe inflammation or adhesions around the gallbladder sometimes require a conversion to open surgery. METHODS: Laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LC's) were attempted on 440 patients, and preoperative IVC-SCT also was attempted {{in all of these}} patients. Using this spiral scanning technique, the bile ducts, cystic duct, and gallbladder were assessed for contour abnormalities, relative position, and filling defects. Forty-seven patients were diagnosed with having stones in their common bile duct or common hepatic duct. RESULTS: Three-hundred eighty-seven patients out of the 440 patients (88. 0 %) who were subjected to IVC-SCT had the length and course of their cystic duct successfully determined. Anomalous unions of the cystic duct were seen in 59 (15. 2 %) of 387 patients with respect to the operative findings, and 48 of 440 patients (10. 9 %) had severe adhesions to Calot's triangle and the surrounding tissues. In these 48 patients, 45 patients (94 %) had a nonvisualized cystic duct on IVC-SCT. The preoperative assessment of the feasibility (dense adhesions obscuring Calot's triangle) of using IVC-SCT demonstrated that the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 93 %, 98 %, and 94 %, respectively. Five patients had to be converted to open surgery, and the overall morbidity rates for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 0. 9 % (4 of 440). CONCLUSIONS: The most important factor in assessing the feasibility of using laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not the nonvisualized gallbladder, but the nonvisualized cystic duct on IVC-SCT. IVC-SCT may be of benefit to those patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonography, {{although}} an accurate method of detecting stones within the gall bladder, is unreliable {{for the detection}} of bile duct stones for which per-operative cholangiography remains the standard investigation. Fifty seven patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy had both a pre-operative intravenous cholangiogram and per-operative cholangiography. The pre-operative investigation is shown to be at least as effective in the detection of common bile duct stones and only missed a duct stone in one patient. The substitution of pre-operative <b>intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography</b> for routine per-operative cholangiography would result in a significant reduction in operating time, may provide advance knowledge on the biliary anatomy and would allow advance planning of the likely procedure. It is suggested that pre-operative <b>intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography,</b> carried out on the day of admission, should be considered as a preferred alternative investigation to per-operative cholangiography...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{meglumine}} iodipamide (Cholografin®) hepatotoxicity were confirmed by liver biopsy.

30|$|ERCP was {{accepted}} as the ‘gold standard’ for bile duct imaging, with the advantage of permitting the bile duct to be cleared of stones. However, it is an invasive technique, with a reported mortality rate of 0.1 – 3 % [11] and complications including pancreatitis, cholangitis, perforation and bleeding. Ideally, its use should be restricted to therapeutic procedures alone and not recommended as a routine examination. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography</b> has the same sensitivity and specificity as ERCP [24]; however, it is an invasive technique and is associated with ionising radiation.|$|E
30|$|The efferent limb of the Roux loop was surgically {{fixed to}} the parietal {{peritoneum}} in a right anterior location, or the afferent limb was fixed anteriorly in the central upper abdomen [7]. Marking surgical clips, sometimes in combination with prior CT images and/or transjejunal cholangiograms provided information about the fixation site for loop puncture. Unfixed loops were accessed percutaneously with knowledge of previous CT, CT <b>intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography</b> (CT–IVC) or by ‘roadmapping’ with percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) to opacify the Roux loop. Not all patients had marking clips, as some were transferred from other institutions or had surgery before the introduction of this technique.|$|E
40|$|To compare <b>intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography</b> (i. v. c.) and {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) as preoperative imaging techniques in patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Twenty patients underwent i. v. c. and MRI, 40 axial 'localizer' images were first obtained with a half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE) sequence. Next, an extremely high T 2 -weighted rapid acquisition relaxation enhancement (RARE) acquisition (TE = 1100 msec) was used for MR cholangiography. All images obtained with i. v. c. and MRI were independently analyzed by two observers. The relative visibility of the (normal or abnormal) gallbladder (GB), cystic duct (CD), and bile ducts (BD) on both types of images was scored as follows: 1 = MRI better than i. v. c.; 2 = no difference; 3 = i. v. c. better than MRI. We observed 3 anatomic variants: 1 of the cystic duct and 2 of the intrahepatic bile ducts; 15 patients had gallstones; one had cholecystitis. Magnetic resonance images were considered more informative than i. v. c. -images for visualization of GB in 11 patients (55 %), for CD in 9 patients (45 %), and in 8 patients (40 %) for visualization of the CBD. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography</b> outperformed MRI {{in the evaluation of}} the CBD and CD in one patient (5 %).

Methods: We report a case of duplicated gallbladder with symptomatic unilobar gallstones. Appropriate biliary workup (ultrasound, oral cholecystography, and <b>intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography)</b> allowed a correct preoperative diagnosis. Results: Laparoscopic treatment included selective removal of the diseased accessory gallbladder. However, postoperative acute cholecystitis and symptomatic gallstone occurred in the remaining main gallbladder, and laparoscopic reintervention was required 27 months later.

However, there still remain serious reservations regarding its safety and accuracy, despite some reports in the literature to the contrary. METHODS: A personal series of 1000 patients undergoing routine preoperative infusion cholangiography was reviewed. RESULTS: The cholangiograms detected bile duct stones with a sensitivity of 93. 3 % and a specificity of 99. 3 %.

40|$|Imaging {{is central}} to the {{investigation}} and diagnoses of biliary tract disease. Upper abdominal pain, jaundice and abnormal liver function test are common symptoms and signs and imaging of the biliary tract should be performed to make an exact diagnosis of the disease.

Several imaging techniques are obsolete namely oral cholecystography, <b>Intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography</b> and biliary scintigraphy, and should therefore be omitted. These imaging techniques are expensive and we should choose one or two options. Abdominal ultrasound is less expensive and can be performed rapidly without special preparation or contrast agent.

40|$|It is well {{established}} {{that a number of}} organic anions are excreted by the liver into bile in association with a marked increase in bile flow. Previous studies have shown that iodipamide (3, 3 '-(adipoyl-diimino) bis[2, 4, 6 -triiodobenzoic acid]), the radiographic contrast material used for <b>intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography,</b> is a potent choleretic. Experiments were performed in unanesthetized dogs to determine if the increased bile flow produced by iodipamide is canalicular or ductular in origin, to quantitate the choleresis associated with iodipamide and taurocholate excretion, and to correlate these findings with the results of in vitro studies in which the osmotic activities of iodipamide and taurocholate in both isotonic saline and bile were determined. The plasma erythritol clearance increase linearly with the excretion of iodipamide, indicating that iodipamide stimulates canalicular bile flow. The choleretic potency of iodipamide (22 ml/mmol) is approximately 3 times that of taurocholate (7. 8 ml/mmol), yet the osmotic activity of iodipamide in bile (1. 5 mosmol/mmol) is only twice as great as that of taurocholate in bile (0. 8 mosmol/mmol).

Since 1974, 40 cases of choledochocele have been reported with enough clinical information for critical review. Ten of these patients were 21 {{years of age or}} younger. Presenting symptoms were not specific for choledochocele; they were generally interpreted to result from other biliary or gastrointestinal disorders that are more common for each age group. In pediatric patients the most frequent signs and symptoms of choledochocele were abdominal pain (70 %), nausea and/or vomiting (60 %), jaundice (30 %), and acute pancreatitis (30 %). While two-thirds of adult patients with choledochocele had undergone prior cholecystectomy (with stones rarely found), this was observed only once in children. Obstructive symptoms led to evaluation of the stomach and duodenum with either barium upper GI series or endoscopy in all children.

Bergman, Ellison, and Dunea [1] initially reported the occurrence of acute renal failure in a diabetic patient after infusion urography. Since that time, at least 122 insulin-dependent (type 1) and maturity onset (type 2) diabetic patients who developed deterioration of renal function after contrast media study have been reported [1 – 21]. Among these 122, 70 patients (57. 3 %) evidenced renal dysfunction following intravenous urography (IVU). Sixty-four (91 %) of these 70 patients had a serum creatinine concentration equal to or more than 2 mg/dl, while six had a level below 2 mg/dl before receiving contrast media.

Thus, of 122 patients developing contrast media-induced renal failure, 18 (15 %) had serum creatinine concentrations below 2 mg/dl. A serum creatinine concentration of 2 mg/dl was selected for analyzing prior reports to exclude minor creatinine elevations due to diuretics or transient dehydration.

Trying to verify the pertinency of such, alleged, inconveniences and limitations a personal series is analysed, retrospectively until 1976 and prospectively from then on. A total of 61 of these operations were performed (1973 - 81), on 47 women and 14 men, 25 % below 50 years of age, 33 % over 70, 14 of them as Resurgery. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography</b> was obtained, preoperatively, for evaluation of the duct width, which was less than 15 mm in 20 patients (32 %).

The long term results on the survivors are classified as EXCELLENT in 48, GOOD in 8, FAIR in 3 and POOR in 1. It is concluded that this is a safe and very effective therapeutical measure, even when carried down on ducts less than 15 mm wide, provided a few technical requirements are respected.

40|$|In {{the open}} {{cholecystectomy}} era, the established principle for treating biliary calculi was to perform intraoperative cholangiography to diagnose and treat the concomitant common duct stone {{at the time}} of cholecystectomy. To reduce unnecessary cholangiograms, a selective cholangio-gram policy based on preoperative and operative criteria was sometimes used. Although both time and cost were saved, a 4 % to 10 % chance of missing unsuspected com-mon duct stones was associated with this policy. The introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Australia initially led to an abandonment of the principles of biliary surgery. Rates of intraoperative cholangiography declined as stones were either ignored or diagnosed preoperatively by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and/or <b>intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography.</b> When stones were identified, they were treated by preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy. This decline in cholangiography was asso-ciated with a twofold to fourfold rise in serious bile duct injury as well as a delay in its diagnosis. Over the past two years, as laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become estab-lished in Australia, practice is returning to the standards of the open cholecystectomy era. Intraoperative cholangiogra-phy rates have been increasing along with the proportion of patients having their duct stones removed laparoscopically. To succeed, this practice depends on the use of fluoroscopic cholangiography, which should be the standard of care in the laparoscopic era. With laparoscopic cholecystectomy, intraoperative cholangiography is no longer optional, but mandatory. Not only does it reduce the incidence and severity of bile duct injury, but it also trains the surgeon to develop techniques of laparoscopic duct exploration...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{determine}} {{the possibility of}} preoperative evaluation of the feasibility of laparoscopic cholecystectomy based on the standard preoperative examinations and findings. Methods. During 1997, 100 consecutively operated patients with the diagnosis of chronic calculous cholecystitis were followed up. Sex and age, {{and the results of}} blood count, sedimentation rate, ultrasonography (US), and <b>intravenous</b> <b>cholangiography</b> (IVC) were monitored. Based on adhesions, fibrosis in Calot’s triangle and pericholecystitis, surgical interventions were classified as minor and major. Results. Minor operations were performed in 57, and major in 43 patients. Earlier surgical interventions had been carried out in 8 (18. 6 %) patients from the major surgery group, while 9 (15. 79 %) patients had undergone minor surgery. Out of 57 patients with minor surgery, IVC verified the contrast medium filling of the gallbladder in 55 (96. 49 %) of the patients. Tense gallbladder or wall stratification was not revealed by ultrasonography in any of the patients from this group. Out of 43 patients with major surgery, the gallbladder was not filled with the contrast medium during IVC in 34 (79. 07 %) patients, while the stratified and tense gallbladder was found by US in 2 (4. 65 %) patients. The mean sedimentation rate was 14. 3 in the patients with minor surgery, and 23. 5 in major surgery group. Mean WBC in the patients with minor surgery was 7. 4 × 109. The patients with major surgery had slightly increased mean value of the white cell count. It was 8. 3 × 109. Conclusion. Statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0. 05) was found between the variables of the IVC, sedimentation rate, the white blood count, and the earlier operations. No significant difference was found between other analyzed variables...|$|E
