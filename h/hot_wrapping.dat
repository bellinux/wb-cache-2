After a couple of hours the pit is opened and the food removed and eaten. Pigs are too valuable to be served regularly, and are reserved for special occasions only.|$|R

Then after the [...] "bowels are thoroughly cleaned," [...] it was proper to take 8 to 10 ounces of blood from the arm if, after purging, the pulse was full or tense.

If the pulse was weak and low, he recommended camomile or snakeroot as a stimulant, and blisters or blankets soaked in <b>hot</b> vinegar <b>wrapped</b> around the lower limbs. To restore the patient he recommended [...] "gruel, sago, panada, tapioca, tea, coffee, weak chocolate, wine whey, chicken broth, and white meats, according to the weak or active state of the system; the fruits of the season may be eaten with advantage at all times."

The insulation consists of graphite tubes at the <b>hot</b> side and <b>wrapped</b> fibre blankets. The inner shrauds are fixed in radial and axial directions by means of Tour spheres and one special spacer, respectively. First test runs showed increasing thermal fluxes and thermal conductivities with growing gas pressure. Additionally, the temperatures {{at the top of}} the horizontally arranged pressure tube were rauch higher than Chose at the battom position. This was caused by natural convection within the fibre blankets. Because of the paar results the insulation was dismantled and and mounted again.

50|$|Traditionally, a fire using 'Iliahi (sandalwood) {{is built}} in a dirt pit called the imu. The pit is usually about 6 feet (1.8 m) long, 4 feet (1.2 m) wide and 3 ft (90 cm) deep. Rocks are then placed in the pit to retain cooking heat long after the flames have burned down. Once the rocks have become {{extremely}} hot, the hole is lined with traditional vegetation, such as banana leaves. The meat to be cooked is salted, stuffed with more <b>hot</b> rocks, then <b>wrapped</b> with ti and banana leaves. To maintain even heating and to retain the meat's natural moisture, the meat is covered with wet burlap, then {{with a layer of}} sand or soil. The meat is then left to cook in the pit for six to seven hours, absorbing smoke and steam from the koa wood and banana leaves. When the meat is fully cooked, it is removed from the imu and shredded. This is done to allow the melted fat to mix with the meat to help maintain its uniform consistency and flavor.|$|R
5000|$|Having {{demonstrated}} that the effectiveness of most Bencao gangmu human drug prescriptions was not attributable to pharmacognosy, Cooper & Sivin examined whether the symbolic aspects of magic and ritual in Chinese folk medicine could explain why pharmacopoeias continue to list human drugs. Within their sample of 8 human drugs, prescriptions mention two dozen symbolic ritual procedures (1973: 265). Sympathetic magic, for example, could explain using blood to treat blood loss (52.17.3 above) and attempting to treat bone damage with bone (52.27.1). Li Shizhen quotes the (9th century) Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang.The book Youyang Zaju: Once a military man in Jingzhou had an injured tibia. Doctor Zhang Qizheng treated him {{with a kind of}} medicinal wine, which was taken orally. A small segment of broken bone in the wounded tibia was taken out and a kind of medicinal ointment was applied externally. The injury was cured. The patient kept the small piece of bone from his tibia under his bed. But two years later there was a recurrence. Doctor Zhang said that the bone from the tibia was cold now. He searched for the bone and found it under the man's bed. He washed the bone with <b>hot</b> water, <b>wrapped</b> it in silk fabric, and kept in a good place. After that the pain was gone. This shows the interrelationship between the bone left under the bed and the pain. How can we say a withered bone has no sense? People should be aware of this. (tr. Luo 2003: 4179) Prescription 52.27.4 (tr. Luo 2003: 4171) specifies using a dead child's bone: [...] "To treat bone fractures: Bone of infant, calcined, and muskmelon seed, stir-fried. Grind the above ingredients into powder, and take the powder by mouth with good wine. It stops the pain right away." ...|$|R

When 1-1.5 m left to the end of form, woven fabric is cut, as the purl yarn woven fabric with an increasing of woven linen is tightened and can break. After the cutting, the edges of the carpet are styled with purl of the remaining threads. From three or four filaments they make small knots, it’s provides durability of the carpet.Making of takir gilam (weaving technique) is a very complex process, and they used average 12-14 kg of yarn.Turkmen clan Ersari living in Surkhan oasis is considered as the best masters for making of takir gilam.From the wool yarn they produced takinamat of white, black, blue and other colors. Wool was purified and scotched, shook up then it was painted in large boilers and laid on a sacking in a variety of patterns, mostly diamond and a cross shaped. Then they moistened it a little with <b>hot</b> water, <b>wrapped,</b> pressed by hand and knees, and hung up. Then again they pressed it, but mainly this was the business of young men.
