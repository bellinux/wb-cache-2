40|$|Summary An {{investigation}} of the pervasive impact of multi-access technologies, i. e. the internet, wireless data, wired and wireless voice, and interactive TV, on consumer <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> {{was carried out in}} the Dutch market by some researchers. This article extends the analytic generalizability of their research findings through a replication study in the emerging markets of China. By comparing the empirical research findings, we reveal that there is {{no significant difference in the}} impacts of multi-access technologies on consumer <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> within dissimilar contexts; as long as both the business and the technologies are prevalent. This affirms the argument that the use of more sophisticated multi-access technologies has positive effects on the maturity level of exchange processes and stakeholders interactions in consumer <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions,</b> thereby leading to an increase in the expected success of the auctions. <b>Electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> Multi-access technologies Maturity level Exchange process Stakeholders Customer perceived value...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Researchers {{studying}} on-line auction venues {{have focused}} on the business-to-consumer (B 2 C) auction and overlooked consumer-to-consumer (C 2 C) auctions. Since these two venues differ significantly in consumer type and auction rules, they are expected to generate different levels of consumer surplus. This paper explores the extent to which consumers in each type of auction experience the winner’s curse—that is, pay more than the minimum fixed price for identical products. The paper also examines how product value, information asymmetry, and type of auction affect the occurrence of the winner’s curse. KEY WORDS AND PHRASES: <b>Electronic</b> <b>auctions,</b> electronic bidding, information asym-metry, product value, search costs, winner’s curse. Despite the recent slowdown of e-commerce, <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> remain strong and have far exceeded expectations of revenue growth. For example, eBay’s second-quarter revenue in 2001 jumped to $ 180. 9 million, more than 80 per-cent above the same quarter a year earlier, and posted net income of $ 24. 6 million [44].

40|$|Electronic marketplaces {{have been}} used for {{procurement}} in various industries by both small and large organisations. However, the role of electronic marketplaces in procurement is still unclear and strategies and organisational implications of trading via an e-marketplace are not well defined. An electronic marketplace facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers and a common transaction mechanism for price negotiation is an <b>electronic</b> <b>auction.</b> This paper investigates the role of reverse auctions in procurement including the organisational implications and strategies for using an <b>electronic</b> <b>auction.</b> We use a case study (Revnet) of an <b>electronic</b> <b>auction</b> provider to analyse their role and benefits. The findings show that e-auctions can be used as part of a strategic procurement strategy to reduce procurement costs and improve efficiency {{and are more likely to}} be used for non-critical business for products and services that do not require strong ties with suppliers. The success of e-auctions within this context relies to a large extent on the quality of contract specifications. The narrower tactical role for e-auctions that is now emerging in some organisations is shaped by the fear and disdain surrounding their use in the past and in particular the perception of the damage to supplier relationships that their widespread adoption in procurement can create...|$|R
