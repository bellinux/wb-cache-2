25|$|The Democratic Party {{supports}} {{the death penalty}} {{far less than the}} Republican Party. Though most Democrats <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty, both Russ Feingold and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with little success. Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws, particularly in New Jersey and in New Mexico. They have also sought to prevent reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts and New York. During the Clinton administration, Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty. These efforts resulted in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law by President Clinton; the law heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{is known}} as an energetic, genial, and sociable politician, one {{who is able to}} gain {{friendship}} and influence by means of charm, humor, and candor. [...] He is called [...] "Charlie" [...] by everyone in Congress, from the highest-ranking members to the custodial employees. [...] Of his political skills, 1980s Ways and Means chair Dan Rostenkowski said, [...] "Charlie has the gifted knack of getting you to change your position, and you actually enjoy doing it. Compromising isn't so unusual in Congress. Enjoying it is." [...] The New York congressman's ability to use humor to catch others off guard before making a political point has been called [...] "Rangeling" [...] by lobbyists and others on Capitol Hill. [...] Many of his closest friends and allies <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> not been other African Americans, but white representatives from working class or rural districts; O'Neill aide Chris Matthews said these members were [...] "tied emotionally and culturally to the people they represent." ...|$|E

50|$|In fact, Republicans claim, Democrats <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> informally {{done the}} same thing and forced lobbies to hire former staffers of their own. In this view, the K Street Project was simply a way of {{ensuring}} that those lobbying <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> political views <b>in</b> line with those who hired them to lobby. Labor unions, they noted, hire people to advocate for them in Washington who share their viewpoints regardless of their access to power.|$|R

Arizona's foundation includes fast highways, adequate electric power, and abundant water, and these foundations have been laid.

The odds of the bill being enacted are seen as remote.

50|$|The {{politics}} of civil forfeiture were somewhat unusual. The more problematic federal forfeiture laws were introduced and pushed through by Republicans in the 1980s, {{with support from}} some Democrats; but efforts to reform forfeiture laws have also come from the right, as libertarians <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> focused on the basic idea as offensive to property rights. In many areas civil forfeiture adversely affects persons from minorities and low-income communities, in which the typical seizure is less than $500, and Democrats have also been critical of civil forfeiture programs.

5000|$|Poole and Rosenthal (beginning {{with their}} 1984 article [...] "The Polarization of American Politics") have also used NOMINATE data to show that, since the 1970s, party {{delegations}} <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> become ideologically homogeneous and distant {{from one another}} (a phenomenon known as [...] "polarization"). Using DW-NOMINATE scores (which permit direct comparisons between members of different Congresses across time), political scientists have demonstrated the expansion of ideological divides in Congress, which has spurred intense partisanship between Republicans and Democrats in recent decades. Contemporary political polarization has had important political consequences on American public policy, as Poole and Rosenthal (with fellow political scientist Nolan McCarty) show in their book Polarized America: The Dance of Ideology and Unequal Riches.|$|E

5000|$|According to Orman, {{he would}} have opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but is against repeal of it now. He told the Lawrence Journal-World in {{response}} to a question if the Affordable Care Act should be repealed in its entirety, amended to address specific problems or left as it is, he said, [...] "I opposed ACA because it did nothing to fix a broken system. We had a national crisis in health care before the Affordable Care Act passed, and that crisis still exists today. But instead of playing political games with this issue as Republicans and Democrats <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> done, I believe we need to focus on what Washington can actually do to ensure that health care is affordable for all Americans." ...|$|E
50|$|Judicial {{systems can}} also be {{affected}} by the implications of political polarization. For the United States in particular, scholars state that as polarization increases, confirmation rates of judges decrease. In 2012, the confirmation rate of presidential circuit court appointments was approximately 50% as opposed to the above 90% rate in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As parties <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> become more polarized, they have increasingly used tools to hinder the executive agenda and aggressively block nominees. Political scientist Sarah Binder (2000) argues, “senatorial intolerance for the opposing party’s nominees is itself a function of polarization.” By blocking judicial nominations, political polarization hinders the implementation of legitimate laws and impedes the confirmation of appellate judges, which results in higher vacancy rates, extended case-processing times and increased caseloads for judges.|$|E
