[...] Security and police personnel often carry Maglite flashlights as they can be employed as a defensive weapon, especially at night or in dark locations.

40|$|Abstract: The ICLIPS {{model is}} an {{integrated}} assessment model {{of climate change}} that links global climate change with regional impacts and mitigation efforts by integrating components from different disciplines and various spatial scales. Its reduced–form impact module consists of climate impact response functions (CIRFs) that depict the regional sensitivity of selected climate–sensitive impact sectors to changes in important climatic and atmospheric drivers. In addition to enabling the specification of maximum “tolerable ” impacts of climate change in a tolerable windows analysis with the ICLIPS model, the CIRFs are also a valuable information source in their own right. In this paper, I present the ICLIPS <b>Impacts</b> <b>Tool,</b> a software tool that provides convenient access to a large number (ca. 100, 000) of CIRF diagrams {{for a wide range}} of impact indicators, geographical regions, and climate projections. The choice of Java as programming language enables the ICLIPS <b>Impacts</b> <b>Tool</b> to run on most computer platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Linux, Solaris and AIX.

50|$|Sockets and {{extensions}} for impact wrenches {{are made}} of high tensile metal, as any spring effect will greatly reduce the torque available at the fastener. Even so, {{the use of multiple}} extensions, universal joints, and so forth will weaken the impacts, and the operator needs to minimize their use. Using non-impact sockets or accessories with an impact wrench will often result in bending, fracturing, or otherwise damaging the accessory, as most are not capable of withstanding the sudden high torque of an <b>impact</b> <b>tool,</b> and can result in stripping the head on the fastener. Non-impact sockets and accessories {{are made of}} a harder more brittle metal. Safety glasses should always be worn when working with impact tools, as the strong impacts can generate high-speed shrapnel if a socket, accessory, or fastener fails.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} power tool {{versions}} of [...] "air" [...] (pneumatic) ratchets which use compressed air power to drive air powered socket wrenches which tighten or loosen nuts or bolts. A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are impact wrenches {{which are used}} for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels. Electric powered impact wrenches for the same tasks are not uncommon. Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts. Hydraulic motor ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry. The sockets used for impact duty (called [...] "impact sockets") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness {{so as not to}} shatter under the impacts of the <b>impact</b> <b>tool.</b> They are typically finished in black oxide rather than the usual chrome plating of the hand-tool variety. Standard sockets (i.e. non-impact sockets) may shatter if used with impact wrenches, presenting a safety risk.|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{effect of}} <b>impact</b> <b>tool</b> {{geometry}} and soft material covering on bone fracture patterns {{plays a major}} role in fracture patterns. However, the literature is nearly void of such studies and only general correlations between the fracture pattern and the mechanism underlying the insult were reported. Purpose The aim of this study is to reveal the association between the geometry of the <b>impact</b> <b>tool</b> and the presence of soft material covering on bone fracture patterns. The Dynatup Model POE 2000 (Instron Co.) low energy pendulum impact machine was utilized to apply impact loading on fresh pig femoral bones (n = 50). The bone clamp shaft was adjusted to position the bone for three-point bending with additional bone compression simulating a situation occurring in pedestrian road traffic accidents. Five different tests using varying <b>impact</b> <b>tool</b> sizes with and without soft interface covering were carried out. Results A significant positive correlation was found between the fracture features and the impact tool’s geometry. Only bones that were damaged by a rounded impact body result in a “false” butterfly fragment; in all other cases where the impact body is flat and wide, double trapezoid fragments are observed in the area of impact. The impacted aspect is the most affected. All fracture line features were significantly greater in bones subjected to an impact by tools without soft covering. With an impact with soft covering, the impacted aspect exhibits numerous unique fracture lines and a fragmented pattern. Our study clearly shows that <b>impact</b> <b>tool</b> geometry and soft material covering markedly affect the fracture pattern...|$|E
