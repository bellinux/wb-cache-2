5|$|At dawn on {{the morning}} of 7 April, Pedro, his wife, and others, {{including}} his daughter MariaII and his sister Ana de Jesus, were taken on board the British warship HMS Warspite. The vessel remained at anchor off Rio de Janeiro, and, on 13 April, the former emperor transferred to and departed for Europe aboard HMS Volage. He arrived in Cherbourg-Octeville, France, on 10 June. During the next few months, he shuttled between France and Great Britain. He was warmly welcomed by, but received no actual support from, either government. Finding himself in an awkward situation because he held no official status in either the Brazilian Imperial House or in the Portuguese Royal House, Pedro assumed the title of Duke of Braganza on 15 June, a position that once had been his as heir to Portugal's crown. Although the title should have belonged to MariaII's heir, which <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not, his claim was met with general recognition. On 1 December, his only daughter by Amélie, Maria Amélia, was born in Paris.|$|E
2500|$|Gilbert was a {{skyscraper}} pioneer; when {{designing the}} Woolworth Building {{he moved into}} unproven ground [...] though <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> aware of the ground-breaking work done by Chicago architects on skyscrapers and once discussed merging firms with the legendary Daniel Burnham [...] and his technique of cladding a steel frame became the model for decades. Modernists embraced his work: John Marin painted it several times; even Frank Lloyd Wright praised {{the lines of the}} building, though he decried the ornamentation.|$|E
2500|$|Spofforth truly {{announced}} {{himself to}} the cricketing world on 27 May 1878, when the touring Australians met the MCC at Lord's. In this, the second match of the tour, the might of the MCC was dismissed twice in one day at the fortress of English cricket for paltry scores of just 33 and nineteen. The colonists won by nine wickets, with Spofforth picking up ten for twenty after first clean-bowling Grace for a duck. Tom [...] "Felix" [...] Horan records that, when he did so, [...] "he jumped about two feet in the air, and sang out: 'Bowled! Bowled! Bowled!' And at the finish in the dressing-room, he said: 'Ain't I a demon? Ain't I a demon?' gesticulating the while in his well-known demonaic style. Whether or not he christened himself the demon, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a demon bowler." [...] Spofforth confirms this: [...] "To myself, {{it will always be}} a noteworthy occasion, since it was then that I first earned my popular sobriquet – 'the Demon'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a good shot," [...] {{declared}} Fred. [...] "I saw him {{shooting at}} a target {{one day and}} <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> made some marvelous hits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did not see}} his face, Mademoiselle. They {{say that}} <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a good soldier, M. Charles, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> does not look like any one of our Vendean officers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a whopper! Oh, say, Allie, isn't he a beauty? I could hug--I--You bet I'm thankful. You <b>were</b> quick.... <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> slippery." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{becoming}} {{interested in the}} man. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> of a superior kind.|$|E
60|$|Then his Majesty lit a {{cigar and}} took up a volume; <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a sad bookworm.|$|E
60|$|He a traitor! Oh, {{far from}} it; <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> the last Frenchman that any Briton {{had a right}} to bring that charge against.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Charles tells me," [...] said Lady Deloraine, [...] "that Sir Thomas says so, and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} right; {{but it is}} not Charles' own opinion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gee, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a pill!" [...] was Dan Soppinger's comment. [...] "I think none of {{us would}} weep if Codfish left the school for good. How about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> {{great in}} that feature, one {{is obliged to}} admit it; but--now mind, I'm not really criticising--don't {{you think he is}} just a trifle overstrong in technique?" ...|$|R
60|$|Wally {{listened with}} {{flattering}} attention {{as she began}} the epic of Major Christopher Selby's doings in New York. Whatever his emotions, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not bored.|$|E
60|$|If a {{laughing}} eye with a lively light, {{and a face}} bright with beaming and healthy energy, could attest that he was better, better <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about him," [...] the woman was saying, [...] "but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> right last night about those two men who came ferreting in here--and last week too...." ...|$|E
60|$|Is {{it that he}} is {{a little}} {{restrained}} with me on his side? <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is!</b> I felt it the moment he came into the room--I have felt it ever since.|$|R
6000|$|... "He may be {{a banker}} now ... but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> no royalist--he {{is the son of}} a peasant who was {{unjustly}} put to death four years ago by the duc de Kernogan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is one thing--no one asks questions. His majesty {{thinks for}} his subjects, and as <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> the cleverest {{man in his}} dominions, {{everyone}} is well content {{that it should be}} so.|$|R
6000|$|Clearly he {{was unaware}} of my presence, and I stood waiting until his pen should come to a pause. Old as <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> he wrote with a steady hand. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... --But {{there are}} many eminent French critics, said the priest, who {{consider}} that even Victor Hugo, great as <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was,</b> had not so pure a French style as Louis Veuillot.|$|E
6000|$|The Merman sank--the Captain too Jumped overboard, {{and dropped}} from view Like stone from catapult; And {{when he reached}} the Merman's lair, <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> welcomed there, But, ah! with what result? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gosh, don't mention Duke!" [...] {{broke out}} Gif. [...] "I had all I {{could do to}} keep from getting into a row with him this morning. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a tart one at times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{remind me}} of the days,' said Mr Meagles, {{suddenly}} drooping--'but she's very fond of him, and hides his faults, and thinks that no one sees them--and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> well connected and of a very good family!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your parson {{may be a}} good man," [...] {{returned}} the beetle, with some indignation, [...] "but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not overwise. Nevertheless, if you do not want the gold I can take it from you as easily as I gave it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{some ways}} {{it is a good}} ambition," [...] Mrs. Halliday agreed, {{although}} she was puzzled, for she thought Bernard had an object he had not stated. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not vain.|$|E
60|$|Physically <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> ill; {{the mental}} strain caused by two great {{conflicting}} passions had attacked his bodily strength, and whilst his brain and heart fought their battles together, his aching limbs found no repose.|$|E
60|$|He {{might have}} been at bottom, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not at top, seeing that his coat was of the roughest and most ill-favoured kind. So, Nicholas merely {{observed}} that he shouldn't wonder if he was.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{understand}} this Charles Davis. He sat up calmly in his bunk, and calmly lighted his pipe ere he replied to Mr. Mellaire. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not insane. Yet deliberately, in cold blood, he has murdered a helpless man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he's {{not exactly}} young," [...] {{answered}} Mary, with a peculiar expression {{that made her}} questioner feel still more uncomfortable, [...] "yet he is scarcely middle-aged, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> the most splendid fellow on the frontier; and he saved my life once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{had a good}} breakfast this morning, and {{his full}} stomach has made him sleepy," [...] thought Jerry. [...] "But he's getting {{careless}} in his old age. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> getting careless. The idea of going to sleep right out in plain sight like that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather {{imagine he}} has left the country," [...] {{returned}} Roger. [...] "For if he was around at all, some of the school fellows would be sure to hear of him. Say, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a bad egg." ...|$|E
6000|$|Herman Mordaunt, at first, looked gravely at the speaker, but {{catching}} {{the expression of}} our eyes he answered with the tact of a perfectly well-bred man, as <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was,</b> on all occasions that put him to the proof-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Sam grew very {{red in the}} face, looked down, and twirled {{the button}} of his sleeve. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not a gracious boy, for all he said was in a gruff hoarse voice, without even thanks, [...] "Not if it is for this." ...|$|E
60|$|Frank {{said that}} <b>he</b> would <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> careful with the frying pan.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} just like him {{to go off and}} get full of liquor," [...] muttered the young man, with a scowl. [...] "I really ought to part company with him. But when he <b>is</b> {{perfectly}} sober <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a slick one," [...] he continued meditatively.|$|R
6000|$|... "Porton {{must have}} seen us when we {{came up to the}} rooms," [...] said Dave to his chums. [...] "He {{probably}} heard me speak about leaving my cap and overcoat downstairs, and he just took a fiendish delight in walking off with them and leaving his old duds behind. Oh, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a peach!" ...|$|R
