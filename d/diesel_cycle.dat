In contrast, {{by the end of}} production over 30,000 Pegasus engines had been built.

Several altitude and distance records were set by aircraft using the Pegasus.|$|E
25|$|The ideal Stirling {{cycle is}} {{unattainable}} {{in the real}} world (as with any heat engine); efficiencies of 50% have been reached, similar to the maximum figure for <b>Diesel</b> <b>cycle</b> engines. The efficiency of Stirling machines is also linked to the environmental temperature; higher efficiency is obtained when the weather is cooler, thus making this type of engine less interesting in places with warmer climates. As with other external combustion engines, Stirling engines can use heat sources other than from combustion of fuels.|$|E

40|$|An {{irreversible}} Dual {{heat engine}} model, which can include the Otto and <b>Diesel</b> <b>cycles,</b> is established {{and used to}} investigate {{the influence of the}} multi-irreversibilities mainly resulting from the adiabatic processes, finite time processes and heat leak loss through the cylinder wall on the performance of the cycle. The power output and efficiency of the cycle are derived and optimized with respect to the pressure ratio of the working substance. The maximum power output and efficiency are calculated. The influence of the various design parameters on the performance of the cycle is analyzed. The optimum criteria of some important parameters such as the power output, efficiency and pressure ratio are given. Several special interesting cases are discussed. The results obtained are general, so that the optimal performance of irreversible Otto and <b>Diesel</b> <b>cycles</b> are included in two special cases of the Dual cycle and may be directly derived from that of the Dual heat engine. Moreover, the performance characteristic curves of the three heat engines are presented by using numerical examples. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|Stirling engines {{have a high}} {{efficiency}} compared to steam engines, being able to reach 50% efficiency. They are also capable of quiet operation and can use almost any heat source. The heat energy source is generated external to the Stirling engine rather than by internal combustion as with the Otto cycle or <b>Diesel</b> <b>cycle</b> engines. Because the Stirling engine is compatible with alternative and renewable energy sources it could become increasingly significant {{as the price of}} conventional fuels rises, and also in light of concerns such as depletion of oil supplies and climate change. This type of engine is currently generating interest as the core component of micro combined heat and power (CHP) units, in which it is more efficient and safer than a comparable steam engine. However, it has a low power-to-weight ratio, rendering it more suitable for use in static installations where space and weight are not at a premium.|$|E
2500|$|The Carnot {{cycle and}} {{efficiency}} are useful because they define the upper bound {{of the possible}} work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system. [...] Other cycles, such as the Otto cycle, <b>Diesel</b> <b>cycle</b> and Brayton cycle, can be analyzed {{from the standpoint of}} the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells require an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|Fiat's {{interest}} in Diesel engines dated from 1907, initially focused on slow turning factory engines then moving to higher speed marine and railway motors. [...] The AN.1 {{was their first}} foray into Diesel aero-engines. To shorten its development time and {{to concentrate on the}} higher combustion chamber pressures, different burning temperatures and fuel supply systems of the <b>Diesel</b> <b>cycle,</b> they based its design on the Fiat A.12. [...] This was a petrol engine first run in 1916 and produced in large numbers during World War I, a water-cooled, upright, overhead camshaft straight six. The AN.1 kept the external dimensions and the lower section, crankshaft, crankcase, sump, plus the lubrication and water-cooling supplies of the older engine but required new cylinders, pistons, valve gear and fuel delivery systems to replace carburettors and magnetos. The cylinder barrels had to be stronger to withstand the greater combustion pressures (2-300 atmospheres) required by the compression ignition Diesel. The swept volume of the Diesel engine was reduced by 23.4% as the cylinders had a bore of 140mm (5.51in), compared with the A.12's 160mm (6.30in). Two camshafts were fitted to operate the four valves per cylinder, though they were driven via the same tall vertical rod used for the single camshaft of the A.12, at its top, and the water pump of both models at its bottom.|$|E
25|$|The ideal Otto and <b>Diesel</b> <b>cycles</b> are {{not totally}} {{reversible}} because they involve heat transfer through a finite temperature difference during the irreversible isothermal heat-addition and heat-rejection processes. The irreversibility renders the thermal efficiency of these cycles {{less than that}} of a Carnot engine operating within the same limits of temperature. Another cycle that features isothermal heat-addition and heat-rejection processes is the Stirling cycle, which is an altered version of the Carnot cycle in which the two isentropic processes featured in the Carnot cycle are replaced by two constant-volume regeneration processes.|$|R

40|$|Based on quantum {{thermodynamic}} processes, {{we make a}} quantum-mechanical (QM) {{extension of}} the typical heat engine cycles, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto, and <b>Diesel</b> <b>cycles,</b> etc. The temperature {{is not included in}} these QM engine cycles, as {{lies in the fact that}} the concept of energy is well-defined in quantum mechanics, temperature a priori is not. These QM engine cycles are implemented by an ideal or interacting system with an arbitrary number of particles confined in an arbitrary power-law trap. As a result, a relation between the quantum adiabatic exponent and trap exponent is found. The efficiency of a given QM engine cycle is similar to that of its classical counterpart, thereby identifying the universality of the efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the effects of friction and heat transfer with considerations of variable specific heats of working fluid on the performance of a Miller <b>cycle</b> <b>Diesel</b> engine. The variations in power output and thermal efficiency with compression ratio, and the relations between the power output and the thermal efficiency of the Miller <b>cycle</b> <b>Diesel</b> engine are presented. The results show that the power output as well as the efficiency where maximum power output occurs will decrease with the increase of heat loss. The temperature-dependent specific heats of working fluid have a significant influence on the performance. The power output and the working range of the Miller <b>cycle</b> <b>Diesel</b> engine increase with the increase of specific heats of working fluid, while, the efficiency decreases with the increase of specific heats of working fluid. The influence of the parameter b related to the friction loss has a negative effect on the performance. Therefore, the power output and efficiency of the cycle decrease with increasing b. Note that the effects of heat transfer with considerations of variable specific heats of working fluid and friction loss on the performance are significant and should be considered in practice cycle analysis...|$|R
