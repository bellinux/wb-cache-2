5|$|Keith's {{slow and}} <b>erratic</b> <b>movement</b> {{caused it to}} produce strong winds and heavy {{rainfall}} in Central America.

Several other countries reported significant but less severe flooding, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Overall, Keith was responsible for 40 deaths, as well as approximately $319 million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Upon developing, the {{depression}} {{was located in}} an area of weak steering currents, resulting in an <b>erratic</b> <b>movement</b> generally to the south. In its formative stages, {{the depression}} executed a small loop. As it did so, it moved into an area of very warm waters and decreasing wind shear. The depression's convection gradually organized, although the winds were slower to increase. An anticyclone became established over the system, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lorenzo at around 1200UTC on September27. At the time, it was located about 150mi (240km) east of Tuxpan, Veracruz, moving steadily westward under the influence of a building ridge to its east. As it approached the coast, Lorenzo rapidly intensified unexpectedly, and within 12hours of attaining tropical storm status it strengthened into a hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In mid- to late-April, a {{pulse in}} the Madden–Julian oscillation, {{coupled with a}} Kelvin wave, (which later contributed to the {{formation}} of Typhoon Chanchu in the western Pacific) enhanced convective activity over the Bay of Bengal. By April22, a trough developed along an axis from the southern Bay of Bengal eastward to the Andaman Sea. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the system for potential tropical cyclogenesis the following day. By 0600UTC on April24, an area of low pressure formed southeast of the Andaman Islands and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) began monitoring the disturbance. Quickly organizing, the low developed into a tropical depression later on April24 and the JTWC began writing full advisories on the cyclone without issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Organization slowed thereafter due to moderate wind shear, but continued at a near-climatological rate as upper-level outflow allowed for continued convective development. Early on April25, the JTWC estimated the system to have attained gale-force winds. The IMD followed suit later that day and subsequently assigned it the name Mala. Weak steering currents prompted slow and <b>erratic</b> <b>movement</b> with an overall northward trajectory.|$|E

500|$|As the {{hurricane}} stalled {{to the southwest}} of Hawaii on September3, tropical storm watches were issued for Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau. High surf advisories were raised for all islands as well. Following Uleki's turn to the west on September5, the tropical storm watches were discontinued. The storm's <b>erratic</b> <b>movement</b> proved to be troublesome for forecasters and they continuously warned residents to be cautious and alert should the storm double-back to the state.

500|$|The tornado {{killed four}} storm chasers, {{the first known}} deaths {{in the history of}} storm chasing. Although the tornado {{remained}} over mostly open terrain, dozens of storm chasers unaware of its immense size and <b>erratic</b> <b>movement</b> were caught off-guard. Near Highway 81, TWISTEX scientist and engineer Tim Samaras, along with his son Paul and research partner Carl Young died in the tornado. Paul and Young were ejected from their Chevrolet Cobalt by the storm's sub-vortex, while Tim was still buckled in the passenger's seat. Local resident Richard Henderson, who decided to follow the storm, lost his life in that same area. He snapped a picture of the tornado from his cellular phone before it struck him. Other chasers, including Mike Bettes of The Weather Channel and Reed Timmer, were either injured or had their vehicles damaged. A Doppler on Wheels-based analysis of how the tornado impacted these teams revealed that they were hit by an intense internal sub-vortex. Overall, the tornado was responsible for eight fatalities and 151 injuries. The National Weather Service referred to the tornado as [...] "the most dangerous tornado in storm observing history." ...|$|E

Owing to the localised nature of the disease, it was suspected to be contagious and as a precaution patients were isolated and their homes disinfected. Although contagion was later disproved, this initial response contributed to the stigmatisation and discrimination experienced by Minamata victims from the local community. During its investigations, the committee uncovered surprising anecdotal evidence of the strange behaviour of cats and other wildlife in the areas surrounding patients' homes. From around 1950 onward, cats had been seen to have convulsions, go mad, and die. Locals called it the , owing to their <b>erratic</b> <b>movement.</b> Crows had fallen from the sky, seaweed no longer grew on the sea bed, and fish floated dead {{on the surface of the}} sea. As the extent of the outbreak was understood, the committee invited researchers from Kumamoto University to help in the research effort.|$|E

50|$|The knuckleball is also {{employed}} by the Indian cricket fast bowler Zaheer Khan as his slower delivery. The physics of the operation are largely the same. However, the seam on a cricket ball is equatorial, and thus the extent of <b>erratic</b> <b>movement</b> is reduced due to the symmetry (at least in the conventional release position where the planes of the ball's trajectory and the seam are nearly co-planar). In addition, the lack of backspin does shorten {{the length of the}} delivery, and also tends to make the ball skid off the pitch—faster than it would come off a normal delivery.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates a general-equilibrium asset {{pricing model}} of the term {{structure}} of nominal interest rates. In a pure exchange economy with incomplete information, investors are unable to observe the expected growth rates of both exogenous real output and money supply and, therefore, engage in dynamic Bayesian inference. The dependence of term premia on beliefs allows the model to introduce a GARCH property, which interacts with the volatility of the macro variables. In particular, the volatility of excess returns is inversely related to noise in the macro variables, implying that their <b>erratic</b> <b>movements</b> may reduce uctuations in interest rates...|$|R
