25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap,</b> their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E

She wears a sheer apron or overskirt, a falling ruff, and an <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap</b> with lace trim. The jacket itself is in the longer fashion of the previous decade.|$|E
50|$|Men also wear {{colourful}} <b>embroidered</b> <b>caps</b> {{known as}} hula. Depending on their location and occupation, they may wear a Tuareg-style turban around this to veil the face (known as Alasho or Tagelmust). The {{women can be}} identified by wrappers called zani, made with colourful cloth atampa, accompanied by a matching blouse, head tie and shawl.|$|R

5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white <b>embroidered</b> <b>caps</b> and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|R
2500|$|Moskvin {{lived in}} Nizhny Novgorod, the fifth {{largest city in}} Russia. Moskvin said he began {{wandering}} through cemeteries with friends when still a schoolboy. In particular, they visited the Krasnaya Etna Cemetery located in the Leninsky district of Nizhny Novgorod. In an article written shortly before his arrest, Moskvin explained {{his interest in the}} dead, attributing it to a childhood incident during which he witnessed a funeral procession for an eleven-year-old girl. Moskvin alleged that the participants forced him to kiss the dead girl's face, writing that [...] "an adult pushed my face down to the waxy forehead of the girl in an <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap,</b> and there was nothing I could do but kiss her as ordered." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Vincy {{went home}} from {{the reading of the}} will with his point of view {{considerably}} changed in relation to many subjects. He was an open-minded man, but given to indirect modes of expressing himself: when he was disappointed in a market for his silk braids, he swore at the groom; when his brother-in-law Bulstrode had vexed him, he made cutting remarks on Methodism; and it was now apparent that he regarded Fred's idleness with a sudden increase of severity, by his throwing an <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap</b> out of the smoking-room on to the hall-floor.|$|E
6000|$|EARLY on {{the morning}} after my arrival, I arose, and {{consulted}} my new acquaintances about the means of recovering the missing property. They unanimously advised a visit to the governor, whom, however, they described to be a [...] "Kalb ibn kalb," [...] (dog, son of a dog,) who never returned Moslems' salutations, and who thought all men dirt to be trodden under foot by the Turks. The boy Mohammed showed his savoir faire by extracting from his huge Sahara-box a fine <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap,</b> and a grand peach-coloured coat, with which I was instantly invested; he dressed himself with similar magnificence, and we then set out to the [...] "palace." ...|$|E

5000|$|All {{members in}} the Ground Self-Defense Force are {{authorized}} to wear wool rifle green berets - {{referred to as the}} [...] "ベレー帽" [...] (ベレーボウ　or bereebou) - as an optional head covering for dress, working and camouflage uniforms since 1992. However, it is normally considered a special dress item, worn for public relations events or parades. An <b>embroidered</b> goldwork <b>cap</b> badge representing the JGSDF logo identical to the one used on the service dress peaked cap is required by regulation to be affixed to the beret.|$|R
60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} lived in France a man whose name was Jalm Riou. You might have walked a whole day without meeting anyone happier or more contented, for he had a large farm, plenty of money, and above all, a {{daughter}} called Barbaik, the most graceful dancer and the best-dressed girl {{in the whole country}} side. When she appeared on holidays in her <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap,</b> five petticoats, each one a little shorter than the other, and shoes with silver buckles, the women were all filled with envy, but little cared Barbaik what they might whisper behind her back as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else's and that she had more partners than any other girl.|$|E
6000|$|... § XI. But this {{superimposition}} of lightness {{on weight}} {{is still more}} distinctly the system of many buildings of the kind which I have above called Architecture of Position, that is to say, architecture of which the greater part is intended merely to keep something in a peculiar position; as in light-houses, and many towers and belfries. The subject of spire and tower architecture, however, is so interesting and extensive, that I have thoughts of writing a detached essay upon it, and, at all events, cannot enter upon it here: but this much is enough for the reader to note for our present purpose, that, although many towers do in reality stand on piers or shafts, as the central towers of cathedrals, yet the expression of all of them, and the real structure {{of the best and}} strongest, are the elevation of gradually diminishing weight on massy or even solid foundation. Nevertheless, since the tower is in its origin a building for strength of defence, and faithfulness of watch, rather than splendor of aspect, its true expression is of just so much diminution of weight upwards as may be necessary to its fully balanced strength, not a jot more. There must be no light-headedness in your noble tower: impregnable foundation, wrathful crest, with the vizor down, and the dark vigilance seen through the clefts of it; not the filigree crown or <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap.</b> No towers are so grand as the square-browed ones, with massy cornices and rent battlements: next to these come the fantastic towers, with their various forms of steep roof; the best, not the cone, but the plain gable thrown very high; last of all in my mind (of good towers), those with spires or crowns, though these, of course, are fittest for ecclesiastical purposes, and capable of the richest ornament. The paltry four or eight pinnacled things we call towers in England (as in York Minster), are mere confectioner's Gothic, and not worth classing.|$|E
50|$|Personnel {{within the}} Swedish Special Operations Forces, SOG and its support units also wear an olive green beret with a black, <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap</b> badge, the only {{non-metal}} cap badge within the Swedish Armed Forces.|$|E
60|$|So, {{though she}} lay in bed till ten, and came down to a {{separate}} breakfast at eleven, she kindly consented to dine as early as five, when a hot joint was prepared, which coldly furnished forth the children's table the next day; she considerately prevented Milly from devoting herself too closely to the children, by insisting on reading, talking, and walking with her; and she even began to <b>embroider</b> a <b>cap</b> for the next baby, which must certainly be a girl, and be named Caroline.|$|R
60|$|It only {{remains to}} say, that the Marquis's valet was in attendance, {{displaying}} his master's brocaded nightgown, and richly <b>embroidered</b> velvet <b>cap,</b> lined and faced with Brussels lace, upon a huge leathern easy-chair, wheeled round {{so as to}} have the {{full advantage of the}} comfortable fire which we have already mentioned. We therefore commit that eminent person to his night's repose, trusting he profited by the ample preparations made for his accommodation--preparations which we have mentioned in detail, as illustrative of ancient Scottish manners.|$|R

6000|$|I {{could talk}} to you for a year of all the pretty kindnesses that she would do for me; how, when she found me of early mornings among my books, her {{presence}} [...] "would cast a light upon the day;" [...] how she used to smooth and fold my little surplice, and <b>embroider</b> me <b>caps</b> and gowns for high feast-days; how she used to bring flowers for the altar, and who could deck it so well as she? But sentiment does not come glibly from under a grizzled moustache, so I will drop it, if you please.|$|R
6000|$|... "Venerable mother!" [...] he began, [...] "the blessed Jesus {{commands}} {{you to give}} up the Anathema {{which you}} carry upon you. That <b>cap</b> <b>embroidered</b> with pearls, those jewels that fasten up your false hair--let them be given up and sold for the poor; and cast the hair itself away from you, as a lie that is only fit for burning. Doubtless, too, you have other jewels under your silk mantle." ...|$|R

50|$|Lady Russell {{wears the}} nebule head-dress, {{consisting}} of a caul of netting arranged in 3 rows {{on top of her}} head. Under the caul is a close-fitting <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap,</b> keeping the hair off the forehead. The head-dress conceals the ears and falls in a wavy line upon the shoulders, where the netting appears again. She is clothed in a mantle fastened by a cord. Above the hands are shown 5 buttons of the gown, cut higher than that of Lady Berkeley at Wotton. At her feet lies a little lap-dog with a collar of bells.|$|E

5000|$|In 1964, the RLAF {{adopted a}} new blue-grey service peaked cap with crown of [...] "Germanic" [...] shape - {{very similar to}} that worn by Khmer Air Force (KAF) or South Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) {{officers}} -, with gold embroidered flame decoration on the black cap band for general officers. It was initially worn with the standard gilt metal FAR wreathed trident cap device set on a black background, replaced after 1967 by a distinctive RLAF silver cap badge. A blue-grey overseas flight cap (with silver cord piping in the flap for officers), styled after the French M1957 sidecap, was also adopted. Besides regulation headgear, unofficial Olive Green and camouflage cloth berets, baseball caps and US [...] "Boonie hats" [...] found their way into the RLAF from the United States, Thailand and South Vietnam, to which were soon added Laotian-made copies; a red <b>embroidered</b> baseball <b>cap</b> was given to graduate pilots of the T-28 fighter-bomber course held at the RLAF Flying School in Seno Airbase, near Savannakhet.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the eve of}} the King's {{execution}} in 1649, Charles sent Salesbury an <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap</b> of crimson silk as a token of his respect. For the duration of The Protectorate, William was heavily fined for his commitment and loyalty to the Royalist cause. Upon the restoration of Charles II, in 1660, Salesbury was nominated for the order of Knight of the Royal Oak, having an estate of £800 a year. He was known affectionately as Hen Hosanau Gleision (" [...] old blue stockings") and was described as [...] "an upright honourable man".|$|E
50|$|In Tanzania, the kanzu was {{introduced}} by Arab traders and missionaries from Oman who were conducting dawah. The Tanzanian kanzu {{is identical to the}} Arabic thobe. Originally, the kanzu was made from silk. Today, due to Islamic restrictions on silk garments, it is made from polyester or other synthetic fabrics made to resemble silk. The distinctive feature of the Tanzanian kanzu is the tassel that hangs from the collar. In some families, the tassel is perfumed with African oils or Arabic attar (oils) before wedding ceremonies. The kanzu is always worn with a kofia, a small <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ruswa's {{dress was}} as {{eccentric}} as {{his way of}} living. When he had the money, he stepped out like a Lucknow dilettante, wearing a thin muslin kurta, finely creased pyjamas, an <b>embroidered</b> <b>cap</b> on his head, and velvet slippers on his feet. But {{most of his time}} he spent in his ganji and lungi. In these sparse garments, he wrote or dictated, sitting cross-legged on a mat with his books littered about him on the floor. Ruswa was a tall and powerfully built man of light-brown complexion with a bushy moustache and a neatly trimmed beard. He had a broad forehead but narrow eyes. He had a high-pitched, wheezy voice.|$|E

Xunzi cites [...] "songs and laughter, weeping and lamentation...rice and millet, fish and meat...the wearing of ceremonial <b>caps,</b> <b>embroidered</b> robes, and patterned silks, or of fasting clothes and mourning clothes...unspacious rooms and very nonsecluded halls, hard mats, seats and flooring" [...] as vital {{parts of the}} fabric of li.|$|R

60|$|At {{the time}} when Mr. Vincy uttered that presentiment about Rosamond, she herself had never {{had the idea that}} she should be driven to make the sort of appeal which he foresaw. She had not yet had any anxiety about ways and means, {{although}} her domestic life had been expensive as well as eventful. Her baby had been born prematurely, and all the <b>embroidered</b> robes and <b>caps</b> had to be laid by in darkness. This misfortune was attributed entirely to her having persisted in going out on horseback one day when her husband had desired her not to do so; but it must not be supposed that she had shown temper on the occasion, or rudely told him that she would do as she liked.|$|R
