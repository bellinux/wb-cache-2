30|$|The {{development}} of new methods for the <b>endometrial</b> <b>investigation</b> has allowed discovering the endometrial cancer in early stages, even in asymptomatic women. Among the methods used in endometrial disorder screening, diagnostic hysteroscopy is a simple procedure that can provide a good visualization of the whole uterine cavity without cervical dilation and usually without anesthesia. However, one important limitation about the office hysteroscopy usage {{is the lack of}} studies correlating the visual aspects of the endometrial lesion and the histology, as the subjective hysteroscopic appearance, based on surgeon experience, does not allow distinguishing all cases of endometrial carcinoma from benign endometrial disease [1, 2]. Several investigators, who suggest the use of hysteroscopy for diagnosis of endometrial cancer, admit that a carcinoma with polypoid appearance can be confused with a benign endometrial polyp [3, 4]. According to other authors [5] differential diagnosis among hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma using the subjective hysteroscopic view could be made in only 60.9 % of the cases.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study how}} {{gynaecologist}} manage postmenopausal bleeding in women not using HRT. The {{impact on the}} physicians' attitude of risk factors for endometrial cancer and of the endometrial thickness was essentially accounted for. Methods: Two different case-types were defined by modifying the risk level of developing endometrial cancer. Also the level of endometrial thickness, assessed by ultrasound, was made to vary. In total four case-types were constructed. One case-type was sent at random to each Belgian gynaecologist (n = 970). Results: Response rate: 55 %. The proportion of physicians who would not investigate the patients' endometrium varied between 2 % (high-risk patient with abnormal ultrasound) and 34 % (low risk patient, normal ultrasound). Significant differences were observed {{in relation to the}} level of risk factors for endometrial cancer and in relation to endometrial thickness. No significant relationship was found between the choice of the method of <b>endometrial</b> <b>investigation</b> and the risk situation or the ultrasound result. Conclusions: The attitude of Belgian gynaecologists towards postmenopausal bleeding is modified by the presence of risk factors and by the level of endometrium thickness. About one third of physicians would not further investigate the endometrium of a patient with a low risk profile and a normal endometrium as assessed by ultrasound. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Summary. A {{method for}} the {{creation}} of an abdominal utero-cutaneous fistula in the monkey is described. This surgical technique provides a means for serial endometrical biospy and observation of histological response. Serial evaluation of the human endometrium by transcervical suction biopsy has recently found widespread use. Biopsy by this technique permits accurate evaluation of the effects of sex steroids, determination of pathological endo-metria and timing of ovulation. In the rhesus monkey, however, the tortuous endocervical canal resulting from a prominent cervical colliculus (Wislocki, 1933) prevents successful <b>endometrial</b> biopsy. Previous <b>investigations</b> have, for the most part, relied on hysterectomy in order to obtain endometrial samples for study. Recently both Martin & Eckstein (1966) and Mastroianni & Rosseau (1965) have published studies demonstrating techniques of trans-cervical cannulation of the monkey uterus, but neither method lends itself to dependable biopsy. Van Wagenen & Morse (1940) first described a techniqu...|$|R
30|$|In {{another recent}} study [19], hysteroscopic view was {{validated}} with histology {{in cases of}} endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding. Among 4, 054 examinations, hysteroscopic views were compatible with cancer or hyperplasia (80.0 % and 16.2 %, respectively) in the histologic cases of endometrial cancer (101 cases, 96.2 %). In endometrial hyperplasia, sensitivity of the hysteroscopic view was 56.3 % (95 % CI 52.2 – 60.2 %), specificity was 89.1 % (95 % CI 88.0 – 90.1 %), PPV was 48.0 % (95 % CI 44.3 – 51.7 %), NPV was 92.0 % (95 % CI 90.1 – 92.9 %), and accuracy was 72.7 % (95 % CI 70.7 – 74.7 %); and in endometrial cancer, {{the sensitivity of the}} hysteroscopic view was 80.0 % (95 % CI 71.1 – 87.2 %), specificity was 99.5 % (95 % CI 99.2 – 99.7 %), PPV was 81.5 % (95 % CI 72.7 – 88.5 %), NPV was 99.5 % (95 % CI 99.2 – 99.7 %), and accuracy was 89.8 % (95 % CI, 85.9 – 93.6 %). In the histologic cases of endometrial cancer, 101 (96.2 %) hysteroscopic views were compatible with cancer or hyperplasia (80.0 % and 16.2 %, respectively) and 97 out of 103 (94.2 %) hysteroscopic views with cancer findings had histologic diagnosis of cancer or hyperplasia (81.5 % and 12.6 %, respectively).These data declare that hysteroscopy is an accurate method for <b>endometrial</b> pathology <b>investigation</b> with good sensitivity.|$|R
40|$|The 'unopposed {{oestrogen}} hypothesis' for {{endometrial cancer}} maintains that risk is increased {{by exposure to}} endogenous or exogenous oestrogen that is not opposed simultaneously by a progestagen, and that this increased risk {{is due to the}} induced mitotic activity of the <b>endometrial</b> cells. <b>Investigation</b> of the mitotic rate during the menstrual cycle shows that increases in plasma oestrogen concentration above the relatively low levels of the early follicular phase do not produce any further increase in the mitotic rate of endometrial cells. A modification of the unopposed oestrogen hypothesis which includes this upper limit in the response of endometrial cells to oestrogen is consistent with the known dose-effect relationships between endometrial cancer risk and both oestrogen replacement therapy and postmenopausal obesity; it also suggests that the mechanism by which obesity increases risk in premenopausal women involves progesterone deficiency rather than oestrogen excess, and that the protective effect of cigarette smoking may be greater in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women. Detailed analysis of the age-incidence curve for endometrial cancer in the light of this hypothesis suggests that there will be lifelong effects of even short duration use of exogenous hormones. In particular, 5 years of combination-type oral contraceptive use is likely to reduce a woman's lifetime risk of endometrial cancer by some 60 %; whereas 5 years of unopposed oestrogen replacement therapy is likely to increase her subsequent lifetime risk by at least 90 %; and even 5 years of 'adequately' opposed therapy is likely to increase subsequent lifetime risk by at least 50 %...|$|R
40|$|Objective:To {{determine}} the role, timing and indications for <b>endometrial</b> hysteroscopic <b>investigation</b> {{in relation to}} the clinical, ultrasound and histological features of the endometrium during tamoxifen use. Methods:We performed an observational longitudinal cohort study (years 2007 - 2012) that investigated the endometria of 151 tamoxifen users with hysteroscopy and histology. For all patients, gynaecological history, years of adjuvant treatment, ultrasound endometrial thickness measurement and indications for hysteroscopy were recorded. Results:Hysteroscopic findings showed that 100 % of patients referred for simple follow-up had no evidence of endometrial disease. We found a strong correlation between previous history of abnormal uterine bleeding (with or without endometrial thickening) and hysteroscopic suspicion of endometrial atypia that was confirmed by histology. Hysteroscopy had 83. 3 %-sensitivity, 99 %-specificity, 83. 3 %-PPV and 99 %-NPV in detecting endometrial atypia. No significant correlation was found between endometrial thickening to > 5 mm without bleeding and histological atypia. Similarly, the duration of treatment was not related to endometrial thickening and histological atypia. Endometrial stromal hyperplasia was detected by histology in 70. 5 % of patients with endometrial thickness measurements ranging from 5 - 10 mm. In contrast, no atypia was detected when endometrial thickness was < 5 mm. Ultrasound performed using a 5 -mm cut-off threshold for endometrial thickness resulted in 100 %-sensitivity, 15 %-specificity, 4 %-PPV and 100 %-NPV in detecting endometrial atypia, while a 10 -mm cut-off threshold resulted in 84 %-sensitivity, 69 %-specificity, 10 %-PPV and 99 %-NPV. Conclusion:Low-risk tamoxifen users do not require different endometrial surveillance than the general population. Hysteroscopy could play a fundamental role in determining the endometrial status of patients before the initiation of tamoxifen treatment and in assessing the endometrial status of patients when bleeding occurs...|$|R
40|$|Eighty-eight endometrial {{specimens}} from 36 postmenopausal {{breast cancer}} patients treated with tamoxifen were investigated cytogenetically and molecularly using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} with appropriate probes for the HMGIC and HMGIY genes. Twenty control specimens, 10 endometrial polyps, and 10 endometrial biopsy specimens were investigated in the same way. Of the 88 specimens, 44 were from endometrial polyps; 3 were from endocervical polyps; 7 were from cystic endometrium; 30 were from normal or atrophic endometrium, normal endocervix, or myometrium; and 4 were from <b>endometrial</b> carcinomas. Chromosome <b>investigation</b> of the <b>endometrial</b> polyps showed the nature of the chromosome changes in tamoxifen-induced polyps to be the same as that in the controls and in sporadic endometrial polyps described in the literature. HMGIC and HMGIY gene rearrangements in both groups were identical as shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization, which also allowed for the detection of seven hidden paracentric inversions involving 12 q 15, one of which occurred in a cystic endometrium. The carcinomas did not exhibit any of these changes. Because abnormal expression of HMGIC or HMGIY as a consequence of structural chromosome changes in 12 q 15 or 6 p 21, respectively, is invariably associated with benign neoplasia, tamoxifen-associated endometrial polyps are unlikely to undergo further malignant transformation, and a mode of action of tamoxifen as an external carcinogen is unlikely. status: publishe...|$|R

Background: A thickened endometrium in the post-menopausal patient is a common reason for referral to gynaecology rapid access clinics under the cancer targets wait. This can often be an incidental finding in the asymptomatic patient. Investigation {{of this can be}} invasive, uncomfortable and carries significant sur-gical risk. Aims: This paper aims to summarise all the recent literature {{to see if there is}} any clear consensus on who should be further investigated in this select group of patients. Methods: Systematic literature re-view. Results: The studies varied greatly on the need for further investigation in asymptomatic women with endometrial thickness greater than 11 mm, with some deciding on careful case selection for further investigation, and others investigating every patient. The treatment of asymptomatic patients with endo-metrium classified as thickened, yet under 11 mm and no symptoms again varied in case selection and fur-ther <b>investigation.</b> <b>Endometrial</b> polyps were men-tioned in 1 paper, suggesting that asymptomatic pol-yps need not be removed, which is contrary to cur-rent clinical practice. Conclusion: There is no overall opinion as to the exact treatment of women with thic-kened endometrium. Women should be carefully tri-aged and all other factors taken into account before further investigation are instigated...|$|R
40|$|Hormonal {{therapy and}} {{chemotherapy}} {{play a major}} role in the management of advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Progesterone therapy obtains overall response rates ranging from 11 % to 25 % in patients with endometrioid-type tumours, and oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 200 mg daily appears to be a reasonable therapeutic option for those lesions that are well differentiated and/or have a high progesterone receptor (PgR) content. However, the activity of progestins is often compromised by the down-regulation of PgR within the target tissues, and therefore therapeutic strategies designed to enhance PgR expression are warranted. Little data are currently available about the new aromatase inhibitors and selective estrogen receptor modulators. As for chemotherapy, the combination of doxorubicin [DOX]+cisplatin [CDDP] achieves overall response rates ranging from 34 % to 60 %, and the addition of paclitaxel (TAX) seems to improve response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival, but to worsen toxicity profile. A phase III study is currently comparing TAX+DOX+CDDP versus the less toxic combination of TAX+carboplatin. Chemotherapy is active against both endometrioid-type carcinoma and uterine serous papillary carcinoma. However, this latter endometrial malignancy is less chemosensitive than the histologically similar high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Interesting fields of research are represented by investigational agents directed against specific intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in the proliferation, invasiveness and metastatic spread of endometrial cancer. Mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, the monoclonal antibody cetuximab), imatinib, the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, and the Clostridium perfrigens enterotoxin are currently under evaluation as molecularly targeted therapies for <b>endometrial</b> cancer. Further <b>investigations</b> addressed to better understand the signal transduction pathways that are disregulated in endometrial carcinogenesis could identify novel biological targets suitable for tailored therapies...|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 126 - 147). Lynch Syndrome, {{also known}} as Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) (OMIM # 120435), is a familial disorder resulting from mutations within DNA MMR genes. Effective surveillance, {{diagnosis and treatment of}} the disorder is complicated due to the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lynch syndrome, which exhibits an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Determine the molecular pathology of extracolonic cancers in Lynch syndrome and to elucidate whether or not the occurrence of these extracolonic cancers are {{a direct result of the}} mismatch repair deficiency. First, a modifier study was performed assessing the effect of a variant within the DNA MMR gene hMLH 1 in a cohort of individuals predisposed to Lynch syndrome in order to examine a potential epistatic effect in the gene. In order to obtain a genetic signature of Lynch associated tumours, germline DNA and corresponding tumour DNA was isolated from Lynch syndrome patients. The genetic material was assessed via a panel of microsatellite rich genes and MS-MLPA. Finally, in silico analyses were undertaken assessing microarray data from microsatellite unstable colorectal and endometrial cancers to characterise novel candidate genes. The modifier study did not prove fruitful as no association was found between the hMLH 1 promoter variant and site of cancer in individuals predisposed to Lynch syndrome. An association was observed heterozygous and homozygous variant genotypes and an increased risk of colorectal cancer, regardless of predisposing mutation (p = 0. 000181). Two tumour suppressor genes; HIC 1 and TIMP 3, were found to be methylated in the tumour samples in the germline/tumour tissue study. This study also showed instability of the Erβ gene in the majority of tumour samples. Bioinformatic analysis utilising existing microarray data resulted in common under-expression of four genes and common overexpression in three genes in microsatellite unstable colorectal and <b>endometrial</b> cancers. Further <b>investigation</b> into the modifier study and elucidation of a genetic signature in MMR deficient, MSI cancers. The results obtained in this study contribute to the increasing body of knowledge in the field and the various stages of malignancies should be assessed for a more informative result. Genetic and functional studies should be performed on the information garnered from the bioinformatics analysis. Overall evaluation and molecular classification of Lynch syndrome tumours may guide better diagnosis, surveillance and treatment of those at risk...|$|R
