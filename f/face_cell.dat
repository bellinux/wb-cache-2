50|$|Further {{evidence}} for the theory that a small neural network provides facial recognition was found from analysis of cell recording studies of macaque monkeys. By formatting faces as points in a high-dimensional linear space, the scientists discovered that each face cell’s firing rate {{is proportional to the}} projection of an incoming face stimulus onto a single axis in this space, allowing a <b>face</b> <b>cell</b> ensemble of about 200 cells to encode the location of any face in the space.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} study the failure {{patterns}} and strength of 3 D braided composites from the microscopic view, the damage propagation under tensile loading steps in three kinds of unit cells is simulated. The homogenization formula of micro-stress and the solving approach of finite element method are given firstly. A criterion is presented to determine the damage and its pattern of each element, and then the stiffness degradation method based on Murakami's geometric damage theory is used to simulate the status of damage under tensile loading steps for three kinds of unit cells. It {{can be seen that}} the damage percentage and damage pattern of damaged unit cell are totally different for different kind of unit cells. More damaged elements are observed for <b>face</b> <b>cell</b> and corner cell than that for body cell. It is also observed that the damage firstly occurs at the area of <b>face</b> <b>cell,</b> which agrees well with experimental results. It is verified that considering the effects of face and corner cells are important for the damage and strength analysis of 3 D braided composites...|$|E
40|$|Primates {{recognize}} complex {{objects such}} as faces with remarkable speed and reliability. Here, we reveal the brain’s code for facial identity. Experiments in macaques demonstrate an extraordinarily simple transformation between faces and responses of cells in face patches. By formatting faces as points in a high-dimensional linear space, we discovered that each face cell’s firing rate {{is proportional to the}} projection of an incoming face stimulus onto a single axis in this space, allowing a <b>face</b> <b>cell</b> ensemble to encode the location of any face in the space. Using this code, we could precisely decode faces from neural population responses and predict neural firing rates to faces. Furthermore, this code disavows the long-standing assumption that face cells encode specific facial identities, confirmed by engineering faces with drastically different appearance that elicited identical responses in single face cells. Our work suggests that other objects could be encoded by analogous metric coordinate systems...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known since the 1970 s that there are neurons in the monkey visual system that are {{sensitive}} to <b>faces.</b> These <b>face</b> <b>cells</b> have been studied in most detail in the anterior inferior temporal (IT) cortex and the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS), but they also occur in other {{areas such as the}} amygdala and the inferior convexity of the prefrontal cortex (Figure 1). Characteristically, the optimal stimuli of <b>face</b> <b>cells</b> cannot be deconstructed into simpler component shapes (Wang et al., 1996). In general, these cells show virtually no response to any other stimulus tested (such as textures, gratings, bars, and the edges of various colors), but respond strongly to a variety of faces, including real ones, plastic models, and video display unit images of human and monkey faces. The responses of many <b>face</b> <b>cells</b> are invariant to size and position; the cell’s response is maintained when there is a change {{in the size of the}} face, or if the position of the <b>face</b> within the <b>cell’s</b> receptive field is altered. <b>Face</b> <b>cells</b> do not respond well to images of faces that have had the components rearranged, even though all the components are still present and the outline is unchanged (e. g., Perrett et al., 1992). <b>Face</b> <b>cells</b> are even sensitive to the relative position of features within the face; particularly important is inter-eye distance, distance from eyes to mouth, and the amount and style of hair on the forehead (e. g., Young and Yamane, 1992...|$|R

40|$|Binomial’ cell {{proliferation}} and cell death {{have been studied}} {{in only a few}} non-mammalian vertebrates, such as fish. We thought it of interest to map {{cell proliferation}}/apoptosis in the brain of the frog (Rana esculenta L.) as this animal species undergoes, during the annual cycle, physiological events that could be associated with central nervous system damage. Therefore, we compared the active period and the deep underground hibernation of the frog. Using western blot analysis for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), we revealed a positive 36 kDa band in all samples and found higher optical density values in the hibernating frogs than in active frogs. In both active and hibernating frogs, we found regional differences in PCNA-immunoreactive cells and terminal transferase dUTP nick-end labelling apoptotic cells in the ventricular zones and parenchyma areas of the main encephalon subdivisions. During the active period of the frogs, the highest concentration of PCNA-immunoreactive cells was found in the ventricle dorsal zone of the cerebral hemispheres but only some of the cells were apoptotic. By contrast, the tectal and cerebellar ventricular zones had a small or medium amount of PCNA-immunoreactive cells, respectively, and a higher number of apoptotic cells. During hibernation, an increased PCNA-immunoreactive cell number was observed in both the brain ventricles and parenchyma compared with active frogs. This increase was primarily evident in the lateral ventricles, a region known to be a proliferation ‘hot spot’. Although differences existed among the brain areas, a general increase of apoptotic cell death was found in hibernating frogs, with the highest number of apoptotic cells being detected in the parenchyma of the cerebral hemispheres and optic tectum. In particular, the increased number of apoptotic cells in the hibernating frogs compared with active frogs in the parenchyma of these brain areas occurred when cell proliferation was higher in the corresponding ventricular zones. We suggest that the high number of dying cells found in the parenchymal regions of hibernating frogs might provide the stimulus for the ventricular zones to proliferate. Hibernating frogs could utilize an increased cell proliferation in the brain areas as a neuroprotective strategy to <b>face</b> <b>cell</b> death and the onset of neurological damages. Therefore, the hibernator promises to be a valuable model for studying the mechanisms naturally carried out by the central nervous system in order to adapt itself or survive adverse conditions...|$|E

40|$|Recognizing {{a person}} we know {{seems like an}} {{unremarkable}} occurrence within the stream of everyday events. However, {{the ease with which}} most of us recognize a familiar face belies the daunting complexity of the underlying computational challenges—challenges that become apparent in the not so rare cases of face-blindness and in attempts to develop computational models that mimic human face recognition performance. Neuroscience has shown, since the discovery of face-selective cells in the early 1970 s, that face recognition is a highly evolved ability in primates that relies on very specialized hardware: we now know that millions of <b>face</b> <b>cells</b> exist in the primate brain, that they are specialized for the processing of particular facial dimensions depending on which area they are located in, and that this spatial segregation of function is maintained within a network of highly interconnected face areas. Even some of the algorithms by which <b>face</b> <b>cells</b> detect and analyze faces are becoming clear. How this highly sophisticated face-processing system comes about, and how individual cells acquire their selectivity, is still the matter of much debate, yet it is clear that experience with the visual world, and with faces in particular, must play an important role. In PNAS, McMahon et al. (1) now provide an entirely new perspective on the question of plasticity in face recognition. With a new technical approach that allows for the activity of <b>face</b> <b>cells</b> to be monitored over days, weeks, months, and, in rare cases, even a year, they determined the selectivity of <b>face</b> <b>cells</b> {{in one part of the}} brain and found it to be remarkably stable over these long periods of time. This finding comes as a great surprise to a field that has gotten used to the notion of plasticity, and might indicate a hitherto unrealized form of functional specialization within the primate face-recognition system...|$|R
