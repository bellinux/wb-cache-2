5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Thelephora palmata {{can be used}} for {{mushroom}} <b>dyeing.</b> Depending on the mordant used, colors ranging from blackish brown to dark grayish green to greenish brown can be obtained from the <b>dyeing</b> process; without a mordant, a light-brown color is produced.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Jeremias Friedrich Gülich made {{substantial}} {{contributions to}} refining the <b>dyeing</b> process, making particular progress on setting standards on <b>dyeing</b> sheep wool {{and many other}} textiles. His contributions to refining the dying process and his theories on colour brought much praise by the well known poet and artist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.|$|E

5|$|Morris {{took up the}} {{practical}} art of <b>dyeing</b> as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He {{spent much of his}} time at Staffordshire dye works mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo <b>dyeing</b> as a practical industry and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, such as the red derived from madder, which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines. <b>Dyeing</b> of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.|$|E

30|$|<b>Dyes</b> {{can have}} acute and/or chronic effects on exposed organisms {{depending}} on the exposure time and <b>dye</b> concentration. <b>Dyes</b> can cause allergic dermatitis, skin irritation, cancer, mutation, etc. <b>Dyes</b> can be classified as (Mishra and Tripathy 1993): anionic (direct, acid and reactive <b>dyes),</b> cationic (basic <b>dyes)</b> and non-ionic (dispersive <b>dyes).</b>|$|R
5|$|Tin(II) {{chloride}} {{is used as}} a mordant in textile <b>dyeing</b> {{because it}} gives brighter colours with some dyes e.g. cochineal. This mordant has also been used alone to increase the weight of silk.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein {{has been}} used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat and {{breathing}} ailments. It has long had a medicinal reputation, especially as an astringent and emollient, as it contains mucilage, several saponins, coumarin and glycosides. Dioscorides recommended it for diseases of the lung {{and it is now}} widely available in health and herbal stores. Non-medical uses have included <b>dyeing</b> and making torches.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} finds use {{in water}} purification and sewage treatment, in the <b>dyeing</b> of cloth, as a coloring agent in paints, as an additive in animal feed, and as an etchant for copper {{in the manufacture of}} printed circuit boards.

30|$|Acid <b>dyes</b> {{are also}} {{another type of}} direct <b>dyes</b> for {{polyamide}} fibres like wool, silk and nylon.

5|$|Now in {{complete}} control of the Firm, Morris took an increased interest {{in the process of}} textile <b>dyeing</b> and entered into a co-operative agreement with Thomas Wardle, a silk dyer who operated the Hencroft Works in Leek, Staffordshire. As a result, Morris would spend time with Wardle at his home on various occasions between summer 1875 and spring 1878. Deeming the colours to be of inferior quality, Morris rejected the chemical aniline dyes which were then predominant, instead emphasising the revival of organic dyes, such as indigo for blue, walnut shells and roots for brown, and cochineal, kermes, and madder for red. Living and working in this industrial environment, he gained a personal understanding of production and the lives of the proletariat, and was disgusted by the poor living conditions of workers and the pollution caused by industry; these factors greatly influenced his political views. After learning the skills of <b>dyeing,</b> in the late 1870s Morris turned his attention to weaving, experimenting with silk weaving at Queen's Square.|$|E

Bioactive compounds that have been identified from the fruit bodies include pulveravinA, pulveravinB, vulpinic acid, and pulverolide. Mushrooms are also used in mushroom <b>dyeing</b> to produce the colors yellow, gold, greenish yellow, orange, or olive, depending on the mordant used.|$|E

These artifacts are now preserved at the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 3rd century, sewing, {{followed}} later by weaving, {{was introduced to}} Japan from Korea. Early textiles were made of simple twisted cords from wisteria, mulberry, hemp or ramie fibres. Following a gift of silk clothes and silk worms from the Chinese court, the Japanese court started to support textile and silk production from the 4th century onward. Chinese and Korean weavers were encouraged to exhibit their fabrics bringing new techniques such as those used to make brocades or delicate silk gauzes. In the 8th century Nara period, Japanese weavers employed {{a variety of techniques}} such as tie-dyeing, stenciling, batik, and embroidery. They skillfully imitated continental weaves, including rich damasks, many types of brocades and chiffon-like gauzes. Because of a general change in aesthetics in the Heian period weaving and <b>dyeing</b> techniques became less varied with less colourful brocades, smaller patterns, and less elaborate gauzes. The Japanese aristocracy preferred plain silks over woven or dyed designs. A total of seven National Treasures have been designated in the weaving and <b>dyeing</b> category, including: two mandalas, two monk's surplices or kesa, one brocade, one embroidery with a Buddhist motif and a set of garments presented to a shrine.|$|E
5|$|In China, Japan, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Gambia, {{and other}} parts of West Africa and {{southeast}} Asia, patterned silk and cotton fabrics were produced using resist <b>dyeing</b> techniques in which the cloth is printed or stenciled with starch or wax, or tied in various ways to prevent even penetration of the dye when the cloth is piece-dyed. The Chinese ladao process is dated to the 10th century; other traditional techniques include tie-dye, batik, Rōketsuzome, katazome, bandhani and leheria.|$|E
5|$|Mycena purpureofusca {{has been}} {{investigated}} for its potential to decolorize industrial dyes. These dyes, used in textile <b>dyeing</b> and printing processes, are difficult to degrade due to their highly structured organic compounds and pose a major environmental threat. The fungus mycelium produces high levels of laccase, an oxidoreductase enzyme. Laccases are widely used in biotechnology and industry due {{to their ability to}} break down various recalcitrant compounds. M.purpureofusca laccase efficiently breaks down Remazol Brilliant Blue R, an industrially important dye that is frequently used as a starting material in the production of polymeric dyes.|$|E
50|$|One other {{class that}} {{describes}} the role of <b>dyes,</b> rather than their mode of use, is the food <b>dye.</b> Because food <b>dyes</b> are classed as food additives, they are manufactured {{to a higher standard}} than some industrial <b>dyes.</b> Food <b>dyes</b> can be direct, mordant and vat <b>dyes,</b> and their use is strictly controlled by legislation. Many are azo <b>dyes,</b> although anthraquinone and triphenylmethane compounds are used for colors such as green and blue. Some naturally occurring <b>dyes</b> are also used.|$|R
