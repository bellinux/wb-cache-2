5|$|I am heartily {{sorry that}} after waiting {{so long for}} you I would set out but a day before your arrival.... I am {{exceeding}} unhappy at our not joining at Weelind , but don't know that <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are to blame, the militia with us continue to desert, and consequently I cannot remain long in one place otherways should be happy in forming a junction here.... I shall move on slowly for the reasons before recited and you will use the greatest industry as you cannot possibly pass us without our knowledge. I have suffered much lately but you again encourage me.|$|E

500|$|Foster {{talked about}} Hannibal in an {{interview}} with Total Film in late 2005. She said: [...] "The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie, Flora Plum. So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, and I know it sounds kind of strange to say {{but there was no way}} that <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could really trample on her." ...|$|E
500|$|Aspinall later commented {{about his}} first meeting with George Harrison, who also {{attended}} the Liverpool Institute: [...] "My first encounter with George was behind the school’s air-raid shelters. [...] This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out-of-breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine. It {{was one of the first}} cigarettes <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had smoked. We spluttered our way through it bravely but gleefully. After that the three of us did lots of ridiculous things together.... By the time we were ready to take the GCE exams we added John Lennon to our 'Mad Lad' gang. He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime." [...] Aspinall took nine GCEs at the Institute and passed eight of them, but failed the French exam. He left school in July 1959, and studied accountancy. [...] Aspinall worked for a Liverpool company for two years, receiving a wage of £2-10s–0d. (£2.50 decimal equivalent) per week as a trainee accountant.|$|E
500|$|Planning and rehearsals for {{the concert}} took {{about three weeks}} in a Manhattan theater. The rehearsals were {{characterized}} by past tensions that resurfaced between the performers under the intense time pressure. Paul Simon later said: [...] "Well, the rehearsals were just miserable. Artie and I fought all the time." [...] An early concept was for each singer to give a solo performance, with Simon allotted the greater amount of time, and to conclude with the duo performing their joint works. This idea was rejected because, according to Garfunkel, [...] "It didn't seem right to <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that Paul should be the opening act for Simon & Garfunkel, {{and for him to}} follow Simon & Garfunkel didn't make show-business sense". The two decided to perform most of the show together, with room for each to showcase some solo material. [...] Simon, who had resumed songwriting after a long hiatus, interrupted a series of studio recording sessions for the concert preparations. He used the live show as an opportunity to test one of his new songs in front of an audience. Garfunkel also planned to present a new song, [...] "A Heart in New York", from his soon-to-be released album Scissors Cut.|$|E

500|$|In the {{correspondence}} between the two men, Hoffecker gave Rovelstad a number of tips {{about how to deal}} with Congress. [...] Even though the bill was still mired in committee, Hoffecker advised what to do once the bill was signed. [...] He did not know yet that Rovelstad was a sculptor, and wrote to him in September 1935 about the models to be submitted for approval, [...] "These should also be 10 [...] in diameter, and this is where your trouble commences. These sculptors all want to incorporate their own ideas in the design and ask anywhere from $400.00 to $1,000.00 for their work, telling you what trouble it is to get the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts and many other things which do not exist." [...] Hoffecker also offered to handle the issue for the committee; he proposed to advance the money necessary to purchase the new coins from the government and to handle the distribution. [...] He stated that he had enjoyed the distribution of the Old Spanish Trail piece, though he lied to Rovelstad, stating he was not a coin dealer—the letterhead that Hoffecker used to write to Rovelstad said [...] "Loans and Mortgages" [...] under his name. He also warned Rovelstad, [...] "It would not be good for <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> if the word got out you had disposed of the entire issue to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Wallenda {{proposed}} to {{his future wife}} Erendira (née Vasquez, from famous Mexican circus family) on a wire [...] high during a performance in Montreal, Quebec. Having just performed a seven-man pyramid act with his family, he stayed on the platform while the family descended. He walked {{to the middle of}} the wire and got down on one knee, proposing to Erendira in front of 25,000 people. [...] A week later, they were married. [...] "I don’t know if <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could be married to someone who didn’t perform," [...] says Erendira. [...] "I can’t see <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> ever being happy sitting behind a desk." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Fox News, Coons was [...] "targeted by Republicans" [...] {{over the}} 25-year-old piece. Coons himself downplayed the article, {{as well as}} {{controversial}} past statements by O'Donnell, saying that voters were interested in current issues such as job creation and the national debt and were not [...] "particularly interested in statements that <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> made 20 or 30 years ago." [...] David Weigel, writing in Slate, opined: [...] "If the Tea Party Express slings the 'bearded Marxist' nonsense, I doubt it will work." ...|$|E
500|$|Anka {{created a}} new {{instrumental}} arrangement for [...] "It's Really Love" [...] and sent a demo to Carson and Ed McMahon, who were in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, making preparations for the show.

2500|$|In a 2005 interview, Heap said of Frou Frou [...] "(it) {{was really}} {{like a kind of}} little holiday from my own work. Guy and I, we have always worked together, and then over the years, it became clear that we wanted to do a whole album together. It was very organic and {{spontaneous}} — just one of those wonderful things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and I will get back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions, Boards of Canada used {{a wide range}} of vintage hardware and equipment, including an effects unit [...] "that cost [...] {{a lot of time and}} road miles to source." [...] The band used minimal amounts of drum machine and samplers and used [...] "real live drumming and percussion", which was later [...] "woven into the rhythm tracks." [...] The recording process also included Eoin and Sandison [...] "throw tracks back and forward at each other." [...] Speaking of the process, Sandison said that [...] "sometimes we jam the core idea down as a take, or one of us will start something and hand it over, and vice-versa. There isn't really one method or any particular strength for <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> because it changes from track to track. We both write melodies but at the same time we're both technicians in some way, so the process is quite unpredictable and messy." ...|$|E
2500|$|HaKohen {{argued that}} [...] "both {{narratives}} are equally valid and {{so long as}} they seek to negate or eclipse one another, both peoples will continue to suffer." [...] "Even if one narrative were to finally win out over the other, it would lead to injustice for at least one of us. The sad truth is that Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank actually undermines the Jewish people's legitimate right to Judea and Samaria. The Jews in Judea are not the Americans in Afghanistan. We don’t occupy some foreign people’s homeland. The problem is that many of our political and military leaders behave like the Americans in Afghanistan, bestowing credibility on claims we don’t belong in our own country. ... The bottom line is that in order for both peoples to achieve justice without creating any new injustices for <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> we need to collectively arrive at a larger narrative big enough to encompass both seemingly rival narratives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lighthouse {{design was}} the family's profession: Thomas's father (Robert's grandfather) was the famous civil {{engineer}} Robert Stevenson, {{and both of}} Thomas's brothers (Robert's uncles) Alan and David, {{were in the same}} field. Indeed, even Thomas's maternal grandfather, Thomas Smith, had been in the same profession. However, Robert's mother's family were not of the same profession. Margaret's natal family, the Balfours, were gentry, tracing their lineage back to a certain Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of Inchyra in Fife in the fifteenth century. Margaret's father, Lewis Balfour (1777–1860), was a minister of the Church of Scotland at nearby Colinton, and her siblings included the physician George William Balfour and the marine engineer James Balfour. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house. [...] "Now I often wonder," [...] wrote Stevenson, [...] "what I inherited from this old minister. I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> loved to hear them." ...|$|E
2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E
