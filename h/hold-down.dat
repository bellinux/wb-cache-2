40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the seismic design of multi-storey buildings made from cross-laminated timber panels (‘crosslam’). The use of seismic analysis {{methods such as}} the modal response spectrum and the non-linear static (push-over) analysis is discussed at length, including {{issues such as the}} modelling of crosslam walls and connections, the evaluation of the connection stiffness, and the schematization of floor panels. It was found that it is crucial to account for the flexibility of the connections (<b>hold-downs</b> and angle brackets) between upper and lower walls, since otherwise the vibration periods of the building would be underestimated. The basics of capacity design to ensure the attainment of ductile mechanisms in crosslam timber structures under seismic actions are presented. The ductile failure mechanism is characterized by plasticization of connectors (<b>hold-downs,</b> angle brackets and screws) between adjacent wall panels and between panels and foundations. The crosslam panels and the connections between adjacent floor panels must be designed for the overstrength of the connectors to ensure that they remain elastic during the earthquake and the ductile failure mechanism is attained. Based on the results of preliminary quasi-static cyclic tests, a value of 1. 3 was found for the overstrength factors of <b>hold-downs</b> and angle brackets. A case study multi-storey crosslam massive wooden building was then analysed using the non-linear push-over analysis as implemented in the N 2 method recommended by the Eurocode 8. The building was modelled using shell elements and non-linear links to schematize the <b>hold-downs</b> and angle brackets. The building ductility, calculated from the bilinear curve equivalent to the actual non-linear push-over curve, was then investigated. Such a quantity, defined as the ratio of the displacement at the near collapse state and the maximum elastic displacement of the top floor, was found to rise from 1. 7 to 2. 5 when ductile instead of brittle <b>hold-downs</b> and angle brackets are used. Furthermore, the maximum peak ground acceleration the building can resist raised from 0. 2 g to 0. 4 g, demonstrating the importance of using ductile connectors in seismic design...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{possibility}} to improve the seismic performance of cross-laminated timber (CLT) panel buildings introducing in the structure dissipative connectors in substitution of the classical <b>hold-downs.</b> In fact, as demonstrated by past experimental tests and numerical analyses, <b>hold-downs</b> exhibit a limited dissipation capacity. The proposed dissipative connector is called XL-stub and applies the concept usually adopted for ADAS devices. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed system the results of an experimental program devoted to characterize the force–displacement response under cyclic loads and low fatigue behavior of the XL-stub are presented and compared to the results of cyclic tests of <b>hold-downs</b> with same resistance. Afterwards, the comparison is extended at the level of the building, evaluating the influence of the connection on the seismic performance of the whole CLT panel building. To this scope, a FE model of the three-storey building tested within the SOFIE project is calibrated and multiple transient dynamic analyses are performed both for the building with the classical layout of connections and for the building equipped with XL-stubs. The obtained results are compared and the values of the behavior factor for the two solutions are calculated...|$|R

Once the rocket had lifted off, it could not safely settle back down onto the pad if the engines failed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of laboratory cyclic testing of preten-sioned concrete beams with <b>hold-downs</b> operating in the cracked or partially prestressed condition. It is shown that the fatigue life of inclined strand is low due to flexural action in strand at cracks. This results from the noncoincidence of crack-opening direction and strand direction. A pattern of regular, fine cracks is desirable. However, the usual pattern features dominant cracking at <b>hold-downs.</b> Based on experimental data a lower-bound fatigue-life equation is proposed. The equation indicates that for a fatigue life of 2, 000, 000 cycles the stress range in inclined strand should be restricted to 70 MPa for either pretensioned or posttensioned construction. The research suggests that in situations where heavy service loadings are frequent (e. g. railway bridges on heavy haul coal and mineral lines), partially prestressed design featuring inclined strand should be avoided...|$|R

40|$|The use of rigid {{engineered}} timber panels, such as cross-laminated-timber, {{in construction}} is increasing around the world, particularly in Europe and Australasia. Typically the panels rely on nailed or screwed steel plates for <b>hold-downs</b> and shear keys. However, this {{can mean the}} level of ductility is difficult to quantify. Furthermore ductile wall behaviour will inevitably be associated with permanent damage to the connections. There have been calls from designers for a solution in which the level of ductility can be predicted and achieved with confidence. The authors propose a novel, yet simple, slipfriction device that limits activated forces on a structure during an earthquake by allowing it to slightly rock. An experimental LVL wall was fitted with these devices acting as <b>hold-downs.</b> The shear key consisted of steel rods bearing against upright steel plates along {{the base of the}} wall. Under cyclic displacement tests, the wall demonstrated excellent elasto-plastic behaviour. The predicted wall strength from theory, matched, in general, the forces measured, while ductility levels can be as large as the designer desires, within obvious limits. Even under only self-weight, the wall readily descended at one end, while uplifting at the other. The results suggest that structures of engineered lumber can perform with reliable levels of ductility and remain free from damage...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of narrow shear walls or bracing segments without <b>hold-downs</b> {{has been recognized}} by the International Residential Code (IRC) in the U.

S. building codes restrict this application to construction on rigid foundations, such as a concrete foundation, stem wall, or slab. In order to address the raised floor issue such as occurs in basement or crawl space construction and in second or third level floors, a research project was conducted by APA- The Engineered Wood Association in late 2004 on narrow shear walls constructed on the top of a raised wood floor assembly without <b>hold-downs.</b> A total of 12 full-scale cyclic shear wall tests were conducted in this study. Several different raised floor configurations were first tested to determine the difference between engineered-wood raised floors using I-joists and solid-sawn raised floors, and to evaluate the effect of joist orientation relative to the braced wall segment.

50|$|Timing {{sequence}} referencing in ignition {{is critical}} for a successful liftoff and ascent flight. The explosive <b>hold-down</b> bolts relieve (through the launch support pedestals and pad structure) the asymmetric vehicle dynamic loads caused by the SSME ignition and thrust buildup, and applied thrust bearing loads. Without the <b>hold-down</b> bolts the SSMEs would violently tip the flight stack (orbiter, external tank, SRBs) over onto the external tank. That rotating moment is initially countered by the hold-bolts. Prior to release of the vehicle stack for liftoff, the SRBs must simultaneously ignite and pressurize their combustion chambers and exhaust nozzles to produce a thrust derived, net counter-rotating moment exactly equal to the SSME’s rotating moment. With the SRBs reaching full thrust, the <b>hold-down</b> bolts are blown, releasing the vehicle stack, the net rotating moment is zero, and the net vehicle thrust (opposing gravity) is positive, lifting the orbiter stack vertically from the launch pedestal, controllable through the coordinated gimbal movements of the SSMEs and the SRB exhaust nozzles.|$|E

40|$|Cross-laminated timber panel {{buildings}} are gaining a growing {{interest of the}} scientific community due to significant technical advantages, such as the material sustainability, the high fire resistance and quickness of erection. Nevertheless, {{it is well known that}} timber panels themselves are not able to dissipate a significant amount of energy during an earthquake. In fact, in this system the seismic design is carried out in order to dissipate the energy by means of inelasticity of connections. Generally, the elements devoted to withstand plastic deformations are the panel-panel and panel-foundation joints and, therefore, their ability to sustain repeated excursion in plastic range governs the building inelastic response. The paper here presented aims to propose an advanced approach for designing cross laminated timber panel buildings. In particular, it is proposed to substitute the classical <b>hold-downs,</b> which usually exhibit a limited dissipation capacity, with an innovative type of dissipative angle profile. The new connections, called XL-stubs, apply the concept usually adopted for designing the hysteretic metallic dampers ADAS (Added Damping and Stiffness). In particular, their tapered shape allows a better spread of plasticization resulting in a high dissipation capacity. Within this framework, in order to characterize the force-displacement response under cyclic loads of XL-stubs an experimental campaign is carried out. Afterwards, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved by analysing the non-linear response under seismic loads of a single wall alternatively equipped with <b>hold-downs</b> or XL-stub...|$|R
40|$|An {{extended}} experimental programme on typical cross-laminated (CLT) connections {{was performed}} at IVALSA Trees and Timber Institute. The paper discusses {{the results of}} monotonic and cyclic tests in shear and tension (pull-out) carried out on <b>hold-downs</b> and steel angle brackets used to anchor the wall panels to foundations or to connect wall panels to floor panels. Mechanical properties such as strength, stiffness, energy dissipation, impairment of strength and ductility were evaluated and are critically discussed in the paper. Significant ductility and energy dissipation was attained {{in most of the}} tests. Nevertheless, brittle failure modes were observed in some tests, indicating the need for introduction of capacity based design principles for CLT connections. The overstrength factors, which are needed for capacity based design, were also evaluated for the different types of connection tested. A comparison between the test results and the analytical formulas provided by current codes of practice and new proposals is also provided. The approach developed by Uibel and Bla&# 223; gives slightly more accurate CLT metal strength predictions compared to the existing formulas in Eurocode 5. Both approaches lead to very conservative results. However, analytical models for the prediction of CLT metal connectors’ stiffness significantly overestimate the experimental values. Therefore, it is recommended that currently only experimental strength and stiffness values of <b>hold-downs</b> and angle brackets be used in seismic analyses. Some proposals to improve the mechanical performance of metal connectors in terms of strength and stiffness are also given based on this experimental and analytical study...|$|R

40|$|Källsner and Girhammar have {{developed}} a new plastic design method for wood-frame shear walls at ultimate limit state. The method is capable of calculating the load-carrying capacity of partially anchored shear walls, where the leading stud is not necessarily anchored against uplift. In fully anchored shear walls, the leading stud needs to be anchored using some kind of <b>hold-downs</b> to resist uplift and the bottom rail needs to be fixed by anchor bolts to resist horizontal shear forces. In partially anchored shear walls, where <b>hold-downs</b> are not provided, the uplifting force is resisted by the sheathing-to-framing joints along the bottom rail. Hence, {{it is important that}} the bottom rail is anchored to the floor structure or foundation by anchor bolts and, therefore, able to transmit the forces to the structure below. Because of the eccentric load transfer, transverse bending is developed in the bottom rail and splitting of the bottom rail can occur. In order to use the plastic design method, a ductile behaviour of the sheathing-to-framing joints must be ensured. In this paper, results of tests on the splitting capacity of the bottom rail due to uplift in partially anchored shear walls are presented. Specimens with single-sided sheathing were tested, varying the size of washer, pith orientation of the bottom rails and anchor bolt position along the width of the bottom rail. The aim of the tests was to evaluate the influence of these parameters in order to avoid splitting failure of the bottom rail. Two types of brittle failure modes occurred during testing: (1) a crack opening from the bottom surface of the bottom rail and (2) a crack opening from the edge surface of the bottom rail along the line of sheathing-to-framing joints. These failure modes were mainly dependent on the washer size and the location of the anchor bolt. The results show that the distance between the edge of the washer and the loaded edge of the bottom rail has a decisive influence on the maximum load and the failure modes of the bottom rail.

The timber components (solid X-lam floors and wall panels) are modelled using elastic shell elements. By calibration on experimental cyclic tests carried out on each degree of freedom, important features of timber connection behaviour such as post-peak strength, pinching and stiffness degradation can all be considered. In addition, the effect of friction at the interface between panels and with foundation can be taken into account.
