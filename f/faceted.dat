40|$|This {{research}} {{was done with}} the aim of identifying and determining <b>facets</b> in network of correlated relationships of inside and outside field of Islamic Ethic Thesaurus using content analysis method. The research society consisted of 3316 published terms in Islamic Ethic Thesaurus which have correlated relationship together. The method of data collecting was documentary (Library). According to the findings Personality <b>Facet,</b> with 23 lateral and subset <b>facets</b> and 78. 55 percent usage, has the most usage in correlated relationships of Islamic Ethic Thesaurus. The Space <b>Facet</b> without subset <b>facet</b> and 0. 05 percent usage, has the minimum usage in correlated relationships of Islamic Ethic Thesaurus. Thus, {{it can be said that}} ‘Personality’ <b>Facet</b> has the most frequency, and ‘Space’ <b>Facet</b> has the minimum frequency between <b>facets</b> of network of correlated relationships in concepts of inside and outside field of Islamic Ethic Thesaurus. In this study according to the requirements of Islamic Ethic Thesaurus 6 <b>facets</b> were described which include <b>facets</b> of love and friendship, <b>facets</b> of foundation/basis, <b>facets</b> of pests and damages, <b>facets</b> of internal characteristics/sense, <b>facets</b> of signs and symptoms, and <b>facets</b> of ranks and grade...|$|R

5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were <b>faceted</b> and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft designed to use stealth technology to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low detectability was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only subsonic speed. The aircraft's <b>faceted</b> shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, {{at the expense of}} making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a fly-by-wire flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of stealth aircraft can be reduced by designing exhaust nozzles to mix the hot gases with cool ambient air, by placing the nozzles above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and by avoiding the use of afterburners, as with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|E

5|$|Architecturally, Plas Mawr {{is almost}} {{unchanged}} from the 16th century, {{making it a}} very rare survival from this period. The architectural style {{is a product of}} the broader Renaissance influences prevalent across Europe at the time. Robert Wynn spent time in Germany, and the style of Plas Mawr makes use of North German Gothic themes, particularly in its use of symmetry, the pedimented windows at the front of the house, <b>faceted</b> finials and crow-stepped gables. These features were already popular in England when the house was built, and indeed Plas Mawr is very similar in design to Eastbury Manor House, the two possibly being based off the same architectural plan. Some of these features had already begun to spread into Wales – crow-stepped gables, for example, were already being used in Flintshire by the 1580s – but others were ground breaking in Wales, such as the use of ovolo-moulded and dormer windows. Nonetheless, Robert Wynn was only an emerging member of the gentry, and his house was not as large or as sophisticated as contemporary grander Renaissance properties built in larger rural settings.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds are {{extremely}} hard, but also brittle {{and can be}} split up by a single blow. Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a <b>faceted</b> jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of facets would determine {{the weight of the}} final product. The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of the order of 50%. Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations. For example, the diamond might be intended for display or for wear, in a ring or a necklace, singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape. Some of them may be considered as classical, such as round, pear, marquise, oval, hearts and arrows diamonds, etc. Some of them are special, produced by certain companies, for example, Phoenix, Cushion, Sole Mio diamonds, etc.|$|E
5|$|The Nassers and Naify {{contracted}} with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities. They assigned Pflueger {{the design of}} the Tulare Theatre (1927) in Tulare, the Senator Theatre (1928) in Chico and the State Theatre (1928) in Oroville. The $250,000 Tulare Theatre (now demolished) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin-towered facade trimmed in neon accents, and brought Streamline Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped mirrors. The $250,000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas-relief exterior, but turned to Streamline Moderne in a 1,529-seat interior that featured chrome railings, plush carpet and indirect lighting. Aztec elements were incorporated in the proscenium design. The $300,000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running water under the foundation, a condition that required channelization and pumps. The movie palace's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish, Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant <b>faceted</b> amber glass gem lit from within.|$|E
40|$|The Drosophila fat <b>facets</b> gene encodes a deubiquitinating {{enzyme that}} regulates a cell {{communication}} pathway essential {{very early in}} eye development, prior to <b>facet</b> assembly, {{to limit the number}} of photoreceptor cells in each <b>facet</b> of the compound eye to eight.

50|$|The <b>facet</b> {{language}} defines {{individual specifications}} and specification composition to define systems. <b>Facets</b> and components define system models from one engineering perspective.

As such, Rosetta is a declarative language and constructs cannot be guaranteed to evaluate to a value, although some <b>facets</b> can be evaluated. Using the design abstractions provided by its domain, a <b>facet</b> describes requirements, behavior, constraints, or function of a system. <b>Facets</b> are heterogeneous and may be defined using any of the predefined or user defined domains. The Rosetta semantics denotes each <b>facet</b> to a coalgebra that defines its model-of-computation.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Facet</b> joints are {{important}} anatomical structures for {{the stability of}} spine. Surgical or degenerative damage to a <b>facet</b> joint may lead to spinal instability and causes clinical problems. This article explains the importance of <b>facet</b> joints, reviews <b>facet</b> replacement systems, and describes a simple and effective method for <b>facet</b> replacement after surgical removal of <b>facet</b> joints. Materials and Methods: Ten patients were operated with the diagnosis of unilateral nerve root compression secondary to <b>facet</b> degeneration. The hypertrophic <b>facet</b> joints were removed with microsurgical techniques and the roots were decompressed. Then, a unilateral artificial <b>facet</b> joint was created using two hinged screws and a dynamic rod. Results: The clinical outcome of all the patients was determined good or excellent at second and last follow-up (mean 13. 3 months) controls using visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores. Radiological evaluations also demonstrated no implant-related complications. Conclusions: The authors suggest that, if removal of a <b>facet</b> joint is necessary to decompress the nerve roots, the joint can {{be replaced by a}} construct composed of two hinged screws connected by a dynamic rod. This simple system mimics the function of a normal <b>facet</b> joint and is an effective technique for unilateral <b>facet</b> joint replacement...|$|R
