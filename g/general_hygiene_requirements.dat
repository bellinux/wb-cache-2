Its observance, particularly the <b>general</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements,</b> a prerequisite for the introduction of the HACCP system, and thus the overall safety of food preparation. The level of hygiene in catering premises reflects the responsibility of their management to food safety and also demonstrates the willingness of management to gain the favor of customers. In providing common food services and catering services to the public is always a danger of contagion that can spread the food, but also finished products. To avoid this possibility, it is necessary to apply the rules of hygiene. Establishments which provide catering services must meet the requirements to ensure the health of boarders. The common food services are very strict controled and is our aim to provide pointers on how to minimize risk and liability. Very dangerous is also bacterial transfer rates between hands and other common surfaces involved in food preparation in the kitchen.

40|$|Not only in Germany, human {{salmonellosis}} due {{to consumption}} of contaminated food {{of animal origin}} {{is one of the most}} frequent gastrointestinal infections. Since the entry into force of the duty of notification in accordance with BSeuchG 1962, the incidence continuously in-creased with S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium as the most frequent serovars. To protect the consumer from Salmonella infections, the law relating to food production and distribution has laid down minimum hygienic requirements for the handling of food and criteria to assess its presence in food. As a prerequisite for the assessment of the efficiency of these legal requirements for user protection, the present paper first discusses the epidemiological context and legal regulations with respect to salmonellae. Based on the compiled facts it was discussed and established whether the legal regulations are sufficient to deal with the presence of salmonellae on a reasonable safety level, whether the legal environment has weak points with respect to certain types of food or circumstances, or whether law includes inadequately serious responses to the presence of salmonellae. Results It is possible to reliably destroy the Gramnegative rod-like bacteria of the genus Enterobacteriaceae by heating food to 70 °C for 1 minute. All other procedures (i. e. drying, salting, fermentation, nitrite addition and cooling) only inhibit growth without however killing the salmonellae. Main sources of human salmonellosis are types of {{food of animal origin}}, including eggs and crude egg products that most frequently are suspected and identified as vehicles for salmo-nellae. However, salmonellae can be detected in nearly all types of food, in particular poultry meat that may be contaminated up to the half of the investigated lots (39 %). Average contamination rates are reported as follows: beef: 1 %, pork: 4 %, minced meat: 8 %, milk and milk products: pastries: 1. 4 %. Under consideration of the origin of the raw materials, the technology used for the production process, the final preparation of food for consumption under kitchen conditions and the resulting classification for the risk that a specific food might be contaminated with salmonellae, it is possible to deduce a risk assessment for the consumer including a specific risk tendency. For the protection of consumers against substances that are dangerous to health and that are (contained in) commercially available types of food, the law relating to food production and distribution has laid down a number of regulations on various levels (<b>general</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements,</b> Salmonella treatment and assessment regulations) that apply to the presence of salmonellae. A comparison of legal directives and their relation to the risk to the user by individual types of food demonstrates that in some cases the legal requirements for the handling of pork and poultry are not adequate. The legal limits of carcass and meat examination mainly apply to clinical diseases of the carcass. The principal origin of salmonellae, i. e. latently infected carcass, can be eliminated by control of the herds of origin. In addition to the examination of individual animals, the examination of herds should be kept out with even higher priority. As far as the presence of salmonellae is concerned, legal requirements on (poultry and) meat products have insufficient microbiological standards. These types of food could be made safer via legally binding standards or other regulations (e. g. HACCP systems). As discussed above, food containing crude egg products is the most frequent cause of human salmonellosis, indicating that the regulations with respects to this type of food is insufficient. It would be possible to implement the use of pasteurized egg mass via an HACCP conception. Legal requirements that refer to eggs to be used as food have loopholes with respect to cooling. Early cooling after laying will considerably contribute to risk minimization. Although sufficient consumer education would be required, the legal fixation of shorter periods before cooling would be more helpful. With respect to the low contamination of raw materials and also finished products, the legal regulations on the handling of egg products are sufficient to guarantee healthy unrisky egg products. Legal requirements on milk and milk products are high. However, the rule to heat farm milk demonstrates to be a weak point in milk hygiene legislation, because its implementation appears to be impossible. Despite the considerable risk to consumers, no particular hygiene regulations beyond the too general LMHV exist for bread, cakes and pastries. So far, particular requirements for the handling of this type of food are missing. The comparison of individual types of food and production lines thereof demonstrates that the legal assessment of a salmonellae contamination risk is quite heterogeneous and does not refer to prevalence or risk originating from the individual food. The chicken salmonellae directive and the voluntary monitoring initiative in pig stock seem to be initial steps into a direction that will help to establish the required far-reaching monitoring programs for all types of food. <br...|$|E

Aerobic colony count (ACC; ISO 4833 : 2003), Enterobacteriaceae (EB; ISO 21528 - 2 : 2004), Salmonella spp. (ISO 6579 : 2002), Listeria monocytogenes (ISO 11290 - 1 : 1996 and 11290 - 2 : 1998) were also tested. All the plants except one have two separate rooms, for clean and dirty zones, stunning and bleeding operations being frequently carried out on open air. The piglet scalding was carried out in hot water bowls, and hair removal by singeing. Animal welfare signs revealed the following aspects: handling: hoisting prior to stunning, vocalizations (41 %); stunning: not individual access to box, repeated shocks (4 %), mean voltage 135. 6 V, mean current for head-only electrical stunning 0. 78 A; indicators of not effective stunning: palpebral reflex (24. 2 %), corneal reflex (12. 8 %), vocalizations (15. 4 %); bleeding: conscious and sensitive animal shackling (53. 8 %). Results of carcass evaluation showed, for piglets and adult pig respectively: i) pH: pH 1 = 6. 21 ± 0. 25 and 6. 18 ± 0. 22; pH 24 = 5. 66 ± 0. 17 and 5. 49 ± 0. 11; ii) ACC: 4. 11 ± 0. 64 and 4. 63 ± 0. 42 (log 10 CFU/cm 2, mean±standard deviation); iii) Enterobacteriaceae prevalence of 81. 6 % (2. 55 ± 0. 80) in piglets and 100 % (3. 22 ± 0. 90) in adults.

40|$|Students of {{secondary}} hotel schools {{are the most}} likely candidates to work in catering services because of their professional specialization. Graduates may work in the hospitality or hotel industry and are qualified for a job in catering and should be able to ensure compliance in hygiene, health and safety at work. This work is focused on students of the secondary hotel schools and their awareness of <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> in food services. The work is divided into two parts. The theoretical part defines catering service, its features and types. It also includes the legislation relating to <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> in food industry, describes the spatial requirements for businesses, personal and operational hygiene and the HACCP system. The work also briefly describes different ways of food preparation and possibilities to influence health safety and the most common foodborne infections in catering services caused by failing to comply with correct manufacturing and hygiene principles. This work describes sanitation (disinfection, insect and rodent control) and the performance of state health supervision of food hygiene. The practical part includes research results which were obtained by a quantitative questionnaire method. Questionnaires were distributed amongst students of third and fourth (the final) years {{of secondary}} hotel schools in České Budějovice and Teplice. Each questionnaire contained 25 closed questions; the data collection was conducted anonymously. 106 of the 110 distributed questionnaires were returned from the Secondary Hotel School in České Budějovice. 99 questionnaires were sufficiently filled in to meet the research needs, making the return of 90 %. In the Secondary Hotel School in Teplice, 98 of the 100 distributed questionnaires returned, 96 were sufficiently filled in, making the return of 96 %. The aim of this work was to determine the level of awareness of the <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> in food service at secondary hotel schools in Teplice and České Budějovice. Based on the objectives of the work I set two hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : Students of secondary hotel schools in Teplice and České Budějovice are not informed about <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> in food services. Hypothesis 2 : Students of secondary hotel schools in Teplice and České Budějovice who are interested in working in catering services are informed about <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> for food services more than students who are not interested in such work. After testing the two hypotheses it is evident from the results that the students of secondary hotel schools in Teplice and České Budějovice are not informed about <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> in food services and that students of secondary hotel schools in České Budějovice and Teplice who are interested in working in catering services are more informed about the <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> than students who do not intend to work in the field. Based on these findings, it is important to educate students of secondary hotel schools continually, especially about the foodborne disease issues and also, to motivate them to work in catering services, because there are more than 50 % of students who do not want to advance towards working in the industry at both schools. There was almost no difference between the knowledge of students in secondary hotel schools in Teplice or České Budějovice. Students of the Secondary Hotel School in České Budějovice were slightly better an the number of correctly answered questions. Only one question, concerning the E-coli outbreak in Germany, was correctly answered by most students in Teplice. This work could serve as a teaching resource improving knowledge in this field.

Overall, the results emphasize the importance of psychosocial and contextual factors for latrine cleanliness. It makes sense to promote behavior change, as habitual latrine cleaning was the most important predictor of latrine cleanliness. Latrine cleanliness was also related to characteristics of the quality of latrine construction and encouraging households {{to improve the quality of}} their latrines could further enhance cleanliness. Psychosocial factors, especially commitment strength and positive emotions towards cleaning, and satisfaction with latrine cleanliness were important predictors for habitual latrine cleaning and should therefore be targeted by behavior change promotions.
