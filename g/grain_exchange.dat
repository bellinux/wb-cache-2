5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and <b>grain</b> <b>exchange</b> transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E

50|$|The {{marketing}} of wheat was modernized as well, {{as the cost}} of transportation steadily fell and more and more distant markets opened up. Before 1850, the crop was sacked, shipped by wagon or canal boat, and stored in warehouses. With the rapid growth of the nation's railroad network in the 1850s-1870s, farmers took their harvest by wagon for sale to the nearest country elevators. The wheat moved to terminal elevators, where it was sold through <b>grain</b> <b>exchanges</b> to flour millers and exporters. Since the elevators and railroads generally had a local monopoly, farmers soon had targets besides the weather for their complaints. They sometimes accused the elevator men of undergrading, shortweighting, and excessive dockage. Scandinavian immigrants in the Midwest took control over marketing through the organization of cooperatives.|$|R

40|$|An {{empirical}} methodology {{is developed}} for statistically testing the hedging effectiveness among competing futures contracts. The presented methodology {{is based on}} the encompassing principle, widely used in the forecasting literature, and applied here to minimum variance hedging regressions. Intuitively, the test is based on an alternative futures contract's ability to reduce residual basis risk by offering either diversification or a smaller absolute level of basis risk than a preferred futures contract. The methodology is also easily extended to cases involving multiple hedging instruments and general hedge ratio models. The methodology is demonstrated by evaluating the hedging effectiveness of Chicago Board of Trade's (CBOT) corn futures versus the Minneapolis <b>Grain</b> <b>Exchange's</b> National Corn Index (NCI) futures. The results indicate that the NCI futures encompass the CBOT futures for hedging country-level corn price risk in North Central Iowa; but, the NCI and CBOT futures are complementary in hedging terminal-level corn price risk at the U.

Here, we examine the performance of the Minneapolis <b>Grain</b> <b>Exchange's</b> white shrimp futures contract, one of the first futures contracts aimed at the aquaculture industry. Although the market structure largely conforms to the traditional criteria for a successful futures market, the contract's performance is disappointing in terms of liquidity, basis behavior, and ultimately, hedging effectiveness. Furthermore, nonpar-size delivery options embedded in the contract design likely impact basis behavior for certain hedges. While these reasons contributed to the ultimate demise of the contract, a general lack of knowledge regarding futures markets among the shrimp industry was also a factor. Given these findings, pragmatic implications for the introduction and marketing of new futures contracts into new industries are discussed.

40|$|This note {{presents}} an intuitive interpretation and expression for pricing cash settled futures contracts. In particular, {{the choice of}} the averaging period for the underlying cash index is evaluated. A question arises as to how {{the choice of the}} averaging period may effect how the futures contract is priced. In this note, it is shown that under certain assumptions, the behavior of the futures price prior to entering the expiration interval is independent of the averaging intervals length for storable commodities. However, {{this is not the case}} for nonstorable commodities. An examination of the Minneapolis <b>Grain</b> <b>Exchanges</b> National Corn Index futures provides empirical support for the results. Given the increasing interest in cash settled futures, especially for futures contracts on agricultural commodities, these results should prove useful to futures exchanges when considering contract design. Ultimately, contract design choices are a critical factor in the success of any futures contract. In the context of agricultural futures contracts, successful contracts can contribute to increased social welfare and greater efficiency of the food marketing system. ...|$|R

It means that once a certain amount of large dust particles form, even though it is much smaller than that of small dust particles, the dust layer becomes more unstable and dust clumping are accelerated. Thus, presence of dust particles with various sizes must be considered in studies of dust clumping in protoplanetary discs where both large and small dust grains are present.
