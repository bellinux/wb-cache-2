25|$|The {{flexible}} sealing surfaces preventing infiltration around the window unit can also degrade or be torn or damaged. Replacement of these seals {{can be difficult}} to impossible, due to IG windows commonly using extruded channel frames without seal retention screws or plates. Instead, the edge seals are installed by pushing an arrow-shaped indented one-way flexible lip <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> on the extruded channel, and often cannot be easily extracted from the extruded slot to be replaced.|$|E
25|$|After {{it became}} clear that it had been a mistake to ignore the issue of PC compatibility, Wang belatedly {{released}} an emulation board for Wang PC that enabled operation of many PC compatible software packages. The board accomplished this by monitoring all I/O and memory transactions (visible in those days before North/South bridge chips to any board plugged <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> on the expansion bus) and generating a non-maskable interrupt (NMI) whenever an operation was deemed to involve an incompatible device, requiring emulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{automated}} fare collection {{equipment is}} also compatible with the MBTA's CharlieTicket, a paper card with a magnetic stripe that operates as a stored-value card or time-period (monthly, weekly, or daily) pass. The MBTA first implemented the stored-value CharlieTicket on the Silver Line in February 2005. The ticket is inserted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> in the gate or farebox, the fare is deducted, and the remaining balance is displayed on a small screen. The ticket is {{then returned to the}} rider even if there is no remaining value.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{designs of}} {{mailboxes}} with improved construction and security have been patented in recent years, {{particularly in the}} United States. In 2001, the USPS first approved designs for locking curbside mailboxes to stem a rise in identity and mail theft. With these secure designs, the incoming mail is placed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> or hopper by the mail carrier, where it drops into a secure locked compartment for retrieval by only the homeowner (who retains a key or combination to the lock). Locking mailboxes are generally constructed of heavy-gauge steel or aluminum plate, though some models are made of roto-moulded polymer plastic.|$|E
25|$|The {{management}} of Kent International Airport (formerly RAF Manston) donated a Pickett-Hamilton fort to Lashenden Air Warfare Museum. Although {{most of the}} surviving forts are flooded, the fort at Manston was dry and in superb condition. The fort was excavated and restored to working order by museum members {{over a period of}} 18 months. Although the fort was originally intended to be buried on an airfield there was concern that putting it in the ground might, over time, degrade the concrete. Therefore, the fort has been placed at ground level and surrounded with a cone of earth and sandbags. The lifting mechanism is in working order and can be activated by visitors putting a coin <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot.</b> This is the only fully restored Pickett-Hamilton fort.|$|E
25|$|Attached devices {{can take}} either {{the form of}} an {{integrated}} circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself (called a planar device in the PCI specification) or an expansion card that fits <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot.</b> The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles, where it displaced the combination of several slow ISA slots and one fast VESA Local Bus slot as the bus configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as USB or serial, TV tuner cards and disk controllers. PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI. The preferred interface for video cards then became AGP, itself a superset of conventional PCI, before giving way to PCI Express.|$|E
5000|$|A notable {{exception}} was the IBM PC. Graphics display was {{facilitated by the}} use of an expansion card with its own memory plugged <b>into</b> <b>an</b> ISA <b>slot.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Serial Digital Video Out: Some 9xx series Intel {{chipsets}} {{allow for}} adding another output for the integrated video <b>into</b> <b>a</b> PCIe <b>slot</b> (mostly dedicated and 16 lanes).|$|R

500|$|Slotted {{lines are}} used for {{microwave}} measurements and consist of a movable probe inserted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> in a transmission line. [...] They are {{used in conjunction with}} a microwave power source and usually, in keeping with their low-cost application, a low cost Schottky diode detector and VSWR meter rather than an expensive microwave power meter.|$|E
500|$|SmarTrip {{cards are}} 3⅜ by 2⅛ inches (85.7mm × 54.0mm), {{the same size}} as a credit card or driver's license. [...] The card is brought into close {{proximity}} with a circular target on the top or side of each faregate rather than inserted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot.</b> Because the card has a radio-frequency identification (RFID) chip inside, it needs not be touched directly to the target, just held near it; thus the card can be scanned while still inside a wallet or purse passed over the target, affording some speed and convenience over the paper farecards which were physically inserted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot.</b> [...] In the Metrorail system, using the card to activate the target by will display the value remaining as the faregate opens, both when entering and exiting. [...] On Metrobuses, the farebox will audibly beep and display the remaining value. [...] In all cases, the appropriate fare is deducted automatically, accounting for any applicable transfers and discounts.|$|E
2500|$|Single-Journey tickets can be {{purchased}} from ticket vending machines, and at some stations, at a ticket window. [...] Single-ride tickets are embedded with RFID contactless chips. When entering the system riders tap the ticket against a scanner above the turnstile, and on exit they insert the ticket <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> where it is stored and recycled.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a special}} version of the RSA-II that does not need <b>a</b> PCI <b>slot.</b> Instead it is plugged <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{dedicated}} <b>slot</b> on the systemboard, like a mini-pci adapter. This version also {{does not have a}} video controller anymore like the RSA-II.|$|R

2500|$|Comus had a ship rig, with sqaresails on {{all three}} masts. [...] She and her class were among {{the last of the}} saiing corvettes. The vessel was also {{equipped}} with a steam engine driving a single screw with 2,590 indicated horsepower; to reduce resistance, this propeller could be hoisted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> cut in the keel when the vessel was under sail.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with several}} other Goodson-Todman game shows, Password has been adapted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> machine by WMS Gaming. A {{simulated}} Allen Ludden emcees the proceedings, with the voices and caricatures of Rose Marie, Dawn Wells, Adam West, and Marty Allen. One bonus round offers the player free spins; the other involves choosing from four envelopes offered by the celebrities. Finding the [...] "Password" [...] envelope advances the player {{to a new level}} with four more envelopes, worth more prize money.|$|E
2500|$|The other {{remarkable}} {{item was}} the torc or collar which is [...] in diameter with buffer terminals, using a mortice and tenon fastening. The hollow tube {{that made up}} the ring is [...] in diameter. The hinge is no longer there {{but it would have been}} required to put on the collar. The fastening consists of a [...] "T" [...] piece which fits <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> as the torc is closed. A section can then be turned which captures the [...] "T" [...] and prevents it opening.|$|E
50|$|Physically a SAM card {{can either}} be a SIM card and plugged <b>into</b> <b>a</b> SAM <b>slot</b> in <b>a</b> reader, or a fixed {{integrated}} circuit in a housing directly soldered on a Printed circuit board (e.g. HVQFN housing).|$|R
5000|$|Most punch down {{tools are}} of the impact type, {{consisting}} of a handle, an internal spring mechanism, and <b>a</b> removable <b>slotted</b> blade. To use the punch down tool, a wire is pre-positioned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> post on <b>a</b> punch block, and then the punch down tool is pressed {{down on top of}} the wire, over the post. Once the required pressure is reached, an internal spring is triggered, and the blade pushes the wire into the slot, simultaneously cutting the insulation and securing the wire. [...] The tool blade does not cut through the wire insulation to make contact, but rather the sharp edges of the slot in the contact post itself slice through the insulation.|$|R
50|$|The {{duration}} of Ultima Thule has varied considerably over the years. Initially launched as a 90-minute programme, the duration was expanded progressively to two, and then three hours, until settling back <b>into</b> <b>a</b> 90-minute <b>slot</b> from March 2001.|$|R
2500|$|Norwegian (or meat chopper) {{couplings}} {{consist of}} a central buffer with a mechanical hook that drops <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> in the central buffer. There {{may also be a}} U-shaped securing latch on the opposite buffer which is fastened {{over the top of the}} hook to secure it. The Norwegian is found only on narrow gauge railways of , [...] or less, such as the Isle of Man Railway, Western Australian Government Railways, the Ffestiniog Railway and the Welsh Highland Railway, Tanzania, where low speeds and reduced train loads allow a simpler system. The Norwegian coupler allows sharper curves than the buffer-and-chain, which is an advantage on those railways.|$|E
2500|$|The Grand Gallery {{continues}} {{the slope of}} the Ascending Passage, but is [...] high and [...] long. At the base it is [...] wide, but after [...] the blocks of stone in the walls are corbelled inwards by [...] on each side. There are seven of these steps, so, at the top, the Grand Gallery is only [...] wide. It is roofed by slabs of stone laid at a slightly steeper angle than the floor of the gallery, so that each stone fits <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> cut {{in the top of the}} gallery like the teeth of a ratchet. The purpose was to have each block supported by the wall of the Gallery, rather than resting on the block beneath it, in order to prevent cumulative pressure.|$|E
2500|$|The Moon train {{starts with}} gear b1 and {{proceeds}} through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 {{to the moon}} pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an epicyclic gear system; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must {{move back and forth}} in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others. [...] Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the moon, in consequence of Kepler's second and third laws. The modelled rotational period of the moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the moon of 8.85 years.|$|E

60|$|My chest hit {{something}} hard, and I {{found myself}} with my chin {{on the edge}} of an unfathomable abyss that had suddenly opened beneath me, my hand extended stiffly into the void. The whole of that flat circular area {{was no more than a}} gigantic lid, that was now sliding sideways from off the pit it had covered <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> prepared for it.|$|E
60|$|And lo and behold! {{when you}} dropped a penny <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> {{just below the}} wooden stage, the crowd of little figures started waving their arms up and down, and another little doll would ascend the {{elevated}} platform and {{lie down on the}} red board {{at the foot of the}} wooden posts. Then a figure dressed in brilliant scarlet put out an arm presumably to touch the pulley, and the tiny knife would rattle down on to the poor little reclining doll's neck, and its head would roll off into the basket beyond.|$|E
60|$|The cost {{of dress}} varies, {{according}} to the taste of and the purse, everywhere. White serge seemed the favorite wear {{of most of the}} ladies one saw in the street at Monte Carlo, especially in the region of the Casino. This may have expressed an inner condition, or {{it may have been a}} sympathetic response to the advances of the flowers in the pretty beds and parterres so fancifully designed by the gardeners of the administration, or it may have been a token of the helpless submission to which the windows of the milliners and modistes reduced all comers of the dressful sex. Many of the men with the women, or without them, were also in white serge, but they seemed more variably attired; there was a prevailing suggestion of yachting or automobiling in their dress, though doubtless most of them had not sailed or motored to the spot. Some few, say four or five, may have motored away from it, for in the centre of the charming square before the Casino there was an automobile of some newest type being raffled for in the interest of that chiefest of the Christian virtues which makes its most successful appeals in the vicinity of games of chance. Some one must have won the machine and carried a party of his friends away, and triumphantly turned turtle with it over the first of the precipices which abound at Monte Carlo. More than the tables within this opportunity of fortune tempted me, and it was only by the repeated recurrence to my principles that I was able to get away alive. In spite of myself, I did not get away without, however guiltlessly, having yielded to the spirit of the place. It was at the Administrational Art Exhibition, where there were really some good pictures, and where, on my entering, I was given a small brass disk. On going out I attempted to restore this to the door-keeper, but he went back with me to a certain piece of mechanism, where he instructed me to put the disk <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot.</b> Then the disk ran its course, and a small brass ball came out at the bottom. The door-keeper opened this, and showed me that it was empty; but he gave me to understand that it might have been full of diamonds, or rubies, or seed-pearls, which might have implanted in me a lust of gambling I should never have overcome. Monte Carlo was in every way tempting. A vast oblong, brilliant with flowers in artistic patterns, stretched upward from the Casino, and there was an agreeable park where one might sit. On every other side there were costly hotels and costly restaurants, including that of the unexampled, the insurpassable Giro, where one saw people eating and drinking at the windows whenever one passed, by day or night. Beyond the Casino seaward were the beautiful terraces, planted with palms and other tropic growths, where people might come out and kill themselves when they had nothing left to lose but their lives; and against the dark green of their fronds the temple of fortune lifted a frosted-cake-like front of long extent. I do not know just what type of architecture it is of, but it distinctly suggests the art of the pastry cook when he has triumphed in some edifice crowning the centre of the table at a great public dinner. What mars the pleasing effect most is a detail which enforces this suggestion, for the region of the Casino is thickly frequented by a species of black doves, and when these gather in close lines of black dots along the eaves, they have exactly the effect of flies clustering on the sugary surfaces of the cake. At intervals are bronze statues of what seem a sort of adolescent cherubs, but which have, I do not know why, a peculiarly devilish appearance. No doubt they are harmless enough; but certainly they do nothing to keep the flies off the cake.|$|E
