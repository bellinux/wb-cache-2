5000|$|In 2008, Shapeshifter {{embarked}} on their fourth European tour playing sold-out dates in Paris, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Scotland and England. The tour also promoted their single [...] "One", released in May 2008, {{and off the}} back of the successful tour and critically acclaimed single, {{the decision was made to}} release Soulstice in the UK and Europe. This was released on 17 November on Mums The Word Records with a special re-designed package that includes new artwork and exclusive remixes from <b>D-Bridge</b> (Exit Records), Nu:Tone and The Nextmen. Shapeshifter also toured Australia at the end of 2008 and during their summer tour of New Zealand, they played new unreleased tracks including [...] "Dutch Sorrow", [...] "Right Here, Right Now", [...] "Day One", [...] "Twin Galaxies", [...] "Warning" [...] and [...] "System" [...] some of which appeared on their next album entitled, The System Is A Vampire, released 12 November 2009. Shapeshifter also released a remix EP in late 2008 featuring two alternative versions of their song [...] "Bring Change" [...] by themselves and fellow New Zealand drum and bass artists, The Upbeats. A remix of their song [...] "Long White Cloud" [...] was also included, remixed by Nu:Tone. Shapeshifter also released a remix of their hit tune, Electric Dream which was remixed by New Zealand drum and bass act, State of Mind.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Today the {{construction}} of wireless sensing systems {{requires the use of}} rather high-priced pieces of hardware and the assembly of these hardware parts (wireless transmission core, sensor module, gateway device), as well as the implementation of the according software (sensor mote software, gateway software, end user software). This makes overall development and the thereby resulting product costly in terms of both time and money. With the <b>D-Bridge</b> concept that we present in this paper we will show an approach that is much cheaper than any other solution in terms of hardware and development costs. This <b>D-Bridge</b> is a combination of a gateway between the wireless sensor network and the IP network which also includes a Web-based application server at the wireless sensor network appliance’s location. I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK Existing wireless sensor network solutions often targe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDonor-acceptor-donor tetrazines {{containing}} ferrocene moieties and phenyl unit as a <b>ð-bridge</b> {{have been}} synthesized and characterized. UV-vis spectroscopic and cyclic voltamperometric results indicate sizable intramolecular charge transfer interactions {{in the ground}} state when the ferrocene is directly bound to the tetrazine. On the other hand, the results show reduction of the electron-donor strength of ferrocene moieties {{when there is a}} phenyl linkage. Both tetrazines display a high reduction potential. The role of ferrocenyl groups appear to be detrimental to maximize the cubic hyperpolarizability ç of tetrazines, as compared to purely organic groups such as thiophene. A possible explanation for this behavior may originate from metalto- ligand charge transfer processes...|$|E
