5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of sibling species, species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to suggest they have been separated <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> of years. A paramount example of evolutionary stasis is the fern Osmunda claytoniana. Based on paleontological evidence it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the Spring Creek Dam was to collect acid mine {{drainage}} from the old Iron Mountain Mine, which was heavily polluting Spring Creek and its tributaries. The dam was built in response to these pollutants that were contaminating the Sacramento River, the primary water supply <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> of Californians. Although the watershed is small in comparison to that of the Sacramento River, the stream is among the most polluted and acidic in the world.|$|E
5|$|Though {{supported}} by many politicians and businesses in Alaska, {{the project was}} canceled after objections were raised. Native Alaskans in the area protested the threatened loss of nine villages that would be flooded by the dam. Conservation groups abhorred the threatened flooding of the Yukon Flats, a large area of wetlands that provides a critical breeding ground <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> of waterfowl. Fiscal conservatives opposed the dam {{on the grounds of}} its large cost and limited benefit to Americans outside Alaska.|$|E

Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> and millions in this country.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil {{and three}} {{associates}} were extradited to the United States. In a 77-page 32-count indictment filed on July 13, 2008 at {{federal court in}} Los Angeles, the Abergil family {{is considered one of}} the most powerful crime families in Israel, deriving that power, in part, “because of its propensity for violence in Israel and around the world.” They were charged with murder, laundering millions of dollars obtained from embezzlement at Israel Trade Bank, extortion of business people, and operating an ecstasy-distribution network <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> of ecstasy pills. The Abergils and their three associates have denied all charges. According to Israeli police sources, their crime organization has continued to operate in Israel after their extradition.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to {{the project}} was based on three {{separate}} objections to its construction: ecological, human, and financial. Conservation groups opposed the dam's construction because it would flood the Yukon Flats, a large wetland area that provides breeding ground <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> of waterfowl and habitat for game and fur-bearing animals. Alaska Native groups objected {{to the project}}'s human cost—the need to relocate more than 1,500 people and 9 villages—and Native groups outside the reservoir area objected to the potential devastation of the Yukon River salmon population. The third objection to construction of the dam stemmed from its high cost {{and the belief that}} cheap electricity would not be enough to attract industry to Alaska.|$|E

5|$|The orb {{itself was}} buried {{deep in the}} ground <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> of years, until it was {{discovered}} by Karnath, an evil sorcerer. Upon finding the orb, Karnath fused it into his own magical staff, and on doing so learned {{the history of the}} Sarnathians. He became obsessed with the orb and the task of releasing these beings from the Realm of Unreality. After years of isolation in his castle, as his own death was drawing near, Karnath was finally able to cast a powerful spell over his staff. This spell was designed such that upon contact with the orb, it would unleash its most powerful state and tear the fabric of reality once more.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{immigration}} from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and Manhattan became the first stop <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> seeking {{a new life in}} the United States, a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, a gift from the people of France. The new European immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed of revolution (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and unionization.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} many known cases of {{population}} bottleneck in the recent past. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans, North American prairies were habitat <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> of greater prairie chickens. In Illinois alone, their numbers plummeted from about 100 million birds in 1900 to about 50 birds in the 1990s. The declines in population resulted from hunting and habitat destruction, but the random consequence has been a loss of most of the species' genetic diversity. DNA analysis comparing birds from the mid century to birds in the 1990s documents a steep decline in the genetic variation in just in the latter few decades. Currently the greater prairie chicken is experiencing low reproductive success. However, bottleneck and genetic drift can lead to a genetic loss that increases fitness as seen in Ehrlichia.|$|E

5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.|$|E
5|$|The unified {{armed forces}} of Germany from 1935 to 1945 were called the Wehrmacht. This {{included}} the Heer (army), Kriegsmarine (navy) and the Luftwaffe (air force). From 2 August 1934, members {{of the armed forces}} were required to pledge an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler personally. In contrast to the previous oath, which required allegiance to the constitution of the country and its lawful establishments, this new oath required members of the military to obey Hitler even if they were being ordered to do something illegal. Hitler decreed that the army would have to tolerate and even offer logistical support to the Einsatzgruppen—the mobile death squads responsible <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> of deaths in Eastern Europe—when it was tactically possible to do so. Members of the Wehrmacht also participated directly in the Holocaust by shooting civilians or undertaking genocide under the guise of anti-partisan operations. The party line was that the Jews were the instigators of the partisan struggle and therefore needed to be eliminated. On 8 July 1941, Heydrich announced that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot.|$|E
