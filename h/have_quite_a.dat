5|$|Los Angeles robbery-homicide {{sergeant}} Vincent Hanna (Plank) is on {{the trail}} of a gang of ruthless professional criminals, led by the methodical Patrick McLaren (McArthur), whose only mistake in the last heist was the killing of armored car guards by the new recruit, Waingro (Berkeley), who is a loose cannon. But Hanna is soon surprised when he discovers that he and McLaren <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot in common. While McLaren and his gang plan another heist, Hanna and his colleagues keep surveillance. Hanna is facing a personal problem, as the police work is straining his relationship with his wife, Lillian (Pouget). Moreover, McLaren is also facing a similar problem when he finds himself falling in love with Eady (Harrington), which he personally condemns due to the commitment required to his profession.|$|E

Much of the focus of psychology of religion is concerned with issues that wouldn't be considered 'transcendent' within transpersonal psychology, so the two disciplines do <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> distinct focus.|$|E

[...] Scott admired the film, and felt that [...] "it's [...] dark and eerie as any Twilight Zone". He laughed at his role, saying that [...] " [...] is lacking some social skills, he doesn't <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few friends, and he's like the tag-along". Scott was {{surprised}} when in the script his character was written as fat. The writers eventually changed it for Scott.|$|E

And it was a real unveiling of the creature, little by little, and using lighting and camera work and music to make it a very subjective experience. And so we tried to preserve that here." [...] In designing the film's aliens, ILM was careful to make the creatures [...] "cool and captivating". Guyett stated that they adopted a similar approach to that of District 9: ...|$|E

In 2008, she opened the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod and {{performed}} concerts in China, America and Australia featuring songs from her 40-year career. To further celebrate 40 years since her first performance on a West End Stage, in October 2008 Paige released a picture-based autobiography titled Memories. The book took around eight months to compile; [...] "Since Evita I suppose, I had kept a yearbook. My parents always kept cuttings {{and things like that}} for me. I did <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot of reference material to work out," [...] Paige commented.|$|E

[...] In his role as guest reviewer for Disc and Music Echo, Ray Davies of the Kinks also admired the performance and suggested that Harrison [...] "must <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> big influence on the group now".|$|E

500|$|Like many padres {{during the}} First World War, Keable reassessed his {{approach}} to his congregation. The men to whom he ministered, he came to believe, cared nothing for {{the finer points of}} Anglican theological dispute: from the church they wanted only [...] "entertainment and a barely spiritual form of practical Christianity." [...] Keable argued as much openly, suggesting that the Protestant chaplaincy in France should be amalgamated into the operations of the YMCA, and that only the Roman Catholic padres – who seemed to <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> different, more immediate relationship with their Celtic and Lancastrian companies – should remain. His public airing of these views attracted censure from the church (and particularly from Frank Weston, who was also serving), but reflected the openness that made him popular with the officers in France. A smoker, he was known to share whisky and sodas in the officers' mess, and – as does the title character in Simon Called Peter – to have become acquainted with a devoutly religious French prostitute.|$|E
500|$|Chelsea manager Mourinho was {{primarily}} concerned with the fitness of his squad {{in the aftermath of}} the match, in particular Ballack, who was substituted with an injury early in the match: [...] "He had a kick in the muscle and he couldn't run but I hope he will be back soon, we <b>have</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few players not in condition and we need players back, so I hope it's not a big deal." [...] He felt that the fitness of the two squads was the decisive factor in the match: [...] "Today our bench was not very good, with some kids, Liverpool could inject fresh blood at the same time as some of my players became really tired. They were broken. They were in better condition than us, you could see the difference between Frank Lampard and Sissoko." [...] Mourinho was also unconcerned about his team's form heading into the start of the season: [...] "Liverpool had more intensity and pace, qualities that make a team better. They had that and we didn't. We had a big percentage of the ball possession, but Liverpool defended with intensity and looked dangerous when they counter-attacked. I keep saying they are a difficult team to beat and they can go to every game with an ambition to win. They are a good team but over 10 months of competition we will be there." ...|$|E
