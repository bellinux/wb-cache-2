500|$|Most of {{the album}} was {{recorded}} at Brian's home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. Since the recording of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: [...] "He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'" [...] When asked if Brian was [...] "still the producer of Smiley Smile," [...] Carl answered, [...] "Most definitely." [...] Brian acknowledged: [...] "We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped and ended up doing the entire thing here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with." [...] When questioned on why the band took the approach they did, he stated, [...] "We just had a particular atmosphere that we were working in that inspired the particular <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were on the album." [...] Author Domenic Priore notes that when the Beach Boys were taken out of professional studios, [...] "the discipline of the clock, rates and overtime disappeared".|$|E

Few contemporary CD-ROM drives have speeds above 4×, and the competing consoles Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation have 2× drives running at about [...] with high latency. This can be observed on the loading screens that appear in many PlayStation games but are typically nonexistent in Nintendo 64 games. ROM cartridges are so much faster than contemporary CD-ROM drives that data can be streamed in real-time from cartridges {{as if they are}} additional RAM, thus maximizing the efficiency of the system's RAM. This was a common practice for developers in many games, such as Nintendo EAD's Super Mario 64 or Factor 5's Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. Howard Lincoln said, [...] " [...] and those guys felt very strongly that it was absolutely essential to have it on a cartridge in order to do the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we wanted to do with Super Mario." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{point it}} is my purpose to urge might perhaps be {{suggested}} thus: that Socialists and most social reformers of their color are vividly conscious of {{the line between the}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> belong to the state and the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> belong to mere chaos or uncoercible nature; they may force children to go to school before the sun rises, but they will not try to force the sun to rise; they will not, like Canute, banish the sea, but only the sea-bathers. But inside the outline of the state their lines are confused, and entities melt into each other. They have no firm instinctive sense of one thing being in its nature private and another public, of one thing being necessarily bond and another free. That is why piece by piece, and quite silently, personal liberty is being stolen from Englishmen, as personal land has been silently stolen ever since the sixteenth century.|$|E

These two pramanas have as their objects the only two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> exist, unique particulars (svalaksanas) and the abstract/universals (samanyalaksana).

When I see the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Life does, I despair of ever catching her peculiar trick. She has an impudence, life! If one risked a fiftieth part of the effects she risks! It takes ever so long to believe it. You don't know yet, my dear fellow. It is n't till one has been watching life for forty years that one finds out half of what she's up to! Therefore one's earlier things must inevitably contain a mass of rot. And with what one sees, on one side, with its tongue in its cheek, defying one to be real enough, and on the other the bonnes gens rolling up their eyes at one's cynicism, the situation has elements of the ludicrous which the artist himself is doubtless in a position to appreciate better than any one else. Of course one mustn't bother about the bonnes gens." [...] Mark Ambient went on, while my thoughts reverted to his ladylike wife, as interpreted by his remarkable sister.|$|E
6000|$|While this Subsidy Treaty {{is getting}} settled in England, Duke Ferdinand has his French in full cackle of {{universal}} flight; {{and before the}} signing of it (April 11th), every feather of them is over the Rhine; Duke Ferdinand busy preparing to follow. Glorious news, day after day, coming in, for Pitt, for Miss Barbara and for all English souls, Royal Highness of Cumberland hardly excepted! The [...] "Descent on Rochefort," [...] last Autumn, had a good deal disappointed Pitt and England;--an expensively elaborate Expedition, military and naval; which could not [...] "descend" [...] at all, when {{it got to the}} point; but merely went groping about, on the muddy shores of the Charente, holding councils of war yonder; [...] "cannonaded the Isle of Aix for two hours;" [...] and returned home without result of any kind, Courts-martial following on it, as too usual. This was an unsuccessful first-stroke for Pitt. Indeed, he never did much succeed in those Descents on the French Coast, though never again so ill as this time. Those are a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> require an exactitude as of clockwork, in all their parts: and Pitt's Generalcies and War-Offices,--we know whether they were of the Prussian type or of the Swedish! A very grievous hindrance to Pitt;--which he will not believe to be quite incurable. Against which he, for his part, stands up, in grim earnest, and with his whole strength; and is now, and at all times, doing what in him lies to abate or remedy it:--successfully, to an unexpected degree, within the next four years. From America, he has decided to recall Lord Loudon, as a cunctatory haggling mortal, the reverse of a General; how very different from his Austrian Cousin! [Cousins certainly enough; their Progenitors were Brothers, of that House, about 1568,--when Matthew, the cadet, went [...] "into Livonia," [...] into foreign Soldiering (Papa having fallen Prisoner [...] "at the Battle of Langside," [...] 1568, and the Family prospects being low); from this Matthew comes, through a scrips of Livonian Soldiers, the famed Austrian Loudon. Douglas, Peerage of Scotland, p. 425; &c. &c. VIE DE LOUDON (ill-informed on that point and some others) says, the first Livonian Loudon came from Ayrshire, [...] "in the fourteenth century".] [...] "Abercrombie may be better," [...] hopes he;--was better, still not good. But already in the gloomy imbroglio over yonder, Pitt discerns that one Amherst (the son of people unimportant at the hustings) has military talent: and in this puddle of a Rochefort Futility, he has got his eye on a young Officer named Wolfe, who was Quartermaster of the Expedition; a young man likewise destitute of Parliamentary connection, but who may be worth something. Both of whom will be heard of! In a four years' determined effort of this kind, things do improve: and it was wonderful, to what amount,--out of these chaotic War-Offices little better than the Swedish, and ignorant Generalcies fully worse than the Swedish,--Pitt got heroic successes and work really done.|$|E
