5|$|At 15:30 on 21 August the Battle for Hill 60 began. Charging {{straight}} at the hill, the regiment suffered sixty per cent casualties, among them Hutton in command. He was replaced by Major Hurst, from the 1st Squadron, and they succeeded in capturing the Turkish trench within <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> going over the top. But {{on either side of}} them the rest of the attack had failed, leaving the regiment and the Otago Mounted Rifles isolated {{from the rest of the}} force. Not having the manpower to continue the assault, they were ordered to dig in and hold the position. They held on until 23 August when they were relieved by the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, Miyazaki took a {{group of}} artists and animators to the ancient forests of Yakushima and the {{mountains}} of Shirakami-Sanchi, taking photographs and making sketches. The landscapes in the film were inspired by Yakushima. In Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki revisited the ecological and political themes of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Miyazaki supervised the 144,000 cels in the film, about 80,000 of which were key animation. Princess Mononoke was produced with an estimated budget of ¥2.35 billion (approximately US$23.5 million), making it the most expensive film by Studio Ghibli at the time. Approximately <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the film uses computer animation: about five minutes uses techniques such as 3D rendering, digital composition, and texture mapping; the remaining ten minutes uses digital ink and paint. While the original intention was to digitally paint 5,000 of the film's frames, time constraints doubled this.|$|E
5|$|Mathews and Cave {{also began}} to muster their forces, already {{commanding}} 900 Zanzibari askaris under Lieutenant Arthur Edward Harington Raikes of the Wiltshire Regiment who was seconded to the Zanzibar Army and held the rank of brigadier-general. 150 sailors and marines were landed from the Pearl-class protected cruiser Philomel and the gunboat Thrush, which were anchored in the harbour. The naval contingent, {{under the command of}} Captain O'Callaghan, came ashore within <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> being requested to deal with any rioting caused by the general population. A smaller contingent of sailors under Lieutenant Watson of Thrush were put ashore to guard the British consulate, where British citizens were requested to gather for protection. HMS Sparrow, another gunboat, entered the harbour and was anchored opposite the palace next to Thrush.|$|E

5|$|After <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> combat, Boston {{lost its}} cross-jack yard and by 05:45 had {{suffered}} significant damage to its rigging and sails, rendering the ship significantly less manoeuvrable than Embuscade. At 06:10 the main topmast was knocked {{over and the}} mizzen mast badly damaged, and ten minutes later, as he was exhorting his men to greater efforts, a cannonball struck the rail where Captain Courtenay and Royal Marine Lieutenant James Butler were standing. Butler was killed instantly and Courtenay fell to the deck unresponsive, possibly killed. Believing his commander to be dead, Lieutenant John Edwards assumed command and had the bodies thrown overboard {{in an effort to}} prevent his sailors losing morale from the death of their captain. Boston continued to suffer under the heavier guns of the French ship and by 06:40 the mizzen mast was close to collapse and much of the remaining rigging had been shot away. Casualties mounted, with Lieutenant Edwards and Lieutenant Alexander Kerr both badly wounded, the latter blinded in one eye and the former struck on the head and briefly rendered unconscious.|$|E
5|$|In October 2007, Moore {{formed a}} tag team with Yang, {{with the two}} {{defeating}} Deuce 'n Domino. They later competed in a tag team battle royal {{to determine the number}} one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship on the November 9 episode of SmackDown, but were the second team eliminated. In December, Moore and Yang challenged John Morrison and The Miz for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful, igniting a feud between the two teams. The following week on ECW, Moore and Yang defeated Morrison and The Miz in a non-title match, to earn a rematch for the championship. On January 1, 2008, Moore and Wang Yang once again beat Morrison and the Miz, this time in a six-person tag team match also involving Layla and Kelly Kelly. The following week, in a <b>Fifteen</b> <b>Minutes</b> <b>of</b> Fame Match, Moore and Wang Yang tied the champions on pinfalls, meaning Miz and Morrison retained the championship. Throughout late January and February, Moore and Yang moved into a feud with Deuce 'n Domino, defeating them two weeks in a row. On the February 15 episode of SmackDown, Moore, Yang, and Jesse and Festus defeated Deuce 'n Domino and Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder in an eight-man tag team match on SmackDown. In April, Moore and Yang reignited their feud with Morrison and The Miz, losing to them twice in tag team encounters. Yang and Moore went on to win singles matches against Morrison and The Miz respectively, earning another match for the WWE Tag Team Championship on the May 2 episode of SmackDown, but were unsuccessful once again.|$|E

25|$|Merchant sailors {{were trained}} {{and used to}} man the {{anti-aircraft}} gun, it fired continually throughout the battle though it misfired a few times because of old ammunition. In <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> fighting the Stanvac Calcutta was struck {{several times in the}} bridge and elsewhere, killing Captain Karlsson and a few other men. After hitting the Stier the guards manning the 4-inch gun were reported to have been encouraged and continued firing accurately until shrapnel damaged their weapon. The sights were destroyed but the Americans continued shooting until the ammunition on deck was exhausted. At this time Ensign Anderson ordered two men to retrieve more ammunition from below deck though as soon as they left, Captain Gerlach maneuvered his ship for a torpedo attack. When lined up, Stier fired one torpedo and it dove into the water and headed straight for Stanvac Calcutta where it detonated on the port side. Water began flowing in and the vessel started listing. A number of additional men were killed in the torpedo explosion and when {{it was clear that the}} American ship could not be saved, Ensign Anderson ordered the survivors to abandon ship and he began to lower life rafts.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen {{minutes to an hour}} of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do {{can mean the difference between}} a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Dr. David R. Williams (NASA {{archivist}} at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 {{flight director}} Eugene F. Kranz both {{acknowledged that the}} Apollo 11 telemetry data tapes are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed. The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a slow-scan television (SSTV) camera (see Apollo TV camera). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a scan conversion had to be done. The radio telescope at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon {{at the time of}} the Apollo 11 moonwalk. Parkes had a bigger antenna than NASA's antenna in Australia at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, so it received a better picture. It also received a better picture than NASA's antenna at Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this tape that is missing. A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> it were filmed by an amateur 8 mm film camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes from the ALSEP scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.|$|E
