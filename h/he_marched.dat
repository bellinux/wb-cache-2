5|$|In spring 333 BC, Alexander {{crossed the}} Taurus into Cilicia. After {{a long pause}} due to illness, <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius' {{significantly}} larger army, <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure. He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's legacy {{extended}} beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas {{to the east}} were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which <b>he</b> <b>marched,</b> while the Greeks themselves {{got a sense of}} belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus {{intervened in}} a {{conflict}} between Wladislaw I Herman, Duke of Poland, and the duke's illegitimate son, Zbigniew, on the latter's behalf. <b>He</b> <b>marched</b> to Poland and captured Wladislaw I Herman's younger son, Boleslav, in 1093. At Ladislaus's demand, Wladislaw I Herman declared Zbigniew his legitimate son. The Illuminated Chronicle also mentions that the Hungarian troops captured Cracow during Ladislaus's campaign, but the credibility of this report has been questioned.|$|E

5|$|Manuel {{responded to}} this outrage in a {{characteristically}} energetic way. In the winter of 1158–59, <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> to Cilicia {{at the head of}} a huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the Armenian Thoros of Cilicia, who had participated in the attack on Cyprus. Thoros fled into the mountains, and Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel.|$|E
5|$|Octavian also {{demanded that}} the decree should be {{rescinded}} which declared Antony a public enemy. When this was refused, <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> on the city with eight legions. He encountered no military opposition in Rome, and on 19 August 43BC was elected consul with his relative Quintus Pedius as co-consul. Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, another leading Caesarian.|$|E
5|$|The conquistadors were {{accompanied}} by a great many indigenous allies. These included Tlaxcaltecs, Mexicas, Cholutecs, Xochimilcos, Texcocanos, and Huejotzincas that accompanied Pedro de Alvarado from central Mexico, Zapotecs and Mixtecs that joined him as <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> south towards Guatemala and El Salvador, and Kaqchikels that joined him in Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{hearing of}} the Roman {{alliance}} with Aetolia, Philip's first action was to secure his northern borders. He conducted raids in Illyria at Oricum and Apollonia and seized the frontier town of Sintia in Dardania or perhaps Paionia. <b>He</b> <b>marched</b> rapidly south through Pelagonia, Lyncestis and Bottiaea and on to Tempe which he garrisoned with 4000 men. He turned north again into Thrace, attacking the Maedi and their chief city Iamphorynna before returning to Macedon.|$|E
5|$|Around 212AD, {{soon after}} Vologases VI of Parthia (r. c.208–222AD) took the throne, his brother Artabanus V of Parthia (d.224AD) rebelled {{against him and}} gained control over a greater part of the empire. Meanwhile, the Roman emperor Caracalla (r.211–217AD) deposed the kings of Osroene and Armenia to make them Roman provinces once more. <b>He</b> <b>marched</b> into Mesopotamia under the pretext of marrying one of Artabanus' daughters, but—because the {{marriage}} was not allowed—made war on Parthia and conquered Arbil east of the Tigris river.|$|E
5|$|Bajkam's {{unexpected}} death {{created a}} power vacuum in Baghdad, with disagreements between Daylamite and Turkish forces prompting the former {{to join the}} defeated al-Baridi. With their assistance, <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> on Wasit and Baghdad, capturing them, but was soon forced to flee due to the disorder that followed his usurpation of power. A Daylamite chief named Kurankij replaced him as de facto ruler of Baghdad, but he imposed tyrannical rule, and al-Muttaqi appealed to the former amir al-umara Ibn Ra'iq for assistance.|$|E

5|$|Basil II was at {{that time}} in the eastern provinces of his empire, {{wintering}} on the plain of Tarsus following his campaign against the Fatimid dynasty in Syria. On hearing of David’s death <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> north-eastward to claim the lands David had promised to the emperor. The local Georgian and Armenian nobility submitted without any serious resistance. The only notable incident occurred when a quarrel between a Georgian soldier and a Varangian Guardsman over a bale of hay developed into a major fight, involving 6,000 Varangians and taking the lives of thirty Georgian high-ranking nobles.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{began with}} an army of 13,000 men; 1,500 were {{reported}} missing, 1,200 died in combat, and thousands perished from disease—mostly bubonic plague. He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre, so <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> his army back to Egypt in May. To speed up the retreat, Bonaparte ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium; the number who died remains disputed, ranging {{from a low of}} 30 to a high of 580. He also brought out 1,000 wounded men. Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir.|$|E
5|$|Edward and {{his allies}} amongst the Welsh princes soon began to quarrel, and in early 1282 {{rebellion}} broke out, led by Llwelyn's brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd. Edward responded to the revolt by mobilising a royal army of 8,000 foot soldiers and 750 cavalry, which <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> north to Rhuddlan, while in South and mid-Wales Marcher Lord forces advanced from Carmarthen and Montgomery. Edward then mounted a naval invasion of the Isle of Anglesey and formed a temporary bridge to cross over onto the mainland, taking the war into the Welsh heartlands of Snowdonia. Llywelyn was killed that December, and in early 1283 Dafydd was captured and executed.|$|E

5|$|Huger, {{worried about}} clashing with Union forces while marching towards Malvern Hill, had {{also failed to}} manage his {{division}} effectively. He deployed two of his brigades, commanded by Brig. Gens. Lewis Armistead and Ambrose Wright, to perform a flanking maneuver around any Federals they found, to avoid the Union threat. Longstreet eventually notified Huger {{that he would be}} unobstructed by Federal forces if <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> to Malvern Hill. Huger, however, remained in place until someone from Lee's headquarters came to guide them to the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|In 1639 William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, {{came out}} {{in support of the}} Covenanters, a Presbyterian {{movement}} who opposed the established Episcopal Church and the changes which Charles I was attempting to impose. With James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> against the Catholic James Gordon, 2nd Viscount Aboyne, Earl of Huntly, and defeated an attempt by the Royalists to seize Stonehaven. However, when Montrose changed sides to the Royalists and marched north, Marischal remained in Dunnottar, even when given command of the area by Parliament, and even when Montrose burned Stonehaven.|$|E
5|$|In {{early spring}} AD 15, Germanicus crossed the Rhine and struck the Chatti. He sacked their capital Mattium (modern Maden near Gudensberg), pillaged their countryside, then {{returned}} to the Rhine. Sometime this year, he received word from Segestes, who was held prisoner by Arminius' forces and needed help. Germanicus' troops released Segestes and took his pregnant daughter, Arminius' wife Thusnelda, into captivity. Again <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> back victorious and at the direction of Tiberius, accepted the title of Imperator.|$|E

5|$|Lucullus was {{astonished}} upon hearing {{this in the}} year 70, {{and he began to}} prepare for an immediate invasion of Armenia. Although he had no mandate from the Senate to authorize such a move, he attempted to justify his invasion by distinguishing as his enemy king Tigranes and not his subjects. In the summer of 69, <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> his troops across Cappodocia and the Euphrates river and entered the Armenian province of Tsop'k', where Tigranocerta was located.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 1896, Chauvel {{transferred}} to the Queensland Permanent Military Forces with the rank of captain in the Moreton Regiment. He {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom with the Queensland contingent for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Sporting the emu feathers worn by Queensland units, <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> with the colonial troops through London behind Lord Roberts on 21 June 1897. Chauvel qualified at the School of Musketry at Hythe, Kent, and served on exchange with the 3rd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps and 2nd Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment at Aldershot. On returning to Australia, he became a staff officer at Headquarters, Queensland Defence Force.|$|E
5|$|Soult rapidly {{gathered}} a new army from the French forces in Andalusia and, joining {{with the troops}} retreating before Beresford, <b>he</b> <b>marched</b> to relieve the siege. With intelligence of another approaching force—a Spanish army under Gen. Joaquín Blake—he planned to turn Beresford's flank and interpose his army between the two. However, Soult was again acting on outdated information; unknown to the Marshal, the Spaniards had already linked up with the Anglo-Portuguese corps, and his 24,000 troops now faced a combined Allied army 35,000 strong.|$|E
