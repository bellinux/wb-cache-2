We present several independent experimental lines of evidence that the phenotypic abnormalities associated with xKaiso-depleted Xenopus laevis embryos are independent of the putative CTGCNA-dependent DNA-binding function of xKaiso. Our analysis suggests that xKaiso does not {{play a role in}} the regulation of either xWnt 11 or Siamois, key signalling molecules in the Wnt pathway during X. laevis gastrulation. The major phenotypic defects associated with xKaiso depletion are premature transcription activation before the mid-blastula transition and concomitant activation of a p 53 -dependent cell-death pathway...|$|E
40|$|How animals {{establish}} and pattern the primary body axis {{is one of}} the most fundamental problems in biology. Data from diverse deuterostomes (<b>frog,</b> <b>fish,</b> mouse, and amphioxus) and from planarians (protostomes) suggest that Wnt signaling through β-catenin controls posterior identity during body plan formation in most bilaterally symmetric animals. Wnt signaling also influences primary axis polarity of pre-bilaterian animals, indicating that an axial patterning role for Wnt signaling predates the evolution of bilaterally symmetric animals. The use of posterior Wnt signaling and anterior Wnt inhibition might be a unifying principle of body plan development in most animals. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

40|$|A post-transcriptional {{regulatory}} protein, termed iron regulatory factor (IRF), {{that binds}} {{specifically to the}} iron-responsive elements of ferritin and transferrin receptor mRNA, has recently been identified in the cytoplasm of human and mouse cells. Activation of this factor by low intracellular iron levels leads to inhibition of ferritin translation and an increase of TR mRNA stability. To investigate whether these feedback regulatory mechanisms are conserved during evolution, we analysed cytoplasmic extracts from 12 different species for a specific IRE-binding activity. We found mRNA-binding proteins in chicken, <b>frog,</b> <b>fish</b> and fly, which are equivalent to human and mouse IRF in gel-retardation assays with radiolabeled RNA transcripts. Competition experiments, molecular weight determinations, and modulation of the mRNA-binding activity in response to intracellular iron levels or reduction by beta-mercaptoethanol indicate that IRF has similar structural and functional properties in these different species...|$|E
40|$|Since {{packaging}} of DNA in the chromatin structure {{restricts the}} accessibility for regulatory factors, chromatin remodeling {{is required to}} facilitate nuclear processes such as gene transcription, replication, and genome recombination. Many conserved non-enzymatic protein domains have been identified {{that contribute to the}} activities of multi-protein remodeling complexes. Here we identified a novel conserved protein domain in Eukaryota whose putative function may be in regu-lating chromatin remodeling. Since this domain is associated with a known SANT domain in several vertebrate proteins, we named it the SANTA (SANT Associated) domain. Sequence analysis showed that the SANTA domain is approximately a 90 amino acid module and likely composed of four central b-sheets and three flanking a-helices. Many hydrophobic residues exhibited high conservation along the domain, implying a possible function in protein–protein interactions. The SANTA domain was identified in mammals, chicken, <b>frog,</b> <b>fish,</b> sea squirt, sea urchin, worms and plants. Furthermore, a phylogenetic tree of SANTA domains showed that one plant-specific duplication event happened in the Viridiplantae lineage. Contact...|$|E
40|$|The Bv 8 /Prokineticins (PKs) are a {{new family}} of {{peptides}} identified in <b>frog,</b> <b>fish,</b> reptiles and mammals that signal through two highly homologous G-protein coupled receptors, PKR 1 and PKR 2.

Over the past few years, several biological functions of Bv 8 /PK proteins have been elucidated. This review considers all the published data on the action and physiological role of this new biological system implicated in angiogenesis and neurogenesis, in reproduction and cancer and in regulating physiological functions that underly circadian rhythms, such as the sleep/wake cycle, hormone secretion and ingestive behaviors. The high expression level of human Bv 8 /PK 2 in bone marrow, lymphoid organs and leukocytes suggested an involvement of these peptides in hematopoiesis and in inflammatory and immunomodulatory processes.

40|$|AbstractThe T-box {{transcription}} factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) has {{been implicated in}} patterning and morphogenesis in <b>frog,</b> <b>fish</b> and mouse. In zebrafish, {{one of the two}} Eomes homologs, Eomesa, has been implicated in dorsal-ventral patterning, epiboly and endoderm specification in experiments employing over-expression, dominant-negative constructs and antisense morpholino oligonucleotides. Here we report {{for the first time the}} identification and characterization of an Eomesa mutant generated by TILLING. We find that Eomesa has a strictly maternal role in the initiation of epiboly, which involves doming of the yolk cell up into the overlying blastoderm. By contrast, epiboly progression is normal, demonstrating for the first time that epiboly initiation is genetically separable from progression. The yolk cell microtubules, which are required for epiboly, are defective in maternal-zygotic eomesa mutant embryos. In addition, the deep cells of the blastoderm are more tightly packed and exhibit more bleb-like protrusions than cells in control embryos. We postulate that the doming delay may be the consequence both of overly stabilized yolk cell microtubules and defects in the adhesive properties or motility of deep cells. We also show that Eomesa is required for normal expression of the endoderm markers sox 32, bon and og 9 x; however it is not essential for endoderm formation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe winged-helix {{transcription}} factor HNF 3 β/FoxA 2 {{is expressed in}} embryonic organizing centers of the gastrulating mouse, <b>frog,</b> <b>fish,</b> and chick. In the mouse, HNF 3 β {{is required for the}} formation of the mammalian node and notochord, and can induce ectopic floor plate formation when misexpressed in the developing neural tube; HNF 3 β expression in the extraembryonic endoderm is also necessary for the proper morphogenesis of the mammalian primitive streak. In the frog Xenopus laevis, several lines of evidence suggest that the related winged-helix factor Pintallavis functions as the ortholog of mammalian HNF 3 β in both axial mesoderm and neurectoderm; the role of Xenopus HNF 3 β itself, however, has not been clearly defined, and {{is the subject of this}} study. HNF 3 β is widely expressed in the vegetal pole but, as previously suggested, is excluded from the gastrula-stage mesoderm. We find that expression of an HNF 3 β-Engrailed repressor fusion protein induces ectopic axes and inhibits head formation in Xenopus embryos, while ectopic HNF 3 β inhibits mesoderm and anterior endoderm formation in explant assays and in vivo. Our studies suggest that HNF 3 β target genes function to limit the extent of mesoderm formation in the Xenopus gastrula, and point to related roles for Xenopus HNF 3 β and the extraembryonic component of mammalian HNF 3 β during vertebrate gastrulation...|$|E
40|$|Type III {{iodothyronine}} deiodinase (D 3) catalyzes {{the inner}} ring deiodination (IRD) of T 4 and T 3 to the inactive metabolites rT 3 and 3, 3 �-diiodothyronine (3, 3 �-T 2), respectively. Here {{we describe the}} cloning and characterization of complementary DNA (cDNA) coding for D 3 in fish (Oreochromis niloticus, tilapia). This cDNA contains 1478 nucleotides and codes for a protein of 267 amino acids, including a putative selenocysteine (Sec) residue, encoded by a TGA triplet, at position 131. The deduced amino acid sequence shows 57 – 67 % identity with frog, chicken, and mammalian D 3, 33 – 39 % identity with <b>frog,</b> <b>fish</b> (Fundulus heteroclitus) and mammalian D 2, and 30 – 35 % identity with fish (tilapia), chicken, and mammalian D 1. The 3 � UTR contains a putative Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element. Recombinant tilapia D 3 (tD 3) expressed in COS- 1 cells and native tD 3 in tilapia brain microsomes show identical catalytic activities, with a strong preference for IRD of T 3 (K m � 20 nM). IRD of [3, 5 - 125 I]T 3 by native and recombinant tD 3 are equally sensitive to inhibition by substrate analogs (T 3 � T 4 � � rT 3) and inhibitors (gold thioglucose �� iodoacetate � propylthiouracil). Northern analysis using a tD 3 riboprobe shows high expression of a 1. 6 -kb messenger RNA in gill and brain, although D 3 activity is much higher in brain than in gill. The characterization of tD 3 cDNA provides new information about the structure-activity relationship of iodothyronine deiodinases and an important tool to study the regulation of thyroid hormone bioactivity in fish.

The high expression level of human Bv 8 /PK 2 in bone marrow, lymphoid organs and leukocytes suggested an involvement of these peptides in hematopoiesis and in inflammatory and immunomodulatory processes. Neutrophils are the main endogenous source of Bv 8 /PK 2, while G-CSF is the the only cytokine able to activate PK 2 expression in neutrophiles. Moreover G-CSF derived pain seems to be stronlgly related to blood levels of Bv 8 /PK. According to these results, we started a clinical experimental trial in order to explore role and expression of Bv 8 /PK proteins in patients treated with chemotherapy for early breast cancer and receiving G-CSF (filgrastim vs peg-filgrastim), investigating also the relationship with G-CSF related pain. Methods: 20 BC pts were submitted to adjuvant FEC 100. G-CSF was given as primary prophylaxis. 12 pts received Lenograstim (L: 5 doses, beginning 96 hours after CT) while 8 pts received Pegfilgrastim (P: 1 dose 24 hours after CT). Real-Time PCR and Elisa test were used to analyze Bv 8 /PK 2 expression both in pts receiving L and P.
