25|$|Unlike in {{the past}} there are many types of lutes {{encountered}} today: 5-course medieval lutes, renaissance lutes of 6 to 10 courses in many pitches for solo and ensemble performance of Renaissance works, the archlute of Baroque works, 11-course lutes in d-minor tuning for 17th-century French, German and Czech music, 13/14-course d-minor tuned <b>German</b> Baroque <b>Lutes</b> for later High Baroque and Classical music, theorbo for basso continuo parts in Baroque ensembles, gallichons/mandoras, bandoras, orpharions and others.|$|R
25|$|It {{is related}} to the liuto attiorbato, the French , the archlute, the <b>German</b> baroque <b>lute,</b> and the angélique or angelica. A theorbo differs from a regular lute in that the theorbo has a much longer neck which extends beyond the regular fingerboard/neck and a second pegbox {{at the end of the}} {{extended}} neck. Low-register bass strings are added on the extended neck. This gives a theorbo a much wider range of pitches (notes) than a regular lute. The theorbo was used during the Baroque music era (1600-1750) to play basso continuo accompaniment parts (as part of the basso continuo group, which often included harpsichord, pipe organ and bass instruments), and a solo instrument.|$|R
5000|$|A lute guitar or <b>German</b> <b>lute</b> (Gitarrenlaute, Deutsche Laute or Wandervogellaute, less {{commonly}} a lutar (modern Turkish), gui-lute or gittar) is a stringed musical instrument, {{common in}} Germany from around 1850. The instrument has a regular six-stringed guitar setup on a lute bowl, however {{there are many}} theorboed variants with up to 11 strings. (see de:Deutsche Basslaute) ...|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the most}} famous English composers of the seventeenth century wrote pieces for the lyra viol, or even entire anthologies. These composers include John Cooper, John Jenkins, Christopher Simpson, Charles Coleman, and William Lawes. The types of pieces written for the {{instrument}} range from single melodic lines, to lyra trios and duets, lyra with other instruments, and lyra as accompaniment for a song. Almost all music for the lyra viol is written in tablature, mainly French lute tablature, but also some Italian {{and a little bit of}} <b>German</b> <b>lute</b> tablature.|$|E
50|$|Matthäus Waissel (c.1540—1602). German lutenist, {{editor of}} music and writer. Waissel was from 1573 {{headmaster}} of a school at Schippenbeil near Königsberg; he published in that year a volume of lute arrangements of vocal pieces, and in 1592 he issued a collection of German dances for lute, which signaled the decline of <b>German</b> <b>lute</b> tablature as it yielded prominence to the so-called French system. Waissel's output comprises three books of solo lute music in all, and one collection of duets. It is unlikely though {{that any of the}} pieces in these collections are his own compositions. Waissel's chief importance arguably lies in his expansion of the passamezzo/saltarello pairing into full suites that in form, if not title, comprise some of the earliest true dance suites.|$|E
50|$|Tabulaturen etlicher lobgesang is the {{earliest}} extensive source of <b>German</b> <b>lute</b> music and {{also one of}} {{the earliest}} published collections of lute music known. There are fifteen lute pieces, twelve of which are duets for voice and lute. The pieces are organized by difficulty, which reflects the didactic aspect of Tabulaturen. Curiously, Schlick does not include performing instructions, which are commonplace in most later German publications, and furthermore, no texts are included, although most can be found in contemporary sources - there are just three songs unique to Tabulaturen (Mein lieb ist weg, Philips zwolffpot and All Ding mit radt). Almost all songs are settings of German polyphonic Lieder on secular texts. There are two exceptions. The first, Metzkin Isaack, may be of Netherlandish origin, and {{there is a possibility that}} Schlick learned the piece from Petrucci's Harmonice Musices Odhecaton. This would imply that Schlick borrowed the idea to apply for an imperial privilege for Spiegel and Tabulaturen from Petrucci. The second exception is All Ding mit radt, which is different from every other piece in Tabulaturen: it relies not on the phrase structure of the song, like other settings, but rather on motivic and harmonic principles. Also, unlike other lute settings, it does not use bar form.|$|E
40|$|In {{part because}} of the {{complexities}} of the German tablature system, lute music preserved in manuscripts from German-speaking regions has been much less studied than music from sources notated in French or Italian tablature. This thesis provides editions and analysis of music from three important German manuscripts of the sixteenth century: M 6983, stored in the University Library in Lodz, Poland; F. IX. 70, kept in the Öffentliche Bibliothek der Universität in Basel, Switzerland; and G. 1. 4, stored in the Württembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart, Germany. This is the first transcription, edition, and analysis of this music. The thesis shows relationships between these three manuscipts and other sources of the period through comparison with other German and European manuscripts and prints. More detailed analysis of selected forms – Passamezzi; free forms such as the Prelude, Intrada and Fantasia; and intabulations – provided a method for selecting material for edition as well as for further comparisons with better known sources from elsewhere in Europe. I also consider instructions on playing the lute, included in many German sources, comparing them to the pedagogical texts in the selected manuscripts. The main goal of this work is to shed considerable new light on manucripts that have never been studied in detail, providing new knowledge about their notation, contents, and possible users. In addition to insights on the individual sources, by studying more than one source from the region, I can advance secure hypotheses about the cultivation of the lute in a defined geographical and linguistic area. Finally, by looking more closely at the <b>German</b> <b>lute</b> tablature system, from the perspective both of research and of performance, the significance of this music can be shared with the wider community including lute players familiar with French, English, Italian, and Spanish repertory. Examination of the three selected manuscripts shall show their place in the history of Renaissance music...|$|E
