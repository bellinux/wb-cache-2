6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] he {{answered}} lightly, [...] "you {{are not even}} scratched. They are clumsy conspirators there. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are a match for them. Come along!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well said!" [...] cried Mr. Jarndyce. [...] "That's well said! She remains here, in {{her home}} with me.

I'm tired of having a farm on my own hands--nothing is made the best of in such cases, as you know. A satisfactory bailiff is hard to find; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I, Poyser, and your excellent wife here, can enter into a little arrangement in consequence, which will be to our mutual advantage." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{seized upon}} this allusion to say: [...] "I {{did not think}} of {{including}} Mr. Clarke, Mrs. Lambert. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> your daughter have both had too much of him. I do not doubt his sincerity, but I am quite certain that he was leading you both into an abyss. I hope you will make the most of this chance to free yourself from his influence.

It is filled with saffron, poppies, and other soothing plants; so lay your little head on it to-night, sleep sweetly without a dream, and wake to-morrow without a pain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My business, ma'am, is {{of a very}} {{delicate}} nature--of a nature {{very delicate}} indeed. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> who understand the world, may soon come to understand each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suits me, forsooth! Yes; he has {{pretended to}} make my {{opinions}} and tastes his own. He has humoured me for good reasons. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Polly, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will bid him good-by." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{overpowered}} when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>you</b> <b>and</b> your hospitable home. No {{words could}} speak language suited to my heart. I refrain. God reward {{you with the}} same measure you have meted with! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; but I shall {{write to}} him at once, and lay the case before him. Indeed, I must hurry away now, for I have many matters to attend to. You, ladies, have been kindly helping me with your labours, I see,' {{continued}} Mr. Tryan, politely, glancing at the canvass-covered books as he rose from his seat. Then, turning to Mary Linnet: 'Our library is really getting on, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> <b>and</b> your sister have quite a heavy task of distribution now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ask {{one of them}} {{to change}} sides. That leaves two places vacant, and as I make a point of paying for two, we get on comfortably enough.
