We extend existing methodology in three ways to demonstrate how additional factors affect the value of screening investments. We examine the effect that screening has in discouraging terrorists. We model multiple levels of screening. Finally, we consider additional objectives beyond cost. We find that the conclusion about screening depends on key inputs to the probability model (reflecting uncertainties) and to the value function (reflecting the stakeholders’ fundamental objectives) ...|$|E

40|$|Radioactive {{sources are}} being {{incorporated}} into the world’s scrap metal supply. In order to prevent this unwanted radioactive material from entering metal processing sites, some facilities have voluntarily <b>installed</b> <b>radiation</b> monitoring devices {{at the entrance to}} their facilities (Figure 1). However, this monitoring does not guarantee that all radioactive sources will be detected in scrap metal loads. Shielding of the sources by the metal scrap, location of the source within the scrap load and the location and sensitivity of the monitoring system will determine if the source is detected. To date, there have been 83 meltings of radioactive sources in metal processing facilities (1), with site cleanups averaging $ 12 – 15 million (1). One facility, the site of a melted a radiation source, has incurred cleanup costs in excess of $ 26 million (1). The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in a cooperative partnership with the scrap metal industry, developed a CD ROM based training program to provide a protocol for response to facility radiation alarms (2). This training enables site workers to identify and properly manage radioactive sources after they have been detected in the scrap metal supply. In order to prevent these sources from becoming uncontrolled, it is necessary to identify and manage these radioactive sources before they get placed in the scrap metal supply. A CD ROM based training program entitled “Identifying Radioactive Sources at the Demolition Site ” is designed to address this problem and help the demolition industry secure radioactive gauges and devices at their point of installation...|$|E

40|$|Trafficking of {{radioactive}} material, particularly {{special nuclear material}} (SNM), {{has long been a}} worldwide concern. To interdict this material the US government has <b>installed</b> <b>radiation</b> portal monitors (RPMs) around the globe. Building materials surrounding an RPM can greatly effect the detector?s background radiation levels due to Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM). In some cases this effect is so great that the initial RPM setup had to be rebuilt. This thesis develops a methodology for quick and efficient determination of the specific activity and composition of building materials surrounding a RPM to predict background levels, therefore determining the minimum detectable quantity (MDQ) of material. This methodology builds on previous work by Ryan et al by generating material and source cards for a detailed Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) deck, based on an experimental RPM setup to predict the overall gamma background at a site. Gamma spectra were acquired from samples of building materials and analyzed to determine the specific activity of the samples. A code was developed to estimate the elemental composition of building materials using the gamma transmission of the samples. These results were compared to previous Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) on the same samples. It was determined that densitometry provided an elemental approximation within 5 % of that found through NAA. Using the specific activity and material composition, an MCNP deck was used to predict the gamma background levels in the detectors of a typical RPM. These results were compared against actual measurements at the RPM site, and shown to be within 10 % of each other...|$|E

An investigation was performed {{to look at a}} method to develop easy to use field survey measurements to assist decision makers in the process of deriving public protective actions. This method could be used at a nuclear power plant if certain accident conditions are known. International values for operational intervention levels (OIL’s) do exist and are recommended to be employed if station specific data has not been derived. No values exist specific to Koeberg Nuclear Power Station and as a result, this became an ideal opportunity to derive station specific values. It was firstly necessary to decide on a specific accident type and hence an applicable accident release fraction. A suitable accident software dispersion code was applied to calculate the organ doses for the selected accident type. It was also decided to use two different wind dispersion criteria to further refine the results. Due to the complexities of dose distribution within the body it was also necessary to look at the gamma dose in isolation as this would be the measurement radiation type utilised as a limit in the field either using <b>installed</b> <b>radiation</b> monitors or by physical measurement performed by station Radiation Protection staff. Comparisons were done with thyroid and lung dose versus gamma dose to arrive at ratios for this specific accident type.

40|$|The DLR Institute of Space Systems in Bremen {{has built}} a new {{facility}} to study the behavior of materials under complex irradiation and to estimate their degradation in a space environment. It is named Complex Irradiation Facility (CIF). CIF allows simultaneously irradiating samples with three light sources for the simulation of the spectrum of solar electromagnetic radiation. The light sources are a solar simulator with a Xe-lamp (wavelength range 300 - 1200 nm), a deuterium-UV-source (112 - 200 nm), and an Argon-gas-jet-VUV-simulator. The latter allows irradiating samples with shorter wavelengths below the limitation of any window material. The VUV-simulator has been validated at the PTB (Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt) in Berlin by calibration that uses synchrotron radiation in the wavelength range between 40 and 400 nm. Beside the different light sources CIF provides also electron and proton sources. Electrons and protons are generated in a low energy range from 1 to 10 keV with currents from 1 to 100 nA and in a higher range from 10 to 100 keV with 0. 1 to 100 µA. Both particle sources can be operated simultaneously. In order to model temperature variations as appear in free space, the sample can be cooled down to liquid Nitrogen and heated up to about 450 K during irradiation. The complete facility has been manufactured in UHV-technology with metal sealing. It is free of organic compounds to avoid self-contamination.

40|$|The boiler {{flue gas}} furnace exit {{temperature}} (FET) {{is a key}} operating parameter of coal fired steam boilers. From the design perspective, the FET is vital for materials selection and sizing of heat transfer surfaces. From an operating perspective, {{it is a major}} indicator of the rate of combustion and heat transfer that is occurring within the furnace. Downstream of the furnace, the FET has a significant impact on both the performance and reliability of the boiler heat exchangers, which ultimately impacts on both boiler efficiency and availability. Monitoring of the FET can advise operating and engineering corrective actions which will ultimately result in better efficiency, reliability and availability together with the associated economic benefits. Therefore, methods of determining FET are investigated. Two methods are focused on for this study, one indirect and one direct. The indirect method studied is a mass and energy balance method which begins with a global boiler mass and energy balance to calculate the major boiler flow rates of coal, air and flue gas which are difficult to measure online. These parameters are then used as inputs into a furnace or backpass mass and energy balance to calculate the furnace exit temperature. The method is applied to a case study, and is evaluated in terms of the measurement uncertainties which are propagated on the intermediate parameters calculated, {{as well as on the}} final calculated FET. The main conclusions are that this indirect method contains various uncertainties, due to parameters which have to be assumed such as (i) the distribution of ingress air (also called tramp air) in the different sections of the boiler and (ii) the estimation of the share of water evaporation heat transfer occurring in the water walls of the furnace part of the boiler. The method is however still useful and can be easily applied to any boiler layout and can be used as a reference tool to verify other measurements. The direct method studied is acoustic pyrometry. The work specifically focuses on the sources of error in determining the temperature from the measurement of the time of flight of sound, the impact of particle concentration on the speed of sound through a gas-particle mixture, and the temperature profile reconstruction from acoustic time of flight measurements. A limited set of physical testing was also carried out using one acoustic generator and receiver to take measurements on a real coal power plant. As part of this physical testing, the detection of time of flight from acoustic signals was explored. Already <b>installed</b> <b>radiation</b> pyrometers were also used as a reference for interpreting the acoustic measurements. The indications are that the acoustic pyrometer provides a more representative temperature measurement than the radiation pyrometers. The uncertainty of the acoustic measurement for the same case study as the indirect method was determined and compared with the calculated result. While many aspects still need to be researched further, this initial study and experimental testing produced very promising results for future application of acoustic pyrometry for better monitoring of the coal combustion processes in power plant boilers...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} two stochastic network interdiction {{models for}} thwarting nuclear smuggling. In the first model, the smuggler travels through a transportation network {{on a path}} that maximizes the probability of evading detection, and the interdictor <b>installs</b> <b>radiation</b> sensors to minimize that evasion probability.

Our second model differs in that the interdictor and smuggler can have differing perceptions of these network parameters. This model captures the case in which the smuggler is aware of only a subset of the sensor locations. For both models, we develop the important special case in which the sensors can only be installed at border crossings of a single country so that the resulting model is defined on a bipartite network.

The structure is above ground, accessible from the top, and equipped with a retractable concrete roof. A second radiation concrete facility, with ground level access via a labyrinth, is also available for testing smaller cavities in 2 smaller dewars. The cryogenic transfer lines installation between the large vertical test dewar and the cryo plant's sub components is currently near completion. Controls and instrumentations wiring are also nearing completion. The Vertical Test Facility will allow onsite testing of SRF cavities with a maximum overall envelope of 0. 9 m diameter and 2. 1 m height in the large dewar and smaller SRF cavities and assemblies with a maximum overall envelope of 0. 66 m diameter and 1. 6 m height...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe in situ {{combination}} of Scanning Probe Microscopies (SPM) with X-ray microbeams adds {{a variety of}} new possibilities to the panoply of synchrotron radiation techniques. In this paper we describe an optics-free AFM/STM that can be directly <b>installed</b> on synchrotron <b>radiation</b> end stations for such combined experiments. The instrument can be used just for AFM imaging of the investigated sample or can be used for detection of photoemitted electrons with a sharp STM-like tip, thus leading to the local measure of the X-ray absorption signal. Alternatively one can can measure the flux of photon impinging on the sharpest part of the tip to locally map the pattern of beams diffracted from the sample. In this paper we eventually provide some examples of local detection of XAS and diffraction...|$|R
40|$|The {{harmful effects}} of carbon {{emissions}} and carbon dioxide caused by over dependence on oil is a global issue, which is currently being addressed by encouraging renewable energy (RE) resources contribution to the energy mix. Encouraging RE is important in order to solve the unsustainable nature of electricity generation especially in the sub-Saharan African countries. One of the REs that have vast potential especially in sub-Saharan Africa is the solar energy. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the solar photovoltaic (PV) developments in selected countries of sub-Saharan Africa – in terms of research, <b>installed</b> capacity, solar <b>radiation</b> level, RE policies and the percentage of solar PV in the future energy mix of these countries. Finally, this paper identified the barriers to RE deployment and proposed scaling-up solar PV as one of the solution in the development of energy mix in these countries...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} system for dose assessment was <b>installed</b> to evaluate <b>radiation</b> dose of each worker {{in a controlled}} area and to automatically produce reports on dose assessment. The main computer was connected to both a tritium monitor control computer and a gate control computer. This computer network has been isolated from a public network. The gate control computer registers data on working hours of each worker in the controlled area and on tritium concentration of each room. The dose assessment computer acquires essential data from the gate control computer to evaluate the radiation dose of each worker. The potential of the specialized network system to improve dose assessment was examined {{over a period of}} two years. It was found that this system significantly contributed to improvement of dose assessment. The basis of assessment was made clear, and reports on dose assessment without errors were readily produced...|$|R
40|$|The work {{proposed}} in this presentation {{builds on the}} foundation set by the DTRA funded demonstration project begun in 2000 and completed in December of 2003. This previous work consisted of two phases whose overall objective was to <b>install</b> portal <b>radiation</b> monitors at four select ports-of-entry in Uzbekistan (Tashkent International Airport, Gisht-Kuprik (Kazakhstan border), Alat (Turkmenistan border), and Termez (Afghanistan border)) in order to demonstrate their effectiveness in preventing the illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. The objectives also included developing and demonstrating capabilities in the design, installation, operation, training, and maintenance of a radiation portal monitoring system. The system and demonstration project has proved successful in many ways. An effective working relationship among the Uzbekistan Customs Services, Uzbekistan Border Guards, and Uzbekistan Institute of Nuclear Physics has been developed. There has been unprecedented openness with the sharing of portal monitor data with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The system {{has proved to be}} effective, with detection of illicit trafficking, and, at Alat, an arrest of three persons illegally transporting radioactive materials into Turkmenistan. The demonstration project has made Uzbekistan a model nonproliferation state in Central Asia and, with an expanded program, places them in a position to seal a likely transit route for illicit nuclear materials. These results will be described. In addition, this work is currently being expanded to include additional ports-of-entry in Uzbekistan. The process for deciding on which additional ports-of-entry to equip will also be described...|$|R
