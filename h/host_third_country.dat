40|$|An {{interesting}} empirical {{phenomenon is}} export-platform foreign-direct investment, particularly affiliate production {{for sale in}} <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> {{rather than in the}} parent or host countries. This is rather poorly understood because our theoretical understanding of multinationals is largely derived from two-country models. Our model shows how affiliate production solely for <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> can occur when a firm in each of two large, high-income countries has a domestic plant to serve its own market, and uses a plant in a small, low-cost country to serve the other highincome country. Third-country export-platform FDI can also occur when the <b>host</b> and <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> are inside a free-trade area and the parent is outside. Our empirical section shows that US affiliates located inside a free-trade area concentrate their exports to other free-trade member countries, consistent with parameterizations of our model in which the outside firm is the chief beneficiary of the free-trade area. Affiliates located outside of free-trade areas such as those in Southeast Asia show a balance between exports to the parent and exports to <b>third</b> <b>countries,</b> consistent with parameterizations that generate “global export-platform” production.

One of the distinguishing features of global organizations is to effectively manage global operations in a consistent manner {{but at the same}} time allow flexibility at the country level to effectively compete. Acquisition and sharing of tacit social knowledge necessary to work globally but with a contextual understanding of local markets require a unique set of management skills. The process of inpatriating <b>host</b> and <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals into the home country organization appears to hold significant potential in developing a pool of future global managers.

First, in a three-country model, these impacts are explained through the competition effect and the demand effect.

US temporary protection programs rest primarily on executive discretion and have not been substantially revisited for nearly 25 years. “Parole” represents the primary vehicle for temporarily admitting non-citizens for emergency and humanitarian reasons. 2 Prior to 1980, the United States used parole to admit large refugee and refugee-like populations to whom (in most cases) it later extended lawful permanent resident (LPR) status. The 1980 Refugee Act made the US refugee resettlement program the primary vehicle for refugee admissions, limited the use of parole to individuals (not groups), and created a presumption against granting parole to refugees...|$|R

Managerial resources for these jobs can be managers from the headquarters <b>country,</b> <b>host</b> and <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> International transfers can be for specific staffing needs, for management development and for organization development. The general hypothesis examined in this paper was the global scale MNEs would operate in a regio-or geocentric fashion with full integration of the world pool of managerial resources for all international transfers. Case studies were done on two North American and two European MNEs in the chemical and electronics industries. World-wide transfers and consequent career opportunities were found in all cases for managers from headquarters countries. Regional transfers and careers were possible for host and third-country managers in regio-centric MNEs, but only national careers were possible in a poly-centric MNE. Temporary transfers to world or regional headquarters for management development were found for host and third-country managers, but transfers for organization development were for headquarters nationals. No consistent differences in use of transfer or international careers were found between North American and European MNEs. © 1985 JIBS.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{draws attention}} to the large number of expatriates sent abroad by Chinese multinational corporations (CMNCs), especially to emerging markets. It is generally assumed that their large number, and any competitive advantage this generates, relate predominantly to their low cost, compared to other MNCs’ expatriates and/or locally available labour. Our research uses an integrative perspective drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), international human resource management (IHRM) and “country of origin” literature and extensive case-study research on 27 CMNCs in 12 emerging markets. This reveals that the competitive advantage created by Chinese expatriates is closely related to the use of expatriates at both managerial and operational levels. It is achieved through human resource management that exploits their relatively lower cost, higher productivity and hardship tolerance (compared to <b>host</b> or <b>third</b> <b>country</b> counterparts) and their knowledge/resource reconfiguration capability, through a centralised and collective expatriation management system. These together enhance CMNCs’ competitive advantage through not only offering cost effective and differentiated products but also transferring the reconfiguration knowledge. This study enhances understanding of the competitiveness of emerging market multinationals (EMNCs) by showing how the competencies, combination and management of their expatriates create a distinct source of competitive advantage. It also advances IHRM research on expatriates by investigating their use from a competitive advantage perspective...|$|R
40|$|The {{coexistence}} of the Member States as fully sovereign subjects {{of international law}} with the European Community has been an area of endless fascination for international and European Union lawyers alike. This has been spurred on {{by a number of}} judgments rendered by the European Court of Justice in the last four years: these range from the constraints imposed on Member States once the Commission has been authorized to negotiate international agreements, to the limited choice they have in the context of international conventions in which they participate along with the EC (Mox Plant), to the duties imposed on them in the context of international organizations to which the EC is not a signatory even though their scope falls within its competence (IMO). Another area where serious issues have been raised concerns the international obligations assumed by Member States prior to their accession to the EU.

Second, open borders might allow companies to migrate to “pollution havens,” thus undermining high environmental standards in <b>host</b> <b>countries.</b> <b>Third,</b> the dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization (WTO) might favor trade over environmental interests in case of conflict. It is shown that although trade liberalization can {{lead to an increase}} in environmental degradation, pollution havens are not a statistically significant phenomenon. As concerns aimed measures at domestic environmental protection, the dispute settlement system in the WTO is not biased against environmental interests. The relationship is more complicated with respect to measures aimed at extrajurisdictional environmental protection and with respect to trade restrictions for health reasons under the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} and the empirical literature regarding migration {{in order to}} cast some light upon the nature of self-selection. In particular it attempts to identify the specific factors which induce a skilled rather than an un-skilled migration. As a result, some conclusions upon the existence {{as well as the}} determinants of selective processes in migration will be offered. Three contributions of the theoretical literature can be highlighted: first, sending country characteristics vis-à-vis host country conditions create uneven incentives for different levels of abilities or education, and therefore create the ground for a selectivity process. Second, migration costs {{play a major role in}} determining the direction of the selectivity and <b>third,</b> <b>host</b> <b>country</b> migration policies as well as demand side considerations influence the direction of the selection. The empirical evidence shows that the direction of the selectivity in terms of educational level varies considerably across countries: in some cases the emigrant flow is mainly characterized by highly educated individuals, whereas in other, the emigration flow is predominantly made by low skilled individuals. On the contrary in terms of unobservable characteristics, the empirical literature reveals that either the movers are positively selected or they are not selected at all. ...|$|R
