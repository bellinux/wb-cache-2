5|$|In biochemistry, {{heavy metals}} are {{sometimes}} defined—on {{the basis of}} the Lewis acid (electronic pair acceptor) behaviour of their ions in aqueous solution—as class B and borderline metals. In this scheme, class A metal ions prefer oxygen donors; class B ions prefer nitrogen or sulfur donors; and borderline or ambivalent ions show either class A or B characteristics, depending on the circumstances. Class A metals, which tend to have low electronegativity and <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> with large ionic character, are the alkali and alkaline earths, aluminium, the group 3 metals, and the lanthanides and actinides. Class B metals, which tend to have higher electronegativity and <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> with considerable covalent character, are mainly the heavier transition and post-transition metals. Borderline metals largely comprise the lighter transition and post-transition metals (plus arsenic and antimony). The distinction between the class A metals and the other two categories is sharp. A frequently cited proposal to use these classification categories instead of the more evocative name heavy metal has not been widely adopted.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is {{an element}} in which the 5f {{electrons}} are the transition border between delocalized and localized; it is therefore {{considered one of the}} most complex elements. The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure. The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels. This leads to competing 5fn7s2 and 5fn−16d17s2 configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior. The highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{chemistry}} {{is similar to}} the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.|$|E

5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning {{people during the}} spring period, though {{it is unlikely that}} vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill rats and mice in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E
25|$|Although main group {{elements}} of the second period and beyond usually react by gaining, losing, or sharing electrons until they have achieved a valence shell electron configuration with a full octet of (8) electrons, other elements obey different rules. Hydrogen (H) can only <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> which share just two electrons, while transition metals often conform to a duodectet (12) rule (e.g., compounds such as the permanganate ion).|$|E
25|$|The {{striped hyena}} is easily tamed {{and can be}} fully trained, {{particularly}} when young. Although the Ancient Egyptians did not consider striped hyenas sacred, they supposedly tamed them for use in hunting. When raised with a firm hand, they may eventually become affectionate and as amenable as well trained dogs, though they emit a strong odour which no amount of bathing will cover. Although they kill dogs in the wild, striped hyenas raised in captivity can <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> with them.|$|E

25|$|Born into an upper-class {{household}} {{with strong}} political connections, Manet rejected the future originally envisioned for him, and became engrossed {{in the world}} of painting. His early masterworks, The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) and Olympia, both 1863, caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism. Today, these are considered watershed paintings that mark the start of modern art. The last 20 years of Manet's life saw him <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> with other great artists of the time, and develop his own style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters.|$|E
25|$|PGH2 has a 5-carbon ring bridged by {{molecular}} oxygen. Its derived PGS {{have lost}} this oxygen bridge and contain a single, unsaturated 5-carbon ring {{with the exception}} of thromboxane A2 which possesses a 6-member ring consisting of one oxygen and 5 carbon atoms. The 5-carbon ring of prostacyclin is conjoined to a second ring consisting of 4 carbon and one oxygen atom. And, the 5 member ring of the cyclopentenone prostaglandins possesses an unsaturated bond in a conjugated system with a carbonyl group that causes these PGs to <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> with a diverse range of bioactive proteins (for more see the diagrams at Prostanoid).|$|E
25|$|While {{hydrophobic}} polymers beneficially repel {{water and}} contribute to chewiness, they also detrimentally attract oil. The stickiness of gum results from this hydrophobic nature, as gum can <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> and stick when it makes contact with oily surfaces such as sidewalks, skin, hair, or the sole of one’s shoe. To make matters worse, unsticking the gum is a challenge because the long polymers of the gum base stretch, rather than break. The sticky characteristic of gum may be problematic during processing if the gum sticks to any machinery or packaging materials during processing, impeding the flow of product. Aside from ensuring that the machinery is free from lipid-based residues, this issue can be combatted by the conditioning and coating of gum {{toward the end of}} the process. By adding either a powder or a coating to the exterior of the gum product, the hydrophobic gum base binds to the added substance instead of various surfaces with which it may come in contact.|$|E

After over 3,000 {{individuals}} in the United Kingdom were unsuccessfully auditioned, American actors were chosen instead, including three who had previously worked with Cameron on The Terminator: Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and Michael Biehn. Actors who played marines were asked to read Starship Troopers and undergo military training, which included running, lifting weights, learning salutes, marches, deployments, and maneuvers, for two weeks. Cameron wanted the marines to train together {{so that they would}} <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> that would show on-screen. Sigourney Weaver, William Hope, and Paul Reiser were absent from training because of other obligations, but Cameron felt that this suited their characters as [...] "outsiders" [...] in the film.|$|E

500|$|... is a ninja {{who joins}} Team Kakashi in Part II, {{carefully}} designed by Kishimoto {{to stand out}} as Sasuke's replacement by having the two look similar. Having {{been a member of}} The Foundation since he was a child, Sai has been trained to not possess or desire any type of emotion or camaraderie, even after he killed his surrogate brother Shin under Danzo's diabolical orders. He consequently gives people labels based on their status, and his label of Sasuke as a traitor provokes Naruto and Sakura into antagonizing him. After the two discover his past and warm up to him, however, he begins to crave bonds with other people, which has since become his primary goal in the series. Sai's attempts to <b>form</b> <b>bonds</b> turn can be humorous as he tries giving pet names to others; however, he often says what he actually thinks of a person, resulting with him choosing names such as [...] "fatso" [...] for Choji and [...] "ugly" [...] for Sakura. He eventually learns from his mistakes and attempts the opposite approach by calling Ino [...] "beautiful", causing Ino to fall for him. When not making an attempt to bond with others, Sai spends his time painting and drawing, and has produced thousands of works, although he doesn't name any of them. His artistic talents extend to his choice of attacks in battles, being that he can infuse chakra with his inking brush to make his drawings come to life. In the series epilogue, Sai marries Ino Yamanaka and together they have a son, Inojin. Sai's voice actor is Satoshi Hino in the [...] anime, and his English voice actor is Benjamin Diskin except in Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Lucien Dodge.|$|E
