50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> have {{gradually}} displaced manual <b>hair</b> <b>clippers.</b> Today, <b>electric</b> <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> {{are used by}} {{the vast majority of}} barbers in industrialized countries.All of these companies offer <b>electric</b> <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> in differing grades from bargain consumer units to high-end professional units. Most consumer grade clippers are intended for personal use by individual consumers and are often sold in kits which include several accessories such as clipper guides (for adjusting the length of the cut). Professional units are intended for hair care professionals and often are sold without any accessories (which must be ordered separately). The quality difference between the consumer grade and professional grade electric clippers has narrowed significantly over the years. Today the primary difference between the two grades is usually added or enhanced insulating for internal electrical components to prevent the unit from heating up during periods of prolonged usage. Some companies, such as Conair and Andis, replace some plastic parts in consumer grade units with metal parts on their professional grade units to extend the durability and useful lifespan of the product. Some companies, such as Wahl Clipper, produce specialty clippers, such as the Trim n Vac, which are designed for ease of use at home.|$|R

While they were {{widely used in}} the distant past, the advent and reduction in cost of <b>electric</b> <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> has led to their largely replacing manual clippers. Some barbers in Western countries continue to use them for trimming. They are also used in the Russian army: when conscripts enter boot camp, they cut their hair close to the skin, sometimes using manual clippers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> work in {{the same}} way as manual ones, but are driven by an {{electric}} motor which makes the blades oscillate from side to side. They have gradually displaced manual <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> in many countries. Three different motor types are used in clipper production: magnetic, rotary and pivot. Rotary style may be driven by direct current or alternating current electricity source. Both magnetic and pivot style clippers use magnetic forces derived from winding copper wire around steel. Alternating current creates a cycle attracting and relaxing to a spring to create the speed and torque to drive the clipper cutter across the combing blade.|$|R

Leo continued to work on his inventions and by 1921, he patented his final design of an invention more than a decade in the making- the first <b>electric</b> <b>hair</b> <b>clipper.</b> Within a year, Wahl Manufacturing had manufactured and sold thousands of clippers all over the United States and in 1921 Leo renamed the company the Wahl Clipper Corporation.Leo J. Wahl died on May 20, 1957 with over 100 patent applications to his name. His descendants still operate the company today. Wahl Clipper is now an international industry leader in the manufacturing of products for the professional beauty and barber salon trade, consumer personal care and animal grooming. Wahl products are available in 165 countries around the world.By 1921, Mathew Andis Sr. entered the electric clipper industry. Production of these clippers began in the basement of his home, with help from Anna, his wife. Andis sold his electric clippers door to door and one year later established the Andis O M Manufacturing with John Oster and Henry Meltzer. After the three men parted ways, Mathew established Andis Clipper Company the following year. Today, Andis Company remains a family-held business.In 1928, the John Oster Manufacturing Company joined the electric clipper market. In 1960, the John Oster Manufacturing Co. was acquired by Sunbeam Corporation. Oster continues to manufacture clippers today but is also known for their kitchenware including but not limited to toasters, ovens, blenders, etc.Wahl Clipper, Andis Company and Oster Company all remain in business today and are highly successful in the clipper industry as are many other companies, such as Kim Laube & Co. Kim Laube & Co specializes in clippers powerful enough for the animal grooming industry, and is committed to keep their manufacturing in U.S.A.|$|E

Roberts and Michael Girardi Corresponding author ([michael. girardi@yale. edu](michael. girardi@yale. edu)) ### INTRODUCTION The {{induction}} of cutaneous carcinogenesis in mice by topical {{administration of}} chemicals enables the local, systemic, {{and environmental factors}} that influence tumor susceptibility, growth, and progression to be studied in the laboratory. Chemical carcinogenesis in mouse skin {{has been used for}} several decades, and continues to help in the identification of important molecular and immunological pathways involved in cutaneous malignancy. This protocol describes the two-stage application of chemicals to the skin for the initiation and promotion of cutaneous tumors. In the two-stage model of induction, a single application of the chemical initiator mutagen 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) is followed by repeated applications of a pro-inflammatory phorbol ester 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (TPA; otherwise known as phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate [PMA]). Resulting tumors may develop in the form of benign papillomas that regress or progress to SCC, or SCC may arise without an apparent precursor lesion. Thus, two-stage chemical carcinogenesis provides an opportunity to monitor early and late events in cancer development and progression. ### RELATED INFORMATION The two-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol includes an initiating application of DMBA which induces an irreversible and specific mutation in mouse skin: an A-to-T transversion in codon 61 (second nucleotide) of the oncogene Ha-ras (Fujiki et al. 1989). This application is followed by multiple, regular applications of the phorbol ester TPA. The initiation is typically given at a dose that is not sufficient to induce tumors, thus necessitating application of the TPA. For each experiment, it may be useful to titrate the doses of the initiator and promoter that best induce tumors in an acceptable range. Several examples of different regimens are given in Table 1. Several parameters should be considered when utilizing the two-stage protocol with regard to the dose of initiator and promoter: - Mouse strain susceptibility. For example, the FVB/n strain is particularly susceptible to two-stage chemical carcinogenesis, while the C 57 BL/ 6 strain is relatively resistant to tumor formation (Hennings et al. 1993; Elmets et al. 1998; Woodworth et al. 2004). For more information on strain susceptibility, see French et al. (1994), Daniel et al. (2003), Girardi et al. (2003), and Murphy et al. (2003). - The presence of a genetic mutation (Girardi et al. 2001, 2003; Daniel et al. 2003) or transgene (French et al. 1994; Daniel et al. 2003; Murphy et al. 2003). Mice genetically engineered to target tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, and/or immunologic activities may exhibit altered susceptibility to tumor formation. - Appropriate initiation and promotion doses. Varying the doses of the initiator or promotor chemicals may enhance or inhibit various components/effects of the protocol (e. g., susceptibility to papilloma formation and progression to carcinoma) (Hennings et al. 1993; Girardi et al. 2003). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (TPA, also commonly known as phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate [PMA]) - *For utilization as a topical tumor promoter, TPA may be dissolved in either ethanol (Girardi et al. 2001; Girardi et al. 2003; [[URL] or acetone (Hennings et al. 1993; Woodworth et al. 2004; Ridd et al. 2006). We dissolve TPA in benzene-free, 100 % ethanol (American Bioanalytical, AB 00515) at 25 mg per 100 mL (for a 0. 025 %, w/v solution). This is equivalent to 40 nmol per 100 -μL application. For the regimens listed in Table 1, dilute the 0. 025 % (w/v) TPA solution with ethanol to yield the appropriate concentration. Protect the 0. 025 % TPA stock solution from light, and store it at − 20 °C for up to 6 mo*. - 7, 12 -Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) (Sigma-Aldrich) - *Dissolve DMBA in acetone at 100 mg per 100 mL (0. 1 %, w/v). This is equivalent to 400 nmol per 100 -μL application. For the lower-dosage regimens listed in Table 1, dilute the 0. 1 % DMBA solution in acetone to yield the appropriate concentration. The 0. 1 % DMBA stock solution should be made fresh prior to each experiment, or stored at − 20 °C*. - Eosin - Formalin - Hematoxylin - Mice, 6 - or 7 -wk-old female - *We highly recommend using age-matched females for the experiments. Male mice may fight, causing damage to the dorsal skin. If experimental (e. g., genetically engineered) and control (e. g., wild-type) mice receive identical chemical applications, we advise mixing the groups throughout cages. Density of animals in cages should be determined according to institutional animal care guidelines*. ### Equipment 1. Calipers or other measuring device (e. g., Vernier calipers [Scienceware Bel-Art Products, Inc. ], digital calipers [Mitutoyo Corp. ], dermatologist ruler, or combo circle template [Staedtler, STD 977101] - Fine electric shaver (e. g., Braun 3612 or Braun 3615 InterFace) - Handheld electric hair clippers or trimmer (e. g., Oster A 5 [Oster Professional Products] or Panasonic ER 121 H) - Microscope - Microtome - Paraffin-embedding equipment ### METHODS **Hair Removal** *Hair removal is typically performed at 6 - 7 wk of age (the beginning of the second resting hair growth cycle) *. 1. Remove a patch of dorsal hair from each mouse using an <b>electric</b> <b>hair</b> <b>clipper.</b> - Remove any residual stubble with a fine electric shaver. **Two-Stage Chemical Carcinogenesis** Table 1. Examples of two-step carcinogenesis regimens ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") 3. One week after hair removal (7 - 8 wk of age, the resting hair growth phase), apply 100 μL of DMBA to the shaved area (Borum 1954; Andreasen and Borum 1956; Miller et al. 1993). 4. After 1 wk, begin 100 -μL applications of TPA to the DMBA-initiated area. Apply TPA twice weekly, 3 - 4 d apart. *More or less frequent applications will reduce tumor numbers*. **Clinical Monitoring of Tumors** *Tumors should be evaluated by visual inspection by an observer, ideally a dermatologist, blinded to the experimental group*. 5. Evaluate mice for tumors weekly. Count palpable tumors that attain a diameter of 1 mm or greater and that are present for 2 wk or longer. 6. To follow the progression of papillomas to carcinomas, make a chart of the affected area, map the tumor(s), and note any changes. Count, measure, and score the tumors as: - clinically apparent papillomas (typically exophytic, i. e., extending outward from the skin; well-demarcated, symmetrical, pedunculated, or dome-shaped papules, without erosion or ulceration), or - clinically apparent carcinomas (typically endophytic, i. e., growing downward; poorly demarcated, asymmetrical, non-pedunculated, or doughnut-shaped papules or nodules with erosion or ulceration). **Histological Analysis of Tumors** *To assess the validity of the clinical scoring system, multiple tumors from each type (papilloma and carcinoma) and size category (e. g., 1 mm 2, 4 mm 2, 9 mm 2, and 16 mm 2) should be submitted for histological analysis by a dermatopathologist blinded to the clinical score*. 7. Excise the tumors and fix them in formalin. 8. Embed the tissue in paraffin, and cut it into 5 -μm sections. 9. Stain the sections with hematoxylin and eosin, and examine tumor histology using a microscope. ### REFERENCES 1. Andreasen E., Borum K.
