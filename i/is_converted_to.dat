5|$|A {{variety of}} nuclear fusion {{reactions}} {{take place in}} the cores of stars, that depend upon their mass and composition. When nuclei fuse, the mass of the fused product is less than the mass of the original parts. This lost mass <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> electromagnetic energy, according to the mass–energy equivalence relationship E=mc2.|$|E
5|$|Individual F. aurea {{trees are}} common on dairy farms in La Cruz, Cañitas and Santa Elena in Costa Rica, {{since they are}} often spared when forest <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> pasture. In interviews, farmers {{identified}} the species as useful for fence posts, live fencing and firewood, and as a food species for wild birds and mammals.|$|E
5|$|Most zircon is used {{directly}} in commercial applications, {{but a small}} percentage <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> the metal. Most Zr metal is produced by {{the reduction of the}} zirconium(IV) chloride with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The resulting metal is sintered until sufficiently ductile for metalworking.|$|E

50|$|Missionaries preached Christianity in Tokelau from 1845 to the 1860s. French Catholic missionaries on Wallis Island (also {{known as}} 'Uvea) and missionaries of the Protestant London Missionary Society in Samoa used native {{teachers}} <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> the Tokelauans. Atafu <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> Protestantism by the London Missionary Society, Nukunonu <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> Catholicism and Fakaofo <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> both denominations.|$|R
5|$|The anode sludges {{contain the}} selenides and tellurides of the noble metals in {{compounds}} with the formula M2Se or M2Te (M = Cu, Ag, Au). At temperatures of 500 °C the anode sludges are roasted with sodium carbonate under air. The metal ions {{are reduced to}} the metals, while the telluride <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> sodium tellurite.|$|E
5|$|The {{light energy}} {{captured}} by chlorophyll a is initially {{in the form}} of electrons (and later a proton gradient) that's used to make molecules of ATP and NADPH which temporarily store and transport energy. Their energy is used in the light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle by the enzyme rubisco to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised. Some of the glucose <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> starch which is stored in the chloroplast. Starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae, while inulin, a polymer of fructose is used for the same purpose in the sunflower family Asteraceae. Some of the glucose <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> sucrose (common table sugar) for export {{to the rest of the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse {{together to form a}} single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> other forms of electromagnetic energy of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star's outer layers.|$|E
50|$|Ringwood <b>to</b> Croydon <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> {{automatic}} signalling in November 1973 and duplicated in June 1984. Mooroolbark <b>to</b> Lilydale <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> {{automatic signalling}} in June 1985.|$|R
5000|$|The Bangalore-Shimoga line <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> [...] {{broad gauge}} {{starting}} from late 1990s to early 2000s. Finally, the Shimoga-Talaguppa line <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> [...] broad gauge in 2007.|$|R
50|$|As the American (4-4-0) type was {{displaced}} from top-flight service to secondary duties, tractive effort became {{more important than}} top speed. Large numbers of the high-drivered locomotives <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> low-drivered; 76 D16a and D16c <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> subclass D16, while 9 of class D16d <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> D16b specification; this left {{only a small number}} of locomotives with 80-inch drivers.|$|R
5|$|The {{production}} of iron or steel {{is a process}} consisting of two main stages. In the first stage pig iron is produced in a blast furnace. Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. In the second stage, pig iron <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.|$|E
5|$|The uranium {{fraction}} diagrams in {{the presence}} of carbonate illustrate this further: when the pH of a uranium(VI) solution increases, the uranium <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex.|$|E
5|$|When {{carbonate}} is added, uranium <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> {{a series}} of carbonate complexes if the pH is increased. One effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the pH range 6 to 8, a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, the Delhi-Jaipur {{line and}} Jaipur-Ahmedabad line <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> broad gauge (BG). In 2007, the line going toward Ratlam Junction railway station from Phulera <b>to</b> Chittaurgarh <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> BG.|$|R
50|$|In 1993 Argyll also {{acquired}} 4 supermarkets from Norco in Scotland. Three {{of these}} stores <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> Presto (in Banchory, Ellon, and Westhill) and one larger store (Elgin) <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> Safeway.|$|R
50|$|Until 1861 {{the militia}} were an entirely {{infantry}} force, {{but in that}} year a number of county regiments <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> artillery. In 1877 the militia of Anglesey and Monmouthshire <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> engineers.|$|R
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the zircon <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E
5|$|A typical 100-g parsnip {{contains}} 75 Calories (230 kJ) of energy. Most parsnip cultivars {{consist of}} about 80% water, 5% sugar, 1% protein, 0.3% fat, and 5% dietary fiber. The parsnip {{is rich in}} vitamins and minerals, and is particularly rich in potassium with 375mg per 100g. Several of the B-group vitamins are present, but levels of vitamin C are reduced in cooking. Since most of the vitamins and minerals are found close to the skin, many will be lost unless the root is finely peeled or cooked whole. During frosty weather, part of the starch <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> sugar and the root tastes sweeter.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
5000|$|The 66 {{streetcar}} (later renumbered as the 77, {{then the}} [...] ) {{was the first}} route <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> trackless trolley in 1936.
