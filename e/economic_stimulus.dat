40|$|It’s {{a salient}} {{observation}} {{in the literature}} that hedgers’ net short futures positions for agricultural commodities, {{as reported in the}} Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Disaggregated Commitment of Traders reports (DCOT), correlate strongly with futures prices. However, the DCOT data limits researchers’ ability to discern what influences producers’ hedging decisions from other activities such as storage hedges and spread trades. This is because the DCOT data aggregates open positions of all active contracts. This paper addresses this issue by examining the potential <b>economic</b> <b>stimuli</b> of corn producers’ forward contracting decisions before harvest using a unique data set of forward contracts between producers and large grain and farm supply cooperative over a five-year period. We find that producers forward price more of their crops when the futures price is trending up, and they are reluctant to hedge when the futures price is falling. We show that the producer level hedging data and the DCOT hedge series respond in a remarkably similar manner to <b>economic</b> <b>stimuli</b> despite this dissimilarity...|$|R

The station {{was not included in the}} original (2007) contract award, but was listed as a $450 million option. In late December 2007, reports indicated that the postponed station might be partially built if the City of New York and the MTA agreed on the additional financing for the station shell. In February 2009, the MTA announced that it would build the station if the agency received sufficient funds from the federal <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> package.

In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices.
