40|$|Handgrip is a {{ubiquitous}} human {{movement that}} determines how we interact with our environment. It {{is involved in}} {{almost every aspect of}} daily life (e. g. opening a door, handling cutlery, using tools) and like all human movement, its application is limited by muscle fatigue. However, the supraspinal mechanisms of <b>handgrip</b> <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> fatigue are not fully understood despite the importance of this fundamental movement, numerous publications, and its presence as a longstanding research topic. This thesis investigates the brain mechanisms of <b>handgrip</b> <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> fatigue using fMRI. It begins with {{a review of the literature}} in Chapter one, which evaluates the theories and evidence for central control of <b>handgrip</b> <b>and</b> muscle fatigue as well as describing the rationale to perform the experiments in this thesis. The methodology and analyses are also reviewed to provide rationale for their use and to facilitate the interpretation of subsequent experimental results. In order to understand the supraspinal mechanisms of <b>handgrip</b> <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> fatigue it is logical to first understand the most fundamental grip type (power vs. precision) and pattern (static vs. dynamic) by which handgrip can be performed...|$|R

40|$|Title: Relationship between forced vital {{capacity}} and hand grip strength in children Objectives: One of goals of this thesis {{is to find out}} how strong is the connection between the strength of a children's <b>handgrip</b> <b>and</b> the FVC. Another aim is to ascertain what is the age limit to use a handgrip examination to estimate the children's FVC. The last goal is to determine whether a body height, weight and age of a child are crucial to evaluate the <b>handgrip</b> <b>and</b> the FVC. Methods: First part of this thesis is a research and tries to summarize basic information about an issue of dynamometry, spirometry and to characterize each of age brackets which are the main aim of this thesis. Second part of this work is a survey for which data from sport festivals for children and youth were assembled. This data were statistically processed to calculate correlation and to make graphs showing linear regression between observed variables (<b>handgrip</b> <b>and</b> FVC), finally the results were interpreted. Results: Between the <b>handgrip</b> <b>and</b> the FVC was proven a strong correlation (girls, boys). It is possible to evaluate FVC with younger school age children from the value of handgrip's strenght. Values of strenght of a handgrip are strongly influenced by body length, weight and age of a child. Keywords: strenght of a handgrip, FVC, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{evaluated}} how {{the intensity}} of physical exercise as a lifestyle habit is associated with age, body composition <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> strength. Methods: Total body composition was analyzed using DEXA. Exercise scores were derived from an administered questionnaire and the scoring was calculated using the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET). Handgrip strength was measured using a dynamometer. Results: Age, independent of exercise intensity, was associated with declining lean mass, <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> with increasing total body fat. A regular physical exercise regime of intensity greater than 1230 MET-min/week was associated with higher total lean mass and lean mass in the limbs, <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> lower fat mass in the limbs. Discussion: We have shown that age was associated with lower lean mass especially in the limbs <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> higher total fat mass.

40|$|Objective: To examine {{differences}} in the shock and vibration transmitted to an occupant of a manual wheelchair with and without suspension caster forks and with and without rear-suspension systems. Design: Repeated-measures engineering testing. Setting: Rehabilitation engineering center with a wheelchair standards test laboratory. Specimens: Six manual wheelchairs. Interventions: An American National Standards Institute/Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America wheelchair test dummy and a Hybrid III test dummy were used to test shock and vibration transmission in wheelchairs equipped with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) caster forks and suspension caster forks. Ultralight wheelchairs, half of which had factory-equipped rear-suspension systems, were tested. Testing was conducted on a double-drum wheelch air test machine. Main Outcome Measures: Shocks were examined by using peak acceleration and the frequency at which peak acceleration occurs for the seat <b>and</b> <b>footrest.</b> Vibration was characterized by the acceleration power per octave for the seat <b>and</b> <b>footrest.</b> Results: Significant {{differences were found in}} the peak accelerations at the seat (P=. 0004) <b>and</b> <b>footrest</b> (P=. 0007) between the wheelchairs with the OEM caster forks and those with the suspension casters. The wheelchairs with suspension had significantly different frequencies at which the peak accelerations occurred for both the seat (P=. 01) <b>and</b> <b>footrest</b> (P=. 0001). The wheelchairs with suspension caster forks had a lower total power per octave than the wheelchairs with the OEM caster forks. For the footrest vibrations, {{significant differences were found between}} the types of caster forks for all octaves except those associated with frequencies more than 78. 75 Hz. There were significant differences for wheelchairs with and without rear suspension for total power per octave of seat vibrations in the octaves between 7. 81 and 9. 84 Hz (P=. 01) and 12. 40 and 15. 63 Hz (P=. 008). Conclusions: Suspension caster forks reduce the shock and vibration exposure to the user of a manual wheelchair. Rearsuspension systems reduce some of the factors related to shock and vibration exposure, but they are not clearly superior to traditional designs. © 2003 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|Wheelchair users rely {{on their}} wheelchairs for {{mobility}} for {{extended periods of time}} every day. According to the International Standards Organization 2631 - 1 standard on human vibration, individuals in a seated position when exposed to whole-body vibrations (WBV) are at risk of injury. This study evaluated vibration exposure during manual and power wheelchair driving over nine sidewalk surfaces and differences in vibration exposure over 3 years. Ten nondisabled subjects were asked to drive a manual wheelchair at 1 m/s and a power wheelchair at 1 m/s and 2 m/s over nine sidewalk surfaces while WBV were measured at the seat <b>and</b> <b>footrest</b> of the wheelchair. At 1 m/s, significant differences existed between surfaces and years at both the seat <b>and</b> the <b>footrest</b> for the manual and power wheelchair users. At 2 m/s, significant differences existed between surfaces and years at the seat <b>and</b> the <b>footrest</b> for power wheelchair users.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to verify if there is sex {{difference}} in the associations among handgrip strength, peak expiratory flow (PEF) and timed up and go (TUG) test results. METHODS: The sample included 288 consecutive elderly men (n= 93) and women (n= 195). Functional capacity was measured using the TUG test, and muscle strength was measured based on handgrip. Moreover, as a measure of current health status, PEF was evaluated. Linear regression procedures were performed to analyze the relationships between <b>handgrip</b> <b>and</b> both PEF and TUG test results, with adjustment for confounders, and to identify the possible mediating role of PEF in the association between <b>handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> TUG test results. RESULTS: In men, handgrip strength was associated with both PEF and TUG performance (p< 0. 01). After adjustment for PEF, the relationship between <b>handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> TUG performance remained significant. In women, handgrip strength was also associated with both PEF and TUG performance (p< 0. 01). However, after adjustment for PEF, the relationship between <b>handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> TUG performance was no longer significant. CONCLUSION: Mobility in the elderly is sex dependent. In particular, PEF mediates the relationship between <b>handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> TUG performance in women, but not in men...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} two algorithms for recommending {{notebook computer}} (NBC) and workstation adjustments {{so that the}} user can assume an ergonomic seated posture during NBC operation. Required input data are the user’s anthropometric data and physical dimensions of the NBC and the workstation. The first algorithm {{is based on an}} assumption that there are no workstation constraints while the second algorithm considers the actual seat height and work surface height. The results from the algorithms include recommendations for adjusting the NBC (tilt angle of the NBC base unit, angle between the base and screen units, and base support height) and the workstation (heights of seat support <b>and</b> <b>footrest,</b> <b>and</b> distance between the body and the NBC) ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim in {{this study}} was to analyze the {{relationship}} between <b>handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> muscle mass. Method: One hundred and forty five subjects (aged between 8 and 16 years) were divided into three groups: pre-puberty, puberty and post-puberty. The arm muscle area was estimated by anthropometry <b>and</b> skinfolds, <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> strength was evaluated with hydraulic dynamometer. The maturation stages were compared by using the Kruskall-Wallis test followed by U for Mann-Whitnney the location of differences. Spearman correlations was used to <b>handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> muscle mass (p< 0. 05). Results: <b>Handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> AMA were higher in post-puberty subjects, followed by puberty and prepuberty (p< 0. 05). There was correlation between AMA <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> strength in the three maturational stages (pre-puberty: rho= 0. 49; puberty: rho= 0. 74, and pospuberty: rho= 0. 70.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Physical {{inactivity}} {{has become}} a serious problem all over the world. Handgrip Strength (a form of isometric static contraction test), is an important test to evaluate the physical fitness and nutritional status of an individua l. A number of factors like a ge, gender, body size, effort, skeletal muscle bulk and contractility may affect the <b>handgrip</b> strength (HGS) <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> endurance (HGE). AIM: This {{study was conducted to}} establish the possible correlation (if any) between body mass index <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> str ength <b>and</b> endurance among young healthy adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A population based cross - sectional study comprising of 200 students (both male and female), age group - 18 - 22 yrs was carried out in the Department of Physiology, Jorhat Medical College. Anthropometric parameters like height and weight were taken to evaluate the BMI <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> endurance were taken by using handgrip dynamometer. According to WHO classification of BMI, subjects were categorized into three groups as un derweight BMI ≤ 18. 5 kg/m 2, normal weight BMI 18. 5 - 24. 9 kg/m 2 and overweight BMI≥ 24. 9 kg/m 2. Gender wise difference was analyzed by unpaired t test. Statistical analysis for correlation was done by using Karl Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient denoted by(r). RESULT: Males had higher <b>handgrip</b> strength <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> endurance than females. Statistic ally significant correlation was found between BMI <b>and</b> <b>handgrip</b> strength & endurance in underweight & overweight subjects. Gender differences in correlation were observed in correlation between BMI & HGS and HGE. CONCLUSION: The observed influence of BMI a nd gender differences in correlation between BMI and HGS and HGE indicate that besides BMI several other factors like effort, strength, muscular contractility etc. affect muscular strength & endurance in young males and females...|$|R
