The etch rate, selectivity, anisotropy, and uniformity in these processes are a function of the flux characteristics of the particles impinging onto a surface to be structured. The ions and neutrals emerging from a plasma traverse the sheath in front of the substrate electrode. The electrical ac and dc fields across the sheath and the collision processes, the ions and neutrals are subjected to, define the mass selective angular energy distributions of these particles which in turn influence the profile developments. An apparatus is described, which is capable to simulate parallel <b>plate</b> <b>diode</b> re actors with the additional possibility to install various kinds of plasma or ion beam sources, in order to measure the flux characteristics of these sources.

The detected energies extend from 0 eV up to the maximal energy defined by the potentials across the sheath and angular distributions with angular width of up to 15 degree full width at half maximum (FWHM) are identified. Both the energy distributions and the angular distributions are a result of charge transfer collisions, elastic scattering and dissociative collisions in the sheath in front of the substrate electrode.

This work investigates a novel 2 Ddiode array, named magic plate, for both single point calibration and 2 D positional performance, thelatter being {{a key element of}} modern radiotherapy techniques that will be delivered by these systems. Methods: GEANT 4 Monte Carlo methods have been employed to study the dose response of a silicondiode array to 6 MV photon beams, in the presence of in-line and perpendicularly aligned uniformmagnetic fields. The array consists of 121 silicon diodes (dimensions 1. 5 x 1. 5 x 0. 38 mm 3) embeddedin kapton substrate with 1 cm pitch, spanning a 10 x 10 cm 2 area in total.

40|$|Intensity {{modulated}} {{radiation therapy}} (IMRT) utilizes {{the technology of}} multileaf collimators to deliver highly modulated and complex radiation treatment. Dosimetric verification of the IMRT treatment requires the verification of the delivered dose distribution. Two dimensional ion chamber or diode arrays are gaining popularity as a dosimeter of choice due to their real time feedback compared to film dosimetry. This paper describes the characterization of a novel 2 D diode array, which has been named the “magic plate” (MP). It was designed {{to function as a}} 2 D transmission detector as well as a planar detector for dose distribution measurements in a solid water phantom for the dosimetric verification of IMRT treatment delivery. Methods: The prototype MP is an 11 [*]×[*] 11 detector array based on thin (50 μm) epitaxial diode technology mounted on a 0. 6 mm thick Kapton substrate using a proprietary “drop-in” technology developed by the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong. A full characterization of the detector was performed, including radiation damage study, dose per pulse effect, percent depth dose comparison with CC 13 ion chamber and build up characteristics with a parallel plane ion chamber measurements, dose linearity, energy response and angular response. Results: Postirradiated magic <b>plate</b> <b>diodes</b> showed a reproducibility of 2. 1 %. The MP dose per pulse response decreased at higher dose rates while at lower dose rates the MP appears to be dose rate independent. The depth dose measurement of the MP agrees with ion chamber depth dose measurements to within 0. 7 % while dose linearity was excellent. MP showed angular response dependency due to the anisotropy of the silicon diode with the maximum variation in angular response of 10. 8 % at gantry angle 180 °. Angular dependence was within 3. 5 % for the gantry angles[*]±[*] 75 °. The field size dependence of the MP at isocenter agrees with ion chamber measurement to within 1. 1 %. In the beam perturbation study, the surface dose increased by 12. 1 % for a 30 [*]×[*] 30 cm 2 field size at the source to detector distance (SDD) of 80 cm whilst the transmission for the MP was 99 %.

40|$|X-ray Thomson {{scattering}} (XRTS) is {{the combination}} of elastic Raleigh scattering and inelastic Compton scattering observed from high density systems using energetic probe energies at the keV x-ray level. Thermal x-ray probes have historically been created by delivering 1014 [-] 1016 W/cm 2 to a mid-Z metal foil such as titanium using kilojoule-class lasers. An XRTS probe source must provide adequate photon numbers within a finite bandwidth in order to resolve the elastic and inelastic scattering features. This thesis argues that the 4. 75 keV He[alpha] spectral feature from a titanium hybrid x-pinch x-ray source driven in a pulsed power circuit can satisfy these photon and bandwidth requirements and function as an XRTS probe source. The arguments are supported through xray <b>diode</b> and image <b>plate</b> photometric analysis for the titanium He[alpha] feature. As a proof of principle, scattering signals from cold, static materials have been collected using the hybrid x-pinch as the probe source. Two different experimental scattering arrangements were developed to collect the weak scattered signals from room temperature targets. The hybrid xpinch was driven in the main current path of the Cornell Beam Research Accelerator (COBRA) 1 MA pulsed power driver for both of these arrangements. The first setup, Focused XRTS (FXRTS), used a spherically-bent germanium xray optic to focus the probe photons collected from a titanium hybrid x-pinch approximately 82 cm away, and focused them onto a 20 [MICRO SIGN]m thick aluminum foil scattering target. The FXRTS setup allowed the entire scattering experiment to be spatially removed from the actual source location, thus lowering background signals on the detectors. For the second scattering setup, Direct XRTS (DXRTS), a new spectrometer was designed and built to function inside the main COBRA vacuum chamber. The scattering setup functioned in a more traditional sense by having the scattering target, 125 [MICRO SIGN]m thick graphite, placed approximately 20 mm away from the x-pinch x-ray source. Protection of the optics and background noise shielding for the detectors were design challenges in the spectrometer. For both experimental arrangements, the backscattered radiation was collected using high-efficiency highly annealed pyrolytic graphite (HAPG) optics and focused onto Fuji Biological Analysis Systems - Tritium type (BAS-TR) image plate detectors. The noncollective FXRTS results from aluminum show {{the importance of the}} ion-ion correlation factor within the total dynamic structure factor and its strong dependence on scattering angle. The FXRTS results were fit with theoretical scattering spectrums created using an XRTS subroutine included in the SPECT 3 D spectral code suite. Unfortunately, the noncollective DXRTS results from graphite were mixed with line and continuum radiation from other sources that made detailed analysis impossible...|$|R
40|$|Space-charge {{limited flow}} {{is a topic}} of much {{interest}} and varied application. We extend existing understanding of space-charge limits by simulations,and develop new tools and techniques for doing these simulations along the way. The Child-Langmuir limit is a simple analytic solution for space-charge limitedcurrent density in a one-dimensional diode. It has been previously extended to two dimensionsby numerical calculation in planar geometries. By considering an axisymmetric cylindrical system with axial emission from a circular cathode of finite radius r and outer drift tube R > rand gap length L, we further examine the space charge limit in two dimensions. We simulate a two-dimensional axisymmetric parallel <b>plate</b> <b>diode</b> of various aspect ratios (r/L),and develop a scaling law for the measured two-dimensional space-charge limit (2 DSCL) relative to the Child-Langmuir limit {{as a function of}} the aspect ratio of the diode. These simulations are done with a large (100 T) longitudinal magnetic field to restrict electronmotion to 1 D, with the two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation code OOPIC. We find a scaling law that is a monotonically decreasing function of this aspect ratio,and the one-dimensional result is recovered in the limit as r >> L. The result is in good agreement with prior results in planar geometry,where the emission area is proportional to the cathode width. We find a weak contribution from the effects of the drift tube for current at the beam edge,and a strong contribution of high current-density "wings" at the outer-edge of the beam,with a very large relative contribution when the beam is narrow. Mechanisms for enhancing current beyond the Child-Langmuir limit remain a matter of great importance. We analyze the enhancement effects of upstream ion injection on the transmitted current in a one-dimensional parallel <b>plate</b> <b>diode.</b> Electrons are field-emitted at the cathode,and ions are injected at a controlled current from the anode. An analytic solution is derived for maximizing the electron current throughput in terms of the ion current. This analysis accounts for various energy regimes, from classical to fully relativistic. The analytical result is then confirmed by simulation of the diode in each energy regime. The simulation approach involved iteratively testing injected ion current,and treating the measured transmitted electron current as a feedback mechanism. The feedback loop was automated, allowing for a single simulation to locate the optimized current. By tuning the injected ion current, we are able to optimize the transmitted electron current. This tuning of the ion current is automated by the integration of a high-level Python interface,wrapping the C++ particle-in-cell simulation code OOPD 1. In this particular system, analysis showed that simulation runtime would be a function of transit time, and thus ion mass. By experimenting with reduced ion mass, we were able to significantly reduce simulation times,while recovering the same physical results. Field-limited emission is an approach for using Gauss's law to to satisfy the space charge limit for emitting current in particle-in-cell simulations. We find that simple field-limited emission models make several assumptions,which introduce small, systematic errors in the system. We make a thorough analysis of each assumption,and ultimately develop and test a new emission scheme that accounts for each. The first correction we make is to allow for a non-zero surface field at the boundary. Since traditional field-emission schemes only aim to balance Gauss's law at the surface,a zero surface field is an assumed condition. But for many systems, this is not appropriate,so the addition of a target surface field is made. The next correction is to account for nonzero initial velocity,which, if neglected, results in a systematic underestimation of the current,due to assuming that all emitted charge will be weighted to the boundary,when in fact it will be weighted as a fraction strictly less than unity,depending on the distance across the initial cell the particle travels in its initial fractional timestep. A correction is made to the scheme, to use the actual particle weight to adjust the target emission. The final analyses involve geometric terms,analyzing the effects of cylindrical coordinates,and taking particular care to analyze the center of a cylindrical beam,as well as the outer edge of the beam, in Cartesian coordinates. We find that balancing Gauss's law at the edge of the beam is not the correct behavior,and that it is important to resolve the profile of the emitted current,in order to avoid systematic errors. A thorough analysis is done of the assumptions made in prior implementations,and corrections are introduced for cylindrical geometry,non-zero injection velocity, and non-zero surface field. Particular care is taken to determine special conditions for the outermost node,where we find that forcing a balance of Gauss's law would be incorrect. The new emission scheme is tested in a two-dimensional periodic simulation,to demonstrate that the Jaffe limit for a one-dimensional diode with finite initial velocity is recovered. We also extend the iterative scheme developed earlier,and apply it to determine a scaling law for the Child-Langmuir limitin an axisymmetric planar diode, with finite initial velocity. We find that the new scheme reproduces prior results,and in significantly less computation time due to no longer needing to overinject,and leads to rapid convergence of the surface field,using our new algorithmic optimization wrapper to seek the local limiting current along an emitter...|$|R
