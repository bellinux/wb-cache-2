5|$|Bracken is {{very common}} in upland areas, Beech Fern in woods and other shaded {{locations}} and Scaly Male Fern in wooded or open areas. Wilsons Filmy-fern is a common upland variety in the Highlands, along with the Tunbridge Filmy-fern, Alpine Lady-fern and the rarer stunted form Newman’s Lady-fern (A. distentifolium var. flexile) which is endemic to Scotland. The Killarney Fern, once found on Arran {{was thought to be}} extinct in Scotland, but has been discovered on Skye in its <b>gametophyte</b> form.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a <b>gametophyte,</b> typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|The Rhynia {{plant was}} small and stick-like, with simple dichotomously {{branching}} stems without leaves, each tipped by a sporangium. The simple form echoes that of the sporophyte of mosses, {{and it has been}} shown that Rhynia had an alternation of generations, with a corresponding <b>gametophyte</b> in the form of crowded tufts of diminutive stems only a few millimetres in height. Rhynia thus falls midway between mosses and early vascular plants like ferns and clubmosses. From a carpet of moss-like gametophytes, the larger Rhynia sporophytes grew much like simple clubmosses, spreading by means of horizontal growing stems growing rhizoids that anchored the plant to the substrate. The unusual mix of moss-like and vascular traits and the extreme structural simplicity of the plant had huge implications for botanical understanding.|$|E
40|$|Arsenic hyperaccumulation and {{tolerance}} in <b>gametophytes</b> and spores ofPteris vittata L. (brake fern) have been investigated. <b>Gametophytes</b> {{are able to}} grow normally in medium containing 50 to 200 or 300 μM arsenite and arsenate. In medium containing < 300 μM arsenite and 500 μM arsenate, <b>gametophytes</b> do not almost grow. The highest arsenic concentrations in <b>gametophytes</b> are about 1, 023 and 920 mg/kg-DW in medium containing 300 μM of arsenite and arsenate. The results suggest that <b>gametophytes</b> of the brake fern also has a great potential {{to be used for}} phytoremediating soils with low concentration of arsenic...|$|R
50|$|Salviniales are all aquatic and {{differ from}} all other ferns in being heterosporous, meaning that they produce two {{different}} types of spores (megaspores and microspores) that develop into {{two different types of}} <b>gametophytes</b> (female and male <b>gametophytes,</b> respectively), and in that their <b>gametophytes</b> are endosporic, meaning that they never grow outside the spore wall and cannot become larger than the spores that produced them. In being heterosporus with endosporic <b>gametophytes</b> they are more similar to seed plants than to other ferns.|$|R
5000|$|... their <b>gametophytes</b> are {{subterranean}} {{and rely}} on fungi for their energy (in other words, they are mycoheterotrophic), unlike the terrestrial, photosynthetic <b>gametophytes</b> found in most ferns.|$|R
25|$|Bryophytes {{have life}} cycles that are <b>gametophyte</b> dominated. The longer lived, more {{prominent}} autotrophic plant is the <b>gametophyte.</b> The sporophyte in mosses and liverworts {{consists of an}} unbranched stalk (a seta) bearing a single sporangium or spore-producing capsule. Even when capable of photosynthesis, as in mosses and hornworts, bryophyte sporophytes require additional photosynthate from the <b>gametophyte</b> to sustain growth and spore development and are dependent on the <b>gametophyte</b> for their supplies of water, mineral nutrients and nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|Monoicous {{plants are}} those species that bear both sperm and eggs {{on the same}} <b>gametophyte.</b> Dioicous plants are those that have gametophytes that produce only sperm or eggs but never both. The terms are used largely but not {{exclusively}} {{in the context of}} bryophytes. Both monoicous and dioicous gametophytes produce gametes in gametangia by mitosis rather than meiosis, so that sperm and eggs are genetically identical with their parent <b>gametophyte.</b> The states of being monoicous or dioicous are called monoicy and dioicy respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{preservation}} of spores attached to sporangia allows spore genera to be matched with their producers - {{something that is}} otherwise very difficult to do. The chert also allows {{the identification of the}} <b>gametophyte</b> phases of taxa such as Aglaophyton.|$|E
50|$|The gynoecium {{is often}} {{referred}} to as female because it gives rise to female (egg-producing) <b>gametophytes,</b> however, strictly speaking sporophytes do not have a sex, only <b>gametophytes</b> do.|$|R
40|$|<b>Gametophytes</b> of the fern Onoclea sensibilis grow as {{filaments}} in {{the dark}} and in red light and become planar in blue light. Pulse-labeling 4 -day-old <b>gametophytes</b> with [35 S]methionine at different times after transfer to dark, red, and blue light environments revealed higher rates of amino acid uptake and protein synthesis in blue light than in red light or {{in the dark}}. Characterization of the extant and newly synthesized soluble proteins by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that the patterns of protein accumulation and synthesis in <b>gametophytes</b> exposed to short periods of red or blue light were qualitatively indistinguishable from those of <b>gametophytes</b> maintained in the dark. However, some striking increases and decreases in the levels of certain polypeptides were noted and these changes were accentuated during continued growth of <b>gametophytes</b> in the different environments. The results show that photomorphogenesis of <b>gametophytes</b> of O. sensibilis is associated with quantitative rather than qualitative changes in the population of mRNAs available for translation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to explore what effect light quality and light intensity and various sugars have on the sexual expression of Eguisetum <b>gametophytes</b> and to determine some characteristics of the red pigment in Eguisetum <b>gametophytes.</b> Light quality and light intensity were employed to seek the presence of a morphogenetic factor involved in the sexual expression of Eguisetum <b>gametophytes.</b> The <b>gametophytes</b> were grown in mass culture in petri dishes and singly in test tubes under red light and white light or under high light intensity and low light intensity. Light quality was employed when the Eguisetum species was Eguisetum hyemale. When the species was Eguisetum arvense, light intensity was employed. A higher percentage of antheridial <b>gametophytes</b> in mass culture in petri dishes than singly in test tubes under either red light or high light intensity would indicate an interaction among the <b>gametophytes</b> due to a diffusible substance and thus would indicate that light quality or light intensity was probably involved in a mechanism which activated a morphogenetic factor determining the sex of Eguisetum <b>gametophytes.</b> In mass culture in petri dishes, the morphogenetic factor activated by either red light or high light intensity would influence the sexual expression of other <b>gametophytes</b> in the same petri dish; whereas, singly in test tubes the <b>gametophytes</b> are isolated from each other so that any morphogenetic factor that is produced could not influence the sexual expression of the <b>gametophytes.</b> The factor would probably be some sort of diffusible substance comparable to the antheridogens of ferns. The results were ambiguous. Mannitol, sucrose and glucose were added separately to Bold 2 ̆ 7 s basal medium to determine what effect these sugars have on the sexual expression of Eguisetwn <b>gametophytes.</b> The results were ambiguous. The red pigment often associated with Eguisetum antheridial production was isolated by column chromatography and some characteristics were determined using visible light spectrophotometry. It is definitely not rhodoxanthin, as reported, but could not be identified other than to be a carotenoid. This study showed that Eguisetum <b>gametophytes</b> are a difficult system with which to experiment. It seems the sensitivity of Eguisetwn spores to light quality and light intensity can vary...|$|R
25|$|Sphagnum, {{like all}} other land plants, has an {{alternation}} of generations; like other bryophytes, the haploid <b>gametophyte</b> generation is dominant and persistent. Unlike other mosses, the long-lived gametophytes do not rely upon rhizoids to assist in water uptake. Sphagnum species can be unisexual (male or female, dioecious) or bisexual (male and female gametes produced from the same plant; monoecious); In North America, 80% of Sphagnum species are unisexual. Gametophytes have substantial asexual reproduction by fragmentation, producing much of the living material in sphagnum peatlands. Swimming sperm fertilize eggs contained in archegonia that remain attached to the female <b>gametophyte.</b> The sporophyte is relatively short-lived, and consists almost entirely of a shiny green, spherical spore capsule that becomes black with spores. Sporophytes are raised on stalks to facilitate spore dispersal, but unlike other mosses, Sphagnum stalks are produced by the maternal <b>gametophyte.</b> Tetrahedral haploid spores are produced in the sporophyte by meiosis, which are then dispersed when the capsule explosively discharges its cap, called an operculum, and shoots the spores some distance. The spores germinate to produce minute protonemae, which start as filaments, can become thalloid, and can produce a few rhizoids. Soon afterwards the protonema develops buds and these differentiate into its characteristic, erect, leafy, branched <b>gametophyte</b> with chlorophyllose cells and hyaline cells. This stage dominates the environment where Sphagnum grows, obliterating and burying the protonema and eventually building up into layers of dead moss called peat. Carpets of living Sphagnum may be attacked by various fungi, and one fungus that is also a mushroom, Sphagnurus paluster, produces conspicuous dead patches. When this fungus and other agarics attack the protonema, Sphagnum is induced to produce non-photosynthetic gemmae that can survive the fungal attack and months later germinate to produce new protonema and leafy gametophytes. It is unknown whether the leafy stage can produce such gemmae.|$|E
25|$|When {{eaten in}} large {{quantities}} or over a long period, the <b>gametophyte</b> (meat) of the seed can cause poisoning by 4'-O-methylpyridoxine (MPN). MPN is heat-stable and not destroyed by cooking. Studies have demonstrated the convulsions caused by MPN can be prevented or treated successfully with pyridoxine (vitamin B6).|$|E
25|$|In {{plants such}} as bryophytes, ferns, and a few others, spores {{germinate}} into independent gametophytes. In the bryophytes (e.g., mosses and liverworts), spores germinate into protonemata, similar to fungal hyphae, from which the <b>gametophyte</b> grows. In ferns, the gametophytes are small, heart-shaped prothalli that can often be found underneath a spore-shedding adult plant.|$|E
40|$|Unlike animals, whose gametes are direct {{products}} of meiosis, plant meiotic products undergo additional rounds of mitosis, developing into multicellular haploid <b>gametophytes</b> that produce egg or sperm cells. The complex development of <b>gametophytes</b> requires extensive {{expression of the}} genome, with DNA-dependent RNA polymerases I, II, and III being the key enzymes for nuclear gene expression. We show that loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding key subunits of RNA polymerases I, II, or III are not transmitted maternally due {{to the failure of}} female megaspores to complete the three rounds of mitosis required for the development of mature <b>gametophytes.</b> However, male microspores bearing defective polymerase alleles develop into mature <b>gametophytes</b> (pollen) that germinate, grow pollen tubes, fertilize wild-type female <b>gametophytes,</b> and transmit the mutant genes to the next generation at moderate frequency. These results indicate that female <b>gametophytes</b> are autonomous with regard to gene expression, relying on transcription machinery encoded by their haploid nuclei. By contrast, male <b>gametophytes</b> make extensive use of transcription machinery that is synthesized by the diploid parent plant (sporophyte) and persists in mature pollen. As a result, the expected stringent selection against nonfunctional essential genes in the haploid state occurs in the female lineage but is relaxed in the male lineage...|$|R
40|$|Schizaea pusilla is a pteridophyte {{with several}} unique {{developmental}} characteristics. In contrast to most other fern species, S. pusilla <b>gametophytes</b> remain filamentous throughout their development, and the <b>gametophytes</b> {{are associated with}} an endophytic fungus {{which appears to be}} mycorrhizal. In terms of tropistic responses, apical filament cells of young <b>gametophytes</b> are negatively phototropic compared with germ filaments of other ferns which exhibit positive phototropism. Cryofixation (propane jet freezing and high-pressure freezing) in conjunction with freeze substitution electron microscopy was used to study young <b>gametophytes.</b> The results demonstrate that apical filament cells have a distinctive structural polarity and that rhizoids also can be successfully frozen by these methods. The cytoskeleton and endomembrane system were particularly well preserved in cryofixed cells. In addition, Schizaea <b>gametophytes</b> were used as a test system to evaluate potential artifacts of propane jet freezing and high pressure freezing. There was little apparent difference in ultrastructure between cells cryofixed by either freezing method. These <b>gametophytes</b> will be useful in determining the effectiveness of cryofixation techniques and as a model system in tip growth studies...|$|R
50|$|Laminaria hyperborea can {{liberate}} {{upward of}} a million zoospores from sori {{on the surface of}} the blade during the course of a few weeks during the winter. These have flagella and settle after about 24 hours before developing into microscopic <b>gametophytes</b> which become fertile in about 10 days. Male <b>gametophytes</b> release large quantities of motile sperm, apparently stimulated to do so by the release of female gametes by the female <b>gametophytes</b> in the vicinity. The fertilised zygotes germinate into young sporophytes which will grow into the mature seaweed. Sexual reproduction is dependent on a minimum quantity of blue light; under less than optimal conditions, the <b>gametophytes</b> may develop vegetatively instead.|$|R
25|$|Many trees, shrubs, vines, {{ferns and}} other {{herbaceous}} perennials form clonal colonies naturally. Parts {{of an individual}} plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort <b>gametophyte</b> clones by means of gemmae. Some vascular plants e.g. dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually, termed apomixis, resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.|$|E
25|$|Haploid {{cells are}} {{produced}} from pollen or egg cells or from other {{cells of the}} <b>gametophyte,</b> then by induced or spontaneous chromosome doubling, a doubled haploid cell is produced, which can be grown into a doubled haploid plant. If the original plant was diploid, the haploid cells are monoploid, and the term doubled monoploid {{may be used for}} the doubled haploids. Haploid organisms derived from tetraploids or hexaploids are sometimes called dihaploids (and the doubled dihaploids are, respectively, tetraploid or hexaploid).|$|E
25|$|Conifers are heterosporous, {{generating}} {{two different}} types of spores: male microspores and female megaspores. These spores develop on separate male and female sporophylls on separate male and female cones. In the male cones, microspores are produced from microsporocytes by meiosis. The microspores develop into pollen grains, which are male gametophytes. Large amounts of pollen are released and carried by the wind. Some pollen grains will land on a female cone for pollination. The generative cell in the pollen grain divides into two haploid sperm cells by mitosis leading {{to the development of the}} pollen tube. At fertilization, one of the sperm cells unites its haploid nucleus with the haploid nucleus of an egg cell. The female cone develops two ovule, each of which contains haploid haploid megaspores. A megasporocyte is divided by meiosis in each ovule. Each winged pollen grain is a four celled male <b>gametophyte</b> Three of the four cells break down leaving only a single surviving cell which will develop into a female multicellular <b>gametophyte.</b> The female gametophytes grow to produce two or more archegonia, each of which contains an egg. Upon fertilization, the diploid egg will give rise to the embryo, and a seed is produced. The female cone then opens, releasing the seeds which grow to a young seedling.|$|E
50|$|Extant lycophytes produce several {{different}} types of <b>gametophytes.</b> In the families Lycopodiaceae and Huperziaceae, <b>gametophytes</b> are subterranean and mycotrophic, deriving nutrients from symbiosis with fungi. Isoetes and Selaginella, which are heterosporous, megagametophytes develop inside the megaspores, which crack open at the trilete suture to allow the male gametes to access the egg cells in the archegonia inside. The <b>gametophytes</b> of Isoetes appear to be similar in this respect {{to those of the}} extinct Carboniferous giant arborescent clubmosses, Lepidodendron and Lepidostrobus.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Actively growing post-embryonic sporophytes {{of desert}} mosses are {{restricted}} to the cooler, wetter months. However, most desert mosses have perennial <b>gametophytes.</b> It is hypothesized that these life history patterns are {{due in part to}} a reduced thermotolerance for sporophytes relative to <b>gametophytes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{macroscopic}} sporophyte {{has many}} specialized blades growing near the holdfast. These blades bear various sori containing sporangia, which release haploid spores, which will grow into microscopic {{female and male}} <b>gametophytes.</b> These <b>gametophytes,</b> after reaching the appropriate substrata, grow mitotically to eventually produce gametes.|$|R
25|$|Pollen {{is a fine}} to coarse powdery {{substance}} comprising pollen grains which are male microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes {{during the process of}} their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it germinates, producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female <b>gametophyte.</b> Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called palynology and is highly useful in paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and forensics.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of proliferating buds {{is one of}} several unusual adaptations for reproduction in this species. The buds form near the base of the stipe, and when covered with soil, can grow into new individuals as the frond that bore them dies. Ebony spleenwort is also well-adapted to propagate by spores: the upright sterile fronds help the spores enter the airstream for long-distance dispersal, and a low genetic load allows spores that have grown into a <b>gametophyte</b> to self-fertilize {{with a high degree of}} success. This dispersal ability seems to have helped the species spread rapidly in the Great Lakes region in the late 20th century. Long-distance dispersal may also explain its naturalized appearance in South Africa; the same mechanism may have given rise to an isolated population found in Slovakia in 2009, its first known occurrence in Europe.|$|E

40|$|The {{sporophyte}} of the fern Pteris vittata {{is known}} to be a hyperaccumulator of arsenic in its fronds to> 2. 3 % of its dry weight. However, very little has been stated about hyperaccumulation of arsenic by <b>gametophytes</b> of P. vittata. Here we report that <b>gametophytes</b> of P. vittata from Beppu City and Okinawa Island in western Japan hyperaccumulate arsenic in a similar manner to that observed in the sporophyte. The <b>gametophytes</b> from the Beppu City are able to grow in medium containing 10 mM arsenate and accumulate> 1. 8 % of their dry weight as arsenic. The results suggest <b>gametophytes</b> of P. vittata also have a great potential to be used for phytoremediation and the relative ability of tolerance and accumulation show some local variation of their sources...|$|R
40|$|An in vivo {{phytochrome}} difference {{spectrum of}} dark grown Anemia phyllitidis L. Sw. <b>gametophytes</b> has been measured. The spectral characteristics estimated from the difference spectrum were as follows: red maximum at 662 nanometers, far red maximum at 737 nanometers, isosbestic point at 695 nanometers, and a shoulder from 620 to 630 nanometers. To diminish {{the influence of}} chlorophyll on phytochrome measurements in dark grown <b>gametophytes,</b> total chlorophyll content could be reduced by about 65 % by treatment with 1 micromolar Norflurazon. In <b>gametophytes</b> grown in red light, the inhibition caused by 1 micromolar Norflurazon was 97. 5 %, based on g spores. Total carotenoid content of dark grown <b>gametophytes</b> was not appreciably different from that already present in dry spores. Herbicide treatment reduced this level to about 60 %. <b>Gametophytes</b> grown in red light showed a nearly 7 -fold increase in total carotenoids {{compared with that of}} the dark control. In treated light grown protonemata, no carotenoid accumulation took place, and the level remaining corresponded with that found in treated dark grown protonemata...|$|R

500|$|The strictest {{definition}} of [...] "plant" [...] includes only the [...] "land plants" [...] or embryophytes, which include seed plants (gymnosperms, including the pines, and flowering plants) and the free-sporing cryptogams including ferns, clubmosses, liverworts, hornworts and mosses. Embryophytes are multicellular eukaryotes descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by photosynthesis. They have life cycles with alternating haploid and diploid phases. The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, {{known as the}} <b>gametophyte,</b> nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for {{at least part of}} its life, even in the seed plants, where the <b>gametophyte</b> itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte. Other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied in bacteriology), fungi (mycology) – including lichen-forming fungi (lichenology), non-chlorophyte algae (phycology), and viruses (virology). However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi (including lichens) and photosynthetic protists are usually covered in introductory botany courses.|$|E
500|$|Postelsia has two {{distinct}} morphologies: one for its diploid, monoicous sporophyte stage, {{which is the}} dominant portion of the life cycle, and one for its smaller, haploid, dioecious <b>gametophyte</b> stage.

40|$|Fruiting of U. pertusa was {{confirmed}} to occur during the neap tides in Shibukawa, on the Seto Inland Sea near Okayama City, Japan. <b>Gametophytes</b> first become fertile towards {{the beginning of}} a neap tide series, contrary to the case in Tsuyazaki, Kyushu. They rapidly increase in number and abundant fertile <b>gametophytes</b> can be found on about 5 successive days.

This dominancy reversal took place 3 times in this study and each happened to fall on the following day of such a quarter. Dominant fertile sporophytes are only ephemeral by the second reversal in 1 or 2 days. Thus, fruiting is at fortnightly intervals, and corresponds to the phase of the moon.
