40|$|It is well {{established}} that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violent visual media is associated with increases in aggressive thoughts, feelings and behaviours. However, research regarding the effects of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violent music is more scarce and has returned inconsistent findings. In their review of the literature, Roberts, Christenson and Gentile (2003) suggested that (1) the angry tone of violent music has a much stronger effect on aggressive behaviour than does <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violent lyrics, and (2) {{that the effects of}} violent music exposure on aggression are not widespread. In this study both assertions were tested. Participants (N= 309) were measured for levels of trait aggression, self-reported actual aggression, and <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violent visual and auditory media. <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> violent visual media and <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violent music were both significantly correlated with trait and actual aggression, {{and the size of the}} effect was similar for both modes. When the effects were examined in detail, it was found that whereas <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violent visual media had a stronger effect on levels of physical aggression, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violent music had a stronger effect on levels of indirect and displaced aggression.

5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, an {{independent}} Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw {{a series of}} reports, called the Historical Public Exposure Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies involved nine years of research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> contaminants and potential risks from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E

5|$|Millipedes {{generally}} have little impact to human economic or social well-being, especially {{in comparison with}} insects, although locally {{they can be a}} nuisance or agricultural pest. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor discolouration on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, itching, local erythema, edema, blisters, eczema, and occasionally cracked skin. Eye <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as conjunctivitis and keratitis. This is called millipede burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of the composition of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour.

5|$|The {{result of}} {{breathing}} increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, {{an excess of}} oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways {{depending on the type}} of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.|$|E

5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. Two moral orientations {{in men and}} women‟s {{reasoning}} about moral dilemmas {{have dominated}} the literature: an orientation to rights, fairness, and justice and another based on care, compassion and concern for others. It is widely accepted that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violence {{has a number of}} adverse effects on children and adolescents‟ psychosocial development. Recent research has begun to explore whether, and how, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violence impacts on moral development. Studies examining the nature of this association, however, have yielded contradictory results. While there is evidence <b>to</b> suggest that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violence adversely affects moral development, it has also been shown that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violence simply influences which moral reasoning style is likely to predominate – justice or care. Beginning with a brief review of moral development theories and of the psychosocial effects of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violence, the present research explored the association between <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violence and moral development. This study aimed to determine whether there is an association between gender, moral orientation, and <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violence. Based on the literature, it was hypothesised that men would exhibit a justice moral orientation, while women would exhibit a moral orientation based on care. Further, it was expected that men would show higher levels of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violence than women. <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> violence was expected to be significantly positively correlated with justice reasoning. A significant association was anticipated between gender, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> violence and moral orientation.

40|$|Background: Even {{though a}} series of {{restrictions}} aimed at protecting dwellers from being addicted to tobacco are implemented in Hong Kong, the loopholes utilized by tobacco industry can still promote tobacco marketing by various strategies such as sponsorship in movies and charity activities. Therefore, it is still quite necessary to monitor the associations of intention <b>to</b> smoke with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti-smoking media messages and pro-smoking media messages among adolescents in Hong Kong. Objectives: Objectives {{of this study were}} <b>to</b> investigate <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> pro- smoking media messages and pro-smoking media messages and their association with intention to smoke among adolescents in Hong Kong. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study based on secondary data collected from Smoking and Health Survey among Hong Kong Students 2010 / 11. Data from 61, 810 secondary school students were analyzed. <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti- and pro- smoking media messages among adolescents in Hong Kong was assessed. Logistic regression was conducted to examine the association of intention <b>to</b> smoke with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti- and prosmoking media messages separately, and then examine the association of intention <b>to</b> smoke with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti- and pro- smoking media messages with taking <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti- and pro- smoking media messages as a whole. Sub group analysis splitting the sample into never smokers and ever smokers were made throughout logistic regression models above. Results: In terms of prevalence of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> media, higher possibilities of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> prosmoking media messages and of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti-smoking media messages was found among females relative to males (39. 9 % versus 37. 1 % and 69. 5 % versus 68. 1 % respectively, both p< 0. 001). Besides, significant higher possibilities of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> pro-smoking media messages and of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti-smoking media messages than those without were detected (43. 9 % versus 34. 4 % and 71. 9 % versus 65. 7 % respectively, both p< 0. 001). Statistically significant positive associations were found between <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> pro-smoking media messages and intention to smoke both among never smokers (OR= 1. 39, 95 % CI: 1. 26 - 1. 52, p< 0. 001) and ever smokers (OR= 1. 35, 95 % CI: 1. 24 - 1. 46, p< 0. 001). And, statistically significant negative associations were observed between <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti-smoking media messages and intention to smoke among never smokers (OR= 0. 58, 95 % CI: 0. 53 - 0. 63, p< 0. 001) and among ever smokers (OR= 0. 82, 95 % CI: 0. 76 - 0. 89, p< 0. 001). In logistic regression models for both anti- and pro- smoking media messages, among never smokers, we found the lowest odd ratio was 0. 56 (95 % CI: 0. 51 - 0. 63, p< 0. 001), for category with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti-smoking media messages and no <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> pro-smoking media messages. And the highest odds ratio was 1. 33 (95 % CI: 1. 11 - 1. 56, p= 0. 001), for the category with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> pro-smoking media messages and no <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> antismoking media messages. For ever smokers, the lowest odds ratio was 0. 82 (95 % CI: 0. 75 - 0. 89, p< 0. 001), for category with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti-smoking media messages and no <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> pro-smoking media messages. And, the hightest odds ratio was 1. 35 (95 % CI: 1. 10 - 1. 66, p= 0. 004), for the category with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> pro-smoking media messages and no <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti-smoking media messages. Conclusions: In both ever and never smokers, positive associations of intention <b>to</b> smoke with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> pro-smoking media messages were observed. However, a negative association of intention <b>to</b> smoke with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti-smoking media messages was only found for sub group of never smokers. For both never smokers and ever smokers, the group with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> pro-smoking media messages and no <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> anti-smoking media messages had positively higher increase in the odds of intention to smoke relative to the group with <b>exposure</b> both <b>to</b> anti- and pro smoking media messages. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
