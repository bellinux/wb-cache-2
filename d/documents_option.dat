40|$|Configuration {{options are}} widely used for {{customizing}} the behavior and initial settings of software applications, server processes, and operating systems. Their distinctive property is that each option is processed, defined, and described {{in different parts of}} a software project - namely in code, in configuration file, and in documentation. This creates a challenge for maintaining project consistency as it evolves. It also promotes inconsistencies leading to misconfiguration issues in production scenarios. We propose an approach for detection of inconsistencies between source code and documentation based on static analysis. Our approach automatically identifies source code locations where options are read, and for each such location retrieves the name of the option. Inconsistencies are then detected by comparing the results against the option names listed in documentation. We evaluated our approach on multiple components of Apache Hadoop, a complex framework with more than 800 options. Our tool ORPLocator was able to successfully locate at least one read point for 93 % to 96 % of <b>documented</b> <b>options</b> within four Hadoop components. A comparison with a previous state-of-the-art technique shows that our tool produces more accurate results. Moreover, our evaluation has uncovered 4 previously unknown, real-world inconsistencies between <b>documented</b> <b>options</b> and source cod...|$|R

50|$|Although many {{companies}} {{have been identified as}} having problems with backdating, the severity of the problem, and the consequences, fall along a broad spectrum. At one extreme, where it is clear that top management was guilty of conscious wrongdoing in backdating, attempted to conceal the backdating by falsifying documents, and where the backdating resulted in a substantial overstatement of the company's profitability, SEC enforcement actions and even criminal charges have resulted. Toward the other extreme, where the backdating was a result of overly informal internal procedures or even just delays in finalizing the paperwork <b>documenting</b> <b>options</b> grants, not intentional wrongdoing, there is likely to be no formal sanction—although the company may have to restate its financial statements to bring its accounting into compliance with applicable accounting rules.|$|R

40|$|This {{project was}} done in partial {{fulfillment}} for a master's degree in Educational Technology from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The Lotus Notes email host program {{is used in the}} Hawaiʻi Department of Education (HIDOE) to provide communication within all public schools in Hawaiʻi. At the school level, Lotus Notes is used for checking and sending email, reading school bulletins and HIDOE memos, posting meeting notes, and generating service requests. Without access to their Lotus Notes accounts, teachers and other staff members feel they are cut off from school communication, and therefore, cannot do their jobs effectively. Many requests for Lotus Notes assistance are generated and given to technology coordinators on a daily basis. Until the technology coordinator can help the teacher or staff member, school communication for that person halts. This instructional module provided mini trainings to teach teachers to perform three Lotus Notes tasks by themselves. The module was delivered through a website that utilized screencasts, a document with text and screenshots, and a downloadable <b>document</b> <b>option</b> for those wanting to print the trainings. Survey results indicated that an overwhelming amount of participants found the trainings to be helpful. They stated they could now accomplish adding a Lotus Notes (LN) application, posting minutes, and activating the workspace tab in LN 8. 5 by themselves. All participants felt more comfortable in using online trainings to learn.

40|$|BackgroundEndovascular {{repair of}} {{abdominal}} aortic anevrysms (AAA) {{is a well}} <b>documented</b> <b>option.</b> This approach is usually performed by surgical cut down of the common femoral arteries (CFA). Total percutaneous access for endovascular aortic anevrysm repair (« preclose technique ») has been reported. However high bleeding risk obese patients are still considered as bad candidates for this method. AimsWe describe our experience of the entirely percutaneous vascular approach using the Prostar XL system, in our obese population in particular. MethodsWe analyzed 164 consecutive patients treated for AAA by endovascular percutaneous route between January 2007 and February 2012. Mean age of our patients was 76 years old. 25. 8 %of our population were obese (mean body mass index = 36). All patients were treated with a bifurcated endoprosthesis. The diameter of the introducer was 18 -French (F) for the main femoral access and 12 F for the controlateral access. The success rate of the procedure has been described elsewhere. A total of non-surgical 328 femoral access sites were closed with the Prostar XL system. ResultsThe success rate of the entirely percutaneous vascular approach procedure was 94, 5 % and reached 100 % in obese population, with a mean delay to hospital discharge of 6 days. Nine procedure failures were deplored. All procedure failures occurred on the 18 F side while the success rate was 100 % with 12 F introducers (p= 0. 002). Re-hospitalization rate due to vascular access complication (haematoma, false anevrysm, femoral abscess) was 2. 4 % after a mean follow-up of 23 months, but no difference between obese and non-obese patients was found. ConclusionOur results indicate that even in obese patients, usually considered as relatively contra-indicated to this strategy, the entirely percutaneous approach using the Prostar device for endovascular treatment of infrarenal AAA is safe...|$|R
