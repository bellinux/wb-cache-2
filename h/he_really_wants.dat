5|$|Peter, Joe and Quagmire drag Cleveland {{to a bar}} {{to get him to}} {{meet some}} women, as he's still reeling from him and Loretta getting a divorce. It doesn’t work so well, so when The Bachelorette comes to Quahog, Peter takes Cleveland to {{audition}} for the show. Cleveland gets nervous at the audition and in an effort to calm him, Peter removes Cleveland’s clothes and then his own. The producers see this and Brian apologizes for what happened with Peter and Cleveland--Brian begins to explain how Cleveland and his wife recently divorced and how Cleveland's confused about what <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> in a relationship.|$|E
5|$|Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a {{bank loan}} {{to start his}} {{construction}} company. When his love for Hasini deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses {{to her that he}} is engaged to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but who <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> is her. On learning of his engagement, Hasini gets dejected, but comes back a few days later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Aravind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marrying Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Hasini, Siddhu replies that if Hasini can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao) that she is going on a college tour.|$|E
25|$|Coco is {{down on his}} luck. He {{lives in}} a cramped {{apartment}} with his daughter and her children. As he is 52 years old, it looks increasingly unlikely that he will get another job. What <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> is {{to work in a}} gas station, and during {{the first part of the}} film he is seen inquiring after such jobs.|$|E
5000|$|Pingi (פינגי) (performer: Galya Yishai) - a human-sized penguin. He {{joins the}} show in later episodes as an {{immigrant}} from the North Pole, and is very curious and friendly, yet tends to be obnoxious at times. His character was excluded from the new version, mostly because most viewers found him annoying. For example, <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> glasses but after he got a couple (actually faux glasses) <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> a moustache.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{directed}} by Ken Annakin. He says <b>he</b> did not <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to do the job, the film <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to make being The Singer Not the Song, but agreed because it gave him {{the chance to see}} South Africa.|$|R
50|$|Looking back {{at those}} years, Vasilyev {{said he was}} {{struggling}} to find himself and {{to figure out what}} <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to do in life.|$|R
25|$|Until {{the passing}} of the Married Women's Property Act in 1870 a wife had no {{independent}} existence under English law, and therefore no right to own property or to enter into contracts separately from her husband, or to sue for divorce, or for the control and custody of her children. Helen is misled by ideas of romantic love and duty into the delusion that she can repair her husband's conduct. Hattersley declares that he wants a pliant wife who will not interfere with his fun, {{but the truth is that}} <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> quite the opposite. Milicent cannot resist her mother's pressure, so she marries Ralph against her will. Wealthy Annabella wants only a title, while Lord Lowborough truly and devotedly loves her. The social climber Jane Wilson seeks wealth.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, {{following}} {{the events of}} [...] "Because You Left", Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) part ways, with Ben taking Locke's body to a butcher for safekeeping. Ben tells Jack to collect any personal items <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> and meet up with him in six hours. Meanwhile, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Aaron Littleton, her adoptive son, have fled their home to escape lawyers demanding a maternity test. They meet up with Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) at a hotel, who implies that Kate should take whatever measures are necessary to protect Aaron. Sun forgives Kate for leaving her husband, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), on the freighter when it exploded (as seen in [...] "There's No Place Like Home").|$|E
500|$|Anarky's {{introduction}} {{during the}} late 1980s {{was part of a}} larger shift among supervillains in the Batman franchise of the time. While many naive and goofy villains of previous eras were abandoned, and more iconic villains made more violent to cater to tastes of a maturing readership, some were introduced to challenge readers to [...] "question the whole bad/good guy divide." [...] Falling into [...] "the stereotype anarchist bomb-toting image", Anarky's design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast. In a review of the Anarky miniseries, Anarky was dubbed an [...] "anti-villain", as opposed to [...] "antihero", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains: [...] "In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the Punisher, an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, but what <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> is to save the world... and maybe he's right." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{after the release}} of No Line on the Horizon. David Fricke of Rolling Stone enjoyed the song, writing, [...] "The rising-falling effect of the harmony voices around Bono... is a perfect picture of where <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> to be, when he gets to the line about 'vision over visibility.'" [...] Blender considered it the high-point of the album, comparing it to the band's 1987 single [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". Reviewer Rob Sheffield complimented the melding of bass, guitar, and vocals, calling it [...] "the kind of gimme-divinity anthem that U2 cut their teeth on, except it really does seem like they've gotten better at these songs now that they've picked up some bummed-out adult grit. Bono actually sounds scared of something in this song, and whether his nightmares are religious or sexual, the fear gives his voice some heft." [...] NME felt that it was the [...] "most impressive" [...] song on the album, describing it as a [...] "gorgeously sparse prayer built around Adam Clayton's heartbeat bassline and Bono's rough growl", and noting that despite its seven-minute length, it did not feel too long. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was more critical of the song, saying it [...] "doesn't have enough of a tune to support the full seven-minute gospel treatment", a sentiment that The Times agreed with.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby {{began his}} review {{by calling the}} film [...] "very {{beautiful}} and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years. It's also so full of violence--of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story—that it's going to prompt {{a lot of people}} who do not know the real effect of movie violence (as I do not) to write automatic condemnations of it." [...] He said, [...] "Although the movie's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos, corruption, and defeat". Among the actors, he commented particularly on William Holden: [...] "After years of giving bored performances in boring movies, Holden comes back gallantly in The Wild Bunch. He looks older and tired, but he has style, both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he's always done, not because <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> the money but because there's simply nothing else to do." [...] Time also liked Holden's performance, describing it as his best since Stalag 17 (a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar); said Robert Ryan gave [...] "the screen performance of his career"; and concluded that [...] "The Wild Bunch contains faults and mistakes" [...] (such as flashbacks [...] "introduced with surprising clumsiness"), but [...] "its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah, along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn, belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lobo {{was placed}} in a crystal by Carol Ferris during his battle with her, Hal Jordan, Sinestro, Atrocitous, and Dex Starr. We never see what he does, but Lobo breaks out thanking her [...] "for the peep show."

50|$|Omkar Kapoor {{had also}} {{assisted}} Bollywood directors like Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Farah Khan and Ahmed Khan, but <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to be an}} actor and hence gave many auditions, of which he bagged ‘Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2’.|$|R
60|$|In {{the second}} row she saw Miles Bjornstam, not with Bea but alone. <b>He</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to see the play! It was a good omen. Who could tell? Perhaps this evening would convert Gopher Prairie to {{conscious}} beauty.|$|R
2500|$|DeYoung, however, has {{repeatedly}} stated that he's {{open to a}} reunion with the other members and that what <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> is {{for all of them}} to [...] "come together as a band." [...] DeYoung also rebutted the claim that Shaw and Young wanted a harder-edged rock sound in contrast to his, saying Shaw's [...] "Renegade" [...] "wasn't a rock song when he brought it in. It was my idea to make it into a rock song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Krekar {{told the}} Kurdish {{magazine}} Awene {{that he wants}} to return to Iraq to fight openly against the Iraqi government and the coalition, but that he lacked travel documents from the Norwegian government. He confirmed to a Norwegian newspaper that he had been correctly quoted. The Norwegian minister of labour and migration, Bjarne Håkon Hanssen, responded that Krekar could leave at any time and that he would be given [...] "travel documents within the day. He'll also get money for airline tickets, taxi cab, and the whole deal. If <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> to go, that is." [...] Krekar is still living in Norway.|$|E
2500|$|The programme's first serial, An Unearthly Child, {{shows that}} the Doctor has a granddaughter, Susan Foreman. In the 1967 serial, Tomb of the Cybermen, when Victoria Waterfield doubts the Doctor can {{remember}} his family because of, [...] "being so ancient", the Doctor says that he can when <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> to—"The {{rest of the time}} they sleep in my mind". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in [...] "The Empty Child" [...] (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, [...] "Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither." [...] The Doctor remarks in response, [...] "Yeah, I know the feeling." [...] In [...] "Smith and Jones" [...] (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, [...] "No, not any more." [...] In both [...] "Fear Her" [...] (2006) and [...] "The Doctor's Daughter" [...] (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.|$|E

2500|$|When Sonya is sent {{to check}} up on the {{progress}} of Toadfish Rebecchi's (Ryan Moloney) guide dog puppy, Rocky, she [...] "soon found love" [...] with the lawyer. Sonya and Toadie began a relationship and Moloney thought that Sonya was perfect for Toadie. Moloney quipped [...] "She's funny and a little bit zany and really accepting and loving as well." [...] However, their romance comes to an end when Toadie tells Sonya that he has got back together with his ex-girlfriend, Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner). A Sunday Mail reporter said Sonya was [...] "simply heartbroken" [...] and [...] "devastated" [...] after she was told about Toadie and Steph's relationship. However, she is unaware that Toadie is pretending to be in love with Steph to help cover up the fact she is carrying Daniel Fitzgerald's (Brett Tucker) child. Toadie becomes torn when Sonya tells him she loves him, but he carries on the lie. Of the situation, Moloney said [...] "Toadie is in love with Sonya, but he's had to give up the chance to follow his heart. Now we see that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> nothing more than {{to be able to tell}} her he loves her and that he wants to be with her – but he just can't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Slumdog Millionaire was released, Patel {{auditioned for}} the role of Zuko by {{submitting}} a tape to the studio. Shyamalan called Patel personally to inform him that he got the part. Training for the film was intense, as he had to learn Wushu and different martial arts. Patel recalls fighting, punching, and throwing and said the experience was [...] "truly amazing." [...] While he was filming Slumdog in India, he would finish a take and turn one of the channels over to the animated series. Even though it is based on a cartoon, he wanted to bring as much of himself as possible to the character he was portraying. Shaun Toub, who was cast as Iroh, describes his character in the first film as [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "free". He compares Zuko's [...] "obsession" [...] to his childhood memories and how kids are always looking for their parents' approval, saying that Zuko just wants his father's. [...] "He isn't necessarily bad, he just {{has a great deal of}} built up anger and forgets to consider others. I think people will understand that he's not bad, he's just angry and hurting because <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> his father to love him, but his father is too busy with other things." [...] He says that Patel is an [...] "18 year old with all this energy," [...] and that Patel was able to influence him into appreciating the business of filmmaking more. While comparing the animated series to the film, he says the film is much more serious. He attributed this change to the director trying to relate to every age group, rather than just kids.|$|E
