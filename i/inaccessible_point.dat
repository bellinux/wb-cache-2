60|$|There {{are also}} {{two or three}} of the {{principal}} laws of space or extension which are unusually fitted for rendering one position or magnitude a mark of another, and thereby contributing to render the science largely deductive. First, the magnitudes of inclosed spaces, whether superficial or solid, are completely determined by the magnitudes of the lines and angles which bound them. Secondly, the length of any line, whether straight or curve, is measured (certain other things being given) by the angle which it subtends, and vicè versa. Lastly, the angle which any two straight lines make with each other at an <b>inaccessible</b> <b>point,</b> is measured by the angles they severally make with any third line we choose to select. By means of these general laws, the measurement of all lines, angles, and spaces whatsoever might be accomplished by measuring a single straight line and a sufficient number of angles; which is the plan actually pursued in the trigonometrical survey of a country; and fortunate it is that this is practicable, the exact measurement of long straight lines being always difficult, and often impossible, but that of angles very easy. Three such generalizations as the foregoing afford such facilities for the indirect measurement of magnitudes (by supplying us with known lines or angles which are marks of the magnitude of unknown ones, and thereby of the spaces which they inclose), that it is easily intelligible how from a few data we can go on to ascertain the magnitude of an indefinite multitude of lines, angles, and spaces, which we could not easily, or could not at all, measure by any more direct process.|$|E

The centering error, of both the instrument and targets, causes significant uncertainties in {{the determination of the}} x, y, z coordinates of the network’s points. In order to assure precise centering for both the instrument and targets, not only for the accessible but also for the <b>inaccessible</b> network’s <b>points,</b> a prototype way of marking is being implied. A special semi-permanent portable metallic stand (photo 1) was manufactured for marking the accessible points. The stand provides forced instrument centering of the order of ± 0. 1 mm. It is light enough to carry, it accelerates and facilitates the centering and leveling of the instrument as well as it eliminates the time needed for the measurements. The applied laboratory checks in order to certify the suitability of its use and the provided accuracy are being described. For the <b>inaccessible</b> <b>points</b> special targets were used. The targets were put in permanent attachments (photo 7), (photo 8), which were also manufactured. Useful conclusions were drawn when these special accessories were used in to a 3 D network, which was established for the monitoring of a new football stadium.
