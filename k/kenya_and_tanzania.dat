5|$|Operation Infinite Reach was the codename for American {{cruise missile}} strikes on al-Qaeda bases in Khost, Afghanistan, and the Al-Shifa {{pharmaceutical}} factory in Khartoum, Sudan, on August 20, 1998. The attacks, {{launched by the}} U.S. Navy, were ordered by President Bill Clinton in retaliation for al-Qaeda's August 7 bombings of American embassies in <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania,</b> which killed 224 people (including 12 Americans) and injured over 4,000 others. Operation Infinite Reach {{was the first time}} the United States acknowledged a preemptive strike against a violent non-state actor.|$|E

The donation is valued at $1million and more than doubles the university's collection of 78rpm records to about 400,000. It also has a special The Harriet Tubman Research Collection, and Environmental Justice and Gender collection housed in the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library.

5|$|The country's {{principal}} {{language is}} Kinyarwanda, which is spoken by most Rwandans. The major European languages {{during the colonial}} era were German, and then French, which was introduced by Belgium and remained an official and widely spoken language after independence. The influx of former refugees from Uganda and elsewhere during the late 20th century has created a linguistic divide between the English-speaking population and the French-speaking remainder of the country. Kinyarwanda, English, and French are all official languages. Kinyarwanda {{is the language of}} government and English is the primary educational medium. Swahili, the lingua franca of the East African Community, is also spoken by some as a second language, particularly returned refugees from <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania.</b> In 2015, Swahili was introduced as a mandatory subject in secondary schools. Inhabitants of Rwanda's Nkombo Island speak Amashi, a language closely related to Kinyarwanda.|$|E

This factory was suspected of assisting Osama Bin Laden in making chemical weapons. The Battle Group also launched a second wave of Tomahawk cruise missiles against Bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. These cruise missile strikes were ordered by President Bill Clinton 13 days after terrorists bombed the U.S. embassies in <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania.</b> Rear Admiral Kevin Green transferred command of the group to incoming Rear Adm. Phillip Balisle on 3 December 1999, aboard the flagship Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|Coffee {{also found}} its way to the Isle of Bourbon, now known as Réunion, in the Indian Ocean. The plant {{produced}} smaller beans and was deemed a different variety of arabica known as var. Bourbon. The Santos coffee of Brazil and the Oaxaca coffee of Mexico are the progeny of that Bourbon tree. Circa 1727, the King of Portugal sent Francisco de Melo Palheta to French Guiana to obtain coffee seeds {{to become a part of}} the coffee market. Francisco initially had difficulty obtaining these seeds, but he captivated the French Governor's wife and she sent him enough seeds and shoots to commence the coffee industry of Brazil. In 1893, the coffee from Brazil was introduced into <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania</b> (Tanganyika), not far from its place of origin in Ethiopia, 600 years prior, ending its transcontinental journey.|$|E
25|$|Uganda first fielded an {{international}} team {{as early as}} 1914, against the East Africa Protectorate, but only began competing regularly from the early 1950s, playing frequent series against regional rivals <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania</b> (then Tanganyika). From 1966, Uganda contributed players to a combined East African team, which was reconstituted as East and Central Africa in 1989. The country's first ICC tournament played {{in its own right}} was the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada. Uganda has played in every subsequent edition of that tournament (now called simply the World Cup Qualifier), but has never qualified for a Cricket World Cup. Since the establishment of the World Cricket League in 2007 (which also forms part of the World Cup qualification process), Uganda has alternated between Division Two and Division Three, most recently placing fifth at the 2015 Division Two event (and consequently being relegated to 2017 Division Three). The team has twice participated in the World Twenty20 Qualifier, in 2012 and 2013, but finished in the bottom four teams on both occasions.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{division}} of the province of East Africa in two new provinces, <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania,</b> Olang' was chosen to be the first African Archbishop of the Anglican Church of Kenya and bishop of Nairobi, with his enthronement taking place at the All Saints Cathedral, in Nairobi, on 3 August 1970, in a ceremony presided by Archbishop Leonard Beecher. Olang' would serve as bishop-in-ordinary for the Armed Forces of Kenya and would held an ecclesiastical court for the discipline of the Kenyan clergy. He worked to strengthen relationships {{with other members of the}} worldwide Anglican Communion, visiting several countries on behalf of the Church of the Province of Kenya, such as Great Britain, Germany, Canada, United States and Australia. He also participated several times at Billy Graham's Evangelical Crusades. Olang' hosted the Anglican Consultative Council in Limuru, Kenya, in 1971. He also would organize the Pan-Christian African Assembly in Nairobi, in 1974, and a conference of Anglican bishops from several parts of the world in Trinity College, in Nairobi, in 1975.|$|E
25|$|The Bantu {{expansion}} was {{a critical}} movement of people in African history and the settling of the continent. People speaking Bantu languages (a branch of the Niger–Congo family) began in the second millennium BC to spread from Cameroon eastward to the Great Lakes region. In the first millennium BC, Bantu languages spread from the Great Lakes to southern and east Africa. An early expansion was south to the upper Zambezi valley in the 2nd century BC. Then, Bantu speakers pushed westward to the savannahs of present-day Angola and eastward into Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe in the 1st century AD. The second thrust from the Great Lakes was eastward, 2,000 years ago, expanding to the Indian Ocean coast, <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania.</b> The eastern group eventually met the southern migrants from the Great Lakes in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Both groups continued southward, with eastern groups continuing to Mozambique and reaching Maputo in the 2nd century AD, and expanding as far as Durban. By the later first millennium AD, the expansion had reached the Great Kei River of South Africa. Sorghum, a major Bantu crop, could not thrive under the winter rainfall of Namibia and the western Cape. Khoisan people inhabited the remaining parts of southern Africa.|$|E
25|$|On January 25, 2011, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, the {{presiding}} {{judge in the}} case, sentenced Ghailani, believed to be 36 {{years old at the}} time, to life in prison for the bombing, stating that any suffering Ghailani experienced {{at the hands of the}} CIA or other agencies while in custody at Guantanamo Bay pales in comparison to the monumental tragedy of the bombings of the U.S. embassies in <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania</b> in 1998, which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and left thousands injured or otherwise impacted by the crimes. The attacks were one of the deadliest non-wartime incidents of international terrorism to affect the United States; they were on a scale not surpassed until the September 11 attacks three years later. Ghailani, who had said he was never involved and did not intend to kill anyone, had been portrayed as cooperating with investigators - yielding information wanted by investigators- and as remorseful by his defense counsel, but that argument of relative non-involvement or remorse was not accepted. He is the fifth person to be sentenced. Four others were sentenced to life in prison in a 2001 trial in Manhattan federal court. Osama bin Laden was also named in the indictment.|$|E
