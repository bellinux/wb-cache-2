50|$|MV Arctic is an <b>icebreaking</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> {{built in}} 1978 at the Port Weller Dry Docks in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. The ship is owned and {{operated}} by the Fednav Group.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, Des Groseilliers {{made her}} first voyage to the Arctic. In April 1984, {{after the opening}} of the {{navigation}} season on the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes, the area froze up, driving six cargo ships ashore and a further eighteen became stuck in the ice. Five icebreakers were assigned to aid the merchant vessels, however, they proved unable to meet the task. Des Groseilliers and [...] were sent to their aid, with Des Groseilliers arriving on 11 April and worked to free the stuck vessels and provide safe passage until 29 April. The following year, the icebreaker escorted the <b>icebreaking</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> [...] to Cameron Island in the Arctic to load 100,000 barrels of oil.|$|E
25|$|While the Finnpusku {{system has}} been criticized for its {{constant}} need of icebreaker assistance during the winter months especially on the Raahe–Luleå -route and replacing the vessels with new <b>icebreaking</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> to free 1–2 icebreakers was proposed by the Finnish Maritime Administration in 2007, the pusher-barge combinations remain in year-round service in the Baltic Sea after more than two decades.|$|R
25|$|Although <b>icebreaking</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> {{had been}} built in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water {{performance}} and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather. However, a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance, making it unsuitable for icebreakers. As a result, the total efficiency of icebreaking ships is 20–40% less than that of good open water vessels of similar size mainly due to the bow form.|$|R
25|$|SA-15 is {{the project}} {{name for a}} series of <b>icebreaking</b> {{multipurpose}} <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> built in Finland for the Soviet Union in the 1980s. The ships, capable of independent operation in all prevailing arctic ice conditions, were the first merchant vessels designed for year-round operations in the Northern Sea Route. For this purpose they have hulls that resemble those of polar icebreakers and propulsion systems capable of withstanding ice loads.|$|R
50|$|Rogday {{was built}} in 1915 as the {{commercial}} <b>icebreaking</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> SS Nevada by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Nevada operated on the Great Lakes until March 1917, when the Imperial Russian government purchased her and renamed her SS Rogday. Due to {{the outbreak of the}} Russian Revolution that month, however, she never was delivered to Russia and remained in North America. Rogday was at Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, on 15 November 1918 when the United States Shipping Board acquired her and transferred her to the U.S. Navy the same day. The Navy assigned her the naval registry identification number 3583 and commissioned her on 22 November 1918 at Sydney as USS Rogday (ID-3583) with Lieutenant Commander J. N. Patton, USNRF, in command.|$|E
5000|$|The steam-powered icebreakers were resurrected in {{the late}} 1950s when the Soviet Union {{commissioned}} the first nuclear-powered icebreaker, Lenin, in 1959. It had a nuclear-turbo-electric powertrain in which the nuclear reactor was used to produce steam for turbogenerators, which in turn produced electricity for propulsion motors. Starting from 1975, the Russians commissioned six Arktika-class nuclear icebreakers of which the last, 2007-built 50 Let Pobedy, is {{the largest and most}} powerful icebreaker in the world [...] at [...] In addition, two shallow-draft Taymyr-class nuclear icebreakers were built in Finland for the Soviet Union {{in the late}} 1980s. The Soviets also built a nuclear-powered <b>icebreaking</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> Sevmorput, which had a single nuclear reactor and a steam turbine directly coupled to the propeller shaft. Russia, which remains the sole operator of nuclear-powered icebreakers, is currently building a new [...] icebreakers to replace the aging Arktika class. The first vessel of this type is expected to enter service in 2017.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} sailing season, the <b>ships</b> carried <b>cargo</b> along the Northern Sea Route, {{supplying}} the settlements and mining colonies on the East Siberian coast, and made several transit voyages from Europe to the Far East and Canada, each 25-day voyage taking around ten days {{less than a}} similar voyage through the Suez Canal. In winter the SA-15 class freighters mainly supported the Norilsk-Dudinka operation, providing a continuous flow of non-ferrous metal concentrates to the smelters of the Kola Peninsula and other industries within the Soviet Union, but also carried other cargo especially when the ice conditions became too difficult for other vessels. In 1990, Norilsk became the first <b>ship</b> to transport <b>cargo</b> from Japan to Europe via the Northern Sea Route. To promote the utilization of the Northern Sea Route, cargo space on board the SA-15 class ships was also leased to Western shipping companies and several experimental voyages for scientific purposes {{were made in the}} 1990s. For years the SA-15 class ships formed the core of the Soviet and later Russian fleet of <b>icebreaking</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|R
25|$|Although <b>icebreaking</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> {{had been}} built in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water {{performance}} and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather while a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance. However, already in the late 1800s captains operating ships in icebound waters discovered that sometimes it was easier to break through ice by running their vessels astern. This was because the forward-facing propellers generated a water flow that lowered the resistance by reducing friction between the ship's hull and ice. These findings resulted in the adoption of bow propellers in older icebreakers operating in the Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, but as forward-facing propellers have a very low propulsion efficiency and the steering ability of a ship is greatly reduced when running astern, it could not be considered a main operating mode for merchant ships.|$|R

5000|$|Built at the Kherson Shipyard in Ukraine and {{completed}} on 25 March 1993, Xue Long started {{her life as}} a Project 10621 <b>icebreaking</b> <b>cargo</b> and supply <b>ship</b> designed for the Russian Arctic. She was purchased by the People's Republic of China and converted to a polar research and re-supply vessel in 1994. [...] In 2007, the ship was extensively upgraded to extend her service life by another 15 years. During the mid-life refit, the ship received a new superstructure that considerably changed her external appearance. She received another technical update in 2013 which included replacing her main engine.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the ships}} in the Fednav fleet are {{strengthened}} for navigation in ice. They work in locations such as the Beaufort Sea and Bent Horn at latitude 76°77′ north. Vessels such as the Federal Pendant and Federal Power, for example, have been classified with the Ice Class 1A* notation by Det Norske Veritas. This allows them {{to work in the}} Canadian Arctic with the assistance of icebreakers. Two vessels in the Fednav fleet, 1978-built Arctic and 2006-built Umiak I, are fitted with icebreaker bows and have enough ice-strengthening and installed power to operate independently in Arctic ice conditions. In 2012, Fednav ordered a third <b>icebreaking</b> <b>cargo</b> vessel. The <b>ship,</b> Nunavik, was delivered in January 2014.|$|R
50|$|Fednav also {{operates}} a similar ice-strengthened bulk carrier, Arctic, which shares the load with Umiak I. On 30 October 2012, Fednav announced it had ordered a third <b>icebreaking</b> <b>cargo</b> vessel from Universal Shipbuilding Corporation's Tsu shipyard in Japan. The Polar Class 4 vessel, Nunavik, entered service in January 2014.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, PLAN begun to convert Qiongsha-class <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> to {{ambulance}} transport {{to meet the}} urgent maritime/naval medical needs. A pair of Qiongsha-class converted {{was not enough to}} meet the need, so some other <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> that can also carry passengers were selected to be converted to <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> medical evacuation (APR) to supplement the converted Qiongsha-class. The reason <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> that can also carrying passengers were specifically selected is because neither the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> nor the passenger ship could meet the requirement for conversion: the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> lacked the accommodation and comfort for crew and patient because it does not carry passengers, and passenger ship does not have the room needed to house the medical facilities and support equipment, so both types would require higher conversion cost because more work is needed for both types. In contrast, <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> that also carries passengers would cost less to convert to <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> medical evacuation (APR) because it has what both <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> and passenger ship lack. As a result, Type Long March cargo-passenger ship was selected for conversion.|$|R
