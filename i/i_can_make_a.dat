She has said of teaching at a community college, [...] "I feel like <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> greater difference in their lives. I just love that population. It just feels really comfortable to me. I love the women who are coming back to school and getting their degrees, because they're so focused." ...|$|E

This {{is a very big}} moment for me because I want to continue my career in a new part of the world where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> major contribution and help grow the game I love." [...] After the announcement of the transfer to Sydney FC, Juventus wished good luck to their former captain. Francesco Totti and Filippo Inzaghi said they were saddened by his departure.|$|E

500|$|Ruby Messer Barber {{had this}} to say about joining the WAVES, [...] "It was a choice of adventure. I didn't have any brothers, and I thought that's {{something}} I can do, one way <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> contribution. My sisters thought it was great, but they were not interested. There was too much discipline and routine involved. I felt like it would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to see what it was all about. It gave a sense of confidence. At the time girls just didn't join the WAVES or go into the military. But my Dad, he said, you'll be OK".|$|E
500|$|Hemingway greatly admired Cézanne {{and early}} in his career crafted his prose {{in a way that would}} {{resonate}} with that painter's work. He said in a 1949 interview that [...] "Cézanne is my painter after the early painters.... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> landscape like Mr. Paul Cézanne, I learned how... by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times." [...] Hemingway wanted the structure of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] to resemble a Cézanne—with a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background. In a letter to Stein from August 1924, he wrote, [...] "I have finished two long stories... and finished the long one I worked on before I went to Spain where I am doing the country like Cézanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit. It is about 100 pages long and nothing happens and the country is swell. I made it all up".|$|E
500|$|Inspired by {{this early}} success, Kubrick {{quit his job}} at Look and visited {{professional}} filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about {{the technical aspects of}} film-making. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker {{because of the number of}} bad films he had seen, remarking, [...] "I don't know a goddamn thing about movies, but I know <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> better film than that". He began making Flying Padre (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally going to be called [...] "Sky Pilot", a pun on the slang term for a priest. [...] During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in Flying Padre are later echoed in [...] (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin (1925) and Ivan the Terrible (1944/1958).|$|E

Nursing is related to applied science, but accountancy is not. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> inference here that UK {{students are}} more successful in social science majors, which are not technical such as law, art, English literature, and sociology. It is interesting to say that UK students are more frequent in English literature about 20 %, which is not scant.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the second}} half, Mönchengladbach's flurry of shots on goal didn't stop. Heynckes and Carsten Nielsen {{had made it}} 8–0 by the hour mark, at which time Otto Rehhagel had asked Sigfried Held to warm-up {{and get ready to}} go onto the pitch, but Held declined, saying: [...] "Coach, do you really think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> {{difference}} to the outcome of the game?"

2500|$|Zarifopol, {{sometimes}} {{using the}} pen names PZ and Anton Gherman, returned {{as one of}} the main columnists at Viața Românească and its satellite, Adevărul Literar și Artistic. Despite his material difficulties, Zarifopol categorically refused Ibrăileanu and Petre Andrei's offers to take a professorate at Iași. In early 1920, he complained that the [...] "endless infirmities of my children, my wife, and myself" [...] prevented him from publishing his cultural journalism as an academic volume, which would have qualified him for the office. In 1924, Zarifopol informed his protectors that he now had [...] "a holy terror of officialdom", and that he resented Iași for its support for the National-Christian Defense League, a form of [...] "nationalist imbecility and charlatanry". As he noted: [...] "all things considered, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living from journalism alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1992, {{the tabloid}} {{television}} show Hard Copy broadcast a secretly videotaped conversation between Fisher and Paul Makely, {{the owner of}} a gym in Massapequa. In the tape, recorded hours before she agreed to the plea in court, Fisher could be seen talking about her future, saying that she wanted to get married to Makely so he could visit her in prison. Fisher explained that her lawyer believed requiring people to be married for such visits was unconstitutional, and that she intended to challenge the law on this matter. Fisher could be seen on the tape saying: [...] "That will keep my name in the press. I want my name in the press. Why? Because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> lot of money. I figure if I'm going through all this pain and suffering, I'm getting a Ferrari." ...|$|E

5000|$|Regina Spektor, Randy Newman and Arcade Fire did {{ultimately}} submit {{material to}} the project, albeit later than expected. In an October 2011 interview published in Rolling Stone, Gabriel said, [...] "I've sort of given up waiting for the others ...

2500|$|The band {{continued}} {{this transformation}} with an unexpected cover of Joy Division's [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart", which was released {{as a single}} in 1988 on Product Inc. in a confusing array of 7" [...] and 12" [...] inch formats. Both Gira and Jarboe sang lead vocals on {{different versions of the}} song. In later years Gira dismissed this release as a mistake, {{and for a long time}} refused to reissue his own vocal version, although Jarboe's version was re-released much sooner. However their version of the song was a hit on US college radio in 1988, which led to the group being offered a major label deal at Uni/MCA. [...] "I'd worked so hard all my life", said Gira. [...] "At 15, I was digging ditches in the desert in Israel, and I put myself through college painting houses. I never saw any money from any of our records. So by the time I finally got that carrot dangled in front of me, it was like, 'at last, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living at what I love to do.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 19 November 2010, it was {{announced}} that she was to be ennobled to sit in the House of Lords as a Conservative Party peer. [...] "I was completely taken by surprise when I took the call from the Prime Minister in September," [...] Heyhoe Flint said. [...] "Obviously I am really thrilled at my appointment but still very humbled at the thought of joining such a historic institution ... My background in sport, journalism, charity and community work will I hope stand me in good stead, and I hope <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> positive contribution as a working peer. I will certainly look forward to the commute from one Lord's to another Lords." [...] She was subsequently invested as a life peer on 21 January 2011 taking the title Baroness Heyhoe Flint, of Wolverhampton in the County of West Midlands. The formal designation of her title without a hyphen broke a rule that peerage titles could only have one word, previously observed by the likes of Lord Lloyd-George, Lord Alanbrooke and Lord Lloyd-Webber.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2006, {{various sources}} {{reported}} Shetty's joining PETA {{as part of}} an advertising campaign against the use of wild animals in circuses. According to a PETA India press release, Shetty is a long-time PETA supporter and has assisted the campaign by posing for photographs in a figure-hugging tiger costume. She explained that her crouching in a cage was uncomfortable during the photoshoot, but that her discomfort was insignificant compared to the pain suffered by the creatures. [...] "These once dignified animals only leave their cages, which are barely larger than the size of their bodies, for a few minutes each day to be forced into the ring to perform tricks which make no sense and are upsetting to them. The best way to help animals suffering in circuses is to boycott the circus". Shetty revealed in a later interview that she felt strongly about this cause and that she was appalled to hear of the cruel treatment suffered by such animals. [...] "I thought I should stop that.
