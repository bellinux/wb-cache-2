30|$|In the {{components}} discussed so far, the changing number of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> leads to a proportional {{change in the}} volume of work. This would result in an excessively volatile productivity development caused by calendar-effects. Therefore, working time elasticities specific to economic branches are needed to approximate the correlation between a change of number of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> and a change of labour volume. These working-time elasticities should measure by how many hours the annual hours worked change when more or less <b>working</b> <b>days</b> are <b>available,</b> and hence the latter {{are not included in}} annual hours worked one-to-one. As suitable data for estimating these effects are not available, we take the elasticities to correspond to <b>working</b> <b>days</b> elasticities of production calculated by the German Bundesbank. These elasticities indicate the percentage by which the production increases if the potential working hours are extended by one per cent due to (the fraction of) an additional <b>working</b> <b>day.</b> The <b>estimated</b> <b>working</b> <b>day</b> effect reflects the difference of production carried out at a normal work day and the production carried out at a weekend day.|$|R

In 2009 strike action between {{the public and private sectors}} were evenly spread, with 49 strikes in each sector. The article analyses the three main measures of labour disputes; <b>working</b> <b>days</b> lost, stoppages and workers involved - by industry, region, cause, size and duration. The statistics are put into context by considering <b>estimates</b> of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> lost per 1, 000 employees and working time lost through strikes as a proportion of time actually worked. This year's article will present data in both a Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2003 and 2007 basis, although the majority of the article will be solely SIC 2007. Data is taken from a number of sources including regular centralised returns from some industries and public bodies, as well as directly from the employer or trade union involved after ONS has been notified of a dispute from press reports. This article presents final figures on labour disputes for 2009 and analyses the figures in more depth than the provisional estimates published as part of monthly Labour Market Statistics Bulletin. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: A global {{programme}} {{to eliminate}} lymphatic filariasis (GPELF) is underway, yet two key programmatic features are currently still lacking: (1) {{the extension of}} efforts to all lymphatic filariasis (LF) endemic countries, and (2) the expansion of geographic coverage of mass drug administration (MDA) within countries. For varying levels of scale-up of MDA, we assessed the health benefits and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) associated with LF eradication, projected the potential savings due to decreased morbidity management needs, and estimated potential household productivity gains {{as a result of}} reduced LF-related morbidity. Methods: We extended an LF transmission model to track hydrocele and lymphoedema incidence in order to obtain estimates of the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to scaling up MDA over a period of 50  years. We then estimated the ICERs and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves associated with different rates of MDA scale-up. Health systems savings were estimated by considering the averted morbidity, treatment-seeking behaviour and morbidity management costs. Gains in worker productivity were estimated by multiplying <b>estimated</b> <b>working</b> <b>days</b> lost as a result of morbidity with country-specific per-worker agricultural wages. Results: Our projections indicate that a massive scaling-up of MDA could lead to 4. 38 million incremental DALYs averted over a 50 -year time horizon compared to a scenario which mirrors current efforts against LF. In comparison to maintaining the current rate of progress against LF, massive scaling-up of MDA—pursuing LF eradication as soon as possible—was most likely to be cost-effective above a willingness to pay threshold of US 71. 5 /DALY averted. Intensified MDA scale-up was also associated with lower ICERs. Furthermore, this could result in health systems savings up to US 483 million. Extending coverage to all endemic areas could generate additional economic benefits through gains in worker productivity between US 3. 4 and US 14. 4 billion. Conclusions: In addition to ethical and political motivations for scaling-up MDA rapidly, this analysis provides economic support for increasing the intensity of MDA programmes...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{influenza}} is a prevalent {{and highly}} contagious acute respiratory disease that, year on year, results in increased {{morbidity and mortality}} on a global scale. Because of the widespread and debilitating nature of the disease, annual influenza epidemics result in substantial workplace absenteeism, and the associated cost of lost productivity is a significant component of the substantial financial burden of the disease to society. The objective of this review was to identify studies that had attempted to quantify the impact of influenza upon otherwise healthy adults in terms of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> lost associated with an episode of influenza. Studies were included if they reported <b>estimates</b> of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> lost due to clinical, physician and/or self-diagnosis in adult patients or their dependants, or where this figure could be estimated from the data. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS and the Cochrane Collaboration for articles published since 1995 in English, French or German. Of the 289 papers identified in the search, 28 (9. 7 %) met the inclusion criteria. The studies, involving study sites in North America, Western Europe, Asia and Australia, were categorized into three groups: (i) those reporting influenza diagnoses confirmed by laboratory testing, i. e. studies where influenza was the unambiguous cause of the <b>working</b> <b>days</b> lost (n_=_ 7 studies reported in ten publications); (ii) those where influenza was confirmed by a physician without an accompanying laboratory test (n_=_ 4 studies); and (iii) those where influenza was self-reported by study participants (n_=_ 14 studies). Qualitative reporting of results was performed {{because of the large}} degree of heterogeneity observed between studies, potentially complicating the interpretation of any meta-analysis. The results from studies involving a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis suggested that the mean number of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> lost ranged between 1. 5 and 4. 9 days per episode. Those papers that detailed <b>working</b> <b>days</b> lost per episode following physician diagnosis of influenza reported a range of 3. 7 - 5. 9 days per episode. Finally, estimates from papers reporting <b>working</b> <b>days</b> lost per episode of self-reported influenza ranged fromIndirect-costs, Influenza-virus-infections, Productivity-costs...|$|R

The purpose is to quantify the impact of both legal systems on the long-term performance of M&A transactions. To carry out this research, a specific methodology was developed and the results of which are evaluated. Two legal structures for M&A transactions were retained: the purchase of shares (share deal), and the purchase of assets (asset deal). Each of these acquisition structures was then subdivided into eleven steps composing the process, for example from preliminary information, letter of intent, due diligence, stock or asset purchase agreement, closing, to litigation with formal summons. Performance was then measured by taking into account time, cost, and satisfaction factors.

30|$|Ex ante {{control chart}} uses the project’s {{baseline}} schedule {{to calculate the}} control limits between which natural variability is allowed. The idea behind {{this is that the}} project performance is impacted by the variations of the activity durations placed in the different parts of the baseline, as well as estimation, measurement and implementation errors coming from the impossibility to estimate, measure and implement the actual situation as it occurs. Hence, various scenarios of the activity duration estimates should be used here for the Phase I analysis. For this purpose, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), as a well-known method to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty, is used to simulate actual duration values on certain user-defined ranges (Izadi and Kimiagari 2014; Rao and Naikan 2014; Chiadamrong and Piyathanavong 2017). Once the actual duration <b>estimates</b> of all <b>working</b> <b>days</b> are simulated for a number nrs of simulation runs, project performance indicators of each simulation run can be calculated for all review periods, by which the tolerance limits can be estimated.|$|R
