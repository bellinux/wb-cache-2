5|$|Gimbal: The gimbal {{is known}} as the 'Cardan' {{suspension}} after Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), yet it was known long before him. The British scientist Joseph Needham writes that the earliest confirmed use of <b>gimbals</b> in Europe is the 9th century recipe book Little Key of Painting and Belgian chemist and historian of science Mappae clavicula, which mentioned a vase surrounded by rings which allowed it to be undisturbed when in a rolling motion. Needham and BGeorge Sarton both write that an Arabic translation—dated to roughly the era of Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833)—of an ancient Greek work now lost (i.e. Pneumatica) by 3rd-century BC Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (c. 280– c. 220 BC) contains a description of <b>gimbals</b> used to support an inkpot that could wet a pen on any of its sides, yet Needham suspects Arabic interpolation and doubts total authenticity, while Sarton asserts {{that for the most part}} the Arabic translation is faithful to Philo's lost original, hence Philo should be credited with the invention of the gimbal. Around 180 AD, the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) inventor and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) — who also created a rotary fan and zoetrope lamp—invented a 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions', or 'Bedclothes Censer'. This incense burner had a series of metal rings which could be moved in any direction while the burner in the middle remained constantly level. This is the first clear reference in China of the gimbal, although there is a hint in the writing of Sima Xiangru (179–117 BC) that this device existed in the 2nd century BC (i.e., 'the metal rings burning perfume'). The gimbal incense burner is mentioned in subsequent dynasties, while silverwork specimens of gimbal incense burners from the Tang Dynasty (618–907) still exist. In the Liang Dynasty (502–557) there is mention of <b>gimbals</b> used in hinges for doors and windows, while an unnamed artisan presented a warming stove to Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690–705) in 692 which employed <b>gimbals</b> to keep it constantly balanced.|$|E
5|$|Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes {{largely from the}} choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. For example, in 15 BC the philosopher and writer Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing. The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital. Around 180 AD, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings. Ding also used <b>gimbals</b> as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known zoetrope lamp.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on <b>gimbals</b> so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E

The user input device includes a handle sized and shaped to be gripped by a human {{hand and a}} <b>gimbal</b> assembly within the handle. The <b>gimbal</b> assembly includes a first <b>gimbal</b> component, a second <b>gimbal</b> component coupled to the first <b>gimbal</b> component such that the second <b>gimbal</b> component is rotatable relative to the first <b>gimbal</b> component about a first axis, and a third <b>gimbal</b> component coupled to the second <b>gimbal</b> component such that the third <b>gimbal</b> component is rotatable relative to the second <b>gimbal</b> component about a second axis...|$|R

40|$|Comparing {{with the}} normal {{mechanical}} inertial stabilized platform (ISP), the novel ISP with magnetic bearing {{to suspend the}} yaw <b>gimbal</b> owns the ability of isolating the vibration and disturbance of external <b>gimbal.</b> However, on the one hand, complex structure of the magnetically suspended <b>gimbal</b> introduces parametric uncertainties into modeling of magnetic suspension force, and the disturbance of magnetic fields brings the unmodeled force into dynamics of magnetically suspended <b>gimbal.</b> On the other hand, external disturbances such as wind drag affect the stability of magnetically suspended <b>gimbal.</b> Therefore, H∞robust controllers for translation and tilting of <b>gimbal</b> are designed to dampen the negative influence on stability and improve the robustness of system.

5|$|The spacewalk {{scene on}} the Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of the}} most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on <b>gimbals</b> at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E
5|$|Filming resumed {{two days}} later at Elstree, where Spielberg swiftly filmed the library, Portuguese freighter, and catacombs sequences. The {{steamship}} fight in the prologue's 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty-by-forty-feet deck built on <b>gimbals</b> at Elstree. A dozen dump tanks—each holding three hundred imperial gallons (360 U.S. gallons; 3000lb.) of water—were used in the scene. Henry's house was filmed at Mill Hill, London. Indiana and Kazim's fight in Venice {{in front of a}} ship's propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a long focus lens to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller than they really were. Two days later, on August 4, another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats, was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex. The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while the boats passed between, close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt. The following day, filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth, which doubled for Indiana's college (as it had in Raiders of the Lost Ark).|$|E
25|$|After antiquity, <b>gimbals</b> {{remained}} {{widely known}} in the Near East. In the Latin West, reference to the device appeared again in the 9th century recipe book called the Little Key of Painting Mappae clavicula. The French inventor Villard de Honnecourt depicts a set of <b>gimbals</b> in his famous sketchbook (see right). In the early modern period, dry compasses were suspended in <b>gimbals.</b>|$|E
40|$|Derivation of CMG {{steering}} laws was considered. The type of CMG considered was {{a double}} <b>gimbal</b> one {{which has a}} constant magnitude momentum vector. The equations for the generation of torque of an inertially fixed CMG are presented. To realize a particular commanded torque, the <b>gimbal</b> rates of the CMG must be specified. These <b>gimbal</b> rates are shown to be functions of <b>gimbal</b> angle orientation and the commanded torque. The conventional cross-product steering law was derived by minimizing a function which was {{the square of the}} magnitude of the error between the commanded torque and the realizable torque of the gyro. This steering law was severely dependent upon the inner <b>gimbal</b> angle. When the inner <b>gimbal</b> reaches 90 degrees, the cross product law requires infinite outer <b>gimbal</b> rates to realize finite torque values...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{modelling}} and control of three axis camera pan-roll-tilt unit (<b>gimbal)</b> which {{was meant to be}} attached to a multi rotor platform for aerial photography. The goal of the thesis was to develop a control structure for steering and active gyro stabilization of the <b>gimbal,</b> with aid from a mathematical model of the <b>gimbal.</b> Lagrange equations, together with kinematic equations and data from CAD drawings, were used to calculate a dynamics model of the <b>gimbal.</b> This model was set up as a Simulink simulation environment. Code for sensor reading and actuator control was written to the <b>gimbal’s</b> microprocessor and the code for the control structure in the <b>gimbal</b> was developed in parallel with a control structure in the simulation environment. The thesis resulted in a method for mathematical modelling of the <b>gimbal</b> and a control structure, for steering and active gyro stabilization of the <b>gimbal,</b> implemented in its control unit {{as well as in the}} simulation environmen...|$|R
50|$|Later, Stover meets <b>Gimbal,</b> who openly proclaims a plan {{to fight}} the society system. <b>Gimbal</b> is also open about looking for {{political}} leadership with his anti-society stance. The two shake hands, but Stover is uncertain {{what to make of}} <b>Gimbal.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Gimbals</b> {{are also}} used to mount {{everything}} from small camera lenses to large photographic telescopes.|$|E
25|$|Handheld 3-axis <b>gimbals</b> {{are used}} in {{stabilization}} systems designed to give the camera operator the independence of handheld shooting without camera vibration or shake. Powered by three brushless motors, the <b>gimbals</b> {{have the ability to}} keep the camera level on all axes as the camera operator moves the camera. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) responds to movement and utilizes its three separate motors to stabilize the camera.|$|E
25|$|A {{gyroscope}} is a wheel {{mounted in}} two or three <b>gimbals,</b> which are a pivoted supports that allow the rotation of the wheel about a single axis. A set of three <b>gimbals,</b> one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost gimbal to have an orientation remaining independent of the orientation, in space, of its support. In the case of a gyroscope with two <b>gimbals,</b> the outer gimbal, which is the gyroscope frame, is mounted so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane determined by the support. This outer gimbal possesses one degree of rotational freedom and its axis possesses none. The inner gimbal is mounted in the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal) so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane that is always perpendicular to the pivotal axis of the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal). This inner gimbal has two degrees of rotational freedom.|$|E
40|$|A {{steering}} law {{is presented}} which {{has all the}} features required for space applications, assuming the CMG outer <b>gimbal</b> freedom is unlimited. The reason {{is the idea of}} mounting all the outer <b>gimbal</b> axes of the CMGs parallel to each other. This allows the decomposition of the steering law problem into a linear one for the inner <b>gimbal</b> angle rates and a planar one for the outer <b>gimbal</b> angle rates. The inner <b>gimbal</b> angle rates are calculated first, since they are not affected by the outer <b>gimbal</b> angle rates. For the calculation of the outer rates, the inner rates are then known quantities. An outer <b>gimbal</b> angle distribution function (to avoid singularities internal to the total angular momentum envelope) generates distribution rates next, and finally the pseudoinverse method is used to insure that the desired total torque is delivered...|$|R

2500|$|The ST-124-M3 {{inertial}} platform contains three gimbals: the outer <b>gimbal</b> (which can rotate 360° about the roll or X {{axis of the}} vehicle), the middle <b>gimbal</b> (which can rotate ±45° about the yaw or Z axis of the vehicle), and the inner or inertial <b>gimbal</b> (which can rotate 360° about the pitch or Y axis of the vehicle). The inner <b>gimbal</b> is a platform to which are fixed several components: ...|$|R
25|$|Essentially, a {{gyroscope}} {{is a top}} {{combined with}} a pair of <b>gimbals.</b> Tops were invented in many different civilizations, including classical Greece, Rome, and China. Most of these were not utilized as instruments.|$|E
25|$|Skylab carried three CMGs, {{mounted with}} their casings (and {{therefore}} their rotor axes when the <b>gimbals</b> {{were set to}} zero) facing in three mutually perpendicular directions. This ensured that the six 'polar blind spots' were spaced 90 degrees apart from each other. The 45 degree zero offset then ensured that the three 'blind strips' of the outer <b>gimbals</b> would pass halfway between neighbouring 'polar blind spots' and at a maximum distance from each other. The whole arrangement ensured that the 'blind areas' of the three CMGs never overlapped, and thus {{that at least two}} of the three rotor spins could be pointed in any given direction.|$|E
25|$|The angular {{positions}} of <b>gimbals</b> on their axes were measured by resolvers, which sent their {{signals to the}} LVDA. The LVDA was the input/output device for the LVDC. It performed the necessary processing of signals to make these signals acceptable to the LVDC.|$|E
40|$|The Magnetic <b>Gimbal</b> Proof-of-Concept Hardware activities, accomplishments, {{and test}} results are discussed. The Magnetic <b>Gimbal</b> Fabrication and Test (MGFT) program {{addressed}} {{the feasibility of}} using a magnetic <b>gimbal</b> to isolate an Electro-Optical (EO) sensor from the severe angular vibrations induced during the firing of divert and attitude control system (ACS) thrusters during space flight. The MGFT effort was performed in parallel with the fabrication and testing of a mechanically <b>gimballed,</b> flex pivot based isolation system by the Hughes Aircraft Missile Systems Group. Both servo systems supported identical EO sensor assembly mockups to facilitate direct comparison of performance. The results obtained from the MGFT effort indicate that the magnetic <b>gimbal</b> exhibits the ability to provide significant performance advantages over alternative mechanically <b>gimballed</b> techniques...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{for control}} of {{spacecraft}} maneuvers {{through the use of}} single <b>gimbal</b> control moment gyroscopes are developed. The development employs an integrated model of the spacecraft dynamics with the control moment gyroscope dynamics. Smooth and continuous open-loop control profiles are obtained which minimize a weighted function of maneuver time, magnitude of control effort, and proximity to singular <b>gimbal</b> configurations. Closed-loop state feedback control laws are derived by invoking Lyapunov stability theory. The schemes are presented for implementing the commanded state feedback: <b>gimbal</b> rate control and <b>gimbal</b> acceleration control. The appropriate handling of singular <b>gimbal</b> configurations is also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{fast-changing}} viewing geometry during passes, {{the direction}} in which the <b>gimbal</b> must point throughout the pass must be pre-computed. [...] The list of directions for the <b>gimbal</b> to point was calculated based on the ISS GPS state vector and attitude quaternion. [...] The need for this list to be accurate was very important because of error in ISS orientation predictions and because the <b>gimbal</b> lacked any encoders, so all <b>gimbal</b> movement had to be done through dead reckoning. [...] Once the flight system detects the beacon from the ground system, it tracks beacon with the <b>gimbal.</b>|$|R
25|$|One {{advantage}} of limited gimbal movement such as Skylab's is that singularities are {{less of a}} problem. If Skylab's inner <b>gimbals</b> {{had been able to}} reach 90 degrees or more away from zero, then the 'North and South poles' could have become singularities; the gimbal stops prevented this.|$|E
25|$|A {{gyroscope}} flywheel {{will roll}} or resist about the output axis depending upon whether the output <b>gimbals</b> {{are of a}} free or fixed configuration. Examples of some free-output-gimbal devices would be the attitude reference gyroscopes used to sense or measure the pitch, roll and yaw attitude angles in a spacecraft or aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In {{spacecraft}} propulsion, rocket {{engines are}} generally {{mounted on a}} pair of <b>gimbals</b> to allow a single engine to vector thrust about both the pitch and yaw axes; or sometimes just one axis is provided per engine. To control roll, twin engines with differential pitch or yaw control signals are used to provide torque about the vehicle's roll axis.|$|E

5000|$|The optical <b>gimbal</b> {{transceiver}} {{holds the}} uplink camera and the laser collimator on a 2-axis <b>gimbal.</b> [...] Due to laser safety considerations, the <b>gimbal</b> may not shine on {{anything on the}} ISS. [...] To avoid this, the <b>gimbal</b> is designed with mechanical stops and electromechanical limit switches so that its field of regard (the area where it can point) is limited to 36° wide in elevation and 106° in azimuth, where the azimuthal axis is generally {{in the direction of}} motion of the ISS. [...] Because of the <b>gimbal</b> field of regard geometry, the flight system can only perform downlinks when the ISS is north of the ground station.|$|R
50|$|The {{center axle}} of the {{flywheel}} {{acts as a}} single <b>gimbal,</b> and if aligned vertically, allows for the 360 degrees of yaw in a horizontal plane. However, for instance driving up-hill requires a second pitch <b>gimbal,</b> and driving {{on the side of}} a sloped embankment requires a third roll <b>gimbal.</b>|$|R
25|$|Principal {{rotations}} {{have the}} advantage of modelling a number of physical systems such as <b>gimbals,</b> and joysticks, so are easily visualised, and are a very compact way of storing a rotation. But they are difficult to use in calculations as even simple operations like combining rotations are expensive to do, and suffer from a form of gimbal lock where the angles cannot be uniquely calculated for certain rotations.|$|E
25|$|Rockets {{consist of}} a {{propellant}}, {{a place to put}} propellant (such as a propellant tank), and a nozzle. They may also have one or more rocket engines, directional stabilization device(s) (such as fins, vernier engines or engine <b>gimbals</b> for thrust vectoring, gyroscopes) and a structure (typically monocoque) to hold these components together. Rockets intended for high speed atmospheric use also have an aerodynamic fairing such as a nose cone, which usually holds the payload.|$|E
25|$|By September 1931, his rockets had the now {{familiar}} {{appearance of}} a smooth casing with tail-fins. He began experimenting with gyroscopic guidance, and made a flight test of such a system in April 1932. A gyroscope mounted on <b>gimbals</b> electrically controlled steering vanes in the exhaust, similar to the system used by the German V-2 over 10years later. Though the rocket crashed after a short ascent, the guidance system had worked, and Goddard considered the test a success.|$|E
