All members of the House were Federalists, as Rosas had restored the legislature that had been in place under Dorrego, and which had subsequently been dissolved by Lavalle. A liberal Federalist faction, which accepted dictatorship as a temporary necessity, called for the adoption of a constitution. Rosas was unwilling to govern constrained by a constitutional framework and only grudgingly relinquished his dictatorial powers. His term of office ended soon after, on 5 December 1832.|$|E

40|$|In DSGE {{literature}} {{there has}} been an increasing awareness on the role that the banking sector can play in macroeconomic activity. In most of recent works, purely <b>financial</b> <b>instabilities</b> and frictions are derived from intermediaries that affect the real economy by means of a credit channel or a balance sheet channel. We model financial intermediation as in Gertler and Karadi (2011) {{to take into account the}} bank leverage constraint in the propagation of shocks to the real economy. Within this framework, the evolution of estimated shocks and the instabilities in the structural parameters show that time-variation should be crucial in any attempted empirical analysis. However, DSGE modelling usually fails to take into account inherent nonlinearities of the economy, especially in crisis time periods. Hence, we propose a novel time-varying parameter (TVP) state-space estimation method for VAR processes both for homoskedastic and heteroskedastic error structures. We conduct an exhaustive empirical exercise that includes the comparison of the out-of-sample predictive performance of the estimated DSGE model with that of standard VARs, Bayesian VARs and TVP-VARs. Overall, a first attempt is made to find macro-financial micro-founded DSGE models as well as adaptive TVP-VARs, which are able to deal with <b>financial</b> <b>instabilities</b> via incorporating banking intermediation...|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the greater {{predictability}} in economic and financial performance associated with the Great Moderation caused firms to hold less capital and to be less concerned about liquidity positions.

25|$|Brisbane Roar was {{established}} by Queensland Lions SC in March 2005 as the team that would represent Brisbane in the newly formed A-League. Queensland Lions held a majority share in the club through to 2008. It is understood that in 2008 the 25% share owned by Queensland Lions was bought by the Roar board at a discount. This led to <b>financial</b> <b>instability</b> in the club and rumours of the club handing back its A-League licence to Football Federation Australia (FFA). On 16 April 2009 reports surfaced that the FFA were willing to purchase up to a 55% share in the Roar to ensure its financial stability. This 55% encompassed CEO Lawrence Oudendyk's 15% per cent interest, the 25% previously owned by Queensland Lions and the 15% share owned by Rob Jones and Rob Jansen. FFA advised that any takeover by the FFA would see Oudendyk replaced as CEO. Ultimately a new Brisbane-based ownership structure was formed with investors Emmanuel Drivas, Emmanuel Kokoris, Claude Baradel and Serge Baradel taking over 100% ownership of the club.|$|E
25|$|Luton Town Football Club is an English {{professional}} football club {{based in the}} town of Luton, Bedfordshire. Founded in 1885 as a merger of two leading local sides, Luton Town were the first professional team in the south of England, fully professional by 1891. Luton were also one of the first southern Football League clubs, joining in 1897 before leaving again in 1900 due to <b>financial</b> <b>instability.</b> The club rejoined the League for the 1920–21 season. George Thompson became the club's first manager four years later, but only lasted eight months before leaving, and wasn't replaced until 1927. 1936–37 saw Luton promoted to the Second Division, and the first post-war seasons saw a strong Luton team begin to emerge. Record goalscorer Gordon Turner's arrival into the first team in 1950 helped Luton to promotion to the First Division {{for the first time in}} 1954–55, and the team remained there until relegation in the 1959–60 season. Luton also reached the 1959 FA Cup Final, where Turner's absence and the team's questionable preparation for the game meant that Luton lost 2–1 to Nottingham Forest. The club was subsequently relegated three times in six seasons, reaching the Fourth Division by 1965–66. However, players such as Malcolm Macdonald ensured that the club was then promoted twice in three years and was back in the Second Division by 1970.|$|E

25|$|External threats closely {{shaped the}} course of the Revolution. The Revolutionary Wars {{beginning}} in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula, the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine – achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries. Internally, popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly, culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins. The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror, from 1793 until 1794, established price controls on food and other items, abolished slavery in French colonies abroad, dechristianised society through {{the creation of a new}} calendar and the expulsion of religious figures, and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies. Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror, with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000. After the Thermidorian Reaction, an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795. The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections, debt repudiations, <b>financial</b> <b>instability,</b> persecutions against the Catholic clergy, and significant military conquests abroad. Dogged by charges of corruption, the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799. Napoleon, who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns, went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire, setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

Five institutional spheres are introduced which are in need of systemic change, due to the entrenched contradictions and problems which the current set of institutions generate.
