The Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre provides information on the heritage coast, and the whole length of the site can be visited via the South West Coast Path.|$|E
5|$|The novels {{take place}} on the fantasy world of Krynn, created {{specifically}} for the gameplay. The world once worshiped the True Gods, a pantheon unique to the Dragonlance saga, but has come to believe that the True Gods have abandoned the world and those in it. The world is <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> recover from the loss of the True Gods and a group has sprung up seeking to replace the True Gods (the Seekers). The main focus of the novels is the continent Ansalon and the characters Tanis Half-Elven, Sturm Brightblade, Caramon Majere, Raistlin Majere, Flint Fireforge, Tasslehoff Burrfoot, Goldmoon, and Riverwind.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Ulysses S. Grant, {{the former}} President of the United States, visited Japan. While in Tokyo, he {{attended}} a jujutsu presentation at Shibusawa Eiichi's home in Asukayama. Kano Jigoro {{was one of the}} jujutsuka present. At that time, jujutsu was <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> become known in Europe and the Americas. Excepting literal circus acts, few non-Japanese had much chance of seeing or learning about the art. Even in Japan, judo and jujutsu were not considered separate disciplines at that time. Indeed, it was not until 1925 that there started to be clear differentiation of the names in Japan, and outside Japan, judo and jujutsu were not completely separated until the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet {{war effort}} {{in the first phase}} of the Eastern front war was {{severely}} hampered by the obsolete aviation industry. In 1941 the MiG-3, LaGG-3 and Yak-1 were <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> roll off the production lines but were inferior in all-round performance to the Bf 109.

On March 19, Wyatt's 34th birthday, he and James {{accompanied}} Morgan's body to Benson, where it was loaded aboard a train for California, watched over by James and two or three friends. They took Morgan to the Earp family home in Colton, California. It was not practical, given Virgil's injuries, to transport him and his wife Allie out of Tombstone {{at the same time as}} Morgan.|$|E
25|$|The tide {{of foreign}} {{immigration}} receded, so that many groups had largely stopped coming {{by the beginning}} of the 20th century. Some, however, were <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> immigrate. Southern and Eastern European immigration, especially from Italy and Croatia, began in not insignificant amounts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as they came to work in Iowan coal mines. The early 20th century also saw the start of significant immigration from Mexico, and the mid-1970s saw immigration from Southeast Asia (especially the Tai Dam, Vietnamese, and Lao) as refugees from the Vietnam War searched for a peaceful place to live.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} in time, the idea of {{constructing}} a new tramway was revolutionary. The trend throughout the world had been to close existing tramways rather than open new ones, and only three relatively small tram systems remained in France (the Lille, Marseille and Saint-Étienne systems). In North America {{the very beginning of}} a light rail renaissance was <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> be seen, with the Edmonton Light Rail Transit system opening in 1978, followed by the Calgary C-Train and San Diego Trolley systems in 1981. No significant new tramway system had been built in Europe in many years.|$|E
25|$|The {{two biggest}} moves the Astros {{made in the}} offseason were the {{acquisitions}} of Joe Niekro and José Cruz. The Astros bought Niekro from the Braves for almost nothing. Niekro had bounced around the big leagues with minimal success. His older brother Phil Niekro had started teaching Joe how to throw his knuckleball and Joe was <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> use it {{when he came to}} the Astros. Niekro won six games, saved four games and had an ERA of 3.07. José Cruz was also a steal, in retrospect, from the Cardinals. Cruz became a fixture in the Astros' outfield for several years and would eventually have his number 25 retired.|$|E
25|$|Napoléon {{was first}} {{released}} in a gala at the Palais Garnier (then {{the home of}} the Paris Opera) on 7 April 1927. Napoléon had been screened in only eight European cities when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the rights to it, but after screening it in London, it was cut drastically in length, and only the central panel of the three-screen Polyvision sequences was retained before it was put on limited release in the United States. There, the film was indifferently received at a time when talkies were <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> appear. The film was restored in 1981 after twenty years' work by silent film historian Kevin Brownlow.|$|E

25|$|Elliott was {{replaced}} by rookie driver Kasey Kahne, a successful open-wheel racer <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> gain respect in the Busch Series, who left a development contract with Ford to sign with Evernham's Dodge team for the 2004 season. Tommy Baldwin, Jr. would serve as crew chief for the No. 9 team. Kahne was arguably the least accomplished driver in a strong rookie class that included Busch Series winners Brian Vickers (the 2003 Champion), Scott Riggs, Scott Wimmer, and Johnny Sauter as well as Craftsman Truck Series winner Brendan Gaughan. Kahne would have the strongest performance {{out of all the}} young drivers, earning three second-place finishes through the first eleven races and five on the season, including two close finishes with Matt Kenseth and Elliott Sadler. Kahne earned four poles and 14 Top 10 finishes to score a 13th-place finish in points, winning the Rookie of the Year honors by over 100 points. In 2005, he won the spring Richmond race, but finished a disappointing 23rd in the final point standings.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Garibaldi Belt formation, {{a number}} of older, but related {{volcanic}} belts were constructed along the Southern Coast of British Columbia. This includes the east-west trending Alert Bay Volcanic Belt on northern Vancouver Island and the Pemberton Volcanic Belt along the coastal mainland. The Pemberton Belt began its formation when the former Farallon Plate was subducting under the British Columbia Coast 29million years ago during the Oligocene epoch. At this time, the north-central portion of the Farallon Plate was <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> subduct under the U.S. state of California, splitting it into northern and southern sections. Between 18and five million years ago during the Miocene period, the northern remnant of the Farallon Plate fractured into two tectonic plates, known as the Gorda and Juan de Fuca plates. After this breakup, subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate might have been coincident with {{the northern end of}} Vancouver Island eight million years ago during the late Miocene period. This is when the Alert Bay Belt became active. A brief interval of plate motion adjustment about 3.5million years ago may have triggered the generation of basaltic magma along the descending plate edge. This eruptive period postdates the formation of the Garibaldi Belt and evidence for more recent volcanism in the Alert Bay Belt has not been found, indicating that volcanism in the Alert Bay Belt is likely extinct.|$|E

He also played the full 90 minutes in Sunderland's next league outing against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. However, he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in Sunderland's 1–0 win against Manchester City on 29 August 2010, which sidelined him for an expected six months. Steve Bruce said [...] "It's a tragedy. But Fraizer will be back. He's a larger-than-life character. He was <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> show what he was about.
