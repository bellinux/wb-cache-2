40|$|As {{research}} and development of helical <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> and poloidal <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> for Large Helical Device (LHD), two forced-flow cooled NbTi superconducting coils (TOKI-TF, PF) have been designed and fabricated. The helical coil (TOKI-TF) is a 1 / 4 scale model of LHD. It has the major radius of 0. 9 m, the minor radius of 0. 25 m and pitch number of 4. Nominal current and maximum field were designed to be 8 kA and 2. 8 T, respectively. Another coil (TOKI-PF) was fabricated for the demonstration of LHD poloidal <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> It consists of two double-pancakes with the inner radius of 0. 6 m and the outer radius of 0. 82 m. Nominal current of 25 kA simulates that of LHD poloidal <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> Cable-in-conduit type conductors were used for the both coils. The test facility was also constructed with a vacuum vessel, Iiquid nitrogen shield, 30 kA power leads, a heat exchanger, cryogenic supports and others.

40|$|Abstract — The <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> is {{the primary}} {{component}} of the rotor assembly that provides the rotating magnetic field for the pulse power alternator. The design of the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> is optimized {{so that it will}} produce the required magnetic field with minimum transient losses. The high currents required to produce the correct amp-turns, along with the mechanical loads due to high rotational speeds, present further design requirements for selection of <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> material, insulation, and surrounding material that completes the matrix of the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> sub-assembly. With the addition of active cooling requirements in the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> design, surrounding materials must be selected that retain electrically insulative properties and are thermally conductive to allow sufficient heat removal from the <b>field</b> <b>coil.</b> Thermoplastics are now being reviewed to replace traditional glass-epoxy potting compounds (thermosets) that have been used extensively in pulsed alternator designs. Fillers can be added to tailor properties of the thermoplastic, such as ceramics to increase thermal conductivity at the cost of an increase in density. Thermal analyses have been performed that show the benefits of using thermally conductive potting compounds. In addition, subscale <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> mock-ups (motorettes) have been encapsulated and tested to demonstrate encapsulation of current <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> geometries. I...|$|R
40|$|An ITER Poloidal <b>Field</b> <b>coil</b> <b>winding</b> {{consists}} of stacked double pancakes wound with NbTi cable-in-conduit conductors. One {{of the critical}} components of the coil is the electrical joint connecting either two conductor lengths within a double pancake or two double pancakes. All joints utilize the twin-box “shaking hands” concept. It has previously been found with the JackPot-AC numerical model that in these joints {{the sum of the}} transport and induced currents in some of the superconducting strands during coil operation may exceed the strands' critical current. It was decided to further explore the behavior of the joint with a simplified set of current and magnetic field runs. A solution for the reduction of the induced currents is proposed and verified by modeling. The paper discusses the results of the simulations and gives recommendations for the joint design...|$|R
