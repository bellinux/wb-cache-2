However, it used to require larger compressor size due to the lower fluid density compared with conventional refrigerants such as R 410 A. Thus, a new wing-vane compressor which has no contraction between the vane and the cylinder is developed to prevent increase in the size without performance degradation. Â Rotary motion of the vane {{is supported by the}} partial arc guide on the upper and lower ends of the vane. Revealing the lubricating properties of the guide was one of the development issues.

40|$|Many {{cases of}} high {{vibration}} and changing vibration in reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) {{can be traced}} to one of several types of degradation in the lower motor <b>guide</b> <b>bearing.</b> This paper presents a comparison of the vibrational characteristics for several failure modes. Included in this list are loss of lubricant, bearing overloading, and time-varying shoe clearance. Each of the examples studied is from an actual pump which underwent a lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> failure. In each case the pump was operated for an extended period following the onset of the failure mechanism. This type of operation raises the question of its effect on the fatigue life of the pump shaft and other components. This paper provides a simple assessment {{of the extent to which}} fatigue life is impacted. I. Background I. 1 Design Considerations Experience has shown that one of the most common failures in nuclear main coolant pumps involves the lower motor bearing. Typically, the lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> is an oil-immersed, segmented shoe bearing. Figure 1 shows the arrangement for a typical Westinghouse, or similarly designed, reactor coolant pump. There are several reasons for the frequency of these failures compared to failures in the other bearings. Collectively, the reasons may be summarized in that main coolant pumps are three-bearing machines, wherein the lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> has the weakest design of the three. Therefore, under conditions such as misalignment where all the bearings have higherthan-normal loads, it is the lower motor bearing that is most likely to fail...|$|E

Most of the commercial software is designed to calculate rotordynamic and bearing properties based on machines with a horizontally oriented rotor; that is, the bearing properties are calculated at a static eccentricity. For tilting-pad bearings, there are no existing analytical expressions for bearing parameters and the bearing parameters are dependent on eccentricity and load angle. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present a simplified method to perform numerical simulations on vertical rotors including bearing parameters. Instead of recalculating the bearing parameters in each time step polynomials are used to represent the bearing parameters for present eccentricities and load angles. Numerical results are compared with results from tests performed in a test rig. The test rig consists of two <b>guide</b> <b>bearings</b> and a midspan rotor.

40|$|In 2005 a {{vertical}} 42 MW hydropower unit was upgraded in Sweden. The upgrade included the fitting {{of a new}} turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing,</b> a modified runner, a modified turbine regulator and a new brushless exciter. One of the requirements was that the dynamic behaviour of the machine should not be affected. In spite of the requirements, resonance problems became apparent after the hydropower unit was re-commissioned. Measurements from the re-ommissioning showed poor alignment of the shaft system and shape deviations in the generator. The exchange of the turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> from a sleeve bearing to a block bearing also caused changes in the machines dynamic behaviour. Measurements on the unit were conducted at normal operation and resonance. These show that at normal operation, the machine has dominant frequencies at the nominal speed and at twice the nominal speed. When the machine goes into resonance, the dominant frequencies increase to approx. 2. 4 times the nominal speed. The machine will undergo a major overhaul in ten years. The objective {{is to find a}} solution of the resonance problem that is both inexpensive and possible to implement. The conclusion was drawn that the low damped eigenmode at 2. 4 times the nominal speed had been excited and caused the machine to go into resonance. The unit's dynamic sensitivity to different bearing settings was investigated numerically and with tests on site, i. e. bearing clearances were varied. The calculated result was verified against measured resonance frequencies. Agreement between the estimated and measured result was good. Other possible measures to rectify the resonance problems were also analyzed numerically. The effect of making the surrounding structures more rigid, the installation of additional guide bearings, making the shaft system more rigid, etc. were examined. A temporary solution, used for the last six months, is to operate the machine with larger bearing clearances on all bearings. Increased bearing clearance of the turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> cause increased damping of the natural frequency at 2. 4 times the nominal speed. No problems related to resonance have occurred at the hydropower unit during the last six months. Godkänd; 2008; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20081111 (ysko) </p...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{tests have}} been carried out in a Francis turbine {{suffering}} from inlet edge cavitation erosion on the runner blades. The tests have comprised an onboard accelerometer mounted on the shaft in radial direction just above the turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing.</b> Simultaneously, vibrations in fixed parts have also been monitored such as turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> pedestal and guide vane. Besides, an acoustic emission sensor has been located next to the fixed accelerometer in the bearing pedestal. The machine has been operated at various output loads and the corresponding signals have been recorded and analyzed following traditional cavitation detection techniques such as amplitude demodulation of high frequency bands. This permits to investigate the erosion process from a location which is directly connected to the blades. The advantage of such a situation is that the influence of the fluid film bearing and of the rotating frame of reference are avoided compared with measurements from a fixed position. As a consequence, the validity of external measurements to detect cavitation dynamic behavior can be checked. In the paper, the suitability of the telemetry system used for the tests is analyzed and then the results are presented and discussed.

Furthermore, estimated technically feasible hydropower potential {{in the world is}} 14000 TWh/year. The hydropower is the major renewable energy source in many countries and running at a higher plant-factor.

Objective of this work is to model and simulate dynamic variation of temperatures of bearings (generator <b>guide</b> <b>bearing,</b> turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing,</b> thrust bearing) of a hydropower generating unit.

40|$|Cavitation {{erosion of}} Francis {{turbines}} continues to impose costly repairs {{and loss of}} revenues. This erosion is primarily caused by leading edge cavitation. A revue of the literature reveals the non-existence of an absolutely validated detection technique of this cavitation in operating Francis turbines. Considering the impulsive character of the implosion of a cavitation structure, the assimilation of cavitation erosion to a process of mechanical fatigue of materials and the vibratory response at high frequencies of a linear structure to multiple random excitations whose responses add on a power basis, we have proposed that the vibratory response of a Francis turbine at high frequencies is tightly related to its cavitation erosion rate. The absolute measurement of cavitation aggressiveness on the blades {{can be made by}} the normalization of lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> vibration measurements by an average Transmissibility function measured by reciprocity with the runner underwater. The proposed method has been validated and it is now possible to state that the MSV of inferred forces at the cavitation impact rate of hydrodynamic origin is proportional to the erosion rate. The approach has been validated in excellent manner in laboratory set-ups with little or no flows by comparison to absolute cavitation aggressiveness assessment methods such as the DECER electrochemical technique and the pit counting technique on polished material samples. The validation was then pursued with laboratory homologous flows on a NACA 009 profile in the LMH high-speed cavitation tunnel with blade mounted DECER sensors as reference. Once again, impact frequencies of hydrodynamic origin, following here a Strouhal law, were observed and the MSV of the profile acceleration at high frequencies was proportional to the average erosion rate on the profile. Notwithstanding the difficulty of the measurements, the results were excellent and fared well with the erosive power of the flow in V 3 L 2 (V= flow velocity, L= length of the attached vapour cavity). Preliminary measurements on a Francis model with blade mounted DECER sensors agreed well with the MSV of lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> acceleration at high frequencies. Later measurements on the Rapide Blanc model confirmed the damage model observed on the NACA profile. Hydrodynamic impact frequencies were however not governed by the tunnel Strouhal law but were found to be determined by the blade passage frequency. Stationary measurements at the lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> were equivalent to runner on board measurements. Reciprocity, typical to linear structures, was verfied. As on the profile, maximum aggressiveness on the runner blade occurs in the leading edge cavity closure area. This was confirmed by the application of "Prescale" pressure sensitive film on the blades for operating conditions generating maximum vibratory response at the cavitation hydrodynamic frequencies. High-speed video recordings shot at 2000 frames/s allowed detailed observation of the dynamics of the cavitation structures at the blade passage frequency. Visual observations of cavitation developments along with implosion frequencies allowed observing that the MSV of vibratory response at high frequencies at the cavitation impact occurrence rate was coherent with the calculated value of the flow erosive power inasmuch as the implosions occurred on the blades and not beyond the blade trailing edges. These results on the Francis model therefore supported the proposed vibratory detection approach. The application of the developed techniques, including the measurements of Transmissibility with the runners underwater, allowed assessing the difference in absolute cavitation aggressiveness on an existing and proposed replacement model runner for the Beauharnois power plant. The applicability of the proposed measurement and calibration methods was confirmed on prototype N° 6 of the Rapide Blanc power plant. Measurements on fixed and rotating elements of the machine are equivalent and reciprocity also applies. The recurrence frequency of the cavitation impacts was however {{different from that of the}} model. The difference appears to be due to the semi-spiral case utilized on the model. It was not fully homologous to the full spiral case of the prototype. It would thus appear that on the model, the wake of the semi-spiral case tongue plays a determinant role in the generation and implosion process of cavitating structures while on the prototype the wakes of the wicket gates fill that function. The ultimate validation of the vibratory approach to the detection of erosive cavitation on Francis prototypes occurred in 1995 on unit 44 of the Manic 5 PA power plant. This was done using on board sensors (pressure, DECER and accelerometer) on severely eroded blade 4 and polished 316 L stainless steel disks mounted in this same blade after removal of the pressure sensor housings. Paint removal and pit counting tests had previously correlated well in 1993 with the MSV of global modulation of high frequency acceleration at the lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> at the cavitation hydrodynamic impact occurrence rate which was for this prototype the wicket gate passing frequency for a rotating observer. The 1995 correlation of the MSV of the blade 4 high frequency acceleration modulation at the wicket gate passage hydrodynamic frequency with the volume pitting rate of the 316 L stainless steel disks and the DECER erosion current was excellent. The existence in the flow of the 60 Hz (rotation speed, 180 r. p. m., 20 wicket gates) hydrodynamic frequency was confirmed by dynamic pressure measurements on blade 4 and in the draft tube just below the runner. The per blade inferred forces were calculated for each set of test conditions with the average Transmissibility measured by reciprocity on five blades with the runner underwater. The MSV of high frequency inferred forces agrees better with the real aggressiveness than does the wideband acceleration but not as well as the MSV of the acceleration modulation at the hydrodynamic frequencies of the cavitation impacts. Improvements on this subject have been incorporated in the cavitation erosion monitoring system now in operation at Hydro-Québec. Tu summarize, the MSV of the vibratory response at the lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> modulated at the cavitation hydrodynamic frequencies describes well its relative aggressiveness with varying operating conditions and the use of an averaged Transmissibility measured with the runner underwater allows to estimate it on an absolute basis...|$|E
30|$|Surge {{displacements}} are longitudinal motions caused, for example, by expansion or {{contraction of}} the bridge. The CESuRa system plays {{no part in}} them; expansion joints in the rails on each end of each transition span are needed. The rails should be fixed to the deck at specific points along the span, between which {{they are free to}} expand and contract as a consequence of using fasteners that provide no longitudinal restraint. Thus, all the longitudinal motion of the rails is concentrated at the expansion joints. In the transition span, the rails can be anchored to the deck throughout its length. In the event of longitudinal motion of the bridge, the bridge deck, rather than just the rails, will experience longitudinal motion.

40|$|Current {{trends in}} design of pump-turbines have led into higher rotor-stator {{interaction}} (RSI) loads over impeller-runner. These dynamic loads are {{of special interest}} having produced catastrophic failures in pump-turbines. Determining RSI characteristics facilitates the proposal of actions that will prevent these failures. Pressure measurements all {{around the perimeter of}} the impeller-runner are appropriate to monitor and detect RSI characteristics. Unfortunately most installed pump-turbines are not manufactured with in-built pressure sensors in appropriate positions to monitor RSI. For this reason, vibration measurements are the preferred method to monitor RSI in industry. Usually vibrations are measured in two perpendicular radial directions in bearings where valuable information could be lost due to bearing response. In this work, in order to avoid the effect of bearing response on measurement, two vibration sensors are installed rotating with the shaft. The RSI characteristics obtained with pressure measurements were compared to those determined using vibration measurements. The RSI characteristics obtained with pressure measurements were also determined using vibrations measured rotating with shaft.

40|$|Lecturepg. 39 In {{view of the}} inflammability of LNG (liquefied natural gas), {{submerged}} type {{pumps are}} normally used to protect against leaks. The overhaul interval of an LNG pump, therefore, {{is subject to the}} life of its ball bearings, because LNG is an extremely low temperature, low viscosity and low boiling point liquid. The use of LNG to fulfill the extremely demanding functions of lubrication and cooling of ball bearings results in substantial reduction in the bearings? maximum load tolerance. The limits inherent in the ball bearings, consequently, will make it difficult to extend the life of the bearings beyond that currently achieved, if the bearing system itself depends on the use of conventional ball bearings. Since the service life of a ball bearing is not necessarily constant, there is a possibility of sudden break-down. Thus, new LNG pumps were developed using a form of bearing for which service lifetime is not primary importance, though it nevertheless has a long service life and high reliability, and is small and light. Details are given later. Two types of the static bearings were developed: a hydrostatic slide bearing and a hydrostatic <b>guide</b> <b>bearing,</b> incorporating a hydrostatic journal bearing surrounding the ball bearing. The hydrostatic slide bearing supports the shaft by virtue of the film pressure of the LNG discharged from the pump itself. Therefore, the shaft with ball bearings in the usual way, the buffer effect of LNG in the hydrostatic guide section substantially reduces the radial load of the ball bearings. A hydrostatic journal bearing does not bear any of the thrust load. A structure has, therefore, been developed in which a disk-piston-type thrust balancing system can be used to enable self-balancing of the shaft thrust load, thereby reducing the thrust load to zero. The downstream side of the disk piston is designed to allow a variable clearance whereby, when it is at its maximum, the total flow area upward thrust force exceeds the downward thrust force. In this way, the two thrust forces always balance each other automatically. A high lift impeller was designed, the number of operational stages was reduced, and, radial diffusers were used to enable the use of shorter shafts. For the stage housing, a piston ring type sealing is used, a single layer cylinder casing method was developed that enables a multistep seal provided by the piston rings at each stage. This allowed the pump diameter to be reduced. The use of hydrostatic slide bearings (hydrostatic guide bearings), a thrust balancing mechanism, and the reduction of shaft length has enabled substantial extension to be made to the overhaul interval of pump. Pumps with hydrostatic slide bearings: 100, 000 hours or more. Pumps with hydrostatic guide bearings: 50, 000 hours or more. The use of hydrostatic slide bearings results in some reduction in the shaft bearing performance, due to wear of the face of the bearing. Measurement of the amount of wear, however, enables the remaining life of the bearing to be predicted, and this in turn facilitates cost reductions in terms of the failure diagnosis system employed. Furthermore, since there is little likelihood of sudden failure, maintenance schedules can be organized in a systematic way. The use of high lift impeller and single wall cylindrical radial diffuser has enabled the production of a compact, lighter pump unit, which is easy to disassemble and reassemble. This technology is applicable to pumps for other liquefied gas, for example, LPG, LEG (liquefied ethylene gas), etc...|$|E
40|$|In {{almost all}} {{production}} of electricity the rotating machines serves as {{an important part of}} the energy transformation system. In hydropower units, a hydraulic turbine connected to a generator converts the potential energy stored in the water reservoir into electrical energy in the generator. An essential part of this energy conversion is the rotating system of which the turbine and the generator are part. During the last century the machines for electricity production have been developed from a few mega watts per unit up to several hundreds mega watts per unit. The development and increasing of size of the hydropower machines have also brought a need for new techniques. The most important developments are the increased efficiency of the turbines and generators, new types of bearings and the introduction of new materials. Vibration measurements are still the most reliable and commonly used method to avoid failure during commissioning, for periodic maintenance, and as protection of the systems. Knowledge of the bearing forces in different operational modes is essential in order to estimate the degeneration of components and to avoid failures. In the appended Paper A, a method has been described for measurement of bearing load by use of strain gauges installed on the <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> bracket. This technique can determine the magnitude and direction of both static and dynamic loads acting on the bearing. This method also makes it possible to find the cause of the radial bearing force among the various eccentricities and disturbances in the system. A principal cause of many failures in large electrical machines is the occurrence of high radial forces due to misalignment between rotor and stator, rotor imbalance or disturbance from the turbine. In this thesis, two rotor models are suggested for calculation of forces and moments acting on the generator shaft depending on misalignment between stator and rotor. These two methods are described in appended papers B and C. In Paper B, a linear model is proposed for an eccentric generator rotor subjected to a radial magnetic force. Both the radial force and the bending moment affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the rotor spider hub deviates from the centre of the rotor rim. The magnetic pull force acting on the rotor is assumed to be proportional to the rotor displacement. In Paper C, a non-linear model is proposed for analysis of an eccentric rotor subjected to radial magnetic force. Both the radial and bending moments affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the generator spider hub deviates from the centre of the generator rim. The magnetic forces acting on the rotor are assumed to be a non-linear function of the air-gap between the rotor and stator. The stability analysis shows that the rotor can become unstable for small initial eccentricities if the rotor rim position relative to the rotor hub is included in the analysis. The analysis also shows that the natural frequencies can decrease and the rotor response can increase if the rotor rim position in relation to the rotor spider is considered. The endurance of hydropower rotor components is often associated with the dynamic loads acting on the rotating system and the number of start-stop cycles of the unit. Measurements together with analysis of the rotordynamics are often the most powerful methods available to improve understanding of the cause of the dynamic load. The method for measurement of bearing load presented in this thesis makes it possible to investigate the dynamic as well as the static loads as acting on the bearing brackets. This can be done using the suggested method with high accuracy and without redesign of the bearings. During commissioning of hydropower unit, measurements of shaft vibrations and forces are the most reliable method to investigate the status of the rotating system. Generator rotor models suggested in this work will increase the precision of the calculated behavior of the rotor. Calculation of the rotor behavior is important before the generator is put in operation, after rehabilitation or when new machines will be installed. Godkänd; 2005; 20061214 (haneit...|$|E

40|$|At the 3 rd International Conference of EUSPEN (Eindhoven 2002) {{the authors}} of this paper {{presented}} a design of a 3 D Coordinate Measuring Machine [1] based on an air bearing system for the movements in the horizontal plane and an elastic mechanism for the vertical stroke. Shortly after this conference an agency of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs funded this project so the realisation and testing phase could be started. This paper discusses a system without friction that supplies air to an air <b>bearing</b> <b>guide</b> and initial functionality results of the elastically guided axis. Frictionless air supply to an air <b>bearing</b> <b>guide</b> When a compressed air flow is needed on board of an air <b>bearing</b> <b>guide,</b> a hose of a certain length is often required to provide the air supply. Besides on the length of the hose the magnitude of the flow depends on the speed of the air and on the diameter of the supply hose. In a case of a constant air speed, the diameter of the supply hose has to be increased when more flow is needed on board of the guide (e. g. when the guide contains many air bearings). This inevitably results in more bending and torsion stiffness in the hose, which is a source of disturbance during slide motion. Applying multiple hoses (with a smaller diameter) gives almost no improvement: the bending stiffness decreases but the air friction increases with the fourth power of the diameter. Multiple hoses may not contact while moving because friction causes hysteresis in the guide’s motion, which is often unacceptable. The hoses, often made from thermoplastic material, show relaxation and Bourdon action. The...|$|R
40|$|In {{almost all}} {{production}} of electricity the rotating machines serves as {{an important part of}} the energy transformation system. In hydropower units, a hydraulic turbine connected to a generator converts the potential energy stored in the water reservoir into electrical energy in the generator. An essential part of this energy conversion is the rotating system of which the turbine and the generator are crucial parts. During the last century the machines for {{production of electricity}} have been developed from a few megawatts per unit, up to several hundreds megawatts per unit. The development and increased size of the hydropower machines has also brought a need for new techniques. The most important developments are the increased efficiency of the turbines and generators, new types of bearings and the introduction of new materials. Vibration measurement is still the most reliable and commonly used method for avoiding failure during commissioning, for periodic maintenance, and for protection of the systems. Knowledge of the bearing forces at different operational modes is essential in order to estimate the degeneration of components and to avoid failures. In the appended Paper A, a method has been described for measurement of bearing load by use of strain gauges installed on the <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> bracket. This technique can determine the magnitude and direction of both static and dynamic loads acting on the bearing. This method also makes it possible to find the cause of the radial bearing force among the various eccentricities and disturbances in the system. This method was used in Paper C to investigate bearing stiffness and damping. A principal cause of many failures in large electrical machines is the occurrence of high radial forces due to misalignment between rotor and stator, rotor imbalance or disturbance from the turbine. In this thesis, two rotor models are suggested for calculation of forces and moments acting on the generator shaft due to misalignment between stator and rotor. These two methods are described in appended papers B and D. In Paper B, a linear model is proposed for an eccentric generator rotor subjected to a radial magnetic force. Both the radial force and the bending moment affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the rotor spider hub deviates from the centre of the rotor rim. The magnetic force acting on the rotor is assumed to be proportional to the rotor displacement. In Paper D, a non-linear model is proposed for analysis of an eccentric rotor subjected to radial magnetic forces. Both the radial and bending moments affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the generator spider hub deviates from the centre of the generator rim. The magnetic forces acting on the rotor are assumed to be a non-linear function of the air-gap between the rotor and stator. The stability analysis shows that the rotor can become unstable for small initial eccentricities if the position of the rotor rim relative to the rotor hub is included in the analysis. The analysis also shows that natural frequencies can decrease and the rotor response can increase if the position of the rotor rim in relation to the rotor spider is considered. In Paper E, the effect of damping rods was included in the analysis of the magnetic pull force. The resulting force was found to be reduced significantly when the damper rods were taken into account. An interesting effect of the rotor damper rods was that they reduced the eccentricity forces and introduced a force component perpendicular to the direction of eccentricity. The results from the finite-element simulations were used to determine how the forces affect the stability of the generator rotor. Damped natural eigenfrequencies and the damping ratio for load and no-load conditions were investigated. When applying the forces computed in the time- dependent model, the damped natural eigenfrequencies were found to increase and the stability of the generator rotor was found to be reduced, compared with when the forces were computed in a stationary model. Damage due to contact between the runner and the discharge ring have been observed in several hydroelectric power units. The damage can cause high repair costs to the runner and the discharge ring as well as considerable production losses. In Paper F a rotor model of a 45 MW hydropower unit is used for the analysis of the rotor dynamical phenomena occurring due to contact between the runner and the discharge ring for different grades of lateral force on the turbine and bearing damping. The rotor model consists of a generator rotor and a turbine, which are connected to an elastic shaft supported by three isotropic bearings. The discrete representation of the rotor model consist of 32 degrees of freedom. To increase the speed of the analysis, the size of the model has been reduced with the IRS method to a system with 8 degrees of freedom. The results show that a small gap between the turbine and discharge ring can be dangerous, due to the risk of contact with high contact forces as a consequence. It has also been observed that backward whirl can occur and in some cases the turbine motion becomes quasi-periodic or chaotic. The endurance of hydropower rotor components is often associated with the dynamic loads acting on the rotating system and the number of start-stop cycles of the unit. Measurements, together with analysis of the rotor dynamics, are often the most powerful methods available to improve understanding of the cause of the dynamic load. The method for measurement of the bearing load presented in this thesis makes it possible to investigate the dynamic as well as the static loads acting on the bearing brackets. This can be done using the suggested method with high accuracy and without re-designing the bearings. During commissioning of a hydropower unit, measurement of shaft vibrations and forces is the most reliable methods for investigating the status of the rotating system. Generator rotor models suggested in this work will increase the precision of the calculated behaviour of the rotor. Calculation of the rotor behaviour is important before a generator is put in operation, after overhaul or when a new machine is to be installed. Godkänd; 2008; 20081111 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present {{case study}} {{points on the}} cooling water system of the Hydro-Power Plant (HPP) Bradisor, on the Lotru River in Romania. This 115 MW {{underground}} power plant is equipped with two Francis turbines. We built in EPANET a numerical model to simulate {{the operation of the}} cooling water system of this HPP, for different working scenarios. The whole hydraulic system is a complex one: it is composed of a main cooling water network fed by pumps, a water-based fire fighting network for the hydropower generators and a backup cooling water network fed from the penstock pipes. The numerical model of the whole cooling water system consists of 87 pipes, 133 junctions, 6 variable speed driven centrifugal pumps, 59 valves and 3 reservoirs. Some throttle control valves (TCV) are artificially inserted in our numerical model and are set with appropriate loss coefficients values to be equivalent to the equipments that introduce minor losses in the system and don’t exist as physical components in EPANET. Those equipments are: air-water heat exchangers (placed around the hydropower generators), oil-water heat exchangers (of heavy-duty thrust bearings, of turbines’ and generators’ <b>guide</b> <b>bearings,</b> of the 130 MVA step-up transformer), coolers of turbines’ seals and self-cleaning filters (one for each hydropower unit and another one for the transformer). The loss coefficient for each equivalent TCV was set based on pressure loss values measured in situ on each equipment. The numerical results (pressure and flow rate values) match the existing recordings. The simulations prove that by using a proper calibration of the numerical model, EPANET capabilities can be extended for more complex systems than the water distribution systems...|$|R
40|$|In this diploma thesis two partial {{studies of}} the {{instrumentation}} of a hydropower unit are conducted. These are carried out {{within the scope of}} the JUSPOWER-project. The first part of the thesis deals with the instrumentation of the runner. The incorporation of sensors in a Kaplan runner blade is tested in a experimental set-up on a laboratory scale without dismantling the runner. A further development of the design is suggested that enables damaged sensors to be replaced. The sensors are calibrated with a system destined to be used on site. The results show that the sensors function properly in the test set-up. Further calibration will though be needed during the installation on the runner blade and under operational conditions. The suction cup of the calibration system may have to be modified depending on the shape of the runner blade. The second part is a comparison study concerned with the choice of sensors for radial load measurements at the <b>guide</b> <b>bearings.</b> To measure the load on the bearing segments, the dowel peg on the bearing segment would either be replaced by a load cell or modified so strain gages could be bonded onto the peg itself. The performance of the sensors is evaluated in a loading machine with respect to linearity, hysteresis and sensitivity. Furthermore, the stiffness of the load cell is experimentally determined in a load machine. The results show that the strain gages bonded on the modified dowel peg do not have a reliable output signal. However, the installation of the tested load cell would alter the stiffness of the dowel peg. The load cell had a stiffness that was almost 50 % lower than the dowel peg...|$|R
