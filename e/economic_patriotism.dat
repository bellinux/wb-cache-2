5000|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>patriotism</b> is the coordinated and {{promoted}} behaviour of consumers or companies (both private and public) {{that consists of}} favoring the goods or services produced in their country or in their group of countries. <b>Economic</b> <b>patriotism</b> can be practiced either through demand stimulation (encouraging consumers to purchase {{the goods and services}} of their own country) or through supply protection, the shielding of the domestic market from foreign competition through tariffs or quotas (protectionism). A recently emerging form of <b>economic</b> <b>patriotism</b> is financial protectionism, the hostility against acquisitions by foreign groups of companies considered of [...] "strategic value" [...] for the economy of the country.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2008. I task this archive with {{creating}} {{a place of}} pausing. Outside of the prescriptive and diagnostic temporalities that are usual to politics, this locale paces un-thinking intimate attachments to colonial orders. Here, "un-thinking" hosts a double valence. As an adjective, it describes those attachments as unconscious directives of hegemony in everyday movements. As a verb, it acts on those attachments in material things that are inclusive, and in excess, of thought. Things like inheriting a family name, "everyday life," and feelings have political and economic rhythms that suffuse relationships to the colonial state (government, U. S. militaries, juridical institutions) and society (plantation owning elites, the health sector, academia, and the faith community). The decolonial archive is a theoretical apparatus for approaching structures that alternately invest Asian settlers in an American-Hawaii, tense against U. S. hegemony, and recuperate those tensions into attachments to America. To access the micrological textured of colonization, I've looked to the intimate paper-trails that my own family-names generate into one of Hawai'i's defining colonial institutions, the Territorial-era (1900 - 1959) plantation. These plantation communities were crucial arenas of the labor organizing, wartime <b>economic</b> expansion, <b>patriotism</b> and consumer socialization {{that contributed to the}} emergence of a new multiracial local ruling class in a post-Statehood epoch (1959). Their political and economic enfranchisement, gauged in increased property ownership, professional employment and public office-holding, has been adorned with liberatory signs of racial justice. But this format assumes only political-economic investments secure Asian settler allegiance to Hawai'i's U. S. occupation. To stop the translation of this history (acceleration of multiculturalism under globalization) into that evidence (proofs of American capitalism's capacity to incorporate difference), I archive Asian settlers colonialism in new capillary forms of power that target affect, feeling, sensation and memory. My use of the decolonial archive derails kinship's commitments to heteronormative conventions, while exploiting genealogy's idiomatic kinship with reproductive familiality to turn a (hetero) normative narrative of existential continuity into a narrative of political accountability to a Hawaiian-Hawaii.

5000|$|The {{analogy is}} {{typically}} used to mark {{a debate over}} whether it matters if an industry is primarily domestically owned if easing of foreign ownership restrictions allows the economy to benefit from foreign investment and increased global competition. The phrase can be used positively to assert the economic success of liberal attitudes towards foreign ownership (and sometimes to emphasize that such attitudes promote {{a level playing field}} for domestic and foreign interests alike); or it can be used negatively to emphasize how these policies have eroded a nation's ability to produce globally leading domestic companies. This opposing perspective is represented by <b>economic</b> <b>patriotism</b> and [...] "national champion" [...] policies.The analogy has also been used in policy discourses outside Britain - most notably in the business discourse of Japan, whose financial markets {{and other parts of the}} economy (as of 2006) have not yet been substantially opened up to foreign competition compared with its international peers. It has also, for instance, been used in banking reform debates in South Korea as well as in discussing business process outsourcing in India.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis {{has demonstrated that}} governments continuously seek to steer their economies rather than leaving them to free markets. Despite the ambitions of international economic cooperation, such interventionism is decidedly local. Some politicians even proudly evoke "economic patriotism" to justify their choices. This volume links such populism to {{a specific set of}} tensions – the paradox of neo-liberal democracy – and argues that the phenomenon is ubiquitous. The mandate of politicians is to defend the economic interests of their constituents under conditions where large parts of economic governance are no longer exclusively within their control. <b>Economic</b> <b>patriotism</b> is one possible reaction to this tension. As old-style industrial policy and interventionism gained a bad reputation, governments had to become creative to assure traditional economic policy objectives with new means. However, <b>economic</b> <b>patriotism</b> {{is more than just a}} fashionable word or a fig leaf for protectionism. This volume employs the term to signal two distinctions: the diversity of policy content and the multiplicity of territorial units it can refer to. Comparing economic interventionism across countries and sectors, it becomes clear that economic liberalism will always be accompanied by counter-movements that appeal to territorial images.

Previous {{research shows that}} Presidents use patriotism and civic duty to promote particular policies (Bostdorff and O’Rourke 1997, Coe et al. 2004) and war (Altheide 2004, Ivie 2005, Bostdorff 2003, Loseke 2009, Murphy 2003). Research also looks at how post-World War II (WWII) political culture and campaigning reflect a consumer society, either through how Presidents use consumption to promote a specific value (Altheide 2004, Bostdorff 2003) or how Presidents themselves symbolize branded commodities (Miller and Stiles 1986, Scammell 2007, Simonds 1989, Uricchio 2009 van Ham 2001, Vidich 1990, Zavattaro 2010). However, {{there is not much}} research examining how Presidential rhetoric connects consumption and economic values to civic duty and patriotism over time. Using Critical Discourse Analysis, I reviewed twenty inaugural speeches twelve Presidents delivered while in office since WWII to examine how they connect consumption and economic values to civic duty and patriotism.

40|$|Utilizing the {{paradigm}} of social constructionism, this research project inquires how the North American Free Trade Agreement is co-created, managed and transformed in communication. Articles and editorials about NAFTA in Mexican and U. S. newspapers provide the topoi where narratives of cultural identity are sought. Rather than treating communication as a variable whose amount determines the quality of NAFTA, this dissertation takes the communication perspective, arguing that persons in conversation co-create, manage and transform such social realities as that of an international economic trade agreement. The practical and critical theory of the Coordinated Management of Meaning is selected as the method to approach three sets of research questions: (1) What stories do Mexican and U. S. newspapers tell about the official position {{in order to justify}} their actions to the population? What sorts of stories are told about nationalism, <b>patriotism,</b> <b>economic</b> development, capitalism? (2) How is the 2 ̆ 2 self 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 other 2 ̆ 2 presented by the storytellers of different countries and the different newspapers in each country? Did the presentation in the U. S. have any repercussions on the stories told in Mexican newspapers and vice versa? and (3) What is the role of communication theory in issues of economic development and international cooperation? Can viewpoints such as Social Constructionism and the critical and practical communication theory of the Coordinated Management of Meaning provide a heuristic to examine this type of issues? As with any piece of interpretive and critical research, the findings are not so exclusively significant as is the process by wh ich researchers arrive at them. In addition to this concern for process over product, the conclusion discusses the un/intended consequences of interpolating theories of development with the Coordinated Management of Meaning to address the inter(in) dependence between Mexico and the U.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to reconsider the current {{position}} of American exceptionalism in American society and its influence on U. S. grand strategy {{with regard to the}} future direction of U. S. world leadership. It offers an introduction to the debate on American exceptionalism, and argues that American exceptionalism has a profound impact on the formulation of strategy. Thus any adjustments in Americans sense of self may lead to great changes in its national interests and significantly alter its role in the world. The thesis analyses whether there has been a shift in the American population s beliefs, values and self-understanding the past decades. In order to provide answers, trends in American society such as religiosity, <b>economic</b> mobility and <b>patriotism</b> are examined, and the continued influence of American exceptionalism on American grand strategy is discussed. The main findings of this thesis are as follows; the American public is turning away from core pillars of American exceptionalism which has led to a more sober and pragmatic self-image. This, in addition to the current security environment, has led to ambivalent views on the appropriate global strategy for the United States as it faces its future. The uncertainty about the future role of the United States in the world has already caused erosions in the international system. As such, this thesis also discusses the implications for the liberal world order if the declined belief in America as an exceptional nation leads the United States toward abandonment of some of its idealistic foundations. This thesis proposes a hybrid strategy which corresponds with the current international and domestic setting. A strategy based on a continued leadership role for the United States, but at a lower cost due to higher levels of burden-sharing between America s allies and partners. In addition, a combination of balance of power realism and discriminate intervention, with focus on multilateral institutions of liberal internationalism, represents fundamental aspects of American strategic culture and the ebb and flow between interests and ideals in American foreign policy...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the political}} economy of state aid in the European Union (EU) using the concepts of <b>economic</b> <b>patriotism</b> and models of capitalism. State aid is analysed as a form of <b>economic</b> <b>patriotism,</b> which is conceived here as economic interventions which seek, by a number of means, to advance the perceived economic self-interest of particular groups and actors (firms, workforces, or sectors) defined according to their territorial status. The article argues that the paradox of neo-liberal democracy generated by liberal international markets, overlapping economic governance regimes (such as the EU and the World Trade Organisation), and nationally delimited political mandates presents new problems for policy-makers attempting economic interventions like state aid. Forms of <b>economic</b> <b>patriotism</b> are partly shaped by national institutional and social configurations and state traditions. Within EU economic governance, this generates a ‘clash of capitalisms’ whereby liberal EU anti-trust and competition policy norms proscribe certain state aid and industrial policy measures favoured by some European states. As traditional industrial policy becomes decreasingly viable, new modes of economic patriotic interventionism are enacted within contemporary processes of market-making, and the re-regulatory activity framing European markets. The paper focuses on French state aid responses to the global economic crisis, noting how the retreat of neo-liberal ebullience within the EU provides a conducive environment for resurgent French dirigiste approaches to state aid, indicating that the politics of <b>economic</b> <b>patriotism</b> and state aid will continue to be important features of the European political economic landscape in the years ahead...|$|E

40|$|Over 131, 000 aircrew {{were trained}} by the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Saskatchewan air schools trained {{twenty percent of the}} pilots and thirty percent of some {{categories}} of aircrew. The numbers were impressive. There were many social ramifications with the coming of the Air Training Plan. Saskatchewan had suffered more than any other province of Canada during the Great Depression. The air schools brought economic recovery, as well as the stress, of housing shortages and tension brought by large numbers of personnel arriving in the small communities. In spite of these strains, the population responded with warm acceptance. Patriotism was important in the good relations between the air schools and the host communities. The people of the province opened their homes to the airmen at Christmas. The airmen, in turn, acted to help with the harvests across the province. In {{the early years of the}} war Saskatchewan found her population greatly decreased because of enlistments and the migration of people out of the province to the industrial centres of Canada. This lower population of the province created a need for the air personnel to participate in cultural and sporting events in the communities. The schools provided bands where the local community had lost their band or never had one. Civilians brought the schools stage shows and concerts. Schools and communities united to produce fairs and carnivals. Air personnel and civilians danced together. Airmen and airwomen became the central figures in local sports. In the hockey season of 1942 - 43, the airmen took over the senior hockey league in the province. In cultural and sporting events, the airmen, airwomen and the local civilians united as one community. Only the Service Flying Training School at Moose Jaw reported friction between civilians and airmen. The violence at Moose Jaw in 1944 was the result of poor morale and discipline among a group of airmen. The disturbances were important because they demonstrated the potential for friction between civilians and air personnel. <b>Patriotism,</b> <b>economic</b> recovery and the unity of air schools and host communities for the war effort brought a significant and lasting change to the province. The Second World War was an important chapter in Saskatchewan history that cannot be ignored...|$|R
40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. The new {{constitutional}} dispensation {{which came}} into being in 1994 rendered the Afrikaner people politically powerless in a numerically black dominated one-man-one-votewinner-takes-all system. In {{the face of a}} state policy bent on nation building and averse to minority rights, the need for a strategy to recapture their right to self-determination arises. Self-determination may vary from corporate/cultural rights to internal autonomy, to complete political independence in a sovereign territorial state. With selfdetermination {{in one form or another}} as objective, the next question is whether the Afrikaner has the will to survive. The Afrikaner is a divided people and the will to reassert itself seems dormant. However, there are increasing signs of a reawakening nationalism. Part of a strategy for selfdetermination should therefore be directed at reviving and mobilising the Afrikaner's will and ethnic <b>patriotism.</b> <b>Economic</b> empowerment is also necessary as part of the means to enforce its will and achieve its objectives. Strategy is largely based on values. An analysis of African and Western orientated Afrikaner values reveals serious differences in, inter alia, reality, economic and religious perceptions. This can become a motivating force for reasserting Afrikaner self-determination. Strategy entails imposing one's will on an adversary. No strategy is needed where there is no resistance or opposition. There are a variety of options for exerting coercion in order to force the opposition to comply with a freedom movement's demands for self-determination. A number of options can be proffered. Not all are equally appropriate or politic. Circumstances should dictate the choice. Some of these options are: The so-called soft option. This entails convincing the opponent that it would be also in his own interest to accede to the freedom movement's demands and, conversely, to his detriment to oppose those demands. The psychological or propaganda option, using methods of psychological persuasion to undermine the opposition's morale and encourage one's own people. It also serves to mobilise international opinion. which is becoming more sympathetic to ethnic demands for self-determination. The cybernetic option, utilising information technology and cyberspace as a weapon against the opposition and to enhance one's own organisation and empowerment. Physical violence as used by revolutionary forces, urban guerillas and other terrorists. This could be counter productive because innocent people are often targeted and even killed. These options may be exercised individually or in conjunction with each other...|$|R

With an unbiased competition agency we find that the foreign takeover is more likely to occur the higher the level of trade openness is.

In this paper we offer an explanation why globalization can reinforce the case for promoting “national champions”. We analyze an oligopolistic market where a domestic and a foreign firm {{are engaged in a}} takeover battle for a domestic competitor. Any merger or acquisition (M&A) must be approved by the national government whose objective function may include a bias against the foreign takeover. That bias endogenously results from lobbying efforts of the domestic firm that would become the outsider in the foreign acquisition scenario. In the case where the government is unbiased and only cares about welfare we find that falling trade barriers trigger the cross-border acquisition. However, when the domestic government cares sufficiently strongly about lobbying contributions, globalization has a qualitatively different effect. The foreign takeover would then only emerge in an intermediate range of trade costs. Once trade integration reaches a critical level the biased government starts to block the foreign takeover and instead opens the door for the national champion.
