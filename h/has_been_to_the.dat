Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy.

5|$|Minority {{ethnic groups}} include white Zimbabweans, {{who make up}} less than 1% of the total {{population}}.

Most emigration <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom (between 200,000 and 500,000 Britons are of Rhodesian or Zimbabwean origin), South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

25|$|The {{environment}} of Kazakhstan has been badly damaged by human activity. Most {{of the water}} in Kazakhstan is polluted by industrial effluents, pesticide and fertilizer residue, and, in some places, radioactive elements. The most visible damage <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Aral Sea, which as recently as the 1970s was larger than any of the Great Lakes of North America save Lake Superior. The sea began to shrink rapidly when sharply increased irrigation and other demands on the only significant tributaries, the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya (the latter reaching the Aral from neighboring Uzbekistan), all but eliminated inflow. During the Soviet Era, Kazakhstan received water from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan provided oil and gas for these two nations in return. However, {{after the collapse of the}} USSR this system had collapsed and no plan to replace this system has been put in place. According to research conducted by the International Crisis Group, there is little political will to solve this problem despite Central Asia's need for mutual resource-sharing. By 1993 the Aral Sea had lost an estimated 60% of its volume, in the process breaking into three unconnected segments. Increasing salinity and reduced habitat have killed the Aral Sea's fish, hence destroying its once-active fishing industry, and the receding shoreline has left the former port of Aral'sk more than seventy kilometers from the water's edge. The depletion of this large body of water has increased temperature variations in the region, which in turn have affected agriculture. A much greater agricultural impact, however, has come from the salt- and pesticide-laden soil that the wind is known to carry as far away as the Himalaya Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Deposition of this heavily saline soil on nearby fields effectively sterilizes them. Evidence suggests that salts, pesticides, and residues of chemical fertilizers are also adversely affecting human life around the former Aral Sea; infant mortality in the region approaches 10% compared with the 1991 national rate of 2.7%.|$|E
500|$|Betjeman characterised Heber's {{style as}} {{consciously}} literary, with careful choices of adjectives and vivid figures of speech: [...] "poetic imagery was {{as important as}} didactic truth". A more recent analysis by J. R. Watson draws attention to Heber's tendency to deliver what he terms [...] "a rather obvious sermon", and to his mixing of powerful description with [...] "a rather trite moralism". A handful of Heber's hymns have survived into popular use into the 21st century. One whose popularity has waned is the missionary hymn [...] "From Greenland's Icy Mountains", written in 1819 {{as part of a}} country-wide campaign on behalf of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). Watson describes this as [...] "a conspicuous example of that fervent belief to convert the world to Christianity which led Heber and others to lay down their lives in the mission field", and while widely sung until {{the second half of the}} 20th century, it was for instance omitted from the 1982 revision of the Episcopal Church hymnal. Betjeman felt that in the modern world, the words of this hymn seem patronising and insensitive to other beliefs, with references to [...] "...every prospect pleases and only man is vile", and to [...] "the heathen in his blindness [...] down to wood and stone". These phrases and the assumptions behind them offended Gandhi, who drew attention to them in a speech to the YMCA in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1925: [...] "My own experience in my travels throughout India <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrary ... is not vile. He is as much a seeker after truth as you and I are, possibly more so". Other Heber texts remain popular, and the Dictionary of North American Hymnology noted that most of his hymns remain in use.|$|E
