25|$|Louisville {{had one of}} {{the largest}} slave trades in the United States before the Civil War, and much of the city's initial growth is {{attributed}} to that trade. Shifting agricultural needs produced an excess of slaves in Kentucky, and many were sold <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> other parts of the Upper South to the Deep South. In 1820, the slave population was at its height at nearly 26% of the Kentucky population, but by 1860, that proportion had dropped significantly, even though this percentage still represented over 10,000 people. Through the 1850s, slave traders sold 2500–4000 slaves annually from Kentucky down river.|$|E
