40|$|ABSTRACT: Many {{have claimed}} that {{education}} of the ethical issues raised by biotechnology is essential in universities, {{but there is little}} knowledge of its effectiveness. The focus {{of this paper is to}} investigate how university students assess the information given in class to make their own value judgments and decisions relating to issues of agricultural biotechnology, especially over genetically modified organisms (<b>GMOs).</b> <b>Analysis</b> of homework reports related with agricultural biotechnology after identification of key concepts and ideas in each student report is presented. The ideas were sorted into different categories. The ideas were compared with those in the reading materials using the same categories. These categories included: concern about affects on humans, affects on the environment, developing countries and starvation, trust in industry, responsibility of scientists, risk perception, media influence, need for (international) organizations or third parties, and information dissemination. What was consistent through the different years was that more than half of the students took a "neutral " position.

40|$|Background: In {{order to}} provide a system fully {{integrated}} with qPCR screening, usually used in <b>GMO</b> routine <b>analysis,</b> {{as well as being}} able to detect, characterize and identify a broad spectrum of GMOs in food/feed matrices, two bidirectional DNA walking methods targeting p 35 S or tNOS, the most common transgenic elements found in GM crops, were developed. These newly developed DNA walking methods are completing the previously implemented DNA walking method targeting the t 35 S pCAMBIA element. Results: First, the newly developed DNA walking methods, anchored on the sequences used for the p 35 S or tNOS qPCR screening, were tested on Bt rice that contains these two transgenic elements. Second, the methods were assessed on a maize sample containing a low amount of the GM MON 863 event, representing a more complex matrix in terms of genome size and sensitivity. Finally, to illustrate its applicability in <b>GMO</b> routine <b>analysis</b> by enforcement laboratories, the entire workflow of the integrated strategy, including qPCR screening to detect the potential presence of GMOs and the subsequent DNA walking methods to characterize and identify the detected GMOs, was applied on a GeMMA Scheme Proficiency Test matrix. Via the characterization of the transgene flanking region between the transgenic cassette and the plant genome as well as of a part of the transgenic cassette, the presence of GMOs was properly confirmed or infirmed in all tested samples. Conclusion: Due to their simple procedure and their short time-frame to get results, the developed DNA walking methods proposed here can be easily implemented in <b>GMO</b> routine <b>analysis</b> by the enforcement laboratories. In providing crucial information about the transgene flanking regions and/or the transgenic cassettes, this DNA walking strategy is a key molecular tool to prove the presence of GMOs in any given food/feed matrix...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays most {{animal feed}} {{products}} imported into Europe have a GMO (genetically modified organism) label. This {{means that they}} contain European Union (EU) -authorized GMOs. For enforcement of these labeling requirements, it is necessary, with the rising number of EU-authorized GMOs, to perform {{an increasing number of}} analyses. In addition to this, it is necessary to test products for the potential presence of EU-unauthorized <b>GMOs.</b> <b>Analysis</b> for EU-authorized and -unauthorized GMOs in animal feed has thus become laborious and expensive. Initial screening steps may reduce the number of GMO identification methods that need to be applied, but with the increasing diversity also screening with GMO elements has become more complex. For the present study, the application of an informative detailed 24 -element screening and subsequent identification strategy was applied in 50 animal feed samples. Almost all feed samples were labeled as containing GMO-derived materials. The main goal of the study was therefore to investigate if a detailed screening strategy would reduce the number of subsequent identification analyses. An additional goal was to test the samples in this way for the potential presence of EU-unauthorized GMOs. Finally, to test the robustness of the approach, eight of the samples were tested in a concise interlaboratory study.

40|$|El pdf del artículo es la versión pre-print. The {{development}} {{of genetically modified}} crops has had {{a great impact on}} the agriculture and food industries. However, the {{development of}} any genetically modified organism (GMO) requires the application of analytical procedures to confirm the equivalence of the GMO compared to its isogenic non-transgenic counterpart. Moreover, the use of GMOs in foods and agriculture faces numerous criticisms from consumers and ecological organizations that have led some countries to regulate their production, growth, and commercialization. These regulations have brought about the need of new and more powerful analytical methods to face the complexity of this topic. In this regard, MS-based technologies are increasingly used for <b>GMOs</b> <b>analysis</b> to provide very useful information on GMO composition (e. g., metabolites, proteins). This review focuses on the MS-based analytical methodologies used to characterize genetically modified crops (also called transgenic crops). First, an overview on genetically modified crops development is provided, together with the main difficulties of their analysis. Next, the different MS-based analytical approaches applied to characterize GM crops are critically discussed, and include “-omics” approaches and target-based approaches.

40|$|In many countries, genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMO) legislations have been established in order to guarantee the traceability of food/feed {{products on the market}} and to protect the consumer freedom of choice.

To address these challenges, alternative GMO detection methods have been developed, allowing faster detections of single GM target (e. g., loop-mediated isothermal amplification), simultaneous detections of multiple GM targets (e. g., PCR capillary gel electrophoresis, microarray, and Luminex), more accurate quantification of GM targets (e. g., digital PCR), or characterization of partially known (e. g., DNA walking and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)) or unknown (e. g., NGS) GMO.

40|$|Competent {{laboratories}} monitor {{genetically modified}} organisms (GMOs) and products derived thereof in the food and feed chain {{in the framework of}} labeling and traceability legislation. In addition, screening is performed to detect the unauthorized presence of GMOs including asynchronously authorized GMOs or GMOs that are not officially registered for commercialization (unknown GMOs). Currently, unauthorized or unknown events are detected by screening blind samples for commonly used transgenic elements, such as p 35 S or t-nos. If (1) positive detection of such screening elements shows the presence of transgenic material and (2) all known GMOs are tested by event-specific methods but are not detected, then the presence of an unknown GMO is inferred. However, such evidence is indirect because it is based on negative observations and inconclusive because the procedure does not identify the causative event per se. In addition, detection of unknown events is hampered in products that also contain known authorized events. Here, we outline alternative approaches for analytical detection and GMO identification and develop new methods to complement the existing routine screening procedure. We developed a fluorescent anchor-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the identification of the sequences flanking the p 35 S and t-nos screening elements. Thus, anchor-PCR fingerprinting allows the detection of unique discriminative signals per event. In addition, we established a collection of in silico calculated fingerprints of known events to support interpretation of experimentally generated anchor-PCR GM fingerprints of blind samples. Here, we first describe the molecular characterization of a novel GMO, which expresses recombinant human intrinsic factor in Arabidopsis thaliana. Next, we purposefully treated the novel GMO as a blind sample to simulate how the new methods lead to the molecular identification of a novel unknown event without prior knowledge of its transgene sequence. The results demonstrate that the new methods complement routine screening procedures by providing direct conclusive evidence and may also be useful to resolve masking of unknown events by known events.

The cost required for <b>GMO</b> <b>analysis</b> is constantly increasing due to the progress of GMO commercialization, with inclusion of higher diversity of species, traits and introduced genetic elements. Thus, analytical technologies must evolve towards high throughput GMO diagnostics. This chapter describes different strategies recently developed tosimultaneously detect/identify many GMOs.

Multiplex PCRs combining a limited number of targets are available for <b>GMO</b> <b>analysis.</b> In some cases, several of these reactions can be performed in parallel and the resulting products mixed and detected together by capillary electrophoresis or array hybridization. Non PCR-based approaches (e. g. NAIMA) have also been explored for higher multiplexing potential. Simultaneous detection of very high numbers of targetsis possible bya SNPlex method based on single nucleotide polymorphisms and the Padlock ligation microarray system, relying on a first ligation that only occurs after hybridization to the target, followed by PCR and detection by array.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} a framework {{based on a}} real-option approach to assess the economics of delaying the introduction of genetically modified (GM) technologies in agriculture due to concerns about their unintended effects (unexpected environmental side effects). We applied our framework to analyze the consequences of delaying the introduction of Golden Rice, GM corn {{in much of the}} world, and GM wheat and rice globally. In the case of Golden Rice, we found that delay of more than 10 years of introduction of the technology may result in several millions of eyesights lost. The damage of the technology must be greater than between $ 2. 7 and $ 29 billion of discounted net benefits expected to be gained from the technology under various assumptions. The analysis also suggests that restriction of the adoption of GM in corn, rice, and wheat is justified if the net present value of the damage is above $ 300 billion to $ 1. 22 trillion, depending on assumptions about impacts and interest rate.

Beneficial properties, such as prebiotic and anti-inflammatory effects or modulation of the immune system have been attributed to these oligosaccharides. However, studies regarding composition and characterization of goat milk oligosaccharides (GMO) are still scarce and more information is required. In human and bovine milk oligosaccharides, qualitative and quantitative changes during the different stages of lactation have been reported.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundGenetically {{modified}} organisms (GMOs) have numerous biomedical, {{agricultural and}} environmental applications. Development of accurate methods {{for the detection}} of GMOs is a prerequisite for the identification and control of authorized and unauthorized release of these engineered organisms into the environment and into the food chain. Current detection methods are unable to detect uncharacterized GMOs, since either the DNA sequence of the transgene or the amino acid sequence of the protein must be known for DNA-based or immunological-based detection, respectively. MethodsHere we describe the application of an epigenetics-based approach {{for the detection of}} mammalian <b>GMOs</b> via <b>analysis</b> of chromatin structural changes occurring in the host nucleus upon the insertion of foreign or endogenous DNA. ResultsImmunological methods combined with DNA next generation sequencing enabled direct interrogation of chromatin structure and identification of insertions of various size foreign (human or viral) DNA sequences, DNA sequences often used as genome modification tools (e. g. viral sequences, transposon elements), or endogenous DNA sequences into the nuclear genome of a model animal organism. ConclusionsThe results provide a proof-of-concept that epigenetic approaches can be used to detect the insertion of endogenous and exogenous sequences into the genome of higher organisms where the method of genetic modification, the sequence of inserted DNA, and the exact genomic insertion site(s) are unknown.

Due to their trait-specific nature, these methods allow discriminating better between the different GMO. Compared to GMO screening applying only common targets such as the 35 S promoter or the NOS terminator, screening with trait-specific methods reduces the number of possible GMO candidates present in a sample, reducing the cost of the analysis.

40|$|An {{innovative}} covalent micro-sphere immunoassay, {{based on}} the usage of fluorescent beads coupled to a specific antibody, was developed for the quantification of the endotoxin Cry 1 Ab present in MON 810 and Bt 11 GM maize lines. In particular a specific protocol was developed to asses the presence of Cry 1 Ab in a very broad range of GM maize concentrations, from 0. 1 to 100 % (weight GMO/weight). Test linearity was achieved {{in the range of}} values from 0. 1 to 3 % while fluorescence saturation level occurred at 25 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were equal to 0. 018 % and 0. 054 % respectively.

40|$|Biotechnology is diversifying rapidly {{through the}} {{development}} and application of new approaches to genome editing and ongoing research into synthetic biology. Proponents of biotechnology are enthusiastic about these new developments and have recently begun calling for environmental movements to abandon their campaigns against Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and for organic agriculture to reconsider its exclusion of Genetic Modification (GM). In this article, we begin by describing the diversity of practices that cluster under both the terms GM and organic and show that {{although there is a}} clash of different cultures of agriculture at stake, there is also a spectrum of practices existing between these two poles. Having established the terms of the debate, we then go on to analyse whether the organic movement should reconsider its position on GM in light of new plant breeding techniques (NPBTs), using the criteria highlighted as important by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) in their 2016 draft revised position on <b>GMOs.</b> Through this <b>analysis,</b> we suggest that given the in-context-trajectory of biotechnology development, the continued narrow framing of agricultural problems and the ongoing exclusion of important socio-economic, political and cultural dimensions, the organic movement is justified in maintaining its opposition to GM in the face of NPBTs...|$|R
40|$|To {{guarantee}} the traceability {{on the market}} and the freedom of choice for consumers, genetically modified organisms (GMO) legislations have been established in many countries, including in Europe (EU). However, the implementation of these legislations by the enforcement laboratories is becoming complex due mainly to the increasing number and diversity of GMO. To cope with the problematic of EU unauthorized GMO, this PhD aims to improve and strengthen the existing GMO detection system using high-tech approaches. First, as a study case, an overview of genetically modified (GM) rice, developed around the world was carried out to collect information related inter alia on elements found in their transgenic cassette. Second, according to this information, key targets, frequently found in GMO (p 35 S and tNOS) or exclusively observed in EU unauthorized GMO (t 35 S pCAMBIA), were selected to develop a strategy allowing to detect and characterize a broad range of GMO. This strategy, fully integrated in the <b>GMO</b> routine <b>analysis,</b> consists to characterize sequences surrounding detected key transgenic elements using a DNA walking approach. By this way, the acquisition of sequences from the junction between the transgenic cassette and the plant genome as well as the associations of elements typically found in transgenic constructs allow to confirm the presence of GMO in food/feed matrices. Due to its good performance thoroughly assessed via several unprocessed and processed food/feed matrices, this strategy represents a key tool, easily implementable by the enforcement laboratories. With the aim to even more simplify the workflow and increase the throughput of this strategy, the sequencing step was performed using the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology instead of the Sanger technology. In parallel, the detection of GMO in alimentary matrices using exclusively the NGS technology, through a whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach, was also investigated. As this last approach does not theoretically require any prior information about the targeted sequences, GMO composed only of unknown transgenic elements could be detected. This work has thus allowed to provide additional strategies to the current GMO detection system in order to characterize a larger spectrum of GMO, both authorized or not...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} written within the {{contemporary}} classical institutional economics tradition. The intention {{has been to}} provide insight into how different institutions can enable us to avoid harmful effects and generate beneficial effects {{on the environment and}} food security from genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This is done by analysing how institutions influence perspectives on GMOs, the GMOs that are developed and commercialized, as well as our ability to handle possible uncertain and unknown effects of GMOs. The thesis consists of 4 papers. Paper 1 analyses scientists’ perspectives on the release of GMOs into the environment, and the relationship between their perspectives and the institutional context that they work within, e. g. their place of employment (university or industry), funding of their research (public or industry) and their disciplinary background (ecology, molecular biology or conventional plant breeding). Q-methodology is employed to examine these issues. Two distinct perspectives are identified by interviewing 62 scientists. Perspective 1 is characterised by a moderately negative attitude to GMOs and the uncertainty and ignorance involved are emphasised. Perspective 2 is characterised by a positive attitude to GMOs and it is emphasised that GMOs are useful and do not represent any unique risks compared to conventional crops. The results show a strong association between scientists’ perspective on GMOs and the explanatory variables training, funding and place of employment. Paper 2 analyses how different institutional structures shape the research and development (R&D) of GMOs. Whether this R&D is conducted within companies, cooperatives or public research organisations is expected to influence the type of crops and traits that are developed and therefore the effects on society and ecosystems that potentially could follow from the use of GMOs. This issue is analysed empirically by statistical analysis of 1323 notifications for field trials with GMOs in the EU. The results show that the type of R&D organisation influences strongly the traits and crops that are developed. Paper 3 analyses how the type of regulation for marketing of GMOs influences which GMOs that are commercialised. The EU and Norway have assessed the release of GMOs as commercial products quite differently. Of twenty four notifications approved by the EU, Norway has approved four, rejected ten, and has ten pending. The paper examines whether these differences could be explained by different judgments concerning the effects to be prevented and encouraged, response to uncertainty and and the burden of proof defined. Norwegian rejections are found to be explicable by the combination of no real benefit to society, lack of scientific knowledge, and involved risks. The main explanation for the EU approvals is that they see {{no reason to believe that}} there will be any adverse effects on health and the environment. Paper 4 analyses how capable three different governance regimes are for adequate handling of uncertain and unknown effects of GMOs. GMOs are characterized by strong uncertainty. This implies that procedures for identification, reduction and monitoring of uncertainty, as well as how to treat irreducible uncertainty will be highly incomplete. Governance mechanisms that facilitate cooperative adaptation and communicative rationality (communicate with the intention of reaching agreement exclusively via the force of better arguments) are therefore needed. The three governance regimes compared are: GMOs are produced by private firms and these firms are made liable for harm (GR 1), GMOs are produced by private firms and the government decides whether the crops should be marketed (GR 2), GMOs are produced by public research organisations and the government decides whether the crops should be marketed (GR 3). GR 3 will be stronger in cooperative adaptation and communicative rationality than GR 2. Public research organisations have fewer conflicts of interest with the government than private firms, and academic norms are important as opposed to firms where commercial norms are important. Difficulties in proving harm and identifying the responsible firm will make GR 1 weak in cooperative adaptation and communicative rationality. Based on the results of this thesis it is advised that consideration of the environment and food security justify institutional reforms concerning how we decide which GMOs that should be released into the environment and how we organise the R&D of <b>GMOs.</b> My <b>analysis</b> suggests that it is important to involve scientists from several disciplines in public marketing decisions on new technologies and that information about the contextual background of the scientists is relevant in these decisions. There are strong arguments for changing current practise where those that apply for marketing approval of GMOs also produce the risk assessment prior to marketing and the post marketing monitoring. It is further important to increase public GMO research to secure scientific advices and development of products that are independent from the priorities of the industry and to a greater extent could serve public needs...|$|R
