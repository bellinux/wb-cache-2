40|$|Contaminant in a {{hydraulic}} fluid is broadly defined as any substance that impairs the proper functioning of {{a hydraulic}} system. Hydraulic fluid can be contaminated by air, particles, water, and foreign fluids. Fluid contamination can cause numerous problems including component damage, unacceptable noise, poor component response and severe fluid degradation. This paper focuses on two major contaminants {{that should be}} considered when designing a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>reservoir</b> – air and particle contamination. A proper reservoir design can prevent the occurrence of air and solid contaminants within the hydraulic system and reduce their negative effects. A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>reservoir</b> should be designed {{in such a way as}} to stabilize and direct the oil flow inside the reservoir, so that the fluid has enough time to release air bubbles and to deposit solid particles. In order to visualize and understand flow patterns inside the reservoir, all the advantages of using simulation techniques within the field of reservoir design will be shown.

The booster actuator is the main component in mechanism of aileron’s deflection. The crew was able to arrange an emergency landing thanks to the spare oil onboard: load specialists refilled the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Due to safety concerns {{and in order to}} prevent the possibility of other similar incidents, a technical investigation took place. The study aimed to carry out the analysis of root causes of the actuator failure. The Booster actuator is composed mainly by the piston rod and its aluminum external case (AA 7049). The assembly has two bronze caps on both ends. These are fixed in position by means of two retainers. At one end of the actuator case is placed a trunnion: a cylindrical protrusion used as a pivoting point on the aircraft. The fracture was located {{at one end of the}} case, on the trunnion side, in correspondence to the cap and over the retainer. One of the two fracture surfaces was found separated to the case and with the cap entangled inside. The fracture surfaces of the external case indicated fatigue crack growth followed by ductile separation. The failure analysis was performed by means of optical, metallographic, digital and electronic microscopy. The collected evidences showed a multiple initiation fracture mechanism. Moreover, 3 D scanner reconstruction and numerical simulation demonstrated that dimensional non conformances and thermal loads caused an abnormal stress concentration.

40|$|International audienceSites of monomethylmercury (MMHg) {{production}} in Amazonian regions {{have been identified}} in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> lake sediments and wetlands, but tailings ponds have not yet received sufficient attention for this purpose. This work evidenced high MMHg production within the water column and the interstitial water of two tailings ponds of French Guiana Au mines located; (i) in a small scale exploitation (Combat) where Hg was used for Au amalgamation, and (ii) in an industrial on-going Au mine (Yaoni) processing without Hg. The (MMHg) D maximum (2. 5 ng L− 1) occurred in the oxic water column above the sediment-water interface (SWI) of the most recent tailings pond (Combat), where the substrate was fresh, the redox transition was sharp and the pool of total Hg was large. In the Yaoni pond, the (MMHg) D maximum concentration (1. 4 ng L− 1) was located at the SWI where suboxic conditions prevailed. Using the (MMHg) D concentration as a proxy for Hg methylation rates, the present results show that Hg methylation may occur in various redox conditions in tailings ponds, and are favored in areas where the organic matter regeneration is more active. A 3 -month long laboratory experiment was performed in oxic and anoxic boxes filled with high turbidity waters from the Combat Au mine to simulate tailings ponds. Slaked lime was added in an experimental set (2 mg L− 1) and appeared to be very efficient for the reduction of suspended particulate matter (SPM) to environmentally acceptable concentrations. However, {{at the end of the}} experiment, large (MMHg) D concentrations were monitored under treated anoxic conditions with the (MMHg) D maximum located at the SWI above the Fe-reducing zones. No (MMHg) D was detected in oxic experiments. The use of slaked lime for SPM decantation appears to be an efficient and non-onerous process for Au miners to avoid Hg methylation in tailings ponds when it is combined with rapid drainage of the mine waters. A subsequent human intervention is however necessary for the recovery of soil structure through the cover of dried ponds with organic rich materials and reforestation to avoid the stagnation of rain waters and the occurrence of anoxia...|$|R
