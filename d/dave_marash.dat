500|$|Stossel {{intended}} to go work at Seattle Magazine, {{but it had}} gone out of business by the time he graduated. His contacts there, however, got him a job at KGW-TV in Portland, Oregon, where Stossel began as a newsroom gofer, working his way up to researcher and then writer. After a few years, the news director told Stossel to go on the air and read what he wrote. Stossel, who confesses to having been frightened of being on the air, has expressed embarrassment at watching videos of his early performances. Nonetheless, Stossel says his fear spurred him to improve, examining broadcasts of David Brinkley and Jack Perkins to imitate them. Stossel also struggled with a stuttering problem he had harbored since childhood. After a few years of on-air reporting, Stossel was hired by WCBS-TV in New York City, by Ed Joyce, the same news director who hired Arnold Diaz, Linda Ellerbee, <b>Dave</b> <b>Marash,</b> Joel Siegel and Lynn Sherr. Stossel was disappointed at CBS, feeling that the journalism was of a lower quality than in Portland, and disliking the lesser quantity of time devoted to research there. Stossel cites union work rules that discouraged the extra work that Stossel felt allowed employees to be creative, which he says represented his [...] "first real introduction to the deals made by special interests". Stossel also [...] "hated" [...] Joyce, who he felt was [...] "cold and critical", though Stossel credits Joyce with allowing him the freedom to pursue his own story ideas, and with recommending the Hollins Communications Research Institute in Roanoke, Virginia, that largely cured Stossel's stuttering problem.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is often}} unclear whether recent discussions of anti-American bias at Al Jazeera are {{referring}} also to Al Jazeera English or only to Al Jazeera's Arabic-language channel.

An {{example of this is}} a 2011 claim by Bill O'Reilly that Al Jazeera is [...] "anti-Semitic" [...] and [...] "anti-American" [...] and a subsequent defense of Al Jazeera against these claims made by former Al Jazeera English anchor <b>Dave</b> <b>Marash</b> on the O'Reilly Factor. Another example concerns statements by former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who in April 2004 denounced Al-Jazeera's Arabic-language coverage of the Iraq War as [...] "vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable," [...] but took a more conciliatory tone in a 2011 interview for Frost Over The World, Al Jazeera English's news and public affairs program hosted by David Frost, praising the network as [...] "an important means of communication in the world.". The government of which Rumsfeld was part had deliberately targeted Al Jazeera journalists in Iraq and Afghanistan, and discussed bombing its headquarters in Doha.|$|E

5000|$|In January 1981, Marsh was demoted {{from her}} anchor {{position}} {{to make way for}} the recently rehired <b>Dave</b> <b>Marash,</b> causing her to appear distressed on air.
