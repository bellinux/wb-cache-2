5|$|Somatic {{recombination}} of immunoglobulins, {{also known}} as V(D)J recombination, involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments. V, D and J segments are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the genomes of mammals. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J <b>gene</b> <b>segment</b> (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of <b>gene</b> <b>segment,</b> and different combinations of gene segments {{can be used to}} generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different , and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.|$|E

2500|$|Myriad receptors are {{produced}} {{through a process}} known as clonal selection. [...] According to the clonal selection theory, at birth, an animal randomly generates a vast diversity of lymphocytes (each bearing a unique antigen receptor) from information encoded in a small family of genes. To generate each unique antigen receptor, these genes have undergone a process called V(D)J recombination, or combinatorial diversification, in which one <b>gene</b> <b>segment</b> recombines with other gene segments to form a single unique gene. This assembly process generates the enormous diversity of receptors and antibodies, before the body ever encounters antigens, and enables the immune system to respond to an almost unlimited diversity of antigens. Throughout an animal's lifetime, lymphocytes that can react against the antigens an animal actually encounters are selected for action—directed against anything that expresses that antigen.|$|E

2500|$|To {{improve the}} {{location}} and precision of the transgenic process, an enzyme known as Cre has been introduced. [...] Cre {{has proven to be}} a key element in a process known as recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). [...] While it has shown to have a lower efficiency of transgenic transformation than the P element transposases, Cre greatly lessens the labor-intensive abundance of balancing random P insertions. Cre aids in the targeted transgenesis of the DNA <b>gene</b> <b>segment</b> of interest, as it supports the mapping of the transgene insertion sites, known as loxP sites. [...] These sites, unlike P elements, can be specifically inserted to flank a chromosomal segment of interest, aiding in targeted transgenesis. [...] The Cre transposase is important in the catalytic cleavage of the base pairs present at the carefully positioned loxP sites, permitting more specific insertions of the transgenic donor plasmid of interest.|$|E
50|$|In the {{developing}} B cell, the first recombination event to occur is between one D and one J <b>gene</b> <b>segment</b> {{of the heavy}} chain locus. Any DNA between these two gene segments is deleted. This D-J recombination {{is followed by the}} joining of one V <b>gene</b> <b>segment,</b> from a region upstream of the newly formed DJ complex, forming a rearranged VDJ <b>gene</b> <b>segment.</b> All other gene segments between V and D segments are now deleted from the cell’s genome. Primary transcript (unspliced RNA) is generated containing the VDJ region of the heavy chain and both the constant mu and delta chains (Cμ and Cδ). (i.e. the primary transcript contains the segments: V-D-J-Cμ-Cδ). The primary RNA is processed to add a polyadenylated (poly-A) tail after the Cμ chain and to remove sequence between the VDJ segment and this constant <b>gene</b> <b>segment.</b> Translation of this mRNA leads to the production of the Ig μ heavy chain protein.|$|E

5000|$|During {{thymocyte}} development, the T {{cell receptor}} (TCR) chains undergo {{essentially the same}} sequence of ordered recombination events as that described for immunoglobulins. D-to-J recombination occurs first in the β chain of the TCR. This process can involve either the joining of the Dβ1 <b>gene</b> <b>segment</b> to one of six Jβ1 segments or the joining of the Dβ2 <b>gene</b> <b>segment</b> to one of six Jβ2 segments. [...] DJ recombination is followed (as above) with Vβ-to-DβJβ rearrangements. All gene segments between the Vβ-Dβ-Jβ gene segments in the newly formed complex are deleted and the primary transcript is synthesized that incorporates the constant domain gene (Vβ-Dβ-Jβ-Cβ). mRNA transcription splices out any intervening sequence and allows translation of the full length protein for the TCR Cβ chain.|$|E

40|$|The {{rearrangement}} {{and expression}} of human T cell receptor (TCR) -gamma and -delta <b>gene</b> <b>segments</b> in clonal and polyclonal populations of early fetal and postnatal human TCR-gamma/delta thymocytes were examined. The {{data suggest that}} the TCR-gamma and -delta loci rearrange in an ordered and coordinated fashion. Initial rearrangements at the TCR-delta locus join V delta 2 to D delta 3, and initial rearrangements at the TCR- gamma locus join downstream V gamma <b>gene</b> <b>segments</b> (V gamma 1. 8 and V gamma 2) to upstream J gamma <b>gene</b> <b>segments</b> associated with C gamma 1. These rearrangements are characterized by minimal junctional diversity. At later times there is a switch at the TCR-delta locus such that V delta 1 is joined to upstream D delta <b>gene</b> <b>segments,</b> and a switch at the TCR-gamma locus such that upstream V gamma <b>gene</b> <b>segments</b> are joined to downstream J gamma <b>gene</b> <b>segments</b> associated with C gamma 2. These rearrangements are characterized by extensive junctional diversity. Programmed rearrangement explains in part the origin of discrete subpopulations of peripheral blood TCR-gamma/delta lymphocytes that have been defined in previous studies. In addition, cytokine production by early fetal and postnatal TCR-gamma/delta thymocyte clones was examined. Fetal thymocyte clones produced significant levels of IL- 4 and IL- 5 following stimulation, whereas postnatal thymocyte clones did not produce these cytokines.

40|$|SummaryThe {{critical}} initial step in V(D) J recombination, binding of RAG 1 and RAG 2 to recombination signal sequences flanking {{antigen receptor}} V, D, and J <b>gene</b> <b>segments,</b> has not previously been characterized in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that RAG protein binding {{occurs in a}} highly focal manner to a small region of active chromatin encompassing Igκ and Tcrα J <b>gene</b> <b>segments</b> and Igh and Tcrβ J and J-proximal D <b>gene</b> <b>segments.</b> Formation of these small RAG-bound regions, which we refer to as recombination centers, occurs in a developmental stage- and lineage-specific manner. Each RAG protein is independently capable of specific binding within recombination centers. While RAG 1 binding was detected only at regions containing recombination signal sequences, RAG 2 binds at thousands of sites in the genome containing histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4. We propose that recombination centers coordinate V(D) J recombination by providing discrete sites within which <b>gene</b> <b>segments</b> are captured for recombination...|$|R
40|$|Although V(D) J {{recombination}} {{is thought}} to be regulated by changes in the accessibility of chromatin to the recombinase machinery, the mechanisms responsible for establishing “open” chromatin are poorly understood. We performed a detailed study of the acetylation status of histones associated with 11 VH <b>gene</b> <b>segments,</b> their flanking regions, and various intergenic elements during B-cell development and ontogeny, when V(D) J recombination is highly regulated. Histone H 4 shows higher and more-regulated acetylation than does histone H 3 in the VH locus. In adult pro-B cells, VH <b>gene</b> <b>segments</b> are acetylated prior to V(D) J rearrangement, with higher acetylation associated with JH-distal VH <b>gene</b> <b>segments.</b> While large regions of the VH locus have similar patterns of histone acetylation, acetylation is narrowly confined to the <b>gene</b> <b>segments,</b> their flanking promoters, and recombinase signal sequence elements. Thus, histone acetylation in the VH locus is both locally and globally regulated. Increased histone acetylation accompanies preferential recombination of JH-proximal VH <b>gene</b> <b>segments</b> in early B-cell ontogeny, and decreased histone acetylation accompanies inhibition of V-DJ recombination in a transgenic model of immunoglobulin heavy-chain allelic exclusion. Thus, changes in histone acetylation appear to be important for both promotion and inhibition of V-DJ rearrangement during B-cell ontogeny and development...|$|R
