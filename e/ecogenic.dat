40|$|A 47 -year-old woman {{presented}} with bilateral gradual loss of vision, ocular discomfort and seeing a black shadow {{in her right}} visual field over 6 &emsp 14;months duration. Her medical history was extensive including: developmental delay, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypertension, spinal stenosis, epilepsy and suspected idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Ocular examination revealed choroidal elevation in both eyes, which were highly <b>ecogenic</b> on ecography and confirmed to be calcifications of choroids on CT scan in her both eyes. She had subnormal vision and reduced colour vision in her both eyes. Electrodiagostic studies suggested rod dysfunction. She had typical features of Albright's hereditary dystrophy and was positive for the GNAS 1 mutation. She is currently being monitored by ophthalmologlists and is also under a medical team undergoing further assessment with regard to her treatment. 11961...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{pictorial}} {{essay was}} to evaluate the sonographic features of synovial fluid in patients with arthritis. Methods: Sixty-nine patients with active synovitis (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, septic arthritis, crystal arthropathies, post-traumatic arthritis) were studied. Sonographic evaluation was performed with a AU- 5 Harmonic, Esaote Biomedica (Genoa, Italy) equipped with a 10 - 14 MHz broadband linear transducer and a Diasus Dynamic Imaging Ltd. (Livingston, Scotland UK) equipped with a 8 - 16 MHz broadband linear transducer. Results: Six main different sonographic patterns were detected: 1) Anechoic: increased amount of homogeneous anechoic synovial fluid (exudative synovitis). 2) Cloudy: <b>ecogenic</b> structures (proteinaceous material). 3) Mixed: anechoic synovial fluid and proteinaceus material. 4) “Snow-storm” aspect: multiple mildly and heterogeneous echoic spots (9 out of 10 patients with acute gouty synovitis). 5) Dotted: multiple sparkling hyperechoic dots without posterior acoustic shadow (10 out of 12 patient with chondrocalcinosis). 6) Granular: irregular turbid aspect of the synovial fluid. It was present in 3 patient with septic arthritis. Conclusions: The {{results of this study}} indicate that high resolution ultrasonography is able to detect different features of synovial fluid. Further studies are needed to assess both sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography in “in vivo” synovial fluid examination...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} foreign {{bodies in the}} breast are {{surgical}} clips and fragments of localization hook-wires [1]. Pieces of glass, lead shot and other metal-lic objects have also been reported. Mammography is often useful in the diagnosis of these metallic foreign bodies within the breast. Montrey et al. [2] reported the frequency of retained wire fragments to be 0. 2 %. Some studies reported possible wire migration to the chest wall, pleural and abdominal cavities. For the ex-cision of non-palpable breast lesions, wire-guided lo-calization is the standard procedure. A 70 -year-old female who presented with swelling in the left breast, had palpable mass in her left breast at physical examination. She {{did not have a}} history of surgery or trauma owing to her left breast. She does not remember any interaction with any foreign body ei-ther. Her right breast was mastectomized because of in-vasive ductal carcinoma. Screening mammography de-tected lineer dens structure in the upper lateral quad-rant of the left breast (Fig. 1). <b>Ecogenic</b> lineer structure was demonstrated at the same localization on ultra-sonography (Fig. 2). The sewing needle was extracted surgically. Foreign body in the breast may be asymptomatic like our case and it can be detected incidentally. Cases of migrating needles in any part of the body might stay asymptomatic for a long time, or might be found through symptoms related to toxic and allergic reac...|$|E
40|$|Familial {{porphyria}} cutanea tarda (f-PCT) {{results from}} the half-normal activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D). Heterozygotes for this autosomal dominant trait are predisposed to photosensitive cutaneous lesions by various <b>ecogenic</b> factors, including iron overload and alcohol abuse. The 3. 6 -kb URO-D gene was completely sequenced, and a long-range PCR method was developed to amplify the entire gene for mutation analysis. Four missense mutations (M 165 R, L 195 F, N 304 K, and R 332 H), a microinsertion (g 10 insA), a deletion (g 645 Delta 1053), and a novel exonic splicing defect (E 314 E) were identified. Expression of the L 195 F, N 304 K, and R 332 H polypeptides revealed significant residual activity, whereas reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing demonstrated that the E 314 E lesion caused abnormal splicing and exon 9 skipping. Haplotyping indicated {{that three of the}} four families with the g 10 insA mutation were unrelated, indicating that these microinsertions resulted from independent mutational events. Screening of nine f-PCT probands revealed that 44 % were heterozygous or homozygous for the common hemochromatosis mutations, which suggests that iron overload may predispose to clinical expression. However, there was no clear correlation between f-PCT disease severity and the URO-D and/or hemochromatosis genotypes. These studies doubled the number of known f-PCT mutations, demonstrated that marked genetic heterogeneity underlies f-PCT, and permitted presymptomatic molecular diagnosis and counseling in these families to enable family members to avoid disease-precipitating factors...|$|E
