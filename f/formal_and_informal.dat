5|$|In Chicago, the Irish {{dominated}} {{social and}} athletic clubs that were {{closely tied to}} the political structure of the city. Some had acted as enforcers for politicians. As the first major group of 19th-century European immigrants to settle in the city, the Irish had established <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> political strength. In Chicago, ethnic white gangs had been attacking people in African-American neighborhoods, and the police, overwhelmingly white and increasingly Irish-American, seemed little inclined to try to stop them. Meanwhile, newspapers carried sensational accounts of any African American allegedly involved in crime.|$|E

5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; the dependent form {{functions as a}} determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the chair is mine). The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of the wars of {{independence}} itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E

5|$|The global {{financial}} {{system is the}} worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> economic actors that together facilitate international flows of financial capital for purposes of investment and trade financing. Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of economic globalization, its evolution is marked by the establishment of central banks, multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental organizations aimed at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets. In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of World War I, trade contracted as foreign exchange markets became paralyzed by money market illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening {{the effects of the}} global Great Depression until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the international monetary system after World War II improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance.|$|E
5|$|The {{unification}} of Germany into a politically and administratively integrated nation state officially occurred on 18 January 1871, in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles in France. Princes of the German states, excluding Austria, gathered there to proclaim Wilhelm I of Prussia as German Emperor after the French capitulation in the Franco-Prussian War. Unofficially, {{the de facto}} transition {{of most of the}} German-speaking populations into a federated organization of states had been developing for some time through alliances <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> between princely rulers—but in fits and starts; self-interests of the various parties hampered the process over nearly a century of autocratic experimentation, beginning in the era of the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (1806), and the subsequent rise of German nationalism.|$|E

30|$|The present paper {{extends the}} strand of tax evasion {{literature}} which departs from {{the assumption of}} imperfectly competitive labour markets by incorporating involuntary unemployment through the inclusion of search frictions. 3 See, for example, Fugazza and Jacques (2004), Boeri and Garibaldi (2005), and Kolm and Larsen (2006) who also model underground activities in high-income countries. These studies focus on labour market outcomes and rely on asymmetries between the <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> the <b>informal</b> sector, such as heterogeneity in morality, in order to explain the co-existence of a <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> an <b>informal</b> sector.|$|R
