50|$|For group 2 verbs, {{the stem}} ends <b>in</b> <b>a</b> consonant, the infinitive ends in -a, {{and the present}} tense in -er. Group 2 verbs are further {{subdivided}} into group 2a and 2b. For group 2a verbs, the past tense ends in -de and the past participle in -d, -t, and -da. For group 2b verbs, the past tense ends in -te and the past participle in -t, -t, and -ta. This is in turn decided by whether the stem ends <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>voiced</b> or <b>a</b> voiceless consonant. E.g. The stem of Heta (to be called) is het, and as t is a voiceless consonant the past tense ends in -te, making hette the past tense.
