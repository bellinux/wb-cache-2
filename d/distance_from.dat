5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the Sun {{similarly}} varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E

5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E

5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the Earth {{can vary}} by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's {{apparent}} size varies with its <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the Earth, {{and it is}} this effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the core, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or the <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received. This is typically larger than the core radius.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} was calculated as 7.2astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no discernible activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU from the Sun, a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable.

5|$|On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar probe flew past Jupiter's {{north pole}} at a {{distance}} of 451,000km. This swing-by maneuver was required for Ulysses to attain a very high-inclination orbit around the Sun, increasing its inclination to the ecliptic to 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flightpath downward and away from the ecliptic plane, placing it into a final orbit around the Sun's north and south poles. The size and shape of the probe's orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree, so that its aphelion remained at approximately 5AU (Jupiter's <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the Sun), while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond 1AU (Earth's <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the Sun). During its Jupiter encounter, the probe made measurements of the planet's magnetosphere. Since the probe had no cameras, no images were taken. In February 2004, the probe arrived again at the vicinity of Jupiter. This time the <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the planet was much greater—about 240 million km—but it made further observations of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|One {{explanation}} is {{the exposure of}} whiter subsurface layers by impacts; another is that the scattered objects' greater <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the Sun creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Mike Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour could be because, at its current <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the Sun, its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface, creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the Sun, would be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high-albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice.|$|E
