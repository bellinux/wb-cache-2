5|$|By N42 and S89 the equestrian parade {{is at an}} end, and the {{following}} 16 figures on the north and 18 on the south are taken to be the elders of Athens judging by their braided hair, an attribute of distinguished age in Classical art. Four of these figures raise their right hand in a clenched fist gesture suggestive of a pose associated with the thallophoroi (olive branch bearers) who were older men chosen in competition for their good looks alone. No drill holes, however, exist for any branch to be inserted in their hands. Next in line (S107–114, N20–28) are the musicians: four kithara (a variant of the lyre) and four aulos (flute) players. N16–19 and S115–118 (conjectured) perhaps, as hydriaphoroi, the water-vessel carriers, here men, rather than metic girls mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> the Panathenaia. N13–15, S119–121 are the skaphephoroi, the tray bearers of the honeycombs and cakes used to entice the sacrificial animals to the altar. N1–12, S122–149 are the four cows and four sheep on the north and ten cows on the south meant for sacrifice on the acropolis, presumably an abbreviated form of the hecatomb usually offered on this occasion – there is an a-b-a rhythm of placid and restive cows.|$|E
5|$|Lundomys molitor {{was first}} {{described}} in 1887 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhelm Lund had {{collected in the}} caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated maxilla (upper jaw) from the cave chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr.5 and a mandible (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later {{turned out to be}} from a different species, probably Gyldenstolpia fronto. Lund named the animal Hesperomys molitor and placed it in the same genus (Hesperomys) as what is now Pseudoryzomys simplex and two species of Calomys. Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> South American rodents; those authors who did mention it placed it in either Oryzomys or Calomys.|$|E
5|$|The {{air attacks}} on Japan caused {{hundreds}} of thousands of casualties, though estimates of the number who were killed and wounded vary considerably. The strategic attacks by the Twentieth Air Force caused most of the casualties and damage. The figures most frequently cited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> the campaign are sourced from the USSBS report The Effects of Bombing on Health and Medical Services in Japan which estimated that 333,000 Japanese were killed and 473,000 wounded. Included in this figure were an estimated 120,000 dead and 160,000 injured in the two atomic bomb attacks. Another USSBS report, The Effects of Strategic Bombing on Japanese Morale, included a much higher estimate of 900,000 killed and 1.3million injured which was reached by a Japanese research team using a statistical sampling methodology. While this figure is also occasionally cited, the USSBS' investigators regarded the work of their statistical teams as unsatisfactory, and the researchers were unable to calculate the error rate of this estimate. The postwar Japanese government calculated in 1949 that 323,495 people had been killed by air attacks in the home islands. The destruction of buildings housing government records during air raids contributed to the uncertainty about the number of casualties. The Twentieth Air Force lost 414 B-29s during attacks on Japan. Over 2,600 American bomber crew members were killed, including POWs who died in captivity, and a further 433 were wounded.|$|E

25|$|In his {{retirement}} Briggs returned to research, establishing {{a laboratory for}} studying fluids under negative pressure at the National Bureau of Standards. This topic was directly related to his earlier research in the water uptake of plants. In one famous experiment he measured the negative pressure (or tension) that would break a column of water held in a capillary tube by capillary action. It turned out that at room temperature the maximum attainable tension in water was 250 bar and in mercury nearly 500 bar. This was published in several papers between (1950–1953), and the 1950 paper remains a classic and is still regularly cited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> metastable water.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Garner {{became the}} editor in chief of Black's Law Dictionary, whose roots are {{traceable}} to 1891 and which is currently the most widely respected authority on Anglo-American legal lexicography. Since 1995, Garner has overhauled the book over the course of four unabridged editions (7th–10th). He created a panel of international legal experts to improve all the specialized vocabulary in the book, including Roman law, international law, and transactional terminology. With the help of these experts, Garner and his team have rewritten the entire dictionary and added tens of thousands of new entries, amplifying many with dates of linguistic origin; supplementary usage, historical, or other lexicographic information; and exemplary quotations drawn from myriad sources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> Anglo-American law—some as early as the 16th century.|$|E

Since he does not know how the car is hidden nor how the host makes choices, he may be able to make use of his first choice opportunity, as it were to neutralize the actions of the team running the quiz show, including the host.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> the Vietnam War, Cedar Falls is {{evaluated}} {{much more}} negatively. Phillip Davidson {{is one of}} the few authors who sees it as part of a meaningful broader strategy. While he concedes that Cedar Falls missed some of its short-term goals, he holds that, along with its follow-up Operation Junction City, it had beneficial long term strategic consequences: It dealt a serious blow to the North Vietnamese strategy of protracted guerilla warfare by permanently driving the NLF's main force from the more populated areas and across the Cambodian border. Already this conclusion, however, is contested by Shelby L. Stanton. He notes the same effect as does Davidson but interprets it as detrimental to the American military strategy. Instead of driving the Vietcong into a more “vulnerable posture”, as had been intended by MACV, they were in fact driven into Cambodia and hence into a region beyond the allied forces’ reach where, together with the North Vietnamese Army, they established sanctuaries immune to US attacks.|$|E
500|$|Throffer has not, however, been universally adopted; Michael R. Rhodes {{notes that}} there has been some {{controversy}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> whether to use throffer, citing a number of writers, including Lawrence A. Alexander, David Zimmerman and Daniel Lyons, who do not use the term. Some, including political scientists Deiniol Jones and Andrew Rigby, consider throffer to be synonymous with carrot and stick, an idiom which refers to the way a donkey is offered a carrot to encourage compliance, while noncompliance is punished with a stick. Other writers, while electing to use the word, consider it a poor one. For instance, literary scholar Daniel Shore calls it [...] "a somewhat unfortunate term", while using it in his analysis of John Milton's Paradise Regained.|$|E
500|$|Remains of [...] "Ekbletomys" [...] {{were first}} found on Barbuda {{in the summer}} of 1958 and {{subsequently}} on Antigua in 1961. In his 1962 Ph.D. thesis at Harvard University, paleontologist Clayton E. Ray described them as a new species, Oryzomys hypenemus, which he considered distinctive enough to merit its own subgenus, Ekbletomys. The specific name, hypenemus, is derived from ύπηνεμος (hypênemos), which means [...] "leeward" [...] in Ancient Greek and refers to the species' distribution in the Leeward Islands, and the subgeneric name, Ekbletomys, combines Ancient Greek εκβλητος (ekblêtos) [...] "cast up" [...] and μυς (mus) [...] "mouse", referring to the way [...] "Ekbletomys" [...] probably reached its islands. Because Ray's thesis does not meet the definition of a [...] "published work" [...] in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, both new names proposed by Ray are not available and cannot be used in formal zoological nomenclature. The name has rarely been used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> Antillean oryzomyines since, and no formal description has been published; thus, the animal still lacks a formally available name.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of {{theoretical}} physics {{in the early part}} of the twentieth century and its foundation in mathematics, David Hilbert decided to lend an organizing hand to formalizing the sciences, starting with physics.

2500|$|Among the {{vegetables}} {{that come with}} the hamburger, the first described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> its history is the onion, usually finely sliced in rings.

It is possible that after the creation of the hamburger by uniting the steak with the bread, vegetables were included to give the finished product a more [...] "natural" [...] appearance and taste. All of these condiments were incorporated into the classical image of the hamburger during its golden age, the 1940s. In some cases, the hamburger is prepared differently and distinctly to add regional flavor, as in the case of Tex-Mex style burgers, which are served with a side of chili con carne.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there is}} {{dispute over the}} extent to which the terms [...] "substrate" [...] and [...] "superstrate" [...] are {{applicable}} to the genesis or the description of creole languages. The language replacement model may not be appropriate in creole formation contexts, where the emerging language is derived from multiple languages without any one of them being imposed as a replacement for any other. The substratum-superstratum distinction becomes awkward when multiple superstrata must be assumed (such as in Papiamentu), when the substratum cannot be identified, or when the presence or the survival of substratal evidence is inferred from mere typological analogies. On the other hand, the distinction may be meaningful when the contributions of each parent language to the resulting creole can be shown to be very unequal, in a scientifically meaningful way. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> Atlantic Creoles, [...] "superstrate" [...] usually means European and [...] "substrate" [...] non-European or African.|$|E
