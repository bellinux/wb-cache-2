50|$|Some flaws {{with the}} bilingual <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> theory have been identified. One of {{which deals with}} the {{constant}} finding that translated items are better recollected than the words that are directly recalled or require deriving synonyms for. This was originally thought because translated words are better remembered because they engage both memory systems, compared to synonyms which {{require the use of}} only one memory system. With this in mind, it was also thought that between language systems have stronger associations, compared to within language systems. This means that there are well developed associations for the translated words because there are stronger associations between two languages, compared to the connections within only one language, as seen with synonyms. Other explanations have also been explored to explain this phenomenon, one is that the translated words are better remembered because they are more deeply processed than words that people are simply asked to recall or create synonyms for. This is in line with the levels of processing effect, where in relation to the bilingual <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> theory, words that participants are required to think of synonyms for are better recalled than the words they were simply asked to copy. This is because creating synonyms requires deeper processing than just duplicating a word. Similarly, words that participants are required to translate will be better remembered than the words they created synonyms for.|$|E

5000|$|Allan Paivio's dual-coding {{theory is}} {{a basis of}} picture superiority effect. Paivio claims that {{pictures}} have advantages over words with regards to coding and retrieval of stored memory because pictures are coded more easily and can be retrieved from symbolic mode, while the <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> process using words is more difficult for both coding and retrieval. Another explanation of the higher free call in picture superiority {{is due to the}} higher familiarity or frequency of pictured objects (Asch & Ebenholtz, 1962). According to dual-coding theory (1971, 1986), memory exists either (or both) verbally or [...] "imaginally". Concrete concepts presented as pictures are encoded into both systems; however, abstract concepts are recorded only verbally. In psychology, the effect has implications for salience in attribution theory as well as the availability heuristic. It is also relevant to advertising and user interface design.|$|E
50|$|DCT {{research}} focused initially {{on memory}} and soon expanded to othercognitive phenomena. Memory remains crucial, however, {{because it is}} the basis ofall knowledge and thought. The memory emphasis is further justified here becauselearning and memory {{are at the heart of}} educational goals.The effects can be explained by two DCT hypotheses. One hypothesis is thatnonverbal and verbal codes, being functionally independent, can have additiveeffects on recall. For example, participants in free recall experiments are likely toname presented objects covertly and thus create a nonverbal (pictorial) and averbal memory trace. They can also set up a dual verbal-nonverbal memory traceby imaging to concrete words, but this is somewhat less likely than namingpictures, hence the lower memory for concrete words than pictures. Abstractwords are difficult to image and hence are least likely to be dually coded. Theexpected additive memory benefit of <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> has been confirmed in numerousexperiments which also suggested that the nonverbal code is mnemonically stronger(contributes more to the additive effect) than the verbal code.|$|E
50|$|One useful {{method of}} {{building}} vocabulary in a second language is the keyword method. If time is available or one wants to emphasize a few key words, one can create mnemonic devices or word associations. Although these strategies tend to take longer to implement and may take longer in recollection, they create new or unusual connections that can increase retention. The keyword method requires deeper cognitive processing, thus increasing the likelihood of retention (Sagarra and Alba, 2006). This method uses fits within Paivio's (1986) <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> theory because it uses both verbal and image memory systems. However, this method is best for words that represent concrete and imageable things. Abstract concepts or words that do not bring a distinct image to mind are difficult to associate. In addition, {{studies have shown that}} associative vocabulary learning is more successful with younger students (Sagarra and Alba, 2006). Older students tend to rely less on creating word associations to remember vocabulary.|$|E

50|$|Across the lifespan, {{the picture}} superiority effect is evident. The picture superiority effect in {{recognition}} memory shows a developmental trend, becoming more pronounced with age. Picture superiority effect increased with ages disputing {{the hypothesis that}} greater picture superiority is observed among younger children (Whitehouse, Mayber, Durkin, 2006). However, the major contribution in picture superiority in recognition memory among children was familiarity (Defeyter, Russo & McPartlin, 2009). During childhood, specifically among seven-year-olds, the picture superiority effect is lesser in magnitude than in other age groups. This {{could be due to}} the lack of inner speech among younger children supporting the <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> theory of Paivio. In healthy older adults, the picture superiority effect was found to be greater than it was for younger adults, in comparison to recognition for words, which was disadvantaged for older adults. In that regards, oldest-old people can benefit from the pictorial information in order to retain textual information, implying greater possibilities of using pictorial images or memory treatment in their daily lives (Cherry et al., 2008). While memory for words is impaired for older adults, pictures help restore their impaired memory and function properly (Ally et al., 2008). In addition, older adults have shown the same level of capability for identifying correct items in comparison with young adults when items were accompanied with pictures (Smith, Hunt & Dunlap, 2015). In populations with Alzheimer's disease, and other mild cognitive impairments, the picture superiority effect remains evident. ERP activity indicates that patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment utilized frontally based memorial processes to support successful recognition for pictures, which was similar to healthy controls, but not for words.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> theory (DCT), {{according}} to Paivio, suggests that visual and verbal information act as two distinctive systems. It {{has had its}} roots in the practical use of imagery as a memory aid 2500 years ago For example, one can think of a car by thinking of the word “car”, or by forming a mental image of a car. The verbal and image systems are correlated, as one can think of the mental image of the car and then describe it in words, or read or listen to words and then form a mental image. DCT identifies three types of processing: (1) representational, the direct activation of verbal or non-verbal representations, (2) referential, the activation of the verbal system by the nonverbal system or vice versa, and (3) associative processing, the activation of representations within the same verbal or nonverbal system. A given task may require any or all of the three kinds of processing. Verbal system units are called logogens; these units contain information that underlies our use of the word. Non-Verbal system units are called imagens. Imagens contain information that generates mental images such as natural objects, holistic parts of objects, and natural grouping of objects. Imagens operate synchronously or in parallel; thus all parts of an image are available at once. Logogens operate sequentially; words come one at a time in a syntactically appropriate sequence in a sentence. The two codes may overlap in the processing of information but greater emphasis is on one or the other. The verbal and non-verbal systems are further divided into subsystems that process information from different modalities.Many experiments reported by Paivio and others support the importance of imagery in cognitive operations. In one experiment, participants saw pairs of items that differed in roundness (e.g., tomato, goblet) and were asked to indicate which member of the pair was rounder. The objects were presented as words, pictures, or word-picture pairs. The response times were slowest for word-word pairs, intermediate for the picture-word pairs, and fastest for the picture-picture pairs.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} {{to being able to}} convey information more succinctly, pictures are also more memorable than words (Paivio & Csapo, 1969, 1973). In the memory literature, this {{is referred to as the}} picture superiority effect, and <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> theory was developed in part to explain this effect. <b>Dual</b> <b>coding</b> follows from the notion of text being accompanied by complementary visual information to enhance learning. Paivio (1971, 1986) proposed <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> theory as a mechanistic account for the integration of multiple information “codes” to process information. In this theory, a code corresponds to a modal or otherwise distinct representation of a concept—e.g., “mental images for ‘book’ have visual, tactual, and other perceptual qualities similar to those evoked by the referent objects on which the images are based” (Clark & Paivio, 1991, p. 152). Aylwin (1990) provides a clear example of how the word “dog” can evoke verbal, visual, and enactive representations (see Fig.  7 for a similar example for the word “SPOON”, based on Aylwin, 1990 (Fig.  2) and Madan & Singhal, 2012 a (Fig.  3)). Codes can also correspond to emotional properties (Clark & Paivio, 1991; Paivio, 2013). Clark and Paivio (1991) provide a thorough review of <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> theory and its relation to education, while Paivio (2007) provides a comprehensive treatise on <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> theory. Broadly, <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> theory suggests that providing multiple representations of the same information enhances learning and memory, and that information that more readily evokes additional representations (through automatic imagery processes) receives a similar benefit.|$|E
40|$|Coding of {{multiple}} proteins by overlapping reading frames {{is not a}} feature one would associate with eukaryotic genes. Indeed, codependency between codons of overlapping protein-coding regions imposes {{a unique set of}} evolutionary constraints, making it a costly arrangement. Yet in cases of tightly coexpressed interacting proteins, <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> may be advantageous. Here we show that although <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> is nearly impossible by chance, a number of human transcripts contain overlapping coding regions. Using newly developed statistical techniques, we identified 40 candidate genes with evolutionarily conserved overlapping coding regions. Because our approach is conservative, we expect mammals to possess more dual-coding genes. Our results emphasize that the skepticism surrounding eukaryotic <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> is unwarranted: rather than being artifacts, overlapping reading frames are often hallmarks of fascinating biology...|$|E
30|$|When {{teachers}} combine visuals {{and words}} in their educational practice, however, {{they may not}} always be taking advantage of <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> – at least, not in the optimal manner. For example, a recent discussion on Twitter centered around one teacher’s decision to have 7 th Grade students replace certain words in their science laboratory report with a picture of that word (e.g., the instructions read “using a syringe …” and a picture of a syringe replaced the word; Turner, 2016 a). Other teachers argued that this was not <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> (Beaven, 2016; Williams, 2016), because there were no longer two different representations of the information. The first teacher maintained that <b>dual</b> <b>coding</b> was preserved, because this laboratory report with pictures was to be used alongside the original, fully verbal report (Turner, 2016 b). This particular implementation – having students replace individual words with pictures – has not been examined in the cognitive literature, presumably because no benefit would be expected. In any case, we need to be clearer about implementations for <b>dual</b> <b>coding,</b> and {{more research is needed to}} clarify how teachers can make use of the benefits conferred by multiple representations and picture superiority.|$|E
