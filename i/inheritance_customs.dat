500|$|As society {{became more}} prosperous and stable in the 11th century, <b>inheritance</b> <b>customs</b> {{developed}} [...] that allowed daughters (in {{the absence of}} sons) to succeed to principalities as well as landed estates. The twelfth-century chronicler Ralph de Diceto noted that the counts of Anjou extended their dominion over their neighbours by marriage rather than conquest. The marriage of Geoffrey to {{the daughter of a}} king (and widow of an emperor) occurred in this context. [...] It is unknown whether King Henry intended to make Geoffrey his heir, but it is known that the threat presented by William Clito’s rival claim to the duchy of Normandy made his negotiating position very weak. Even so, it is probable that, should the marriage be childless, King Henry would have attempted to be succeeded by one of his Norman kinsmen such as Theobald II, Count of Champagne or Stephen of Blois who in the event did seize King Henry’s English crown. King Henry’s great relief in 1133 at the birth of a son to the couple, described as [...] "the heir to the Kingdom", is understandable in the light of this situation. Following this the birth of a second son raised the question of whether custom would be followed with the maternal inheritance passing to first born and the paternal inheritance going to his brother, Geoffrey.|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} scholarly interest in understanding how state law interacts with non-state regulations in guiding disputes. Vietnam {{provides a useful}} case study, as its dispute resolution system is undergoing unprecedented change. Despite the introduction of modern law and state institutions, entrenched customs continue to shape the way people deal with and conceptualise social problems. This research investigates the complex interaction of law and customs in the courtroom by developing a detailed empirical study of inheritance litigation in Vietnam. Inheritance disputes are an important topic to study as they are central to family structures and provide glimpses into how dispute resolution is evolving in a rapidly changing society. The study moves beyond the doctrinal approach to legal research, since no established legal doctrines governing cases exist in Vietnam. It draws on the interpretive tradition and embraces a social constructionism approach. This approach does not assume that law orders disputes; instead, law is treated as a locus of social contest and construction. The aim {{of this research is}} to unravel how <b>inheritance</b> law and <b>customs</b> compete and sometimes coordinate with each other to guide judicial resolutions. The study uses systems theory and discourse analysis as an analytical framework. It draws insights from systems theory into how different regulatory systems, such as state law and social customs, co-exist, interact, and co-evolve with each other in ordering inheritance disputes. Discourse analysis is used as a methodological tool to evaluate how the main actors (judges, lawyers, disputants) in inheritance disputes communicate with each other. The study examines courtroom discourse by looking into the regulatory preferences of the main actors. It also investigates how the organisational and epistemological structures of the Vietnamese civil justice system shape courtroom communication. The study finds that customs prevail over law in guiding inheritance disputes. Limited judicial power and the absence of legal fictions that might convert custom into law contribute to this outcome. Overall, law and customs are not co-evolving. Although regulatory hybridity emerges where both law and customs do not provide clear guidance, such hybridity does not generate broadly applicable norms. The courts resolve disputes on behalf of the state, but they neither enhance the law’s authority nor bring law and customs into a meaningful dialogue. The study also identifies the weakness of institutions in promoting the co-evolution of <b>inheritance</b> law and <b>customs.</b> Legal education and lawyers’ associations are not functioning effectively because of both structural constraints and the boundaries set by the political-legal epistemology. Given these limitations, the study predicts that a tradition of legal reasoning that converts custom into law is unlikely to emerge in the Vietnamese civil justice system in the near future. Normative syncretism, rather than law, is more likely to fill the regulatory vacuum. For the broader society, the study suggests that <b>inheritance</b> law and <b>customs</b> will continue to co-exist instead of co-evolving...|$|R
50|$|The Qur'an {{introduced}} {{a number of}} different rights and restrictions on matters of inheritance, including general improvements to the treatment of women and family life. The Qur'an also presented efforts to fix the laws of inheritance, and thus forming a complete legal system. This development was in contrast to pre-Islamic societies where rules of inheritance varied considerably. Furthermore, the Qur'an {{introduced a}}dditional heirs that were not entitled inheritance in pre-Islamic times, mentioning nine relatives specifically of which six were female and three were male. The laws of inheritance in the Qur'an also included other male relatives, like the husband and half-brothers from the mother’s side, which were excluded from <b>inheritance</b> in old <b>customs.</b> The heirs mentioned in the Qur'an are the mother, father, husband, wife, daughter, uterine brother, full sister, uterine sister, and consanguine sister.|$|R
50|$|The {{degree of}} {{acceptance}} that a society may show towards an inheritance rule can also vary.

40|$|Given {{the paucity}} of {{information}} on historical kin relations, this study uses survey data in order to investigate how different family forms influenced the size and composition of social networks and the relationships among elderly siblings born in farming families between 1903 and 1937 in three regions of the Netherlands. In the area with stem families, impartible <b>inheritance,</b> and a <b>custom</b> of neighbor help, social networks are largest and contain the most siblings. Multilevel analyses show that even when controlling for other factors, this particular family form positively affects contact frequency in sibling relationships.

50|$|The {{strict rules}} {{set out for}} <b>inheritance</b> by the <b>Custom</b> of Paris {{commonly}} forced early modern families in New France (especially those of the first colonists) to act outside {{the law in the}} interest of self-preservation. Given that upon the death of half of a childless couple, the half of the community property customarily reserved for the children would revert to the relevant manorial lord, most contemporary marriage contracts specified a reciprocal gift (don mutuel) so if the couple in question was childless, the entire community of property would be inherited by the surviving spouse in the event of the death of either the husband or the wife. That was an especially crucial practice for the earliest settlers, who had no family around to support them if their spouse was to die, and it became increasingly common throughout subsequent generations. It must be noted that customary law prohibited such gifts, but notaries still drew them up, as they were recognized to be key to the survival of individuals living in New France.|$|R

50|$|In {{parts of}} {{northern}} France, giving a slightly larger share to {{the eldest son}} was common among peasants even before the 10th century; after that century, patrilineal primogeniture developed among the nobility (impartible inheritance never obtained among peasants in most of northern France).

25|$|The Merovingians {{established}} {{themselves in}} the power vacuum of the former Roman provinces in Gaul, and Clovis I converted to Christianity following his victory over the Alemanni at the Battle of Tolbiac (496), laying {{the foundation of the}} Frankish Empire, the dominant state of early medieval Western Christendom. The Frankish kingdom grew through a complex development of conquest, patronage, and alliance building. Due to salic <b>custom,</b> <b>inheritance</b> rights were absolute, and all land was divided equally among the sons of a dead land holder. This meant that, when the king granted a prince land in reward for service, that prince and all of his descendants had an irrevocable right to that land that no future king could undo. Likewise, those princes (and their sons) could sublet their land to their own vassals, who could in turn sublet the land to lower sub-vassals. This all had the effect of weakening the power of the king as his kingdom grew, since the result was that the land became controlled by not just by more princes and vassals, but by multiple layers of vassals. This also allowed his nobles to attempt to build their own power base, though given the strict salic tradition of hereditary kingship, few would ever consider overthrowing the king.|$|R
50|$|The main {{taxes in}} Chile {{in terms of}} revenue {{collection}} are the value added tax (45.8% of total revenues in 2012) and the income tax (41.8% of total revenues in 2012). The value added tax is levied on sales {{of goods and services}} (including imports) at a rate of 19%, with a few exemptions. The income tax revenue comprises different taxes. While there is a corporate income tax of 20% over profits from companies (called First Category Tax), the system is ultimately designed to tax individuals. Therefore, corporate income taxes paid constitute a credit towards two personal income taxes: the Global Complementary Tax (in the case of residents) or the Additional Tax (in the case of non-residents). The Global Complementary Tax is payable by those that have different sources of income, while those receiving income solely from dependent work are subject to the Second Category Tax. Both taxes are equally progressive in statutory terms, with a top marginal rate of 40%. Income arising from corporate activity under the Global Complementary Tax only becomes payable when effectively distributed to the individual. There are also special sales taxes on alcohol and luxury goods, as well as specific taxes on tobacco and fuel. Other taxes include the <b>inheritance</b> tax and <b>custom</b> duties.|$|R
5000|$|The Quran {{contains}} only three verses that give specific details of inheritance and shares, {{in addition to}} few other verses dealing with testamentary. [...] But this information {{was used as a}} starting point by Muslim jurists who expounded the laws of inheritance even further using Hadith, as well as methods of juristic reasoning like Qiyas.

50|$|Because of the {{worldwide}} prevalence of patrilineal <b>inheritance</b> <b>customs,</b> both productive resources and property such as household goods {{have ended up in}} the hands of men and not women. When only men have rights of inheritance or family succession, women have little opportunity to improve their status or living conditions within the family and community. Consequently, they are rendered dependent on male relatives for survival and have little say over how property is used to generate income or to support families. Additionally, within patrilineal communities, there is a strong resistance by men towards endowing women, especially daughters, with rights to land access.|$|E
50|$|Employing differing {{forms of}} {{succession}} can affect {{many areas of}} society. Gender roles are profoundly affected by inheritance laws and traditions. Impartible inheritance {{has the effect of}} keeping large estates united and thus perpetuating an elite. With partible inheritance large estates are slowly divided among many descendants and great wealth is thus diluted. <b>Inheritance</b> <b>customs</b> can even affect gender differences in cognitive abilities. Among the Karbis, who employ male primogeniture, men perform significantly better than women in tasks of spatial abilities. There are no significant differences in the performance of men and women among the Khasis, who employ female ultimogeniture.|$|E
50|$|They {{also had}} to deal with a lengthy legal {{struggle}} with Eleanor's nephew, John of Ponthieu, to whom Joan bequeathed a great deal of land in Ponthieu as well as important legal rights connected with those estates. The dispute was resolved when John of Ponthieu was recognized as Joan's successor in Aumale according to the <b>inheritance</b> <b>customs</b> that prevailed in Normandy, while Edward and Eleanor retained Ponthieu and John gave up all his claims there. By using English wealth, Edward and Eleanor restored stability to the administration and the finances of Ponthieu, and added considerably to the comital estate by purchasing large amounts of land there.|$|E
50|$|In India, <b>inheritance</b> <b>customs</b> were (and still are) very diverse. Patrilineal primogeniture predominated {{in ancient}} times. The Laws of Manu {{state that the}} oldest son {{inherits}} all of the father's estate. Since the Middle Ages patrilineal equal inheritance has prevailed in perhaps a majority of groups, although the eldest son often received an extra share. Under this system, the estate would be shared between all sons, but these would often remain together with their respective families under the headship of the karta or family head, who was usually the eldest son of the previous family head. However, among some South Asian peoples, such as the Western Punjabi, male primogeniture continued to prevail.|$|E
50|$|Among Arabic peoples, it is {{sometimes}} argued that the expansion of Islam brought {{an end to the}} sharp distinction between the firstborn and other sons so characteristic of ancient Semitic peoples. However, many peoples who have partially or completely embraced Islam, have also established inequality between sons, such as the Oromo of east Africa, who had patrilineal primogeniture in inheritance, {{in spite of the fact}} that some of them were Muslim. Other Muslim peoples, like the Minangkabau and the Javanese of Indonesia, the Turks, or the Fur in Sudan, also have inheritance practices that contradict their Islamic beliefs. Most non-Arab Muslims historically followed their own <b>inheritance</b> <b>customs,</b> not those of the Sharia.|$|E
50|$|Among English peasants {{there was}} no clearly {{prevalent}} inheritance pattern, while Spanish Basques gave their land to the one considered best qualified, though they had a preference for sons. Giving more or less equal shares of land to sons, but excluded daughters was also common in many populations, as was giving relatively equal shares to both sons and daughters or slightly less to daughters. The same system prevails in contemporary Egypt and most Arab groups (see Sharia). Most non-Arab Muslims, with some exceptions (Caucasians, Iranians), historically followed their own <b>inheritance</b> <b>customs,</b> not those of the Sharia. In Ancient Egypt the eldest son inherited {{twice as much as}} other sons, and in earlier times he was the sole heir.|$|E
50|$|Farming in Zalužnica was {{a matter}} of self-subsistence made {{difficult}} by the limestone geology and mountainous terrain.

The winters are typically harsh, and the summers are hot. Until the early 1960s, most work on the farm was manual throughout the year using bullocks/ox (or a few families who could afford to keep horses) as the main power source for heavy farm work. By the mid-1970s, farming became almost fully mechanised. Typical farm sizes were around 10 hectares with many small fields scattered around the village resulting from historical family <b>inheritance</b> <b>customs,</b> which further limited the scope for larger farmsteads. For those farms away from the main road electricity was only connected in the late 1950-60's and piped water in the 1970-80's.|$|E
50|$|During her {{marriage}} to Jean de Nesle, Joan ran up considerable debts and also appears to have allowed her rights as countess in Ponthieu to weaken. The death of her son Ferdinand in 1265 made her next son, Louis, her heir in Ponthieu but around 1275 he, too, died, leaving two children. But according to <b>inheritance</b> <b>customs</b> in Picardy, where Ponthieu lay, Joan's young grandson John of Ponthieu could not succeed her there; her heir in Ponthieu automatically became her adult daughter Eleanor, who was married to Edward I of England. It does not appear that Joan was displeased {{at the prospect of}} having Ponthieu pass under English domination; from 1274 to 1278, in fact, she had her granddaughter Joan of Acre (the daughter of Edward I and Eleanor) with her in Ponthieu, and appears to have treated the girl so indulgently that when she was returned to England her parents found that she was thoroughly spoiled.|$|E

5000|$|Before Elijah {{was taken}} up into the whirlwind, Elisha asked to [...] "inherit a double-portion" [...] of Elijah's spirit.
