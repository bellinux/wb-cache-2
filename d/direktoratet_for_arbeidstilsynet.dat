40|$|We use {{the dynamic}} MAGIC model to {{calculate}} critical loads of sulfur and nitrogen for forest soils in Norway. Inputs include the soil surveydata of NIJOS and NISK, the atmospheric deposition data of NILU, the forest productivity data of NIJOS, {{and the surface}} water chemistry of NIVA. Two scenarios for future sulfur deposition are used with two scenarios of nitrogen retention in catchments. The magnitude and patterns of calculated nitrogen critical loads and exceedance differ substantially depending on the scenario chosen for sulfur deposition and nitrogen retention. In worst case critical loads for N are low and exceed in southernmost Norway. In the best case critical loads for N are high and not exceeded. More information on the processes controlling N retention in forested ecosystems is of outmost importance for the specification of nitrogen critical loads. <b>Direktoratet</b> <b>for</b> naturforvaltning (DN...|$|R

40|$|Årsliste 2005 The {{present report}} is a {{proposal}} for a preliminary design of a monitoring programme for reference sites for all surface water categories compatible with the requirements in the EU Water Framework Directive. The proposal includes preliminary recommendations of number of sites, parameters, sampling frequency and monitoring intervals. The total number of sites proposed is approximately 400 lakes, 250 river sites and 250 coastal water sites distributed in different ecoregions and types. A tentative budget suggests annual costs for the initial 6 -years’ period of 140 mill. NOK, with 30, 20 and 90 mill. NOK for lakes, rivers and coastal waters respectively. For the consequtive monitoring periods, the annual costs decrease to ca. 28 mill. NOK, in which lakes, rivers and coastal waters require respectively 7. 5, 5 and 15 mill. NOK. The costs can be further reduced by combining the reference network with ongoing and planned monitoring in Norway and in other Nordic countries. <b>Direktoratet</b> <b>for</b> naturforvaltning...|$|R
40|$|Department of Water Affairs and Forestry in South Africa has {{approached}} NORAD with a Programme {{proposal for}} {{support to the}} urgently needed upgrading of the geohydrological services in the country. The importance of groundwater as a resource is increasing because of the current focus on community {{water supply and sanitation}} under the Reconstruction and Development Programme. The pre-apprasial mission observed that the status of geohydrological monitoring and information services is in a fragile and inadequate state because of inadequate resource allocations and loss of trained personnel during the last few years. As a conclusion, the mission recommends that NORAD support the proposed Programme. The mission has identified key issues of concern related to the content of the Programme and its intercations with other relevant activities that have to be addressed. It is recommended that the Department organise an objective oriented workshop to strengthen the project design in co-operation with key actors, target group representatives and other stakeholders. <b>Direktoratet</b> <b>for</b> Utviklingshjelp (NORAD...|$|R
