500|$|As {{his second}} term entered its final year in 1796, Washington was in poor health, {{exhausted}} from years of internal squabbling among members of his cabinet and external attacks in the press, and {{he was ready to}} retire to Mount Vernon. Although many Americans had been expecting or anticipating that Washington would serve a third term, that spring he decided not to, and began drafting his Farewell Address to [...] "friends and fellow-citizens." [...] It was a momentous decision, as at that time in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>western</b> <b>civilization</b> national leaders rarely relinquished their titles voluntarily, In making the announcement and then following through on it, Washington established a precedent for the democratic transfer of executive power. His departure from office after two terms set a pattern for subsequent U.S. presidents, and provided future generations of elected leaders with a lesson in democratic conduct through both word and deed.|$|E

This is however disputed by other historians, who point out that there is no documentary evidence confirming any cooperation on that issue, that the existing Soviet documentation actually makes such a cooperation improbable and that it is reasonable to say that Germany did not know about the Katyn massacre until the mass graves were analysed by the Katyn Commission.|$|R
40|$|Nos hemos preguntado si los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria (TCA) son un fenómeno exclusivo de las sociedades occidentales, de reciente aparición, producido o alentado por los medios de comunicación de masas (MM) y, si es así, cuáles han podido ser los cambios experimentados en los valores de nuestras sociedades que han alentado el auge de estas patologías a lo largo del siglo XX. Concluimos que conductas semejantes a lo que hoy identificamos como TCA (AN y BN), han existido desde la antigüedad. Probablemente desde la incorporación del cristianismo a la {{historia de}} la civilización occidental, previa impregnación de éste de valores religiosos orientales que establecían una separación cuerpo-alma o materia-espíritu. En culturas alejadas de la occidental, los TCA virtualmente no han existido y sólo aparecen tras la incorporación de los valores del occidente desarrollado a la mismas. Los MM influyen poderosamente en la vivencia de la imagen propia que tienen las personas, particularmente las mujeres. La universalización del prototipo de mujer alta y delgada, conduce a una distorsión de la propia imagen {{corporal}} que predispone a la sicopatología. El cambio de lo que tradicionalmente se consideró riqueza y valor social acontecido a finales del s. XIX y comienzos del XX, junto a la incorporación de la mujer al mundo del trabajo en las ciudades, coinciden paso a paso con lo que, respecto a la estética, se dio en llamar el estilo moderno y el de la nueva mujer; "menos es más" es el lema. La anorexia y la bulimia son consecuencia lógica de la norma imperante. We have {{wondered if the}} disorders of the alimentary conduct (DAC) are an exclusive and recent phenomenon <b>of</b> the <b>Western</b> societies, produced or encouraged by the mass media (MM) and, if it is so, who {{they could have been}} the changes experienced in the ethical values of our societies that have encouraged the peak of these pathologies along the 20 th century. We concluded that conducts similar to what we today identified like DAC (anorexia nervosa and/or bulimia), they have existed from the antiquity. Probably from the incorporation of the Christianity to the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Western</b> <b>civilization,</b> previous influence <b>of</b> this of eastern religious values that established a separation body-soul or matter-spirit. In cultures with their views are far apart from the Westerner, the DAC they virtually have not existed and they only appear after the incorporation of the ethical values of the occident developed to the same. The MM influences mightily in the experience of the own image that has the people, particularly the women. The universality of the prototype of high and thin woman, it lead to a distortion of the own corporal image that predisposes to the mental disorder. The change of what it traditionally was considered wealth and social value happened to end of the 19 th century and beginnings of the 20 th century, next to the incorporation of women into the workforce in the cities, they coincide step to step with what, concerning the aesthetics, it occurred in calling the modern style and that of the new woman; "less is more" it is the leitmotiv. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are logical consequence of the prevaling norm...|$|R
