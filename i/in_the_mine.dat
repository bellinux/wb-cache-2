5|$|When Ruffing was 15 years old, he {{suffered}} an accident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mine,</b> where {{his left foot}} was crushed between two cars.

He was supposed to begin his professional baseball career in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League that year, but he found himself unable to run {{as fast as he}} previously could. Doc Bennett, the manager of a nearby semi-professional team, suggested that Ruffing should try to continue pursuing a baseball career by becoming a pitcher.|$|E

5|$|Anions in {{the waters}} of the Black Creek {{drainage}} basin include sulfate and bicarbonate. The concentrations of aluminum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> pools in the area are typically very low or nonexistent. However, some mine waters {{in the waters}}hed can have aluminum ion concentrations of over 70 milligrams per liter, forming 6 percent of total dissolved solids in the water, as measured by weight. The concentration of manganese ions in the waters can be over 100 milligrams per liter and calcium also occurs in groundwater in the watershed. Magnesium occurs in the non-polluted groundwater in the watershed in concentrations of 1 to 5 milligrams per liter and occurs in polluted groundwater at concentrations of 4 to 440 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|Arctic Bulk Minerals {{bought the}} mining rights, and {{operated}} a train once to {{twice a year}} to keep the track and rolling stock maintained. This company filed for bankruptcy in 2002. The mining company was then bought by the local power company Varanger Kraft and Sør-Varanger Municipality. In 2006, they sold the mining company to Tschudi Group for 102million Norwegian krone (NOK). The Tschudi Group established Northern Iron, registered in Perth, Australia, as a holding company to own the mining company. Operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> and on the line resumed in 2009, after the price of iron had risen dramatically since {{the closing of the}} mine. With the opening of the mine, production is estimated at 3million tonnes of export per year. The Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line was the northern-most railway in the world until 2010, when Russia's Obskaya–Bovanenkovo Line was opened.|$|E
5|$|Following {{financial}} difficulties during the First World War, the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916. That year, SNSK built five new barracks, {{including one that}} {{was made into a}} hospital. SNSK introduced its own money with approval from Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone. The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and a graveyard was established in Longyear City. Two years later, 26 men were killed in a coal dust explosion in Mine 1. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> being closed and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2. The same year, the first truck was delivered for use in the mining operations.|$|E

5|$|In the village, the Expendables find several armed female villagers {{guarding}} {{their children}} from Vilain's forces. The local inhabitants are taken and put to work as slaves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mine,</b> never returning, and the women ask for the Expendables' help. The Sangs arrive for more villagers, but are ambushed by the Expendables and killed. After locating Vilain and the mine, the team assaults the area with their plane before deliberately crashing into the mine. The team saves the enslaved miners from execution, but Vilain and Hector escape with the plutonium. Vilain remotely detonates explosive charges in the mine; it collapses, trapping the miners and the Expendables.|$|E
5|$|The Khewra Salt Mine (or Mayo Salt Mine) {{is located}} in Khewra, north of Pind Dadan Khan, an {{administrative}} subdivision of Jhelum District, Punjab Region, Pakistan, which rises from the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is Pakistan's largest and oldest salt mine and the world's second largest. It is a major tourist attraction, drawing up to 250,000 visitors a year. Its history dates back to its discovery by Alexander's troops in 320 BC, but it started trading in the Mughal era. The main tunnel at ground level was developed by Dr. H. Warth, a mining engineer, in 1872 during British rule. After independence, the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation took over the mine, which still remains the largest source of salt in the country, producing more than 350,000 tons per annum of about 99% pure halite. Estimates of the reserves of salt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor a long time, the {{development}} and utilization of coal resources has made important contribution to {{the development}} of China's national economy. However, at the same time, it has damaged environment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> area seriously. Therefore, developing circular economy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> area promotes <b>the</b> regional sustainable development. In this paper, according to entropy flow generated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of exploiting coal resources, the authors advise to introduce the related industries which consume the entropy flow and realize entropy reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> area. By reviewing and analyzing the development of circular economy in Pingdingshan Coal Mining Group as an example, the authors conclude that development of circular economy and the introduction of negative entropy flow could promote the balance of the ecosystem and increase order <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> area...|$|R

5|$|There {{was another}} {{pollution}} incident in March 2008 when twenty {{miles of the}} river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine workings near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution {{at a cost of}} £1M; however, it is thought that there was a collapse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage to wildlife was reported.|$|E
5|$|Unable to find work, Fisher and {{his brother}} emigrated to Queensland in 1885. Despite leaving Scotland, Fisher {{is said to have}} {{retained}} a distinctive Scottish accent {{for the rest of his}} life. Here, Fisher worked as a miner, first in Burrum and then in Gympie. He became an engine driver (a role involving the operation of machinery to raise and lower cages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> shaft) after attaining the necessary qualifications in 1891. In the same year, he was also elected as the president of an engine driver's union. He was also active in the Amalgamated Miners Union, becoming President of the Gympie branch by 1891.|$|E

In addition, 10,000 Korean conscripts worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> between 1939 and 1945 under severe, brutal conditions in which many of them died or were injured while receiving little pay. The company, now known as the Aso Group, is run by Asō's younger brother. Asō's wife serves on its board of directors. Asō headed the company in the 1970s before going into politics.|$|E
