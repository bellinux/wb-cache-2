The main objective of the experiment was {{the investigation of the}} dynamic response problem of an elastic wing model concerning an encountering generic gust induced by a <b>gust</b> <b>generator.</b> Fluid-structure simulations, using a finite element structural model and a computational fluid dynamics model based on time-accurate, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, are compared to the experiment to validate the numerical methodology.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{was investigated}} {{of a flat}} plate <b>gust</b> <b>generator</b> that was located in the nozzle throat of the Lewis 10 - by 10 -foot supersonic wind tunnel. Gust plates were tested at nozzle wall Mach numbers of 3. 1, 2. 4, and 2. 0. Test {{results show that the}} flat plate concept may be used as a <b>gust</b> <b>generator</b> for a wind tunnel; however, more extensive investigation is required to completely define its capabilities and limitations. For the single transient data point recorded, a gust amplitude (decrement) of 0. 15 in Mach number was obtained.

40|$|Hurricanes {{are one of}} {{the deadliest}} and costliest natural hazards {{affecting}} the Gulf coast and Atlantic coast areas of the United States. An effective way to minimize hurricane damage is to strengthen structures and buildings. The investigation of surface level hurricane wind behavior and the resultant wind loads on structures is aimed at providing structural engineers with information on hurricane wind characteristics required for the design of safe structures. Information on mean wind profiles, gust factors, turbulence intensity, integral scale, and turbulence spectra and co-spectra is essential for developing realistic models of wind pressure and wind loads on structures. The research performed for this study was motivated by the fact that considerably fewer data and validated models are available for tropical than for extratropical storms. ^ Using the surface wind measurements collected by the Florida Coastal Monitoring Program (FCMP) during hurricane passages over coastal areas, this study presents comparisons of surface roughness length estimates obtained by using several estimation methods, and estimates of the mean wind and turbulence structure of hurricane winds over coastal areas under neutral stratification conditions. In addition, a program has been developed and tested to systematically analyze Wall of Wind (WoW) data, that will make it possible to perform analyses of baseline characteristics of flow obtained in the WoW. This program can be used in future research to compare WoW data with FCMP data, as <b>gust</b> and turbulence <b>generator</b> systems and other flow management devices will be used to create WoW flows that match as closely as possible real hurricane wind conditions. ^ Hurricanes are defined as tropical cyclones for which the maximum 1 -minute sustained surface wind speeds exceed 74 mph. FCMP data include data for tropical cyclones with lower sustained speeds. However, for the winds analyzed in this study the speeds were sufficiently high to assure that neutral stratification prevailed. This assures that the characteristics of those winds are similar to those prevailing in hurricanes. For this reason in this study the terms tropical cyclones and hurricanes are used interchangeably. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} {{experiment}} for the validation of gust response computations has been performed. The model {{consists of an}} active two-dimensional rigid front wing acting as a <b>gust</b> <b>generator</b> and forcing an elastic backswept rear wing. Results of numerical simulations with gust generation are presented. For the setup of the experiment, a simulation environment was established to identify the effect of different installation positions by parameter variation and {{to point out the}} efficiency of gust generation in the wind tunnel. The aerodynamic forces are computed by a subsonic Doublet-Lattice method (DLM) which provides considerable computational efficiency and flexibility of the numerical approach. DLM is used as a standard unsteady aerodynamic tool for gust problems and enables comparisons with CFD results. A large number of numerical results in frequency and time domain are used to obtain the forced motion of the elastic back-swept wing located downstream of the <b>gust</b> <b>generator</b> and to simulate the aerodynamic interaction in the wind tunnel. This enables a survey of gust loads on the back-swept wing in comparison to gust and turbulence loads calculated according to airworthiness standards. Furthermore, the numerical results are compared to the experimental results measured in the Transonic Wind tunnel Göttingen of the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels...|$|E

This consists of a heaving at plate capable of following a specifed transverse trajectory across a water tunnel. The relationship between the trajectory and the properties of the gusts that are shed downstream is characterized for non-periodic heaving motion described by Eldredge's smooth motion equation. PIV experiments show that the circulation of the vortical gust is proportional to the heaving speed of the plate.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{experimental}} setup and first results for a <b>gust</b> <b>generator</b> experiment will be presented. The experiment {{was carried out}} in the transonic wind-tunnel facility in Goettingen (DNW-TWG). The first goal of the experiment was to answer the question, whether it is possible to induce an unsteady flow field with a rigid moving profile as a <b>gust</b> <b>generator.</b> Furthermore the main objective of the experiment was the understanding of the physical phenomena of an impacting gust on an elastic structure. For that purpose a new set-up has been constructed and built, which allows the investigation of two subsequent airfoil-models in the flow of the wind tunnel. The first airfoil is active and should produce a generic gust. The second model located downstream is passive and responds to the unsteady load changes induced by the moving active profile. For a first investigation, amplitudes and frequencies were varied as well as the vertical position of both airfoils relative to each other. The experiment was conducted to deliver a comprehensive data base for validating the DLR in-house fluid-structure-interaction software “PyCSM” which has been developed for aeroelastic simulations in time domain. In order to support the experiment in the preparation phase, fluid-structure-interaction simulations in time domain have been carried out. These simulations mainly show the response amplitudes expected for the passive wing. For that purpose the DLR TAU Code for the calculation of the steady and unsteady aerodynamic loads and a finite element shell model have been used...|$|E

The profiles are arranged {{such that the}} second one is located downstream of the first one similar to the configuration of a tail plane behind a wing. The physical effect {{is that of a}} <b>gust</b> <b>generator.</b> The unsteady wake of the leading profile encounters the trailing profile and effects a load change. A first simplified attempt has been made using a rigid grid where both profiles execute a synchronous heaving motion.

40|$|A {{low speed}} wind tunnel {{equipped}} with a axial <b>gust</b> <b>generator</b> to simulate the aerodynamic environment of a helicopter rotor was used to study the dynamic stall of a pitching blade {{in an effort to}} ascertain to what extent harmonic velocity perturbations in the freestream affect dynamic stall. The aerodynamic moment on a two dimensional, pitching blade model in both constant and pulsating airstream was measured. An operational analog computer was used to perform on-line data reduction and plots of moment versus angle of attack and work done by the moment were obtained. The data taken in the varying freestream were then compared to constant freestream data and to the results of two analytical methods. These comparisons show that the velocity perturbations {{have a significant effect on}} the pitching moment which can not be consistently predicted by the analytical methods, but had no drastic effect on the blade stability...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} gust {{response of}} the helicopter rotor in cruising flight is studied analytically {{by means of the}} local momentum theory (LMT) and experimentally in a wind tunnel utilizing a <b>gust</b> <b>generator.</b> By introducing the unsteady aerodynamic effects into the LMT and by considering the elastic deformation of the rotor blade, the vibratory characteristics of flapping blades and of the rotor forces can be obtained. Since the LMT makes it possible to calculate the instantaneous load distribution along the rotor blade in desired azimuthal or timewise intervals, the effects of gradual penetration of the rotor into the gust can be studied and the Fourier analysis or power spectrum analysis of the rotor response applied to any kind of gust input. Some results obtained analytically are verified by the experimental tests performed in the wind tunnel which generates step, sinusoidal and random vertical gusts by the motion of a series of cascaded vanes upstream of the rotor...|$|E

40|$|The Chimera {{technique}} for moving grids {{is used to}} take into account non-homogeneous unsteady onflow conditions in the simulation of aerodynamic flows. The method is applied to simulate the transport of a large-scale vortex by a mean velocity field over a large distance, where it finally interacts with an airfoil. The Chimera approach allows to resolve the vortex on a fine grid, whereas the unstructured background grid covering most of the computational domain can be much coarser. This method shows the same low numerical dissipation as a simulation on a globally fine grid. Several precursor tests are performed with a finite modified analytical Lamb-Oseen type vortex, to study the influence of spatial and temporal resolution and the employed numerical scheme. Then the interaction of an analytical vortex with a NACA 0012 airfoil and with an ONERA-A airfoil near stall is studied. Finally a realistic vortex is generated by a ramping airfoil and is transported on a moving Chimera block and then interacts with a two-element airfoil, which allows to simulate a typical setup for a <b>gust</b> <b>generator</b> in aerodynamic facilities...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne {{important}} element in the progression of aircraft environmental impact reduction is to reduce their overall weight (without impacting other consumption-oriented performance index, such as drag). In addition to the numerous work conducted in material and structural engineering, from a control viewpoint, this challenge is strongly connected to the need of the development and assessment of dedicated load control strategies in response to gust disturbances. Indeed, the load factors due to gust are considered as a sizing criteria during the aircraft conception steps and require specific verification according to the certification process. To this end, a dedicated experimental research program based on Wind Tunnel (WT) campaigns has been carried out. More specifically, the paper contributions are twofold: (i) to identify the gust load effect using two different versatile frequency-domain techniques, namely the Loewner interpolation and a modified subspace approach, and (ii) to design and implement an active closed-loop control to alleviate the gust main effect. The entire procedure is validated in a wind tunnel setup, involving a <b>gust</b> <b>generator</b> device and a 2 D aeroelastic airfoil, for varying configuration travelling from sub to transonic airflow and varying angles of attack, emphasizing the effectiveness and robustness of the overall approach...|$|E

The definitive version is available at: [URL] transient response of a vehicle to a wind disturbance is of importance to car drivers since low level inputs can result in poor vehicle refinement, and extreme effects can result in path deviation. This paper investigates the use of an oscillating aerofoil <b>gust</b> <b>generator</b> to simulate the transient aerodynamic effects produced on a car-type bluff body during a simplified sinusoidal side gust interaction. A simplified bluff body was exposed to a range of sinusoidal cross-wind excitations corresponding to a reduced frequency of between 0. 09 and 0. 71 based on the model length. Unsteady measurements of surface pressure are processed to determine the side force and yaw moment and the aerodynamic magnification (***a) is calculated by comparing the transient response with a quasi-steady prediction. The transient yaw moment response is shown to exceed the quasi-steady by as much as 30 per cent. The transient side force is generally significantly less than the quasi-steady value except at the lowest frequency tested. The change in response is attributed to changes in the strength of the front and rear pillar vortices and to changes in phase relative to the quasi-steady response...|$|E
40|$|Aeroservoelasticity (ASE) is the {{interdisciplinary}} {{study of the}} interaction of structural, inertial, aerodynamic, and control loads for aircraft systems, and is inherently a nonlinear phenomenon. One {{of the goals of}} ASE research is to provide active gust load alleviation in aircraft to improve ride quality, minimize airframe fatigue, and increase performance. The goal of this research is to develop a robust aeroelastic (AE) predictive model for a wing section that represents a typical flexible wing in flight, and which will be used as a platform for developing ASE controllers. The various components of this research, including an unsteady aerodynamic module, a structural module, and a gust module, have been individually developed and validated with experiments. The experimental facility, comprising of a pitch-plunge free vibration apparatus, a real-time gust sniffing sensor, and an oscillating vane <b>gust</b> <b>generator,</b> are designed and developed at Texas A&M as test beds for current and future ASE research. Both the experiments and predictive model are used to explore nonlinear behavior of the system response. For example, the research has led to experimentally derived bifurcation diagrams depicting possible responses. The limit cycle oscillations (LCO) observed in experiments are captured by the predictive model. The AE model allows for parametric study of wing response on various system features such as nonlinear structural stiffness, nonlinear Coulomb damping, mass imbalance, and other design features. Also, the response of a wing under oncoming gusts is examined. This AE predictive model will serve as a platform to develop ASE models and controllers in future, and the experimental facility will serve as a test bed for validation of developed controllers...|$|E

Underwater, supercavitating vehicles can achieve higher speeds than conventional submarine vehicles {{due to the}} drag reduction result of the vehicle-fluid isolation. Re- search on the control of high speed supercavitating vehicles has led to theoretical so- lutions; however, validation and testing of control laws to drive the vehicle motion are expensive, complex and have not been presented in the open literature. This thesis presents an approach to the experimental validation of control systems for a supercavitating test vehicle in the longitudinal plane. The supercavitating vehi- cle considered in this thesis consists of a cylindrical body with a disk cavitator and two lateral, sweptback, wedge fins. The control validation platform {{enables the use of}} the high speed water tunnel located at the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory to recre- ate realistic flight scenarios including the effect of ocean waves on the vehicle. The test platform uses the hydrodynamic forces produced by the fluid-vehicle interaction, embedded flight computer, and analytical equations of motion to test the closed-loop system performance in real time. The equations of motion for the test vehicle are de- rived based on experiments in which the effect of perturbed flow on the vehicle motion is also considered. A controller for the test vehicle is synthesized using H-infinity op- timization. Water tunnel tests successfully validated the supercavitating vehicle model and controller. The objectives were tracking of pitch angle reference commands and rejection of disturbances produced by an oscillating foil <b>gust</b> <b>generator.</b> The experimental results show the accuracy of the vehicle modeling and control design as well as the effect of the perturbed flow on the closed-loop system performance. The experience gained from this work enabled the introduction of the next generation test platform capable to capture planing phenomena...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{two methods}} of vortical gust generation {{and the interaction}} between these gusts and an airfoil. These flows were studied with both experiments at a Reynolds number of 20, 000 and with potential-flow based simulations. The standard method of generating a vortical gust has been to rapidly pitch an airfoil. A novel approach is presented: heaving a plate across the tunnel, and changing direction rapidly to release a vortex. This method is motivated {{by the desire to}} limit a test article's exposure to the wake of the <b>gust</b> <b>generator</b> by moving it {{to the side of the}} tunnel. A series of potential flow models were used to examine these flows: steady and unsteady thin airfoil theory, an extension of Tchieu and Leonard's unsteady airfoil model, and an unsteady vortex panel method. Experiments characterized the generated gusts and verified that the strength of the shed vortices approximately matched the theoretical predictions. The inviscid simulations were unable to predict viscous effects like the wakes of the generators. The pitching airfoil resulted in a persistent wake in the test section, whereas the wake of the heaving plate only temporarily disturbed the flow. The vortex-wing interaction was examined using both mechanisms. When the wake of the generator was far from the wing, the unsteady simulations provided reasonable estimates for the early variation in lift. This demonstrated that the initial lift peak is due to inviscid effects. Each of the potential flow methods with wake models provided reasonable estimates of this lift. The simplicity of the unsteady thin airfoil theory model recommends its use for examining early vortex-wing interactions. With the test article mounted at the midline of the tunnel, the wakes had substantial effects when the pitching generator was near the midline of the tunnel, or when the heaving plate passed the midline. The simulations were not able to capture the effects of the wakes or predict the effects of the airfoil's angle of attack. This had the largest effect on the timescale of the post-gust approach to the final forces. With the airfoil at α= 0 °, this was 5 - 10 convective time units, which is characteristic of attached flows. The airfoil at α= 10 ° needed double the time to approach its final state after perturbations due to its separated flow. The heaving plate's withdrawal allowed for measurement of the resumption of vortex shedding, which was impossible with the pitching airfoil's persistent wake. </p...|$|E
40|$|Unmanned Air Vehicles, UAVs are {{designed}} to operate without any onboard controllers. Consequently, they are considered to operate {{in a wide range}} of applications. Missions in undesirable conditions such as bad weather and/or highly unsteady gustiness could cause an unsuccessful operation. In many ways, aerodynamics is a key feature in the performance of UAVs such as influencing deformation vehicle, guidance and control. Two aspects of this research are, therefore, to understand flying conditions of UAVs in an urban environment and how the flying performance is affected by such conditions. The first objective relies on understanding air flow behaviour in the lower part of the urban environment which has the most important role on the response of UAVs. The second objective will be to look at the characteristics of a three-dimensional airfoil when it encounters an unsteady sinusoidal gust at different oscillation frequencies and freestream velocities. As the first step of the studies on the aerodynamic problem of UAV operations in the lower part of an atmospheric boundary layer in an urban environment, the boundary layer thickness in a suitable wind tunnel facility were the first experimental results obtained. Experimental measurements of the mean velocity profile in a turbulent boundary layer were investigated for three different floor roughness conditions as well as a smooth wall condition. As a result, three different boundary layer thicknesses were then classified depending on the wall surface roughness and a combination with turbulence generators providing a maximum thickness of 280 mm at the centre of the tunnel test section. However,the experimental investigations into the turbulent boundary layer over a rough wall have shown that the boundary layer thickness is dependent on the surface roughness and is different from that obtained under the smooth wall condition. An experimental study into a simulated urban flow regime was then carried out after the measurement of the boundary layer. Wind tunnel experiments on the airflow around a single and twin buildings including an investigation of the airflow between the gap of the buildings were obtained. Wind in the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer is more a micro-scale problem which increases or decreases the wind speed induced by buildings nearby. The studies have found some strong concentrated vortices caused by the flow separation essentially independent of the nature of the upstream flow and usually as a direct result of the building geometry and orientation. As the measurement location increased further downstream from the back of the buildings, the concentrated vortices were found to be weak and disappeared into the wake region. Finally, an experiment was conducted using a sinusoidal <b>gust</b> <b>generator</b> to describe the effects of wind oscillation parameters such as oscillation amplitude, oscillation frequency and reduced frequency under static and dynamic conditions. An evaluation was made of the onset of dynamic stall due to rapid changes in angle of attack during an unsteady pitch motion. The NACA 23012 wing profile was tested at a fixed angle of attack condition with varying oscillation flow parameters. Results demonstrate that those parameters influence the dynamic stall and hysteresis loop based on lift coefficient and angle of attac...|$|E
