40|$|The {{white rot}} fungus Trametes (Coriolus) versicolor can delignify and {{brighten}} unbleached hardwood kraft pulp {{within a few}} days, but softwood kraft pulps require longer treatment. To determine the contributions of higher residual lignin contents (kappa numbers) and structural differences in lignins to the recalcitrance of softwood kraft pulps to biobleaching, we tested softwood and hardwood pulps cooked to the same kappa numbers, 26 and 12. A low-lignin-content (overcooked) softwood pulp resisted delignification by T. versicolor, but a high-lignin-content (lightly cooked) hardwood pulp was delignified {{at the same rate}} as a normal softwood pulp. Thus, the longer time taken by T. versicolor to brighten softwood kraft pulp than hardwood pulp results from the higher residual lignin content of the softwood pulp; possible differences in the structures of the residual lignins are important only when the lignin becomes highly condensed. Under the conditions used in this study, when an improved fungal inoculum was used, six different softwood pulps were all substantially brightened by T. versicolor. Softwood pulps whose lignin contents were decreased by <b>extended</b> <b>modified</b> continuous <b>cooking</b> or oxygen delignification to kappa numbers as low as 15 were delignified by T. versicolor {{at the same rate as}} normal softwood pulp. More intensive O 2 delignification, like overcooking, decreased the susceptibility of the residual lignin in the pulps to degradation by T. versicolor...|$|R
40|$|Solid-state and {{solution}} NMR technique, {{were used}} in order to study the transformation of various functional groups present in lignin and cellulose when wood is exposed {{to a wide range}} of pH's and pulping reagents. Solid-state proton spin-lattice relaxation times (T 1 H) allowed the determination of the molecular mobilities of carbohydrates and lignin as a function of PH for black spruce softwood. Similar measurements on isolated cellulose and cuoxam lignin were also conducted. These studies showed that the mobilities of the polymeric constituents of wood are affected by ionization processes occurring on the various functional groups present in lignin and cellulose. Quantitative 31 P NMR Spectroscopy was also used to derive the fundamental thermodynamic parameters that are involved in the stereoselective degradation of the two diastereomeric forms of the most abundant structural (arylglycerol-beta-aryl ether) units of lignin under kraft pulping conditions. It was shown that the erythro isomers of the arylglycerol-beta-aryl ether units in softwood milled wood lignin cleave faster than their threo counterparts. The general stability of the threo diastereomers toward kraft pulping seems to be the manifestation of a considerably slower reaction of the pulping reagents with the threo diastereomers of arylglycerol-beta-aryl ethers. Quantitative 31 P NMR Was also used for the identification and quantification of accumulated condensed diphenyimethane (DPW moieties during conventional kraft, <b>extended</b> <b>modified</b> continuous <b>cooking</b> (EMCCRTM) and soda pulping processes. A novel method that permits the quantitative detection and classification of various carbonyls in lignin was also developed.

This was followed by 19 F NMR spectral analyses of the resulting fluorine derivatives allowing for thorough understanding of their structure/ 19 F NMR chemical shift relationships' our studies demonstrated that the Proposed method is a new analytical tool for the classification and quantification of various carbonyl groups that may be present in soluble lignins...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to evaluate how Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus nitens wood raw materials perform in modified cooking: SuperBatch™ (SB), CompactCooking™ (CC) and Lo-Solids™ (LS). <b>Modified</b> <b>cooking</b> methods {{have been developed to}} improve kraft cooking yield, chemical and energy consumption, bleachability and paper's technical properties. The SB cooking technology needed a 20 – 30 units higher H-Factor than CC and LS to reach the same degree of delignification for both raw materials. The highest screened cooking yields were obtained from conventional batch cooking with E. globulus (approximately + 1 %), and the lowest from batch cooking with E. nitens (approximately - 0. 5 %). For both species, the CC technology tended to produce unbleached pulps with a higher intrinsic viscosity (20 – 50 ml/g). The LS technology produced fibers with the highest fiber wall thickness and fiber saturation point (FSP) values. <b>Modified</b> <b>cooking</b> methods did not affect the water retention value (WRV); however, the different raw materials responded differently. E. nitens pulps presented 0. 15 g/g higher WRVs for both bleached and unbleached pulps than E. globulus pulps. In terms of fiber surface composition, no differences could be attributed to <b>modified</b> <b>cooking</b> methods. The total charge of fibers after LS cooking was slightly higher (~ 10 – 20 mmol/kg) compared to that of fibers after the other cooking methods. From the results, it can be concluded that the <b>modified</b> <b>cooking</b> methods (SB, CC and LS) with a slightly different cooking chemistry do not contribute significantly to yield and other cooking parameters. The differences seen in mill environment within the <b>modified</b> <b>cooking</b> technologies {{can be attributed to the}} equipment design, wood column movement and alkali distribution within the column and control systems. The decision on selection of the technology to produce pulp from E. globulus and E. nitens has to be made based on other than cooking chemistry, rather operation parameters that improve mill process control and runnability of the pulp mill. These parameters are e. g. control and stability of chip feed, liquor to wood ratio and chip column movement. In addition, one can conclude that the main differences in the paper technical properties and fiber characteristics come from differences in fiber cell wall structures between the wood species and mechanical effects of the applied <b>modified</b> <b>cooking</b> technology. The results show that the industrial process conditions such as temperature, alkali charge, free and bound liquor gradients have more important impact than cooking chemistry itself on the pulping and pulp quality...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2005. At SAPPI-Tugela a {{continuous}} Kraft wood chip digester operates in EMCC mode (<b>extended</b> <b>modified</b> continuous <b>cooking).</b> Chips are initially {{exposed to a}} NaOH / Na 2 S liquor at high temperature in the top section. The chips move downward in plug flow passing circumferential screens used to draw liquor for various circulations. About midway down the spent black liquor is removed and the chips enter the cooler bottom section where some further reaction and washing occurs. Liquor level and chip level are maintained {{close to each other}} near the top. Chips require 8 - 12 hours to pass through the digester, depending on the chip feed rate. The key parameter of interest at the digester exit is the Kappa number, which {{is a measure of the}} extent of delignification which has occurred. Different board and paper products require different Kappa number pulp feed. (Final properties such as tensile, tear and bursting strengths will also depend on the way fibres have been modified in the digestion). The objective of this investigation is to predict the Kappa number of the product pulp in real-time, thus facilitating quicker reaction than the present dependence on laboratory analysis permits, possibly even allowing closed-loop control. The extent of delignification depends on liquor strength, temperature and exposure time, with final Kappa number also depending on the properties of the chip feed (wood type and moisture content). Compensation to maintain a steady Kappa number is made difficult by the long and varying residence time, and the fact that any changes apply to the whole profile held up in the digester. A number of static models for Kappa number prediction have been developed by previous workers, but these do not compare well with plant measurements. The collection of data from the Sappi-Tugela reactor, and the pulp quality reports, have been used to determine an efficient model. This step required a considerable data collection exercise, and similar results to the quality reports have been obtained using a simple linear model based on this data. The problem of model error is being reduced by arrangement as a Smith Predictor, in which the model is intermittently corrected by available laboratory analyses. At the same time, an interface was created, in order to synchronise measurement data for the chips presently leaving the reactor. In order to deal with the dead time, each parcel of chips entering the reactor is effectively tracked, and the changes in Kappa number integrated for reaction time under the varying conditions in transit. Knowing the present inventory of the reactor, this model can also be run forward in time as a predictive controller, to determine optimal control actions for maintenance of the target Kappa number...|$|R

Because of these characteristic changes, the total burning times (pyrolysis time plus char burning time) of the reference black liquors were somewhat longer than those of black liquors from the <b>modified</b> <b>cooking</b> process. The novel biorefinery-based black liquors also swell more than the conventional ones.
