5|$|Hastings {{eventually}} switched {{sides and}} joined the Labour Party. His conversion, especially {{in the light of}} later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour may come to Government and had few senior lawyers to fill the Law Officer posts. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, {{came to the conclusion that}} Hastings gave political speeches using his skill as a lawyer to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ILP.|$|E
5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving {{that he or she is}} dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person if he or she had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E
5|$|While some evangelical Christians {{consider}} Harry Potter {{related to}} Satanism, a poll in 2000 {{indicated that this}} position remains a minority view. Seven percent of Americans who <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> books {{have a negative view}} of them, with 52 percent having a positive opinion and the remaining 41 percent unsure. This compares with 33 percent of Americans who identify themselves as Evangelical and 39 percent who take the Bible literally.|$|E

25|$|According to a 2010 survey, {{awareness}} of the reforms varies widely within the Moroccan population, with younger, urban, and educated women {{far more likely to}} <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law and have some familiarity with its provisions than women in rural areas, those with less education, and older women. Of Moroccans who <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Mudawana, 85% of women and 59% of men support the reforms. Most men who oppose the reforms believe the law negatively impacts them, gives greater weight to their spouses' demands, and view it as contrary to their religious beliefs. Women's dissatisfaction with the Mudawana, however, reflects a belief that it is not implemented widely and successfully enough to address the problems of women's rights. Two-thirds of Moroccan women surveyed said they felt the new Mudawana had improved women's status in Morocco, and 50% of men agreed.|$|E
25|$|In the English-speaking world, {{many people}} who {{otherwise}} might not <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landing at Suvla Bay know something of its history through the song And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda written in 1972 by Eric Bogle and covered by numerous artists including the Clancy Brothers, Joan Baez and the Pogues. The song, while emotionally charged and vivid, is not an accurate historical account of the landing and subsequent events. Suvla also appears in the traditional Irish song The Foggy Dew commemorating the 1916 Easter Rising.|$|E

500|$|Aided by Gilmer's findings, Stan Love filed unsuccessfully for conservatorship on May 17, 1990. A {{press conference}} with Stan at the lectern {{featured}} an unexpected appearance from Brian. While {{reading from a}} piece of paper, Brian was given a microphone and said: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charges made by Stan Love, and I think they are outrageous, which means {{they are out of}} the ballpark... I feel great." [...] Audree, Carl, Carnie, and Wendy Wilson then contested Landy's control of Brian, pursuing legal action on May 7, 1991. The ruling was finalized on February 3, 1992 when Landy was barred by court order from contacting Brian, leaving his affairs to the hands of conservator Jerome S. Billet. In December 1992, Landy was fined $1,000 for violating the court order when he visited Brian in June for his birthday.|$|E
500|$|Strawberry Panic! {{was one of}} {{the premier}} titles in the Light Novel and Strawberry (for yuri manga) {{production}} lines when it was licensed for English language distribution by Seven Seas Entertainment. In an interview with Seven Seas Entertainment founder Jason DeAngelis, he was posed the question, [...] "How do you attract a fan base for a novel before its release in English?" [...] His response was, [...] "We try to choose titles that are already well-known, like Pita-Ten, Shinigami no Ballad or Strawberry Panic!....In terms of attracting a fan base, though, in the end it's all about word-of-mouth. If the material is great, it will stand out on its own and find its audience. The small format that we're publishing these books in is frankly stunning, and it will definitely attract fans who may not <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property otherwise." ...|$|E
500|$|The club officials, {{including}} Turner, had to {{be removed}} from office and Norwich were ousted from the amateur game {{at the end of the}} season. The response was swift: at a meeting two days later, it was resolved to find a place in professional football. On 30 May 1905, they were elected to play in the Southern League, in place of Wellingborough. By then the club had secured their first professional manager, John Bowman. [...] Bowman served two years in the role. [...] He also has a place in Norwich City history for making the first recorded link between the team and its nickname [...] "Canaries", although at this time the club nickname was [...] "Citizens". The earliest recorded link between the club and canaries, came in a 1905 newspaper interview with Bowman, quoting him saying: [...] "Well I knew of the City's existence... I <b>have...</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canaries." [...] At the time, this was a reference to Norwich's link to breeding canaries; the club's canary colours and crest would follow the adoption of the nickname.|$|E

2500|$|Allen's {{influence}} in the Scottsboro case was particularly important, with Yale University historian Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore contending that [...] "we might never <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scottsboro case if Sol Auerbach, using his Party name, James S. Allen, had not arrived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in mid-July 1930." [...] Allen {{was listening to the}} radio in his Chattanooga apartment in March 1931 when he heard that police in Paint Rock, Alabama, had removed nine young black men from a freight train and charged them with rape. Auerbach promptly alerted the party's International Labor Defense, of the situation, which quickly became involved in the defense.|$|E

The Tres is introduced to trick Agliè. Upon reading the list, he claims not to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tres before.

2500|$|In January 1926, the University of Kansas {{announced}} that it had hired Cappon as its new football coach. [...] Former Michigan football coach George Little, then at Wisconsin, recommended Cappon to the administrators at Kansas.

[...] On his first visit to Lawrence, Kansas, Cappon told reporters: [...] "I always <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clean, fine sportsmanship in the Missouri Valley conference, and I am glad to be coming out this way. ... I hope we may turn out a football team that will be a credit to the Valley and in every way uphold Valley traditions for clean play and sportsmanship." [...] In two seasons as the football coach at Kansas, Cappon's record was 5–10–1. [...] According to a 1940 history of football at the University of Kansas, Cappon resigned after two years at Kansas {{as the result of a}} controversy over [...] "scouting." [...] The Missouri Valley conference schools had agreed [...] "not to 'scout' each other in the belief that such a practice was unsportsmanlike." [...] After Kansas beat Missouri 14–7 with a new passing attack and [...] "impregnable defense," [...] Missouri produced evidence to show that Kansas supporters, not part of the Kansas staff, had acted as [...] "volunteer scouts" [...] at Missouri games and had provided Cappon with [...] "charts of the Tiger plays," [...] that enabled Cappon to develop new schemes to stop the Missouri offense. [...] According to the 1940 account, the [...] "upshot of the affair was Cappon's resignation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} game {{cover was}} revealed by Irrational Games in early December 2012; the art featured DeWitt against a burning flag {{with some other}} elements of the game. Several journalists were critical of the art, with the lack of any major elements from the game including Elizabeth, and lacking any of the uniqueness that BioShock Infinite had set itself to be prior to this point, such as through the Game Informer Saturday Evening Post-inspired covers. Erik Kain of Forbes considered the art [...] "generic", while Owen Good of Kotaku considered it both [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "cliché"; Gieson Cacho of the San Jose Mercury News noted that the cover was reminiscent of , down to the pose of DeWitt matching that of Nathan Drake. Levine responded to these complaints commenting that they had decided to make the cover art something to draw the attention of the more casual player, [...] "the uninformed, the person who doesn't read IGN" [...] that may never <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, knowing that those players that are already planning to purchase the game {{do not need to be}} swayed further. A public poll was opened by Irrational to allow players to decide what the reversible cover art should be, while alternate cover art will be provided as downloadable files that players can print and use. Levine further showed the back cover art, which includes Elizabeth, an element further designed to draw interest in casual players. Levine stated that for the cover and other parts of the game's promotion including live-action commercials, they had hired Anna [...] "Ormeli" [...] Moleva, a Russian cosplayer that had earlier attracted attention for her recreation of Elizabeth back in September 2011.|$|E
