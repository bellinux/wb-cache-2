5000|$|The m-derived process {{starts with}} a k-type filter {{midsection}} and transforms it into a m-derived filter with a different transfer function but retaining the same image impedance and passband.

500|$|Thus, k {{will have}} units of impedance, that is, ohms. It is readily {{apparent}} {{that in order}} for k to be constant, Y must be the dual impedance of Z. A physical interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value of Zi as the size of the section (in terms of values of its components, such as inductances, capacitances, etc.) approaches zero, while keeping k at its initial value. Thus, k is the characteristic impedance, Z0, of the transmission line that would be formed by these infinitesimally small sections. It is also the image impedance of the section at resonance, in the case of band-pass filters, or at ω = 0 in the case of low-pass filters.

[...] Like the m-type, this section can be constructed as a series or shunt section and the image impedances will come in T and Π variants. [...] Either a series construction is applied to a shunt m-type or a shunt construction is applied to a series m-type. [...] The advantages of the mm-type filter are achieved at the expense of greater circuit complexity so it would normally only be used where it is needed for impedance matching purposes and not in the body of the filter.|$|E
50|$|At Kolbermoor, {{location}} of the Heinkel-Hirth engine works, the Fedden Mission, led by Sir Roy Fedden, found jet engine manufacturing was simpler and required lower-skill labor and less sophisticated tooling than piston engine production; in fact, most of making of hollow turbine blades and sheet metal work on jets could be done by tooling used in making automobile body panels.

500|$|Several L <b>half-sections</b> may be {{cascaded}} to form {{a composite}} filter.

50|$|The federal {{government}} granted the first land patents in McKinley in 1860, giving four 160-acre parcels along the Jump River in sections 30 and 29 (around the modern Geise/Winger neighborhood) to Belinda Bonesteel and Harrison Hobart.

2500|$|In {{respect of}} {{constant}} resistance filters, the term half section has {{a somewhat different}} meaning to other kinds of image filter. [...] Generally, a half section is formed by cutting through {{the midpoint of the}} series impedance and shunt admittance of a full section of a ladder network. [...] It is literally half a section. [...] Here, however, there is a somewhat different definition. [...] A half section is either the series impedance (series <b>half-section)</b> or shunt admittance (shunt <b>half-section)</b> that, when connected between source and load impedances of R0, will result in the same transfer function as some arbitrary constant resistance circuit. [...] The purpose of using half sections is that the same functionality is achieved with a drastically reduced component count.|$|E
2500|$|It must be {{emphasised}} {{that these}} half sections {{are far from}} being constant resistance. [...] They have the same transfer function as a constant resistance network, but only when correctly terminated. [...] An equaliser will not give good results if a <b>half-section</b> is positioned facing the line since the line will have a variable (and probably unknown) impedance. [...] Likewise, two half-sections cannot be connected directly {{to each other as}} these both will have variable impedances. [...] However, if a sufficiently large attenuator is placed between the two variable impedances, this will have the effect of masking the effect. [...] A high value attenuator will have an input impedance [...] no matter what the terminating impedance on the other side. [...] In the example practical chain shown above there is a 22dB attenuator required in the chain. [...] This {{does not need to be}} at the end of the chain, it can be placed anywhere desired and used to mask two mismatched impedances. [...] It can also be split into two or more parts and used for masking more than one mismatch.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} born {{in mind that the}} {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance.

It is usual to provide half <b>half-sections</b> at the ends of the filter with m = 0.6 as this value gives the flattest Zi in the passband and hence the best match in to a resistive termination.|$|R
