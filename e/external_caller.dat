40|$|A {{growing number}} of Americans are {{considering}} cutting their landline telephone cords in favor of becoming cell phone-only. To date, survey researchers have begun to understand that cell phone-only users tend to be “heavy users ” of cell phones compared {{with those who have}} both landlines and cell phones. Recent studies on cell phones (either in conjunction with/without a landline phone) have explored behaviors such as types of plans (individual/family), type of usage (sharing,/personal) and frequency of usage (most/some calls, emergency calls). With increases in the number of cell phone subscribers coupled with decreases in landline owner-ship, could variability in cell phone usage patterns be explained in part by recent changes in telephone status? While cell phone plan attributes (e. g., number of any-time/whenever/nights-and-weekend minutes and web and text mes-saging access) and phone attributes / capabilities (e. g., smart/PDA phone, <b>external</b> <b>caller</b> id screen) vary by provider, these may also influence patterns of use – a relationship that has received little attention in the literature. The understanding of prevalence and use of these attributes, which in practical ways differ in function and use from their landline counterparts, is crucial to optimizing call designs to cell phone users. In this paper, we use data collected from a two-phase Gallup Panel survey to explore cell phone usage patterns of members who reported being cell phone-only. The {{participants in this study were}} originally recruited via RDD landline samples and their self reported change to cell phone-only status was confirmed from a follow-up Web survey that collected specific cell phone plan data including: type, cost, minutes and technological components such as: voice mail and text messaging. A detailed analysis of usage behaviors including explorations of the interaction between cell phone plan/ phone capabilities and answering propensity will be presented. ...|$|E

Unlike many such bands however Banjax did not need to work with <b>external</b> <b>callers,</b> since both Dave Roberts and Keith Leech were well able to do this themselves.|$|R

CTI allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller {{as a means of}} directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a screen-pop, making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine enquiries to switchboard or PABX (Private Automatic Branch eXchange) operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time. An additional function is the ability to allow <b>external</b> <b>callers</b> to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated voice mail experience to the caller.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{techniques}} and technology {{needed to make}} building production-quality web services a manageable problem. It approaches this problem in both software process and in the specifics of some areas of a Web Service - such as API, security and session management. The software process is more foundational: this paper argues that the traditional waterfall model of deployment is not appropriate for Web Services. In these services, integration with <b>external</b> <b>callers</b> {{is one of the}} key problems, yet this only surfaces on live systems. Debugging on, and rapid updates of, the live system are the only way to address interoperability and other problems that surface on the production service. Furthermore, as management of a running system is the main ongoing cost of a service, the needs of operations cannot be left as an afterthought to the system design. We propose the incorporation of the deployment process into the iterative development process through the inclusion of operations use cases, tests and defect tracking into the normal software cycle. When combined with a fully automated deployment mechanism, the foundations for a rapid web service development process are in place. On the technical aspects of Web Service development, there are core issues related to security, interoperability, scalability and robust design that need to be considered from the outset. We explore these topics using the experience gained from encountering many of the issues when developing production systems. We then go on to explore how the component models of the future could adapt to better suit server-side and Web Service development. We argue that uniform APIs for standard services- logging, configuration, management, testing-permit reusable components to be used i [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Finding the {{evolutionary}} origins of human {{language in the}} communication systems of our closest living relatives has, {{for the last several}} decades, been a major goal of many in the field of animal communication generally and primate communication specifically. 1 – 4 The so-called “functionally referential” signals have long been considered promising in this regard, with apparent parallels with the semantic communication that characterizes language. The once-prominent idea that functionally referential signals are word-like, in that they are arbitrary sounds that refer to phenomena <b>external</b> to the <b>caller,</b> has largely been abandoned. 5 However, the idea that these signals may offer the strongest link between primate communication and human language remains widespread, primarily due to the fact the behavior of receivers indicates that such signals enable them to make very specific inferences about their physical or social environment. Here we review the concept of functional reference and discuss modern perspectives that indicate that, although the sophistication of receivers provides some continuity between nonhuman primate and human cognition, this continuity is not unique to functionally referential signals. In fact, because functionally referential signals are, by definition, produced only in specific contexts, receivers are less dependent on the integration of contextual cues with signal features to determine an appropriate response. The processing of functionally referential signals is therefore likely to entail simpler cognitive operations than does that of less context-specific signals. While studies of functional reference have been important in highlighting the relatively sophisticated processes that underlie receiver behavior, we believe that the continued focus on context-specific calls detracts from the potentially more complex processes underlying responses to more unspecific calls. In this sense, we argue that the concept of functional reference, while historically important for the field, has outlived its usefulness and become a red herring in the pursuit of the links between primate communication and human language...|$|R
