5|$|Evers {{rejoined the}} Braves as a scout. As Braves owner Emil Fuchs sold manager Rogers Hornsby to the Cubs and assumed {{managerial}} duties {{himself for the}} 1929 season, Fuchs hired Evers as a coach. Fuchs had no experience as a field manager, and so Evers became captain of the Braves, directing the team during the game and dealing with umpires. Evers and fellow coach Hank Gowdy played in one game in the 1929 season, coming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ninth inning on October 6, 1929. In the process, Evers became the oldest {{player in the league}} for the year.|$|E
5|$|On April 16, 1981, the New York Yankees made {{a stop in}} Nashville to play an {{exhibition}} game against the Sounds. The 10–1 Yankees victory was played {{in front of a}} standing-room only crowd of 17,318spectators. Some Yankees present at the game included owner George Steinbrenner, coach Yogi Berra, and players Reggie Jackson, Bucky Dent, Lou Piniella, Bobby Murcer, Goose Gossage, Tommy John, and Johnny Oates. The Yankees returned for another game against the Sounds on April 28, 1983. Former Sound Don Mattingly, as well as Yankees manager Billy Martin and pitcher Goose Gossage were in attendance. The Sounds, who trailed the Yankees, 4–0, going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ninth inning, scored five runs to beat the Yankees, 5–4, before a crowd of 13,641.|$|E

5|$|The Twins {{finally won}} the American League pennant during the 1965 season. On July 11, {{the day before}} the All-Star break, {{defending}} AL champion Yankees had a one-run lead over the Twins going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 9th inning, but Killebrew hit a two-run home run for the win. Two days later, Killebrew started the All-Star Game at his home field, Metropolitan Stadium, and hit a game-tying two-run home run, erasing what had been a 5–0 National League lead. Elected to play first base on his fifth All-Star team, Killebrew became the first player in All-Star game history to be elected at three different positions, having previously been selected to play third base (1959 and 1961) and left field (1963 and 1964).|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{cylinder}} valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose.

5|$|In {{the first}} inning, after {{striking}} out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem {{gave up a}} solo home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first with two straight singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit {{to tie the game}} at 1–1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came up to the plate with two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a solo home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.|$|E

5|$|The Zveno-3 {{in which}} TB-3 carried two Grigorovich I-Z fighters under the wings {{presented}} a different challenge — the I-Z was a monoplane with fixed landing gear which touched the ground {{while it was}} suspended under the mothership. To accommodate the uneven ground during takeoffs, the fighters were attached via a floating frame that permitted vertical movement relative to the TB-3. However, immediately after takeoff the I-Z pilots had to push forward on the control sticks to lock the frame in the fixed bottom position — if the fighter-bomber was not rigid in flight, the bomber became extremely difficult to control. During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the lift generated by his fighter broke the docking frame and crashed him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mothership's wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow landing speed of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov. This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying {{as many as five}} aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that top-mounted configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership's wings. The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter with retractable landing gear. This permitted the use of the same rigid mounting frames as for the top-mounted aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The DC-7's upraised {{left wing}} clipped {{the top of}} the Constellation's {{vertical}} stabilizer and struck the fuselage immediately ahead of the stabilizer's base, causing the empennage (tail assembly) to break away {{from the rest of the}} airframe. At the same time, the propeller on the DC-7's left outboard, or number one engine, chopped a series of gashes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constellation's fuselage. Explosive decompression would have instantaneously occurred from the damage, a theory substantiated by light debris (such as cabin furnishings and personal effects) being scattered over a large area.|$|E
25|$|On {{the road}} against the Toronto Blue Jays on July 25, the Rays were down 8–0 after four innings, and losing 9–1 {{entering}} the 7th inning. However the Rays would score eight runs {{over the next}} 3 innings to tie the game, including two solo home runs in the 9th inning. The game would enter extra innings, where the Rays would take a one-run lead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12th inning. Joe Nelson would come in to pitch as the Rays' last remaining relief pitcher available. The Blue Jays would load the bases with one out, but could not capitalize.

25|$|The {{same was}} not true of the wild-card leading Atlanta Braves. 10 games ahead of the Cardinals on August 24, Atlanta went only 6–7 over its next 13 games before coming to St. Louis on September 9 to play a three-game series that {{would prove to be}} critical. In the first game, Atlanta led 3–1 going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ninth inning, but a Schumaker single and walks to Furcal and Theriot set up a two-run, two-out Albert Pujols single to tie the game. The Cardinals won on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Nick Punto {{in the bottom of the}} 10th. On September 10 St. Louis won by the same 4–3 score when Michael Bourn flied out to right with the tying run on third. On the 11th Yadier Molina hit a three-run double and the Cardinals won 6–3 to complete the sweep. The sweep cut the gap in the wild-card race to 4 games, but St. Louis had only 16 games left to play and its playoff chances were still only 7.7%.|$|E
25|$|Inside the dryer, hot dry air {{is pumped}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hopper {{containing}} the resin {{so that it}} flows up through the pellets, removing moisture on its way. The hot wet air leaves {{the top of the}} hopper and is first run through an after-cooler, because it is easier to remove moisture from cold air than hot air. The resulting cool wet air is then passed through a desiccant bed. Finally, the cool dry air leaving the desiccant bed is re-heated in a process heater and sent back through the same processes in a closed loop. Typically, residual moisture levels in the resin must be less than 50 parts per million (parts of water per million parts of resin, by weight) before processing. Dryer residence time should not be shorter than about four hours. This is because drying the material in less than 4 hours would require a temperature above 160°C, at which level hydrolysis would begin inside the pellets before they could be dried out.|$|E
25|$|The A's {{started out}} as a {{favorite}} to win the AL West again, and played up to that, having the best record in baseball at the All-Star break. To bolster their starting rotation, they acquired pitchers Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel from the Chicago Cubs for several top prospects on July 4, and later acquired Jon Lester from the Boston Red Sox at the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline for Yoenis Céspedes. However, without the big bat of Cespedes, poor production from All-Stars Josh Donaldson and Brandon Moss, and an injury to closer Sean Doolittle, they struggled in August and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim caught up, sweeping them in a key 4-game series between the two teams. At the August 31 waiver trade deadline, the A's acquired first baseman Adam Dunn from the Chicago White Sox and cash considerations for a minor league player. Despite their struggles which continued into September, they made the playoffs {{on the last day of}} the season, and faced the Kansas City Royals in the Wild Card Game. While they carried a 7-3 lead going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 8th inning, they managed to relinquish it due to the Royals' baserunning skills coupled with ineffective pitching, allowing them to tie the game. They did regain the lead in the top of the 12th, but the Royals responded with 2 runs in the bottom of the inning, winning on a walk-off single by Salvador Pérez.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers finally {{returned}} home on June 11 only to lose 3–2 to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, led by rookie outfielder Mike Trout, who was 2 for 4 {{with a home}} run and two RBI in the game. The Dodgers struggled against Angels starter Jerome Williams the next night, trailing 2–1 heading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighth. However they battled back as Ethier hit a game-tying single and then Juan Rivera put the Dodgers ahead to stay with a three-run home run. Kenley Jansen picked up his 10th save in the 5–2 victory. The Angels took {{the final game of}} the series as Erick Aybar hit a tie-breaking home run off Jansen {{in the top of the}} ninth to give them the 2-1 win over the Dodgers. In the next game, on June 15 against the Chicago White Sox, Kershaw struggled, giving up 5 runs in his 6 innings of work but the Dodgers came back and won the game 7-6 thanks to a wild pitch by reliever Matt Thornton that pushed across the eventual winning run. The Dodgers again fell behind early the next day, then came back to tie the game. However, this time they lost 5-4. Chris Capuano struck out 12 in 8 innings of the series finale on Father's Day but left the game down 1–0. The Dodgers ralied to tie the game in the bottom of the 9th and won in the 10th after a triple by Tony Gwynn, Jr. and a walk off single by Dee Gordon.|$|E
