Nevertheless, Majorino commented that Mac and Veronica's relationship would continue to be close throughout the season.

500|$|Attanasio based the {{characters}} in Homicide on the detectives featured in Simon's book. Frank Pembleton was based on Detective Harry Edgerton, although the two were so different that both the producers and detectives agreed their only true similarity {{was that they were}} black. Meldrick Lewis was only loosely based on Detective Donald Waltemeyer, and Levinson admitted Lewis did not start to become strongly developed until [...] because, [...] "I thought it'd be <b>great</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a character who was totally unwilling to share with the people he worked with." [...] Tim Bayliss was based on the real-life Baltimore detective Tom Pellegrini, the primary detective who investigated the 1988 Baltimore slaying of 11-year-old Latonya Kim Wallace. The extremely personal approach Bayliss took in attempting to solve Adena Watson's murder, and his strong disappointment over failing to solve it, was based on the emotions Pellegrini went through in the Wallace case. Pellegrini provided advice to actor Kyle Secor about how to play the Bayliss role.|$|E

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Bryan Cogman spoke of the re-introduction of Benjen and Mawle to the show saying [...] "It was <b>great</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Joe Mawle back with us – {{it must have been a}} trip for him to step back into the character after so long – but he's also decidedly not the Benjen of season 1.

500|$|Gould also {{discusses}} {{the possibility that}} what Morrell sighted was [...] the eastern coast of Graham Land, the so-called [...] "Foyn Coast", despite its being 14° further west from position of the New South Greenland sighting. [...] Gould asserts that {{the features of the}} peninsula's eastern coast corresponds [...] closely with [...] Morrell's description of Nw South Greenland. This theory supposes that Morrell miscalculated the ship's position, perhaps because he lacked the chronometer necessary for proper navigational observation. In his account Morrell writes that he was [...] "destitute of the various nautical and mathematical instruments", although other parts of his narrative seem to indicate that the occasional dead reckoning calculation was the exception to the norm. A longitudinal error of 14° is very large, and the additional distance of about [...] to the Foyn coast seems too <b>great</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been covered within the ten-day voyage from the South Sandwich Islands, where the ship's position is recorded accurately. Even so, Gould suggests that a [...] "balance of evidence" [...] shows that what Morrell saw was the Foyn coast.|$|E

[...] In late January 2015, Butters and Fazekas revealed that Underwood is a product of the precursor to the Black Widow program.

In 2009, {{it was announced that}} Donna's father had been cast and would be introduced the following year. Brian Vriends was given the role of Nick Nixon. Of the introduction of Brian and Nick, executive producer, Susan Bower said [...] "The Freedman family have provided fantastic drama for us so far and we have lots in store for Brian, it's <b>great</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him with us.

Nicholas has just been released from jail and he is keen to do something right. However, he hurts Donna when he tells her that she is just like her mother and that she will run away.

500|$|To help {{train the}} dog playing Vincent for the episode's needed scenes, Madison {{was given the}} fake arm to take home and play with; when finally brought on the set, the crew had {{difficulty}} shooting her because Madison would bring and drop off the arm slightly differently each time, causing trouble recreating the same camera angles. Actor Daniel Dae Kim described their scenes with the beer in the DVD special features, [...] "The comedic scenes with Josh were {{so much fun to}} play because it was a lighter side. A nice change of pace." [...] Like their characters, the actors had not been in scenes together in a while, so Dae Kim thought it [...] "was fun to catch up and have fun in the process". The episode featured Hurley driving a bus down a hill. To create this scene, Garcia had to drive the bus down a small hill [...] "very stead" [...] to ensure the cameraman could record it all; towards the end however, they told Garcia to just [...] "go for it", allowing him to [...] "cut loose a little". For the close-up shots of Garcia and Dominic Monaghan, the production crew would shake the bus to simulate driving, and brush various pieces of foliage across the windshield to make it seem the bus was hitting bushes or trees. A stunt double standing in for Garcia performed the largest hill in the drive down; they were unable to rehearse due to getting rained out, so their first rehearsal was done on film. Dae Kim commented that [...] "it was just <b>great</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> as much fun on camera as we do off camera", {{and that there was no}} real acting that day, as they were all enjoying themselves as much as their characters.
