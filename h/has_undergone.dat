5|$|Although it {{may have}} once been a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks <b>has</b> <b>undergone</b> {{extensive}} erosion since its extinction.

Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E

40|$|Objectives:To {{determine}} the incidence and pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction (ED) {{in patients with}} aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) {{and the effects of}} aortofemoral surgery, including endarterectomy (E) and reconstruction (R), on erectile function (EF). Design:Evaluation of EF before and 3 months after surgery. Methods: 31 out of 40 male patients scheduled for aortofemoral surgery were given multiple choice questionnaires and penile dynamic Colour Doppler Ultrasonography. Results:Of the 31 who agreed to enter the study five (16 %) were found to be potent and 26 (84 %) to suffer from ED. This was purely arteriogenic in 8 % of the cases, purely venogenic in 23 %, combined arteriogenic and venogenic in 53 %, and neurogenic in 16 %. Twenty patients returned for postoperative evaluation of EF, nine who <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> E and 11 who <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> R. Improvement of EF, in terms of increased penile arterial inflow, occurred in seven patients, six who <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> E and one who <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> R. EF remained unchanged in nine patients, three who <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> E and six who <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> R. Deterioration of EF occurred in four patients, all who <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> R, and was attributable to decreased arterial inflow in two cases and to neurogenic surgical injury in the other two. Conclusions:The majority of patients with AIOD suffers from ED. Reduced penile arterial inflow and cavernovenous leakage are equally important in the pathophysiology of ED in patients with AIOD, suggesting that atherosclerosis may also compromise the penile veno-occlusive mechanism. Endarterectomy seems more likely than reconstruction to improve or maintain EF...|$|R

40|$|Background: Ectopic {{pregnancy}} (EP) is the implantation of fertilized ovum in any site of {{the reproductive}} tract except uterine cavity. To choose laparotomy or laparoscopy for treatment {{is based on the}} patient’s hemodynamic status, her past surgical history, and the physician’s experience in endoscopic surgery. The goal {{of this study was to}} compare clinical and laboratory findings in women who <b>have</b> <b>undergone</b> laparoscopy or laparotomy for EP. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 103 women, who <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> laparoscopic or laparotomy treatment due to EP diagnosis, were enrolled. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information. Past fertility history, past medical and drug history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings (including Hb and serum β-hCG levels), size of EP mass and its location, endometrial thickness, free fluid in pelvic or abdominal cavity, type of treatment, and method were recorded. Results: Of the study population, 58 <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> laparotomy and 45 <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> laparoscopy. Mean age, mass size, and B-hCG level before surgery were significantly higher in women who <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> laparotomy. Right tubes followed by left tubes were the most affected sites. Unstable vital sign was recorded in the laparotomy group more than the laparoscopy group. Conclusions: Results of the current study showed that women who <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> laparotomy <b>had</b> significantly higher mean age, mass size, and B-hCG level and were more unstable than the laparoscopic group...|$|R
