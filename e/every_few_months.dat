5|$|Glee {{debuted in}} America on the Fox network on May19, 2009. Series creator Ryan Murphy planned to include {{five to eight}} musical numbers per episode, and to release {{accompanying}} soundtrack albums <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> In the week prior to the broadcast of the pilot episode, Murphy stated that seven different companies had bid on {{the rights to the}} series' first soundtrack. The contenders were narrowed down to four labels, with Fox ultimately signing a deal with Columbia Records as a result of chairman Rob Stringer's belief that Glee would be a success. Stringer appreciated the series' use of both classic and contemporary pop music. He suggested that other record labels underestimated the potential of Glee musical releases as they are all cover versions.|$|E

Subscriptions are sold on an annual basis, and cost anywhere from US$2,000 to US$20,000 per year per subscription, as it is offered in several tiers. Holders of such subscriptions (except the lowest library-only levels) receive new Microsoft software on DVDs or via downloads <b>every</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months.</b> The software generally comes on specially marked MSDN discs, but contains the identical retail or volume-license software as it is released to the public.|$|R
50|$|The rural {{electrification}} drive during the New Deal {{led to a}} wide expansion {{in the number of}} jobs in the electric power industry. Many power linemen during that period traveled around the country following jobs as they became available in tower construction, substation construction, and wire stringing. They often lived in temporary camps set up near the project they were working on, or in boarding houses if the work was in a town or city, and relocating <b>every</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months.</b> The occupation was lucrative at the time, but the hazards and the extensive travel limited its appeal.|$|R
25|$|A major {{challenge}} for waste gasification technologies {{is to reach}} an acceptable (positive) gross electric efficiency. The high efficiency of converting syngas to electric power is counteracted by significant power consumption in the waste preprocessing, the consumption of large amounts of pure oxygen (which is often used as gasification agent), and gas cleaning. Another challenge becoming apparent when implementing the processes in real life is to obtain long service intervals in the plants, {{so that it is}} not necessary to close down the plant <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> for cleaning the reactor.|$|E
25|$|Initial bundles were {{typically}} collections of independently developed games featuring multi-platform support (including Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms) provided without {{digital rights management}} (DRM). Occurring <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> the two-week Humble Bundles drew media attention, with several bundles surpassing $1 million in sales. Subsequently, the bundles became more frequent and expanded to include games from established developers, AAA publishers, games for Android-based devices, bundles promoting game jams, and bundles featuring digital copies of music, books and comic books. Bundles are presently offered on a more regular basis, with a persistent storefront for individual game sales.|$|E
25|$|By {{the fall}} of 2003, season four episodes began to be offered by mail. By the spring of 2004 season five DVDs with about six episodes each began to be {{released}} gradually. Columbia House ended the distribution of these mail order DVDs in the Winter of 2005. They began releasing complete season sets in the Summer of 2004 <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> They stated that Columbia House Subscribers would get these episodes through mail before releasing any box sets with the same episodes. They finally ended gradual subscriptions in 2005, several months before season 5 became available in retail.

50|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Europeans the First Nations lived in a wide array of structures. The {{semi-nomadic}} peoples of the Maritimes, Quebec, and Northern Ontario, such as the Mi'kmaq, Cree, and Algonquin generally lived in wigwams. These were wood framed structures, covered with an outer layer of bark, reeds, or woven mats; usually in a cone shape although sometimes a dome. These groups changed locations <b>every</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months.</b> They would take the outer layer of the wigwam with them, and leave the heavy wood frame in place. The frame could be reused if the tribe returned to the location at a later date.|$|R

25|$|The classic {{presentation}} (in 40–50% of the cases) is episodic hematuria, {{which usually}} starts {{within a day}} or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (hence synpharyngitic), as opposed to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection. Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. Groin pain can also occur. The gross hematuria resolves after a few days, though microscopic hematuria may persist. These episodes occur on an irregular basis <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> and in most patients eventually subsides, although it can take many years. Renal function usually remains normal, though rarely, acute kidney failure may occur (see below). This presentation is more common in younger adults.|$|E
25|$|During {{this entire}} period, {{there had been}} a {{constant}} stream of Errata, and later Addenda (which amounted to the same thing). For a long time, {{the vast majority of the}} mail received was from the top few fanatical SFB players, who constantly campaigned for new rules, rules fixes, and rules changes. This became a source of discontent for most of the rest of the players, who did not appreciate a game that changed <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> and needed a sheaf of notes along with the voluminous rules. However, it was generally believed nearly impossible to repair the damage by properly re-writing and re-integrating such a large and complex system into a new edition before doomsday, especially without bringing the product line to a halt while only new versions of old products were released.|$|E
25|$|The {{settlement}} at Grytviken {{was established}} on 16 November 1904 by the Norwegian sea captain Carl Anton Larsen, as a whaling station for his Compañía Argentina de Pesca (Argentine Fishing Company). It was phenomenally successful, with 195 whales {{taken in the}} first season alone. The whalers used {{every part of the}} animals – the blubber, meat, bones and viscera were rendered to extract the oil, and the bones and meat were turned into fertilizer and fodder. Elephant seals were also hunted for their blubber. Around 300 men worked at the station during its heyday, operating during the southern summer from October to March. A few remained over the winter to maintain the boats and factory. <b>Every</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> a transport ship would bring essential supplies to the station and take away the oil and other produce. The following year the Argentine Government established a meteorological station.|$|E
25|$|The Hebrew {{calendar}} is a lunar calendar synchronised {{with the}} seasons by intercalation, i.e. a lunisolar calendar. There are thus 12 ordinary months plus an extra month that is added in (intercalated) <b>every</b> <b>few</b> years. Some <b>months</b> vary in length by a day, as well. The months originally had very descriptive names, such as Ziv (meaning light) and Ethanim (meaning strong, perhaps {{in the sense of}} strong rain - i.e. monsoon), with Canaanite origins, but after the Babylonian captivity, the names were changed to the ones used by the Babylonians. With the Babylonian naming, the intercalary month has no special name of its own, and is merely referred to as Adar I, the following month being Adar/Adar II (in the Babylonian calendar, it was Adar II that was considered to be the intercalary month).|$|R

40|$|Kleine-Levin {{syndrome}} (KLS) {{is a rare}} sleep disorder mainly affecting {{teenage boys}} in which the main features are intermittent hypersomnolence, behavioral and cognitive disturbances, hyperphagia, {{and in some cases}} hypersexuality. Each episode is of brief duration varying from a week to 1 - 2 months and affected people are entirely asymptomatic between episodes. No definite cause has been identified, and no effective treatments are available even though illness is having well-defined clinical features. Multiple relapses occur <b>every</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months,</b> and the condition may last for a decade or more before spontaneous resolution. In this study, PubMed was searched and appropriate articles were reviewed to highlight etiology, clinical features, and management of KLS. On the basis of this knowledge, practical information is offered to help clinicians about how to investigate a case of KLS, and what are the possible treatment modalities available currently for the treatment during an episode and interepisodic period for prophylaxis.

25|$|Also {{under the}} Piapro brand is Crypton's Piapro Studio, a Vocaloid vocal editor {{implemented}} as a VST/AU plugin bundled {{with all of}} their full V3 Vocaloid products (Miku V3, Miku V3 English, Miku V3 Bundle, Meiko V3, Kaito V3). This allows for full vocal editing functionality nearly identical in feature support to Yamaha's full Vocaloid 3 Editor software, which is available as either a standalone application or a plugin for Cubase. All Vocaloid 3 voice libraries include the Tiny Vocaloid 3 Editor for free, however this is quite severely limited in functionality compared to the full V3 editor, being limited to just 17 bars of output, along with some other limitations - serving mainly as a beginner's taste of Vocaloid editing or a way to easily test out a new vocal library. Piapro Studio was created to allow owners of Crypton's V3 products to have a fully featured vocal editor with a modernized and streamlined interface bundled free of charge. It also allows for the loading of 3rd-party, non-Crypton Vocaloid 3 voicebanks - as well as V2's that have been imported into the full V3 editor beforehand. Being a VST plugin, it allows the user to operate entirely within their DAW of choice, {{in contrast to the}} tiny or full V3 editors which are standalone applications and the user must export a wav to import into their DAW each time a change or update is needed - or export an updated wav file from their DAW as the background music to import into the V3 editor. This integration of the vocal editing within the DAW as a VST instrument plugin allows for convenient editing and a smoother workflow. Currently Piapro Studio is lacking some features of the full V3 editor, but most of these are not needed to work with the vocal composition and tuning of the Vocaloid, instead currently some convenience and expansion features such as WAV import and Vocaloid 3's Job Plugins (a scripting system), are absent from Piapro Studio. Crypton has however has mentioned they would like to implement something similar to Job Plugins {{at some point in the}} future. Piapro Studio is also regularly updated <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> with new features and bug fixes. Vocaloid 3 Editor updates appear much less frequently, generally only around the time of release of a new Vocaloid. Piapro Studio also features some Piapro social designed singer icons and vocal preview samples, added in an update in the Summer of 2014.|$|E

500|$|After the {{disaster}} at Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt {{turned to the}} most aggressive sailor available, Admiral Ernest J. King (1878-1956). Experienced in big guns, aviation and submarines, King had a broad knowledge and a total dedication to victory. He {{was perhaps the most}} dominating admiral in American naval history; he was hated but obeyed, for he made all the decisions from his command post in the Washington, and avoided telling anyone. [...] The civilian Secretary of the Navy was a cipher whom King kept in the dark; that only changed when the Secretary died in 1944 and Roosevelt brought in his tough-minded aide James Forrestal. [...] Despite the decision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Admiral William D. Leahy to concentrate first against Germany, King made the defeat of Japan his highest priority. For example, King insisted on fighting for Guadalcanal despite strong Army objections. [...] His main strike force was built around carriers based at Pearl Harbor under the command of Chester Nimitz. [...] Nimitz had one main battle fleet, with the same ships and sailors but two command systems that rotated <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> between Admiral Bull Halsey and Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. The Navy had a major advantage: it had broken the Japanese code. [...] It deduced that Hawaii was the target in June 1942, and that Yamamoto’s fleet would strike at Midway Island. King only had four carriers in operation; he sent them all to Midway where in a miraculous few minutes they sank the Japanese carriers. This gave the Americans the advantage in firepower that grew rapidly as new American warships came on line much faster than Japan could build them. King paid special attention to submarines to use against the overextended Japanese logistics system. They were built for long-range missions in tropical waters, and set out to sink the freighters, troop transports and oil tankers that held the Japanese domains together. The Southwest Pacific theatre, based in Australia, was under the control of Army General Douglas MacArthur; King assigned him a fleet of his own without any big carriers.|$|E

40|$|Cataclysmic {{variables}} (classical novae and dwarf novae) are {{binary star}} systems {{in which a}} red dwarf transfers hydrogen-rich matter, by way of an accretion disk, to its white dwarf companion 1. In dwarf novae, an instability is believed to episodically dump much of the accretion disk onto the white dwarf. The liberation of gravitational potential energy then brightens these systems by up to 100 -fold <b>every</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months.</b> Thermonuclear-powered eruptions thousands of times more luminous occur in classical novae 5, accompanied by significant mass ejection 6 and formation of clearly visible shells from the ejected material. Theory predicts that the white dwarfs in all dwarf novae must eventually accrete enough mass to undergo classical nova eruptions 9. Here we report a shell, {{an order of magnitude}} more extended than those detected around many classical novae, surrounding the prototypical dwarf nova Z Camelopardalis. The derived shell mass matches that of classical novae, and is inconsistent with the mass expected from a dwarf nova wind or a planetary nebula. The shell observationally links the prototypical dwarf nova Z Camelopardalis with an ancient nova eruption and the classical nova process...|$|R
40|$|The upper haze (UH) of Venus is {{variable}} on {{the order}} of days and it is populated by two particle modes. We use a 1 D microphysics and vertical transport model based on the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres to evaluate whether interaction of upwelled cloud particles and sulfuric acid particles nucleated in situ on meteoric dust are able to generate the two size modes and whether their observed variability are due to cloud top vertical transient winds. Nucleation of photochemically produced sulfuric acid onto polysulfur condensation nuclei generates mode 1 cloud droplets that then diffuse upwards into the UH. Droplets generated in the UH from nucleation of sulfuric acid onto meteoric dust coagulate with the upwelled cloud particles and cannot reproduce the observed bimodal size distribution. The mass transport enabled by cloud top transient winds are able to generate a bimodal size distribution in a time scale consistent with observations. Sedimentation and convection in the middle and lower clouds causes the formation of large mode 2 and mode 3 particles. Evaporation of these particles below the clouds creates a local sulfuric acid vapor maximum that causes upwelling of sulfuric acid back into the clouds. If the polysulfur condensation nuclei are small and their production rate is high, coagulation of small droplets onto larger droplets in the middle cloud may result in sulfuric acid "rain" below the clouds once <b>every</b> <b>few</b> Earth <b>months.</b> Reduction of the polysulfur condensation nuclei production rate destroys this oscillation and reduces the mode 1 particle abundance in the middle cloud by two orders of magnitude, though it better reproduces the sulfur-to-sulfuric-acid mass ratio in the cloud and haze droplets. In general we find satisfactory agreement between our results and observations, though improvements could be made by incorporating sulfur microphysics. Comment: 62 pages, 18 figures, 1 table.
