40|$|It {{is within}} the {{framework}} of the discipline called tort law that the rules of compensation for damages are to be found. The Swedish general tort law is subsidiary, which means that laws that in the light of the question at hand seam more adequate shall be applied instead of the ordinary tort law. Within the framework of what is colloquially called maritime tort law (sjöskaderätt), one may for example sort legal rules concerning compensation for damages occurred under transport, by <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> from ships or damages occurred by collision of ships. There are differences between the ordinary material law of torts and the material law of maritime tort law. Insofar one argues that legal, formal, coherency is the proper yardstick of legal legitimacy either the ordinary tort law or the marine tort law has to be wrong. Of course, one could argue that the correct yardstick is consequential coherence and that only the result matters independent of what kind of instrument (the joint and several- or the pro rata liability) that is used. Another argument would be that there are differences as well in theory as in practice, but that those differences are justified in the light of that the political motives may differ between those the systems of law. In other words: the political instruments are set to achieve different political goals...|$|E
30|$|The {{distribution}} of the giant oil and gas fields in the PLP ancient marine carbonate strata was greatly influenced by regional paleo-uplift. The fields mainly developed in the paleo-uplift area, slope area, and platform margin reef–shoal bodies in the basins (Table  5). There are more oil and gas fields in the slope area than in the higher part of the uplift. This is mainly because the high part has been strongly denuded and destroyed, resulting in the <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and gas accumulated in the early stage. For example, the Tazhong 1 and Tahe fields {{are located in the}} slopes of Tazhong and Tabei paleo-uplifts in the Tarim Basin (Jiang et al. 2010), and the Jingbian gas field is situated in the Yishan paleo slope in the Ordos Basin. Vertically, karst reservoirs in the weathering crust of Ordovician carbonate rocks are the main production layers. The Anyue field is located in the north slope zone of the Weiyuan uplift and gas accumulated {{under the control of the}} Gaoshiti–Moxi paleo-uplift. The dolomite grain beach reservoir body was mainly developed in the Cambrian period (Zou et al. 2014 b; Wei et al. 2015 b; Zhu et al. 2015; Li et al. 2015). The Gomez and Puckett fields are located at the anticlinal flanks of the Delaware and Val Verde basins. The production layer is the weathered crystalline dolomite of the Lower Ordovician Elenburger Group (Ijirigho and Schreiber 1988). The Makarem 1 gas field is located in the Makarem paleo-uplift zone in the Oman Basin. The carbonate reservoirs are Ara subsalt and intersalt dolomite belts, overlaid with thick evaporites of the Ara Group that provide high-quality regional cap rocks (Alkindi and Richard 2014). The Niagaran Reef Trend field is mainly distributed on the slope of annular deposits between the carbonate platform and the center of the Michigan Basin, where oil and gas are accumulated in the middle Silurian pinnacle reefs (Ritter 2008). The four fields in the East Siberian Basin are mainly distributed on the Nepa-Botuobin and Baykit paleo-uplifts and their slopes. The gas and oil reserves in the Baykit uplift are mostly distributed in the middle part of the secondary low uplifts, while those in the Nepa-Botuobin uplift are mainly at the top or southern slope. For example, the Yurubcheno–Tokhomo field is located in the middle part of the Kamo uplift in the Baikit Anticline. Within 100  m under the unconformity surface is a high oil and gas production segment. At the high position of the uplift, the dolomite experienced strong structural movements and dissolution. Dissolved pores, cavities, and fractures were well developed with high-quality reservoir properties for oil and gas accumulation. Meanwhile, very thick evaporites were developed in the lower part of the Lower Cambrian strata in the central and southern regions, which acted as a high-quality regional cap layer preventing the upward migration of lower fluids and the dissipation of lower oil and gas (Kontorovich et al. 1981; Du et al. 2009).|$|E

This work focus on the application of a digital processing methodology on HYPERION images to identify the <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> liquid <b>oil</b> through porous material on land called seepages.

40|$|A {{multi-phase}} Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) {{method is}} developed {{to model the}} failure process <b>of</b> a flexible <b>oil</b> boom. An algorithm is proposed based on the dynamic boundary particles (DBPs) for preventing the particle disorders during the multi-fluid particle movement around the solid boundary. The improved multi-phase SPH model is firstly validated by the experimental data of a wedge falling into a two-layer oil-water fluid. Then a numerical wave-current flume is established with an active absorbing piston-type wave generator and a circulating current system. The model reliability is validated against the measured vertical profiles of velocity. Simulation of the flexible floating boom movement is implemented by introducing a Rigid Module and Flexible Connector (RMFC) multi-body system. The model is finally applied to the simulation of movement of a flexible floating boom in containing industrial gear oil under the combined waves and currents. Good agreements are obtained between the SPH modeling results and the experimental data {{in terms of the}} ambient wave-current field, hydrodynamic responses of the floating body and evolution process <b>of</b> the <b>oil</b> slick for the flexible boom. The hydrodynamic responses and containment performances of the flexible floating boom are also compared with those of the rigid one. It is found from both the experimental and numerical results that two vortices of the water phase exist in the front and rear of the boom skirt {{and the size of the}} front vortex decreases with an increase of the current velocity while the wake vortex is reversed. It is also found that the skirt of the flexible boom has a larger magnitude of the swaying and rolling than the rigid one and the maximum quantity <b>of</b> the <b>escaped</b> <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> a flexible boom within one wave cycle is about 5 % more than a rigid one under the present test conditions...|$|R
40|$|For many food {{products}} emulsification processes {{play an important}} role. Examples are ice cream, spreads, sauces, etc. As is well known, droplet break-up and coalescence phenomena are the local processes underlying the control of particle size in an emulsion process. Quite {{a number of studies}} have generated scaling laws which can be easily applied and which are useful in the design of a process. However, the prediction of particle sizes in an inhomogeneous flow, where the flow velocity is changing spatially in strength and direction and with time, is not yet well established. For one-phase flows computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodologies are in use to predict details on the flow with quite some success. This methodology has been extended to capture the dispersed phase in an efficient way. The essence is that break-up and coalescence processes determine source terms in a transport equation for the moments of the particle size distribution, while velocity vectors as obtained in the one-phase CFD simulation determine the convective term. This method allows particle size prediction in any equipment. The approach is illustrated for the particle size evolution of an oil-in-water emulsion, for a phase-separated biopolymeric mixture (a so-called water-in-water emulsion) and for the <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> the included <b>oil</b> droplets from a double emulsion of the type oil-in-water-in-oil.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Chemical dispersants are {{designed}} to disperse and dissolve surface slicks <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> and diesel by lowering the interfacial tension between the slicks and seawater. The effects of sub-surface application of dispersant during deep ocean oil spills are not well understood; however, very large quantities of dispersants were applied at the broken wellhead, 1, 500 m below the surface, during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident. Following the Deepwater Horizon accident, laboratory experiments were conducted that have shown that smaller droplets are produced by the breakup of contaminant jets <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> discharging into seawater if sufficiently high concentrations ( 1 %) of dispersants are mixed with the oil. These droplets subsequently form a buoyant contaminant plume that rises toward the surface. Small droplets may detrain from the plume due to ambient density stratification and currents and form subsurface intrusion layers. Droplet size is therefore {{an important factor in}} determining the fate <b>of</b> the <b>oil.</b> No data exist on the effect of dispersants on the evolution of droplets in the contaminant plume during their buoyant rise through the oceanic water column. Toward this end, an experimental investigation was conducted. In this experiment, buoyant droplets of Oseberg Blend crude oil, similar to the oil released in the Deepwater Horizon spill, mixed with COREXIT 9500 dispersant at various concentrations, were suspended by a downward flow of synthetic seawater in a vertical water tunnel to simulate free-rise conditions. The droplets were monitored with video cameras over extended periods of time and the hydrocarbon components <b>of</b> the <b>oil</b> that were dispersed or dissolved in the seawater were analyzed with a GCMS. The data indicate that the addition of dispersant to crude <b>oil</b> promotes reduction <b>of</b> droplet size during free-rise and that this evolution is strongly influence by the Dispersant to Oil Ratio (DOR). Video imaging revealed that droplet shrinkage occurs due to "tip streaming," where larger droplets at sufficiently high DORs shed filaments <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> from their edges, or by tearing events. The extent and rate of shrinkage depends on DOR, with significant changes often occurring within the first 10 - 30 minutes of an experiment. GCMS data were employed to attempt to quantify the phenomena observed in the video records. Seawater samples were extracted after 8 hours and dissolved and entrained hydrocarbons were collected using solid phase extraction. Integration of the chromatograms to estimate total hydrocarbon content, based on reference dilution GCMS injections <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> in hexane, indicate that the amount <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> dissolved and dispersed in water is very sensitive to DOR. Tests also demonstrate that most <b>of</b> the <b>oil</b> detected with the GCMS is entrained in the water phase as tiny droplets rather than being dissolved. The results of this investigation suggest that droplets formed by the breakup <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> <b>oil</b> jets during a undersea spill will shrink during their buoyant rise toward the surface if sufficient dispersant is mixed with the oil. The rate and extent of this reduction in droplet size depends strongly on DOR...|$|R
