50|$|Coal is {{introduced}} {{from the top}} to produce an even layer of about 60 - 90 cm deep. Air is supplied initially to ignite the coal. Carbonization starts and produces volatile matter, which burns inside the partially closed side door. Carbonization proceeds {{from top to bottom}} and is completed in two to three days. Heat is supplied by the burning volatile matter so no by-products are recovered. The exhaust gases are allowed to escape to the atmosphere.

The HCOG was reformed by non-catalytic partial oxidation in a tubular reactor (0. 6 m i. d. and ∼ 4. 1 m long) with four oxygen nozzles (0. 0427 m i. d.), which was installed {{on a platform of}} an operating coke oven. The reforming of HCOG, a multi-component mixture, in a turbulent flow was simulated numerically by considering both chemical reactions and fluid dynamics. The detailed chemical kinetic model, originally consisting of more than 2000 elementary reactions with 257 species, was reduced to 410 reactions with 47 species for realising a kinetic model of finite rate reactions with a k–ε turbulence model. The calculation was carried out using the eddy dissipation concept (EDC) coupled with the kinetic model, and accelerated using the in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) algorithm.

40|$|Fluid coking is a non-catalytic {{process where}} heavy {{hydrocarbon}} feed, sprayed using jets into a fluidized bed reactor, cracks upon contacting <b>hot</b> <b>coke</b> particles and produces valuable volatile fractions. It {{is estimated that}} the Alberta tar sands contain 1. 7 trillion barrels of oil, equivalent to 35 % of the world’s crude oil reserves, of which the majority is processed using fluid cokers. Important parameters that affect the yield of fluid cokers include the feed jet stability and therefore its ability to entrain and mix the injected feedstock with the fluidized coke particles. To this purpose, this study investigated {{the effect of the}} use of various types of draft tubes, placed downstream of the feed jet to enhance mixing, on solids entrainment and jet stability. Specifically, it has been demonstrated {{with the use of a}} gas-liquid and gas-only jet that an optimum distance exists between the nozzle and draft tube for entrainment of solids. For both cases, this optimal distance occurs as the jet touches the draft tube wall. However, for a gas-only jet this occurs at a shorter distances due to the increased angle of expansion. The angles of expansion were confirmed using triboelectric probe measurements. It has also been shown that the shape of the inlet to the draft tube will have an effect on the rate of solids entrainment as will the presence of pulsations in the jet...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{approach is}} presented for predicting the species concentrations and temperature profiles of chemically reacting {{flow in the}} non-catalytic partial oxidation of <b>hot</b> <b>coke</b> oven gas (HCOG) in a pilot-scale reformer installed on an operating coke oven. A detailed chemical kinetic model consisting of 2216 reactions with 257 species {{ranging in size from}} the hydrogen radical to coronene was used to predict the chemistries of HCOG reforming and was coupled with a plug model and one-dimensional (1 D) flow with axial diffusion model. The HCOG was a multi-component gas mixture derived from coal dry distillation, and was approximated with more than 40 compounds: H 2, CO, CO 2, CH 4, C 2 hydrocarbons, H 2 O, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons up to coronene. The measured gas temperature profiles were reproduced successfully by solving the energy balance equation accounting for the heat change induced by chemical reactions and heat losses to the surroundings. The approach was evaluated critically by comparing the computed results with experimental data for exit products such as H 2, CO, CO 2, and CH 4, in addition to the total exit gas flow rate. The axial diffusion model slightly improves the predictions of H 2, CO, and CO 2, but significantly improves those of CH 4 and total exit flow rate. The improvements in the model predictions were due primarily to the improved temperature predictions by accounting for axial diffusion in the flow model...|$|R
40|$|In an {{industrial}} Fluid CokerTM, liquid bitumen is injected into {{a bed of}} <b>hot</b> <b>coke</b> particles through spray nozzles, grouped in several banks at different vertical positions. The main objective of this thesis is to determine whether significant improvements in liquid-solid contact could be achieved by optimizing {{the location of the}} spray nozzles. In the coker regions where bitumen is injected, the gas is a mixture of product vapors and steam. Steam introduced at different levels rises through the coker: the stripping steam is injected near the bottom, then the attrition steam above the stripper and finally the bitumen atomization steam. As a result, the cross-sectional averaged gas velocity greatly varies vertically, from the lowest spray bank to the highest spray bank. In addition, there are large radial variations in gas velocity, as gas bubbles tend to concentrate in the central region of the bed. In this study, the impacts on liquid-solid contact of gas velocity and uneven gas distribution were investigated. The effects of spray pulsations and atomization gas flowrate on liquid distribution were also studied. Effects of bed hydrodynamics on the initial liquid distribution and on the subsequent drying were studied separately. The results indicate that jet pulsations or increasing the atomization gas flowrate improve the liquid distribution. Large improvements in liquid distribution were achieved by increasing the superficial gas velocity and also increasing the gas velocity {{at the end of the}} spray jet cavity, for all types of spray jets, pulsating or non-pulsating...|$|R
5000|$|The {{prepared}} coal {{charge in the}} coal tower is drawn by a charging car {{on the top of}} the batteries and charged into the ovens as per sequence. The charged coal is gradually heated by the heating wall of the oven in the absence of air to attain a temperature of 1000°-1050 °C at the central axis of the coke mass toward the end of coking period. the coking period is generally specified between 16 hrs and 19 hrs depending on oven condition and production requirement. the volatile matter of coal liberated during carbonization is collected in gas collecting mains in the form of raw coke oven gas passing through stand pipes and direct contact cooling with ammonia liquor spray.

40|$|Coke plants, {{which produce}} {{various types of}} coke (metallurgical, foundry or heating), at {{temperatures}} between 600 and 1200 °C, with limited access to oxygen, are major emitters of particulates and gaseous pollutants to air, water and soils. Primarily, the process of wet quenching should be mentioned, {{as one of the}} most cumbersome. Atmospheric pollutants include particulates, tar substances, organic pollutants including B(a) P and many others. Pollutants are also formed from the decomposition of water used to quench coke (CO, phenol, HCN, H 2 S, NH 3, cresol) and decomposition of <b>hot</b> <b>coke</b> in the first phase of quenching (CO, H 2 S, SO 2) [1]. The development of the coke oven technology has resulted in the changes made to different types of technological installations, such as the use of baffles in quench towers, the removal of nitrogen oxides by selective NOx reduction, and the introduction of fabric filters for particulates removal. The BAT conclusions for coke plants [2] provide a methodology for the measurement of particulate emission from a wet, low-emission technology using Mohrhauer probes. The conclusions define the emission level for wet quenching process as 25 g/Mgcoke. The conducted research was aimed at verification of the presented method. For two of three quench towers (A and C) the requirements included in the BAT conclusions are not met and emissions amount to 87. 34 and 61. 35 g/Mgcoke respectively.

40|$|Fluid CokingTM {{is a major}} {{refining}} process to upgrade heavy crude oil or bitumen from oil sands. In Fluid CokingTM bitumen is atomized with steam and sprayed inside a high temperature fluidized bed of coke particles where it thermally cracks into smaller molecules. Fluid CokingTM is a carbon rejection process as solid carbon residues are formed during fragmentation into lighter hydrocarbon vapors. New coke deposits over existing coke particles and, consequently, the particle size increases. In addition, particles agglomeration occurs when the injected liquid does not disperse uniformly on individual <b>hot</b> <b>coke</b> particles but reaches, instead, local concentrations sufficiently large {{to act as a}} binder for several solid particles. Attrition nozzles are used to control the particle size to maintain the desired flow properties and reactor operability. In fact, fluidization quality degrades while there are too many particles smaller than 50 μm or larger than 600 μm. Some of the large agglomerates may interact with the stripper sheds near at the bottom of Fluid CokersTM, resulting in their fouling and can cause premature reactor shut down. The simultaneous particle agglomeration and attrition observed in Fluid CokersTM has been simulated at elevated temperature in laboratory scale fluidized unit to study these processes and to develop and apply new technological solutions to reduce the generation of large agglomerates. An experimental technique has been developed to simultaneously perform the spray injection and attrition processes utilizing different nozzle designs and operating conditions, measuring, the initial and the final bed particle size distribution. Various interactions of spray and attrition jets have been tested and a novel liquid dispersion technique has been proposed and studied to reduce the production of large agglomerates. The results show that, when an attrition jet hits {{at the base of a}} spray jet, the formation of large agglomerates is significantly reduced, but a large amount of unwanted fines is then generated. On the other hand, the application of satellite jets at the periphery of spray jets achieved better control of large agglomerates while minimizing fines generation...|$|R
40|$|During the Fluid Coking Process™ bitumen is sprayed into a {{fluidized}} bed of <b>hot</b> <b>coke</b> particles. The bitumen undergoes thermal cracking and is converted into gasses, condensable vapors, and solid coke, which deposits on the coke particles. These vapors rise through the vessel {{and result in}} entrainment of coke particles. Wet fine coke particles from the freeboard region enter the cyclone {{and contribute to the}} fouling of the Coker cyclones which can lead to the premature shut-down of Fluid Cokers. The primary objective of this research is to determine how bed wetness affects entrainment. First, a new {{fluidized bed}} was constructed, and a novel pseudo-isokinetic sampling was developed and tested to collect entrained solids. Then the entrainment from the dry bed in the bubbling and the turbulent regime was investigated. The cluster analysis was performed and showed an improvement in predicting the flux of solids ejected from bed surface, above the TDH, and across the freeboard. In the next chapter, the effect of the different levels of bed wetness on flux and size distribution of the entrained particles was studied, and the results were compared to the ones obtained for the dry bed. It was observed that in the bubbling regime, the presence of liquid can change the bubble properties in the bed which will affect the entrainment. However, the effect of low liquid loading on entrainment in turbulent regime was found to be negligible. In the final chapter, RPT was employed and {{it was found that the}} motion of ejected clusters in the freeboard could not be tracked as the clusters move too fast for the strength of radioactive that was used. Moreover, a new model to measure the entrainment of clusters in the freeboard using a modified radioactive tracer technique in which the detectors are collimated was proposed. It was found that this method only provides the decay coefficient of the clusters flux decay...|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of modern switchers are diesels, but countries with near-total electrification, like Switzerland, use electric switchers. Prior {{to the introduction of}} diesel-electric locomotives, electric shunting locomotives were used to an extent in Great Britain where heavy trains needed to be started on steep gradients. The steeply-graded Quayside Branch in Newcastle upon Tyne was electrified by the North Eastern Railway in 1905, and two steeplecab locomotives were built to handle all traffic on the line. One of these, No. 1, is now part of the National Collection and resides at Locomotion in Shildon. On {{the opposite side of the}} Tyne, the electrified lines owned by the Harton Coal Company in South Shields for the movement of coal and colliery waste to shipping facilities on the river was one of the more extensive industrial networks. A number of the early German locomotives built for use on these lines have been preserved. Electric locomotives were also extensively employed for moving the <b>coke</b> <b>cars</b> at cokeworks, obtaining power from a side wire, as third rail or overhead line electrification would have been impractical. These specialised locomotives were tall steeple-cab types not seen anywhere else, and operated on a short length of track between the ovens and the quenching tower. Despite their ubiquity, very few have survived into preservation as there is very little scope of operating them due to their unique means of obtaining power, slow speed and the fact they greatly exceed the loading gauge of most railway lines. One example built by Greenwood and Batley in Armley, Leeds is preserved at the Middleton Railway, not far from where it was built. Small industrial shunters are sometimes of the battery-electric type. An early battery-electric shunting locomotive is shown here. The Tyne and Wear Metro has three battery electric shunters built by Hunslet, which are used to haul engineering trains when the overhead supply is switched off. Flywheel energy storage was also used experimentally by Sentinel.|$|R

30|$|The {{quality of}} coke affects the {{performance}} of the blast furnace, factors affecting coke quality include coal properties, coal charge granulometry and carbonization conditions. The coke properties include the size analysis, cold strength (Micum Indices-M 40, M 10) and <b>hot</b> strength (<b>Coke</b> Reactivity Index-CRI, Coke Strength after Reaction-CSR) properties and structural properties such as coke structure and texture. Structural properties comprise the porosity, pore-cell wall thickness and pore sizes, while textures consist of the carbon forms in the coke. In present work, advanced method such as image analysis method was used to interpret coke microstructure. Conventional methods such as determination of coke porosity by measurement of real and apparent density and mercury porosimetry have a number of limitations. Coke size, magnification, number of image frames captured, process of pellet preparations and coke properties such as M 40, M 10, CRI and CSR (low, medium and high values) were taken as variables for experimental purposes. The coke structure parameters such as porosity, length, perimeter, breadth, roundness, pore-wall thickness and pore size distribution of the pores were determined by image analysis method. This method provided average porosity in addition to pore-wall thickness and pore-size distribution. The pore wall thickness measurement by image analysis method provided significant correlations with M 40, CRI and CSR values. This explained the usability of image analysis for coke structure measurement.|$|R
