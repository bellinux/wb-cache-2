50|$|In 1934, at {{the time}} of the Austrian revolt, Munich was given the task of {{monitoring}} all Austrian communications traffic including internal communications. In its earliest stage, the monitoring and capture of intercepts was intended only to thoroughly acquaint the Reichswehr cipher bureau personnel with Austrian traffic. However, after the revolt began, warrants for the arrest of political offenders appeared in the customs and police traffic, thus giving the Nazi Party information concerning the fate of its partisans across the border.

50|$|Polish radio {{communications}} were {{well known to}} the Intercept Control Station, {{as a result of}} long observation during the interwar period, and were intercepted from points in Silesia and East Prussia. During the period in the summer of 1939, the <b>intercept</b> <b>service</b> and cipher bureau observed not only the regular traffic but a large number of field messages which increased daily and was far out of proportion to the known organization and radio equipment possessed by the Polish Army. As was later confirmed after the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, the purpose of this was to camouflage Polish {{radio communications}} by using three call signs and three frequencies for each station. Intelligence officers engaged in the evaluation of traffic and D/F data were unable to derive any detailed tactical results from the intercepted messages. It was impossible for officers to determine if polish efforts to disguise their efforts were to simulate stronger forces than they possessed. In any case, the lack of radio silence in the assembly area was a grave mistake.|$|E
50|$|Using their {{previous}} experience had provided the personnel {{of the unit}} with excellent training that enabled them to become rapidly skilled in this new types of work. The intercept company was not engaged in cryptanalysis but {{solely on the basis}} of D/F reports and evaluation of traffic intercepts handled by the numerous stations, the staff were able to deduce that a large number of units were in the area, but had no way to determine their organizational structure or Order of Battle. All that could be determined was whether the units belonged to the army, air force, or the NKVD, whose radio intercepts were distinguished by a different call sign, than that used by the regular armed forces. For several months during the period of regrouping, everything was in a state of flux. The soviet radio traffic was considered well organized and efficiently handled. Then the company intercepted messages from areas which were not actually assigned to it. When the USSR occupied the Baltic states of occupied Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (Occupation of the Baltic states) and when they subsequently attacked Finland, their Shortwave radio transmissions from those areas were very well received by FAK 610 in southern Galicia, even better in areas further north. This was considered a discovery of great technical importance for the German <b>intercept</b> <b>service.</b> It could not have been arrived at by simple calculation, since it resulted from physical conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>intercept</b> <b>service</b> {{mission was}} narrowed to include only Army Traffic. With the {{formation}} of OKW/Chi, the signals intelligence agency of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces, in 1939, OKW/Chi took over all diplomatic intercept traffic. To help facilitate message interception, the Army transferred two interception stations at Lauf and Treuenbrietzen.The <b>intercept</b> <b>service</b> expanded. In 1939, the Army established two new branch stations for the intercept of foreign Army communications from the east. The branch stations were created as Graz and Tullin.Five new Signal Intelligence Regiments (German:Kommandeur der Nachrichtenaufklärung, abbr. KONA) were created. The KONA operated in the theatre as complete intercept and evaluation units, while attached to Army Groups, (e.g. Army Group A). Each KONA unit was numbered from one to five. KONA units 1,2,3 {{were assigned to the}} Eastern Front. KONA 1 was assigned to the southern front, KONA 2 to the Central front and KONA 3 to the Army Group on the Northern Front. KONA 4 was not attached to any Army Group, but was subordinated to the commander of the German Armies in the Balkans (German:Befehlshaber Suedost). [...] KONA 5 was assigned to Army Group B on the Western Front.In 1939, to cope with the increased demand and difficulty of decryption of enemy Army traffic, a large number of mathematicians and linguists were drafted and assigned to various field units, or intercept stations. When intercept units moved into the field in 1939, no cryptographers were available. Colonel (German:Oberst) Kunibert Randewig, was a veteran of pre-war monitoring of Soviet Union wireless traffic. As commander of all the intercept units in the west, he was tasked with seeking available personnel. Those cryptographers which were available from Y Units around Berlin were reassigned with additional Linguists and Mathematicians recruited as necessary. As a result, when the German Offensive started in April 1940, a sufficient group of cryptanalysts personnel were available The Army showed an increased interest in the security of their own key systems. This gave rise via a concentration of personnel for a new agency, a math referat that was created in 1939/40, Army Signal Security Agency es Group IV of Inspectorate 7 (abbr. 7/IV). This was subordinated to the Chief of Army Equipment and Commander of the Replacement Army (German:Chef de Heeresriestung und Befehlshaber des Ersatxheeres) (abbr. Chef H Ruest u. Bde). The unit initially had about a dozen mathematician including Dr Hans Pietsch, Steinberg, Friedrich Böhm, Dr Herbert Julius von Denffer, Hilburg, and Dr Hans-Peter Luzius. Most of these were drawn from the statistical offices of insurance companies. Dr Otto Buggisch had his first contact with the group at the end of 1940The group was loose at first, as men could be detached for specific projects in security work, but over time the work gradually split into three functions. This was General Theory - Referat F under Denffer, Hand ciphers under Oblt. Lüders and machine systems with the heading, Referat 13 commanded by Wachtmeister Doering.The German Army Signal Intelligence service in 1939 consisted of the following parts:At least 10 intercept stations for the interception of foreign traffic (German: Feste Horchstellen, abbr. Feste). Five Signal Intelligence Regiments (KONA) attached to Army Groups. An Intercept Control Stations (German: Horchleitstellle) for the evaluation and analysis of foreign Army traffic. An Army Signal Security Agency, Inspectorate 7/IV for testing and issuing codes and ciphers for the Army.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—One {{of the key}} {{concepts}} of service-oriented computing is dynamic binding which favors on-demand integration of services into a running system. Companies can outsource tasks to external partners by using their services {{and are able to}} switch over to alternatives at runtime. However, this flexibility comes at a high cost because it complicates the testing process significantly. The major problem with external services is their restricted usability for testing purposes, due to costs or because policies forbid trial invocations. In this paper we present our approach to solve this issue by generating automatically testbeds which emulate external services. Based on previous work on testbed generation, we have developed a technique for <b>intercepting</b> Web <b>service</b> invocations in Java-based systems, generating emulated replicas at runtime, and redirecting the invocations transparently.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for deploying a crime directed patrol force. The optimization problem is formulated as {{the allocation of}} N patrol among R high crime regions so as to maximize the weighted probability of a patrol intercept of a crime. The algorithm has full sensitivity analysis capabilities. This capability is critical because the model's input parameters include (1) crime weights, which in general will have a subjective component, (2) crime descriptive data, which are difficult to estimate, and (3) crime frequency data, which are likely to change with time. The paper {{presents an}} illustrative application of the algorithm. The resultant allocation is compared to a strategy which allocates patrol units {{in direct proportion to}} each region's total crime rate. The optimal allocation significantly increased the probability of an <b>intercept.</b> government: <b>services,</b> police, search and surveillance, probability: stochastic model applications...|$|R
