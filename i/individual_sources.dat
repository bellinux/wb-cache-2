For the case where the channel is a DMC we construct an implementable scheme guaranteed to asymptotically attain the performance of (or strictly beat) the best in the set of all schemes with “symbol-by-symbol ” decoders (and arbitrary encoders), on every individual sequence. Decoding in the latter construction employs a recently derived discrete universal filter. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} separating speech and interference signal from their single mixture. The system is based on deriving some independent basis vectors from the mixture spectrogram and clustering them to produce the <b>individual</b> <b>source</b> subspaces. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to derive some basis vectors reducing the dimension of the mixture spectrogram and independent component analysis (ICA) is {{used to make the}} basis vectors independent in their own domain. The independent basis vectors are then grouped into two sets (speech and interfering audio) by employing Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLd) based k-means clustering. Each group of basis vectors is used to decompose the mixture spectrogram into the <b>individual</b> <b>source</b> spectrograms and the time domain source signals are re-synthesized by applying some inverse transformations. The experimental results are noticeable in separating speech and its interfering audio signals...|$|R
