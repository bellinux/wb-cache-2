5000|$|Fused {{deposition}} modeling {{is handled}} by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model {{of this is}} using a <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> <b>gun</b> to build a 3d model. The <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> <b>gun</b> (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly {{the width of the}} extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.|$|E

50|$|Hot adhesives, {{also known}} as hot melt adhesives, are {{thermoplastics}} applied in molten form (in the 65-180 °C range) which solidify on cooling to form strong bonds between {{a wide range of}} materials. Ethylene-vinyl acetate-based hot-melts are particularly popular for crafts because of their ease of use and the wide range of common materials they can join. A <b>glue</b> <b>gun</b> (shown at right) is one method of applying <b>hot</b> adhesives. The <b>glue</b> <b>gun</b> melts the solid adhesive, then allows the liquid to pass through its barrel onto the material, where it solidifies.|$|R

50|$|Foamcore {{does not}} adhere well to some glues, such as superglue, and {{certain types of}} paint. The foam tends to melt away and dissolve. Some glue works well in casual settings, however, {{the water in the}} glue can warp the fibers in the outer layers. Best results are {{typically}} obtained from higher-end spray adhesives.

50|$|Glue dots are {{pressure-sensitive}} adhesive dots, used in various different applications, such as sticking {{credit cards to}} paper, arts and crafts, and as a safe adhesive for children to use, without needing a <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> <b>gun.</b> Glue dots provide a clean and instant bond and are often a more suitable solution that hot or liquid glues or adhesive tapes. Glue dots leave much less mess, residue, and odor which help present a product in the best way, whilst increasing productivity and reducing costs. Removable glue dots also allow you to create a bond which can be removed when needed.|$|E
50|$|Hot melt {{adhesive}} (HMA), {{also known}} as hot glue, {{is a form of}} thermoplastic adhesive that is commonly supplied in solid cylindrical sticks of various diameters, designed to be melted in an electric <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> <b>gun.</b> The gun uses a continuous-duty heating element to melt the plastic glue, which the user pushes through the gun either with a mechanical trigger mechanism on the gun, or with direct finger pressure. The glue squeezed out of the heated nozzle is initially hot enough to burn and even blister skin. The glue is tacky when hot, and solidifies in a few seconds to one minute. Hot melt adhesives can also be applied by dipping or spraying.|$|E

5000|$|The band {{started in}} 1991 {{under the name}} <b>Glue</b> <b>Gun</b> with {{founding}} members: Jeff Roberts (guitars), Pete Newbury (bass), Mike (drums) and singer Bob Oedy (previously founding guitar player of The Grim). Jeff Edwards replaced Mike and <b>Glue</b> <b>Gun</b> made their first appearance on the [...] "Welcome to Califucknia" [...] compilation put out by Signal Sound Systems Records in 1992. Chris Long (guitars) joined and then the band signed a deal with Posh Boy Records. Posh Boy label owner Robbie Fields first came across the band when asked to check out another Posh Boy signing Das Klown at a small Hollywood club in 1993. Their debut album had already been recorded and was prepped for self-release when Fields urged the band to allow Posh Boy {{to step in and}} re-package the material for commercial release. At the same time, Fields recommended to the band the alternative spelling of Glü Gun, to avoid confusion with a different New Jersey band calling themselves <b>Glue</b> <b>Gun</b> who had already asserted their claim to the name. The album was re-sequenced and eventually released under the title Just Glü It in 1994; the album was only moderately successful. Soon after, the band reverted to using the original <b>Glue</b> <b>Gun</b> spelling.|$|R
50|$|This {{involves}} a machine {{similar to a}} <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> <b>gun</b> used to attach human hair extensions to individual strands of one's natural hair of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch squared sections for a truly authentic look. Another option for fusion attachments is using hair which is pre-tipped with a keratin adhesive. A heat clamp is then used to melt the adhesive to attach the extension hair to the natural hair. Fusion weave allows washing hair frequently {{and the use of}} regular hair products such as hair gels. This technique is very time consuming taking 3 or more hours. They need re-positioning every 2-3 months as the natural hair grows. Due to various chemicals in the glue, which may cause hair loss and scalp irritation, combined with heat, this method is more damaging to natural hair.|$|E

40|$|SCORCHED EARTH CROCODILES Guangchen Zhang Fall 2016 Kee-ho Yuen School of Art and Art History When I went to {{the bookstore}} last summer, I found a book about metal clay jewelry. There are many {{examples}} and tutorial {{about how to make}} jewelry with metal clay which I have never seen or done before. For my honors project, I wanted to study metal clay and explore the uses of this form of metalwork in rendering a 3 D animation figure of a crocodile. However, as I began my project, my instructor felt it would work better to learn how to make a mold to create the crocodile. I choose to create a crocodile because I was inspired and influenced by the character Renekton in the video game called League of Legends. When I first came to America, I was alone and helpless. However, I made some friends and became outgoing and optimistic by playing League of Legends. Renekton is a hero and most honored warrior in his country, and he protected his country, during wartime. I was encouraged by his brave and strong, so I decided to create a crocodile to remind me and encourage me to be courageous later in life. Because I didn 2 ̆ 7 t have an actual crocodile mold for casting, I used clay to form the basic form of the crocodile. When the clay was hard, I fixed the crocodile on a 4 X 4 wooden board with <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> <b>gun.</b> To make the rubber mold, I cover the model with plastic wrap and then 1 / 42 ̆ 2 clay. Then I covered the clay with plaster to create a plaster jacket which helped me hold the mold. After the plaster jacket had cured, I opened the jacket and removed all the clay inside of the jacket. Since the crocodile has too many undercuts and a huge tail, I had to build two parting lines to divide the jacket into three parts. After the plaster had dried, I drilled a hole {{at the top of the}} jacket and three small holes at each piece. Before I poured the rubber in the jacket, I tied the jacket with a belt and secured all gaps with clay. However, I overlooked two important facts, one, that the pressure is higher at the bottom than the top and second, my piece is too big. When I poured the rubber into the jacket, the rubber started to run out. I had to wait for all rubber run out and dry which took about one day. I cleaned the surface of the crocodile and re-poured the rubber into the jacket. I made the crocodile in a solid plastic to bear the weight of the heavy metal armour and the blade. After the figure was complete, I made the jacket with paper first. Then. I drew all the paper armour on one piece of brass, which I sawed and soldered to form the metal armour. To show his ruthlessness, I painted the armour in black and the blade point in blood red. I also painted the crocodile in green and red with oil paint. I enjoyed the process of making the crocodile, and I have learned how to make a silicone rubber mold and how to cast a plastic object. Since I have a silicon mold, I can now explore making more crocodiles in differing styles. I enjoyed this project, and in the future, I plan to look for a job that involves making molds and models for characters or objects...|$|E
