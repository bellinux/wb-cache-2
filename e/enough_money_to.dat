5|$|In 1987, after Laliberté re-privatized Cirque du Soleil, it {{was invited}} to perform at the Los Angeles Arts Festival. Although they {{continued}} to be plagued by financial difficulties, Normand Latourelle took the gamble and went to Los Angeles, despite only having <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> make a one-way trip. Had the show been a failure, the company {{would not have had}} <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> get their performers and equipment back to Montreal.|$|E
5|$|A {{school was}} built in Vietnam in memory of Pryce. His colleagues raised <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> have the school built to leave a lasting legacy in his honour. The primary school opened in 2007. Its cost was met by the Hong Kong office of Pryce's employer, Linklaters.|$|E
5|$|Flashbang Studios {{had planned}} to earn money from {{creating}} casual games {{so that they could}} create a quirky game without having to worry about sales and sustaining the studio. Although the company failed to create a financially successful casual game, by creating software for other companies they managed to acquire <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> undertake an unusual project of their own choosing.|$|E

5|$|This is a {{city that}} doesn't have enough money for basic {{services}} right now and doesn't have <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> protect regular citizens. The question has to be asked whether a full-time bodyguard detail to one alderman who hasn't {{been shown to be}} in any kind of danger {{for more than two decades}} is warranted.|$|E
5|$|Another similar rags-to-riches {{story is}} Pang Lim, {{who was an}} illegal fruit hawker in Sungei Road in the 1970s. His big break came when he saved <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> rent a coffee shop in 1990 with his younger brother and uncle. They rented the stalls out to other hawkers and managed the drinks stall themselves. The {{business}} took off and from one coffee shop, Pang is now the managing director of Koufu, which operates 20 foodcourts, five coffee shops and five cafes around the island.|$|E
5|$|By 1986, {{the company}} was once again in serious {{financial}} trouble. During 1985 they had taken the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response. In Toronto they performed {{in front of a}} 25% capacity crowd after not having <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> properly market the show. Gilles Ste-Croix, dressed in a monkey suit, walked through downtown Toronto as a desperate publicity stunt. A later stop in Niagara Falls turned out to be equally problematic.|$|E

5|$|His first efforts, {{published}} under {{a variety}} of pseudonyms, were cheaply printed potboiler novels. In 1829 he finally released a novel under his own name, titled Les Chouans; it was a minor success, though it did not earn the author <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> relieve his considerable debt. He found fame soon afterwards with a series of novels including La Physiologie du mariage (1829), Sarrasine (1830), and La Peau de chagrin (1831).|$|E
5|$|In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put {{together}} <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> help him leave Gospić for Prague, {{where he was}} to study. He arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he had never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor {{and he did not}} receive grades for the courses.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, the Barr {{campaign}} was sued by libertarian pundit Jim Bovard, {{who was hired}} to ghostwrite {{a book about the}} campaign. Bovard claims he was never paid the $47,000 he was to receive for his efforts. Campaign manager Russ Verney stated that the campaign hoped to raise <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay Bovard, and asked for donations. The ensuing litigation resulted in a judgment entered for Bovard against the Bar 2008 Presidential Committee, Inc., in the full amount of $47,000.00.|$|E
5000|$|Although Mitchell {{inherited}} <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> not <b>to</b> have to work, {{she had an}} adventurous temperament.

5|$|Overall, the Myst {{series has}} been commercially and {{critically}} successful. Rand and Robyn Miller were expecting Myst to {{perform as well}} as previous Cyan titles, making <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> fund the next project. Instead, Myst sold more than six million units, becoming the top-selling PC game of all time until The Sims surpassed its sales in 2002. The first three games in the series have sold more than twelve million copies.|$|E
5|$|Ross felt {{strongly}} that the state should adequately care for its veterans. During his first term, the first Confederate home in Texas was dedicated in Austin. Within two years, the facility {{had run out of}} room, so Ross served as chairman of a committee to finance a relocation to a larger facility. By August 1890, the home had collected <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> move to a larger location.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{prevented}} {{the company from}} going bankrupt that year. The Desjardins Group, which was Cirque du Soleil's financial institution at the time, covered about $200,000 of bad checks. Also, a financier named Daniel Lamarre, who worked {{for one of the}} largest public relations firms in Quebec, represented the company for free, knowing that they didn't have the money to pay his fee. The Quebec government itself also came through again, granting Laliberté <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> stay solvent for another year.|$|E

5|$|When {{a tax cut}} {{passed over}} Buckner's veto in 1890drained the state treasury, the {{governor}} loaned the state <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> remain solvent until tax revenue came in. Later that year, he was chosen as a delegate to the state's constitutional convention. In this capacity, he unsuccessfully sought to extend the governor's appointment powers and levy taxes on churches, clubs, and schools that made a profit.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Barkley went to Emory College (now part of Emory University) in Oxford, Georgia, the {{alma mater}} of several administrators {{and faculty members}} at Marvin. During the 1897–1898 {{academic}} year, he {{was active in the}} debating society and the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, but he could not afford to continue his education and returned to Clinton after the spring semester. He took a job teaching at Marvin College but did not make <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> meet his basic living expenses. He resigned in December 1898 to move with his parents to Paducah, Kentucky, the county seat of McCracken County, where his father found employment at a cordage mill.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Johnson's {{future was}} {{uncertain}} {{because his father}} was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, {{and it is likely}} that Johnson spent much time in his father's bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.|$|E

5|$|In the Republican gubernatorial primary, the Williams-Farmer ticket {{defeated}} businessman Phil Moffett {{and former}} Jefferson County Judge/Executive Bobbie Holsclaw. Williams and Farmer had led in opinion polling {{throughout the entire}} campaign, and neither opposing slate was able to raise <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> engage in statewide television advertising; despite this, Williams and Farmer received only 68,502 votes, 48.2% of those cast. Holsclaw won the voting in her home county of Jefferson, which contains the city of Louisville and is the state's most populous. Moffett, a Tea Party favorite, carried the second most populous county, Fayette (which contains Lexington), as well as heavily-populated Daviess, McCracken, and Warren counties, and several counties in Northern and Central Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Blatty worked {{as the public}} {{relations}} director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and as a publicity director at the University of Southern California. He published his first book, Which Way to Mecca, Jack? in 1960, a humorous look at both his early life, and {{his work at the}} United States Information Agency in Lebanon. In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show You Bet Your Life, winning $10,000, <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.|$|E
5|$|Marge's absence is {{felt at home}} as Homer and {{the rest}} of the family struggles to cope without her. Without Marge, the house shortly becomes a {{complete}} wreck. The annual bake sale also suffers– without Marge's marshmallow squares, the Springfield Park Commission fails to raise <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay for a statue of Abraham Lincoln. Instead they purchase one of Jimmy Carter. The townspeople are enraged by this, and riot. When Marge is released from jail, the townspeople welcome her back and apologize for suspecting her. They even unveil a statue for Marge, though it is just the Carter statue with Marge's hair added to it. The last scene shows Bart and Lisa playing on the statue, which has been converted into a tether ball post.|$|E
