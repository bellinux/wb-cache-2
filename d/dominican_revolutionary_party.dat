Originally sent to evacuate Americans {{in the midst}} of fighting between forces loyal to assassinated dictator Rafael Trujillo and the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> supporting Juan Bosch, President Lyndon B. Johnson expanded the intervention to prevent a second Communist nation on America's doorstep. Joined by the 82nd Airborne Division and the Organization of American States, Marines quickly forced a cease-fire, but would continue to be harassed by small-scale combat and sniper fire until their withdrawal on 31 August. Remaining peacekeepers enforced a truce, and Bosch would never regain power.|$|E
25|$|On 24 April 1965, three junior {{officers}} requested {{a meeting with}} President Donald Cabral Reid. Reid revoked the commission after receiving news of a suspected anti-government plot. When Chief of staff Riviera Cuesta was instead sent to discuss with the officers at the 16 of August military camp, he was immediately detained. A group of military constitutionalists and <b>Dominican</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> (DRP) supporters then seized the Radio Santo Domingo building, issuing calls of sedition, {{at the same time}} constitutionalist officers distributed weapons and molotov cocktails to their civilian comrades. The transmissions prompted the garrison of the 27 of February camp and a unit of the Dominican Navy's frogmen to defect. Large numbers of police officers abandoned their positions and changed into civilian clothing.|$|E
25|$|The country {{came under}} the rule of {{military}} junta until 1963, when democratic elections were organised with the aid of the United States. Juan Emilio Bosch Gaviño emerged victorious in the elections, assuming office. Bosch then tried to implement a number of social democratic reforms, causing the anger of the clergy, business magnates and members of the army, who initiated a rumor campaign accusing Bosch of being a communist. On 25 September 1963, a group of 25 senior military commanders led by Elías Wessin y Wessin expelled Bosch from the country and instated Donald Reid Cabral as the new president. The newly installed president failed to gather popular support, at the same time several factions prepared to launch coups. Those included Constitutionalists under Bosch, a group inside the Dominican army under Peña Taveras, supporters of former <b>Dominican</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> leader Nicolás Silfa and plotters siding with Joaquín Balaguer.|$|E

25|$|Although {{official}} and unofficial {{repression of the}} opposition parties (the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> and National Civic Union, {{as well as the}} communist Dominican Popular Movement) continued, Balaguer publicly condemned this repression and in September he pledged to form a coalition government. Hector and Jose Trujillo left the country in October but the opposition parties demanded Ramfis withdraw from the government as well. At the end of October, Ramfis announced that he would resign if the OAS agreed to lift the economic sanctions. The OAS agreed on November 14 but Ramfis’ uncles returned to the country the following day, hoping to lead a military coup. Ramfis resigned and went into exile on November 17 and rumours circulated that Air Force general Fernando Arturo Sánchez Otero would support pro-Castro revolutionaries. The United States now sent a small fleet of ships and 1,800 marines to patrol Dominican waters. The US consul informed Balaguer that these forces stood ready to intervene at his request, and would be supported by forces from Venezuela and Colombia. Air Force general Pedro Rafael Ramón Rodríguez Echavarría announced his support for Balaguer and bombed pro-Trujillo forces. The Trujillo brothers again fled the country on November 20 and Echavarría became Secretary of Armed Forces.|$|E
500|$|Under the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration, which gained {{power after}} the {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy, the U.S. took a more hardline stance on Latin America—sometimes called the [...] "Mann Doctrine". In 1964, the Brazilian military overthrew the government of president João Goulart with U.S. backing. In late April 1965, the U.S. sent some 22,000 troops to the Dominican Republic for a one-year occupation in an invasion codenamed Operation Power Pack, citing {{the threat of the}} emergence of a Cuban-style revolution in Latin America. Héctor García-Godoy acted as provisional president, until conservative former president Joaquín Balaguer won the 1966 presidential election against non-campaigning former President Juan Bosch. Activists for Bosch's <b>Dominican</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> were violently harassed by the Dominican police and armed forces.|$|E

50|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} the Dominican Republic on 16 May 1994.

2500|$|In 1978 Balaguer sought another term. [...] However, by this time, {{inflation}} {{was on the}} rise, and {{the great majority of}} the people had gotten little benefit from the economic boom of the past decade. [...] Balaguer faced Antonio Guzmán, a wealthy rancher running under the banner of the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party.</b> [...] When election returns showed an unmistakable trend in Guzmán's favor, the military stopped the count. [...] However, amid vigorous protests at home and strong pressure abroad, the count resumed. [...] When the returns were all in, Guzmán handed Balaguer the first loss of his electoral career. [...] When Balaguer left office that year, it marked {{the first time in the}} Dominican Republic's history that an incumbent president peacefully surrendered power to an elected member of the opposition.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the insistence}} of the United States, Balaguer was forced to share power with a seven-member Council of State, {{established}} on January 1, 1962, and including moderate members of the opposition. OAS sanctions were lifted January 4, and, after an attempted coup, Balaguer resigned and went into exile on January 16. The reorganized Council of State, under President Rafael Filiberto Bonnelly headed the Dominican government until elections could be held. These elections, in December 1962, were won by Juan Bosch, a scholar and poet who had founded the opposition Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (<b>Dominican</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party,</b> or PRD) in exile, during the Trujillo years. His leftist policies, including land redistribution, nationalization of certain foreign holdings, and attempts to bring the military under civilian control, antagonized the military officer corps, the Catholic hierarchy, and the upper-class, who feared 'another Cuba'. In September 1963 Bosch was overthrown by a right-wing military coup led by Colonel Elías Wessin {{and was replaced by}} a three-man military junta. Bosch went into exile to Puerto Rico. [...] Afterwards a supposedly civilian triumvirate established a de facto dictatorship.|$|E
