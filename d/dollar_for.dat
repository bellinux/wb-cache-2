40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the incremental cost-effectiveness of the first-line pharmacotherapies (nicotine gum, patch, spray, inhaler, and bupropion) for smoking cessation across six Western countries-Canada, France, Spain, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom. DESIGN AND STUDY POPULATION: A Markov-chain cohort model to simulate two cohorts of smokers: (1) a reference cohort given brief cessation counselling by a general practitioner (GP); (2) a treatment cohort given counselling plus pharmacotherapy. Effectiveness expressed as odds ratios for quitting associated with pharmacotherapies. Costs {{based on the}} additional physician time required and retail prices of the medications. INTERVENTIONS: Addition of each first-line pharmacotherapy to GP cessation counselling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per life-year saved associated with pharmacotherapies. RESULTS: The cost per life-year saved for counselling only ranged from US 190 dollars in Spain to 773 dollars in the UK for men, and from 288 dollars in Spain to 1168 dollars in the UK for women. The incremental cost per life-year saved for gum ranged from 2230 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> men in Spain to 7643 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> women in the US; for patch from 1758 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> men in Spain to 5131 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> women in the UK; for spray from 1935 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> men in Spain to 7969 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> women in the US; for inhaler from 3480 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> men in Switzerland to 8700 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> women in France; and for bupropion from 792 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> men in Canada to 2922 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> women in the US. In sensitivity analysis, changes in discount rate, treatment effectiveness, and natural quit rate had the strongest influences on cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of the pharmacotherapies varied significantly across the six study countries, however, in each case, the results would be considered favourable as compared to other common preventive pharmacotherapies...|$|R

25|$|A rand {{was worth}} US$1.40 {{from the time}} of its {{inception}} in 1961 until late in 1971.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{incremental}} cost {{effectiveness of the}} five first line pharmacological smoking cessation therapies in the Seychelles and other developing countries. DESIGN: A Markov chain cohort simulation. SUBJECTS: Two simulated cohorts of smokers: (1) a reference cohort given physician counselling only; (2) a treatment cohort given counselling plus cessation therapy. INTERVENTION: Addition {{of each of the}} five pharmacological cessation therapies to physician provided smoking cessation counselling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per life-year saved (LYS) associated with the five pharmacotherapies. Effectiveness expressed as odds ratios for quitting associated with pharmacotherapies. Costs based on the additional physician time required and retail prices of the medications. RESULTS: Based on prices for currently available generic medications on the global market, the incremental cost per LYS for a 45 year old in the Seychelles was 599 US <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> gum and 227 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> bupropion. Assuming US treatment prices as a conservative estimate, the incremental cost per LYS was significantly higher, though still favourable in comparison to other common medical interventions: 3712 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> nicotine gum, 1982 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> nicotine patch, 4597 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> nicotine spray, 4291 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> nicotine inhaler, and 1324 <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> bupropion. Cost per LYS increased significantly upon application of higher discount rates, which may be used to reflect relatively high opportunity costs for health expenditures in developing countries with highly constrained resources and high overall mortality. CONCLUSION: Pharmacological cessation therapy can be highly cost effective as compared to other common medical interventions in low mortality, middle income countries, particularly if medications can be procured at low prices...|$|R

25|$|The setup {{involves}} an auctioneer who volunteers {{to auction off}} a dollar bill with the following rule: the bill goes to the winner; however, the second-highest bidder also loses the amount that they bid. The winner can get a <b>dollar</b> <b>for</b> a mere 5 cents, but only {{if no one else}} enters into the bidding war. The second-highest bidder is the biggest loser by paying the top amount they bid without getting anything back. The game begins with one of the players bidding 5 cents (the minimum), hoping to make a 95-cent profit. They can be outbid by another player bidding 10 cents, as a 90-cent profit is still desirable. Similarly, another bidder may bid 15cents, making an 85-cent profit. Meanwhile, the second bidder may attempt to convert their loss of 10 cents into a gain of 80 cents by bidding 20 cents, and so on. Every player has a choice of either paying for nothing or bidding 5 cents more on the dollar. Any bid beyond the value of a dollar is a loss for all bidders alike. A series of rational bids will reach and ultimately surpass one dollar as the bidders seek to minimize their losses. If the first bidder bids 95 cents, and the second bidder bids one <b>dollar</b> (<b>for</b> no net gain or loss), the first bidder stands to lose ninety five cents unless he bids $1.05, in which case they rationally bid more than the value of the item for sale (the dollar) in order to reduce their losses to only five cents. Bidding continues with the second highest bidder always losing more than the highest bidder and therefore always trying to become the high bidder. Only the auctioneer gets to profit in the end.|$|E
