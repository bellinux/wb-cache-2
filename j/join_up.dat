5|$|Pechersky's plan merged {{the idea}} of a mass escape with vengeance: to help as many prisoners as {{possible}} to escape while executing SS officers and guards. His final goal was to <b>join</b> <b>up</b> with the partisans and continue fighting the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|Derrick did not <b>join</b> <b>up</b> {{when war}} broke out in September 1939 but, like many Australians, enlisted {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940. He joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 5 July 1940, and was posted to the 2/48th Battalion, 26th Brigade, as a private. Derrick first joined his unit at the Wayville Showgrounds, before basic {{training}} at Woodside. Derrick thrived on military life, but found discipline difficult to accept.|$|E

5|$|In {{permafrost}} soils with {{an active}} upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, patterned ground can form, creating circles, nets, ice wedge polygons, steps, and stripes. Thermal contraction causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may <b>join</b> <b>up</b> to form polygons and other shapes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the battle, a state of {{confusion}} spread through the French troops. Governor de Vaudreuil, who later wrote to his government and put the full blame for the French rout on the deceased Montcalm, decided to abandon Quebec and the Beauport shore, ordering all of his forces to march west and eventually <b>join</b> <b>up</b> with Bougainville, leaving the garrison in Quebec under the command of Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the retreat}} went awry. The Allied contingents in the centre missed their {{appointed}} position {{and ended up}} scattered in front of Plataea itself. The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding {{the rear of the}} retreat, had not even begun to retreat by daybreak. A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while the Spartans and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin the retreat and if possible <b>join</b> <b>up</b> with the Spartans. However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea, and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began to stir.|$|E

5|$|In 1648, {{during the}} Second English Civil War, Charles moved to The Hague, where his sister Mary and his {{brother-in-law}} William II, Prince of Orange, seemed {{more likely to}} provide substantial aid to the royalist cause than his mother's French relations. However, the royalist fleet that came under Charles's control {{was not used to}} any advantage, and did not reach Scotland in time to <b>join</b> <b>up</b> with the royalist Engager army of the Duke of Hamilton before it was defeated at the Battle of Preston by the Parliamentarians.|$|E
5|$|In late June 1944, {{during a}} {{strafing}} {{attack on a}} railway yard in the Po Valley in northern Italy, Smith was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Parachuting from his aircraft, he landed without serious injury in the Ligurian Alps, {{in an area that}} was behind German lines, but largely under the control of anti-German Italian partisans. Smith spent three months working with the local resistance movement before trekking westwards, across the Maritime Alps, with three other Allied personnel, hoping to <b>join</b> <b>up</b> with the Allied forces that had just invaded southern France. After 23 days' hiking, he and his companions were recovered by American troops and repatriated.|$|E
5|$|Laying {{takes place}} in September and October. A clutch {{of four or five}} white and {{slightly}} shiny eggs, measuring 30 x 24mm, is laid. The incubation period has been recorded as anywhere from 19 to 23 days, with the female performing this duty alone. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down, and are largely helpless (nidicolous). They leave the nest four to five weeks after hatching and <b>join</b> <b>up</b> with other young birds in flocks, though rely on their parents for food for another fortnight after fledging.|$|E

5|$|Monmouth {{learned of}} the {{approach}} of royalist reinforcements and departed, but instead of marching to London, he headed north with his force towards the county of Somerset. On 15 June he fought with the militia at Axminster, taking the town before the militias could <b>join</b> <b>up.</b> More recruits joined his disorganised force, which was now around 6,000, consisting mostly of nonconformists, artisans, and farm workers armed with farm tools (such as pitchforks). One famous supporter was the young Daniel Defoe.|$|E
5|$|On {{the desert}} flank, ASquadron 2RTR's patrol toward Sidi Azeiz was being {{monitored}} by Panzer Regiment5, but the Germans misidentified the light cruiser tanks as heavily armoured Matilda infantry tanks, {{and reported that}} an attack was not possible. Herff—believing the British had two divisions operating in the area—had grown uneasy. ASquadron's patrol was interpreted {{as an attempt to}} concentrate south of Sidi Azeiz, in preparation for a thrust north the next day; such a move threatened to sweep aside Herff's force and completely unhinge the German front in the Sollum–Bardia area. In response, Herff broke contact with the British; his plan was to <b>join</b> <b>up</b> with Cramer's Panzer Regiment8 to mount a concentrated counter-attack the following morning.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{commander}} Sulzbach made {{a tactical}} error in not attacking either Schack or Eberstein {{before they could}} <b>join</b> <b>up,</b> even though his generals urged him to do so. Instead, he chose to withdraw to Nyborg. The Swedish king was not pleased and immediately sent Gustaf Otto Stenbock to relieve Sulzback of his command. When Stenbock arrived he found the city's defenses wanting and sent a note to the king {{that he could not}} guarantee that he would hold the city.|$|E
50|$|At St. Clair, Route 47 meets Interstate 44, before <b>joining</b> <b>up</b> with Route 30. The highway {{now runs}} east with that route for about 8 miles, until {{returning}} south.

5|$|The {{first stage}} of Zeppelin {{commenced}} on 8 February, with threats to Greece and Crete. A provisional date for the supposed invasion was set at 29 March (to {{take advantage of the}} full moon). On 10 March the operation moved to a second stage, where the fictional operation was delayed until April and May to <b>join</b> <b>up</b> with a supposed Soviet invasion of Bulgaria. Stage two was communicated through a sub-plan called Dungloe, involving double agents back in England. The story passed to the Germans was that radio messages would inform friendly leaders in Yugoslavia of the intended invasion dates and any delays.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{ordered that}} the excess baggage {{be taken to}} Burlington where it could be sent to Pennsylvania. The ground had frozen, making it {{possible}} to move the artillery without it sinking into the ground. By midnight, the plan was complete, with the baggage on its way to Burlington and the guns wrapped in heavy cloth to stifle noise and prevent the British from learning of the evacuation. Washington left 500 men behind with two cannon to patrol, keep the fires burning, and to work with picks and shovels to make the British think that they were digging in. Before dawn, these men were to <b>join</b> <b>up</b> with the main army.|$|E

5|$|A Danish {{fleet of}} 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel put to sea in March 1676, and on 29 April his forces landed on Gotland, which surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May with 23 {{warships}} of over 50 guns, 21 {{of less than}} 50 and 16 minor supporting vessels manned by about 12,000 men, but encountered adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then left Visby, the main port on Gotland, to <b>join</b> <b>up</b> with a smaller Danish-Dutch force at Bornholm, between {{the southern tip of}} Sweden and the northern coast of Germany. Together they intended to cruise between Scania and the island of Rügen to stop Swedish troops from landing on the island and reinforcing Swedish Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets fought the indecisive battle at Bornholm. The Swedish force was superior in numbers but was unable to inflict any serious losses, and two of the fleet's fireships were captured, one by the allies and the other by a Brandenburg squadron headed for Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|As {{he builds}} this army to attack Superior Spider-Man, Norman {{takes on the}} new alias of the Goblin King. The Hand ninjas who evaded capture arrive at the sewers and <b>join</b> <b>up</b> with Goblin King's Goblin Underground. The group revels in the news that, thanks to Superior Spider-Man's assault, the Goblin King now owns over the half of New York's {{organized}} crime. He claims he now owns New York City as the Goblin Kingpin of Crime. With the help of Menace, the Goblin King later releases Phil Urich from a prison transport, and upgrades Urich's Goblin armor and weapons. Goblin King asks in return only that Urich dedicate his only identity from here on as the Goblin Knight. Goblin King trains Goblin Knight, anxious to confront Superior Spider-Man. Goblin King later poses as Hobgoblin and is sighted {{by some of the}} Spiderlings.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{in tandem}} with the single-player mode, the online {{multiplayer}} mode Grand Theft Auto Online was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world. Up to 30 players freely roam across the game world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story-driven competitive and cooperative modes). The Content Creator toolset lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs, like racetracks and deathmatch weapon spawn points. Players may band together in organised player teams called crews to complete jobs together. Rockstar Games Social Club extends crews formed in Max Payne 3 multiplayer mode to those of Grand Theft Auto Online. Players may create their own crews and <b>join</b> <b>up</b> to five total. Crews win multiplayer matches to earn experience points and climb online leaderboards.|$|E

40|$|In his {{background}} paper for the Governments and Communities in Partnership conference, Mark Considine (2005) suggests that international change towards {{whole of government}} approaches, partnerships and <b>joining</b> <b>up</b> could be termed ‘network governance’. He characterises this change as both a challenge to traditional bureaucratic thinking, and a deepening of democracy. My focus in this paper is on this notion of democratisation. I will take an analytical and critical look at {{the extent to which}} <b>joining</b> <b>up</b> promotes democracy and challenges the neo‐liberalism and neo‐conservativism that have become internationally dominant in recent years. I will link theory and practice by discussing YP 4, a trial of <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> services for homeless jobseekers in Victoria, Australia...|$|R
