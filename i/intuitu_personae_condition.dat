40|$|Our {{study of}} sixty French {{municipalities}} {{shows that they}} have a tendency to concentrate the management of local public goods under a unique manager. This seems to go against the egalitarian and transparency principles of the European Union for attribution of markets. We show how ??libre administration?? and ?<b>intuitu</b> <b>personae?</b> principles can lead a mayor, who has electoral concerns, to favor a unique manager even though this choice can in fact be inefficient. We also consider the natural limits to this behavior. Classification JEL : D 44, D 72, L 41, L 90. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{spread of}} market {{rationality}} leads to new fertilizations between economic markets and spiritual markets. The paper adresses the legal challenges {{due to a}} deeper renewal of a pluralism of economic legitimacies linked to reference points such as business “ethics,” “culture,” and “participative management. ” What difference should we see between {{the appearance of a}} fast-food restaurant, Quick’s, that prepares meat in accordance with Islamic law and the secular business culture of Coca-Cola? To what extent can an employer decide and state its own “ethics” or “culture,” which for the employer might be of the order of a principle and not of an exceptional adaptation? This normative business perspective does not imply extreme communitarianism nor extreme <b>intuitu</b> <b>personae.</b> Is it possible to address these issues not as arbitrary claims, but as objective reference to a particular ethical project. This claims are often geared toward benefiting minorities, but not only, as shown by the "spiritual" trend in management"...|$|R
40|$|Forgery by its nature, always harms {{the trust}} {{that people are}} forced to have and need to grant {{one another in the}} {{relations}} among themselves or which they should show for the things usually considered as the expression and evidence of truth. While for the offenses committed by violation of trust, this is the rule applied <b>intuitu</b> <b>personae,</b> taking into account the personal condition of the person to whom trust is granted, in forgery crimes trust is given in rem, meaning to the thing per se perceived as being the expression of truth. Thus, we are not in front of a violation of trust given to certain people, but in front of the trust granted to the thing which is assumed legally the characteristic of expressing the truth, but truth which has been altered. This paper aims to be an interdisciplinary approach, starting from the criminological meaning rendered to public trust and up to its legal effects produced, set into criminal or extra-criminal content, an approach derived from applying the method of observation...|$|R
40|$|The {{administrator}} can be {{delegated to}} represent the company in its relations with third parties. The administrator’s powers are manifested on two levels: internally and externally. Thus, the manager is responsible {{with regard to the}} internal management of the company but also to the representation of the company in dealings with third parties. Basically the mandate is granted to the administrator <b>intuitu</b> <b>personae,</b> which excludes the possibility to be substituted for the exercise of the powers conferred. The powers of the manager are not unlimited, being held primarily by the object of the activity, by the hierarchy of organization of the company, by the social interest, by the decisions of the ordinary general assembly, the decisions of the Board or even by the constitutive document. Within the limits of its mandate, the administrator may enter intoconcluding management, conservation and disposal legal documents, required by the activity of the company. For all companies, the legal documents that the administrator concludes in his position of companyrepresentative in his dealings with third parties employ the company...|$|R
40|$|According to the Romanian law {{the debtor}} that faces {{financial}} difficulties {{of a certain}} extent can be {{the object of the}} insolvency procedure, regulated by Law no. 85 / 2006 concerning the insolvency procedure. Because the insolvent debtor is no longer trustworthy to its contractual partners and cannot execute the assumed obligations, there is a risk that these contracts cease, or the services that are incumbent on contractual parties are not executed. This is why, {{it is very important to}} know within the insolvency procedure and, especially during the judicial reorganization period, what will be the treatment of contracts concluded prior to the opening of this procedure and still not executed, the so-called “contracts under execution”. Also, after clarifying the concept of contract under execution, it is important to establish who has the right to opt between their continuation, or their cancellation. On the other hand, there are presented the special rules provided by Law no. 85 / 2006 for some categories of contracts concluded prior to the opening of the insolvency procedure, such as: labor, lease, commission contracts, master of netting agreement or contracts concluded <b>intuitu</b> <b>personae</b> or by a debtor that is the owner of a leased building, etc...|$|R
40|$|Starting from {{a case of}} the {{jurisprudence}} of the Cluj Court of Appeal, {{this study}} probes into the different aspects of the contract of lease for lands pertaining to the State’s private domain (that is, under the Local Council’s management) through which the lessees, in consideration of certain special criteria, procure the right to employ the land for a fixed term of 99 years, in order to build individual housing units. The fundamental issue {{that needs to be addressed}} is whether the lesser can one-sidedly increase the rent due to the fact that a third party buyer, to whom the initial lessee sold the building, failed to comply with the special conditions that led to the initial abatement of rent. It is reasonable to assume that such a decision would be illegal taking into account that the lease contract has a civil nature and not an administrative one (as a result the lesser cannot unilaterally alter the contract) and, on the other hand, the fact that this type of contract does not retain its <b>intuitu</b> <b>personae</b> nature throughout its period of enforcement (considering the provisions under art. 41 of Law no. 50 / 1991 on construction permits), even though that attribute was essential at the moment when the contract was concluded. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} to extend an {{existing}} method, ‘the personas’, {{and to develop}} a ‘dynamic persona’ in a virtual environment. To determine the interest of such a dynamic persona, we compared the influence of dynamic vs static personas in groups composed of two professionals (a designer and an ergonomist) who had to deal with either a dynamic or a static persona, while being engaged in a creative task. Their creative performances were also compared with those of 11 groups of three lay-participants who performed the same task, in the same virtual environment, with the same communication modality (i. e. chat). Moreover, we analysed the quality of collaboration in groups with personas and their level of empathy toward the dynamic or static personas. Results tend to be in favour of the dynamic <b>persona</b> <b>condition,</b> concerning the fluency and originality of ideas, and with regard to quality of collaboration and empathy...|$|R
40|$|To face {{innovation}} {{challenges of}} the twenty-first century, companies should learn from proven successful strategies and draw on technological evolutions as well. Our proposal consists in aligning ideation to innovation strategies {{through the use of}} avatars in a virtual world. On the basis of the Persona method and the Proteus effect, we design avatars’ appearance so as to implement a Needseeker or a Technology-driver innovation strategy. To test the effectiveness of this avatar-mediated innovation tool, we conducted an experiment in a French company. Two groups of highly qualified employees from the innovation department had to find applications for smart windows in public transportation. Both groups experienced immersion in a virtual transportation situation: one group embodied avatars resembling Inventors, whereas the other group embodied Personas representing users of public transportation. As expected, avatars’ appearance proved to influence the creative production: the Inventor condition led to a techno-centered ideation profile, oriented toward technological solutions, while the <b>Persona</b> <b>condition</b> led to more user-centered, needs-oriented ideas. Consistently, Inventors’ production tended to be better evaluated through industrial criteria and Personas’ production tended to be better evaluated by transportation users. We discuss the use of avatar-mediated creativity as a strategic tool for companies seeking to innovate...|$|R
40|$|It is a {{challenge}} to work in a software development project. People with different backgrounds are together working towards the goal of delivering a run able piece of software. The influences to the design are many and all of them will affect how the program will be designed. During this spring we have been involved in a large software engineering project. Our part of the project has been focusing on interface design and using the design method persona. In this bachelor thesis we describe our experiences of participating in a software development project. We will explain how our design work was affected by the organisation of the project and how we have worked with adjusting the method of <b>persona</b> to the <b>conditions</b> given in the project. We will also describe the importance of communicating the design within the project. The main purpose of the report is to show how we during the project have become {{aware of the importance of}} tracing design decisions back to its origin. Many attributes has come to inform our design and this has made us aware of the importance of having a traceability of our work...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{offers a}} new biography of Manuel II Palaiologos (1350 - 1425), attempting to depict him as a ruler, writer and personality. The dissertation is organized as a chronological narrative, each chapter dealing with a time period in Manuel’s life. For the first time, this study offers an in-depth analysis of Manuel’s complete literary, philosophical and theological oeuvre. Some of the key discussions are Manuel’s self-representation and how he adopts various stances and <b>personas</b> under specific <b>conditions,</b> his literary style, the innovations he introduces to topoi and the allusions he makes to Classical authors in order to display his wit and to give different layers of meaning. An attempt is made to gain an insight into Manuel’s thoughts and feelings, his pastimes and his relationships with the literati, family members and foes. This study also strives to envisage Manuel’s surroundings and everyday life, such as his environment in Constantinople and other cities, his travels, the conditions in the campaigns in which he participated, his daily life in the palace, fashions and food. Finally, through an analysis of Byzantine, Western and Ottoman sources, the dissertation studies the political history of the period...|$|R
