Given a constant average propensity to save, rising: money incomes at full employment level would lead to an excess of demand over supply and to a consequent <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap.</b> Thus Keynes used the concept of the <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap</b> to show the main determinants that cause an inflationary rise of prices.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{cyclical}} properties of private asset income taxation in a New Keynesian model with financial frictions. We argue that optimal state-contingent variations in asset income taxation increase welfare, alter the {{monetary policy transmission mechanism}} and insure against liquidity traps. These findings are explained by an endogenous association amongst taxation, the effective {{rate of return}} on assets, the <b>inflationary</b> output <b>gap</b> and credit spreads. Such unique link operates via a working-capital cost channel, and affords the policy maker an additional degree of freedom in stabilizing the economy.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to prove whether inflation dynamics in Indonesia {{can be explained}} by the hybrid model of New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC). Output gap variable and dummy variable are also incorporated in this study as the external shock of the increase in fuel oil prices in 2004. By using a steady state model, it can be concluded that inflation dynamics in Indonesia could be explained by the hybrid model of NKPC. The variable of forward looking has significant effect on inflation dynamics, but the variable of <b>inflationary</b> pressure (output <b>gap)</b> has no significant effect on inflation dynamics. In addition, the increase in fuel oil prices in 2004 also gives pressure on the inflation rate, but when interacting with the variable of inflation (backward and forward), it even reduces its pressure on the inflation rate...|$|R

5000|$|Friedman {{criticized the}} Keynesian <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap</b> {{on the grounds}} that gap {{analysis}} can be used only under special circumstances like wartime. He stated that the analysis did not improve our knowledge of business cycles to a great extent.Bert Hansen criticized Keynes for limiting his analysis of the gap only to the goods market, leaving out the factor market. According to him, the gap is caused due to excess demand in both the goods and factor market. Another drawback of this model is its static nature, which was criticized by Milton Friedman, Eric Lundberg [...] and other economists. Keynes himself recognised this drawback and introduced time lags concerning receipts and expenditure of income. T.Koopmans introduced the idea of the speed of inflation, stating that the <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap</b> reduces as the speed of inflation falls. Another weakness of the theory is that it is concerned only with flow concepts like current income, expenditure, consumption, and saving. However the increase of prices affects not only current goods but also the stock of goods already out in the market. This point is ignored in the theory.|$|E
40|$|The chief {{objective}} of our {{paper is to}} highlight basic features of the Information Technology (IT) policies adopted by Indonesia and Thailand, and to evaluate {{the commitment of the}} monetary authorities and the overall performances of the IT regime. The results demonstrate that the IT regime in these two economies has had some success, but not during {{the immediate aftermath of the}} Lehman Brothers' collapse in the last quarter of 2008. Furthermore, the implementation IT policy in these economies has largely been "flexible" during the stable period, seeking the balance between narrowing the output gap, managing exchange rate volatility, and anchoring inflationary pressure. However during the turbulent period, there had been a heightened focus on anchoring inflationary expectations. <b>Inflationary</b> expectation Output <b>gap</b> Inflation targeting Pass-through Monetary policy rule...|$|R
40|$|After the 1997 {{financial}} crisis, several East Asian economies, {{including the}} Philippines, adopted an inflation-targeting framework. The {{shift in the}} policy stance of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) came with the acknowledgement that a flexible exchange rate framework is better suited to cushioning domestic economic performance from external disturbances than fixed nominal exchange rates. However, many inflation-targeting central banks, including the bsp, have continued {{to intervene in the}} foreign exchange market. This paper evaluates the impact of sterilized intervention using an economy-wide macroeconometric model instead of a partial-equilibrium framework. A loss function is used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} sterilized intervention, the latter being modeled as incorporating the exchange rate in the monetary authority’s reaction function. The key features of the New Keynesian macroeconometric model are as follows : (a) the policy interest rate of the BSP responds to <b>inflationary,</b> output <b>gap,</b> and exchange rate pressures; (b) changes in the BSP policy rate affect changes in the nominal exchange rate based on the uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition; and (c) the nominal peso-dollar rate is an effective transmission mechanism, as both direct and indirect pass-through effects to inflation are relatively above average. Theory indicates that incorporating the exchange rate in the BSP reaction function may lead to unintended consequences. Simulation results show that such a policy has a favorable outcome if the exchange rate also appears in the bsp’s objective function. Otherwise the exchange rate has to be dropped from the reaction function. foreign exchange intervention, monetary policy rule, central bank objective function...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EconomicsSteven P. CassouThis {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays relating to asymmetric preferences in optimal monetary policy models. Optimal monetary policy models are theoretical optimal control problems that seek to identify how the monetary authority makes decisions and ultimately formulate decision rules for monetary policy actions. These models are important to policy makers because they help to define expectations of policy responses by the central bank. By identifying how researchers perceive the central bank’s actions over time, the monetary authority can identify how to manage those expectations better and formulate effective policy measures. In chapter 1, using a model of an optimizing monetary authority which has preferences that weigh inflation and unemployment, Ruge-Murcia (2003 a; 2004) finds empirical evidence that the monetary authority has asymmetric preferences for unemployment. We extend this model to weigh inflation and output and show that the empirical evidence using these series also supports an asymmetric preference hypothesis, only in our case, preferences are asymmetricforoutput. Wealsofindevidencethatthemonetaryauthoritytargetspotential output rather than some higher output level as {{would be the case}} in an extended Barro and Gordon (1983) model. Chapter 2 extends the asymmetric monetary policy problem of Surico (2007) by relaxing the assumption that inflation and interest rate targets are constant using a time varying parameter approach. By estimating a system of equations using iterative maximum likeli- hood, all of the monetary planner’s structural parameters are identified. Evidence indicates that the inflation and interest rate targets are not constant over time for all models esti- mated. Results also indicate that the Federal Reserve does exhibit asymmetric preferences toward <b>inflationary</b> and output <b>gap</b> movements for the full data sample. The results are robust when accounting for changing monetary policy targeting behavior in an extended model. The asymmetry for both inflation and output gaps disappears over the post-Volcker subsample, as in Surico (2007). In chapter 3, Walsh (2003 b) ’s speed limit objective function is generalized to allow for asymmetry of policy response. A structural model is estimated using unobserved compo- nents to account for core inflation and measure the output gap as in Harvey, Trimbur and Van Dijk (2007) and Harvey (2011). Full sample estimates provide evidence for asymmetry in changes in inflation over time, but reject asymmetry for the traditional speed limit for the output gap. Post-Volcker subsample estimates see asymmetry disappear as in a more traditional asymmetric preferences model like Surico (2007) ...|$|R
50|$|The GDP gap or {{the output}} gap is the {{difference}} between actual GDP or actual output and potential GDP. The calculation for the output gap is Y-Y* where Y is actual output and Y* is potential output. If this calculation yields a positive number it is called an <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap</b> and indicates the growth of aggregate demand is outpacing the growth of aggregate supply—possibly creating inflation; if the calculation yields a negative number it is called a recessionary gap—possibly signifying deflation.|$|E
50|$|Obviously, this {{situation}} cannot last forever, {{because there is}} a shortage of labour. The shortage of labour produces the rise of wage rates, which makes the short-run aggregate supply decrease, until it reaches the full-employment level. The short-run aggregate supply decrease makes an upward pressure on the price level, consequently causing inflation. The once created gap between real GDP and potential GDP was the sign of forthcoming inflation, this is another reason this type gap is called an <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{an initial}} {{increase}} in aggregate demand produces inflation (so called demand-pull inflation) and real GDP increase, the price level and real GDP are determined {{at the point}} where the new aggregate demand and the short-run aggregate supply meet. This point is known as above full-employment equilibrium, since the short-run aggregate supply is above the long-term aggregate supply, i.e. above the aggregate supply at full employment. The gap created between real GDP and potential GDP is the consequence of inflation, this is one of the reasons this type of gap is called an <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap.</b>|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of own resources, Spain has to import all of its fossil fuels. Besides, until the 2008 crisis, Spain's recent {{performance}} had shown an inflationary tendency and an <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap</b> compared to other EMU countries, affecting the country's overall productivity. Moreover, when Spain joined the euro zone, it lost the recourse of resorting to competitive devaluations, risking a permanent and cumulative loss of competitivity due to inflation. In a scenario of record oil prices by the mid 2000s this meant much added pressure to the inflation rate. In June 2008 the inflation rate reached a 13-year high at 5.00%.|$|E
50|$|The AD-AS diagram can model {{a variety}} of {{macroeconomic}} phenomena, including inflation. Changes in the non-price level factors or determinants cause changes in aggregate demand and shifts of the entire aggregate demand (AD) curve. When demand for goods exceeds supply there is an <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap</b> where demand-pull inflation occurs and the AD curve shifts upward to a higher price level. When the economy faces higher costs, cost-push inflation occurs and the AS curve shifts upward to higher price levels. The AS-AD diagram is also widely used as a pedagogical tool to model the effects of various macroeconomic policies.|$|E
50|$|The {{main cause}} of the gap is {{considered}} to be expansionary monetary policies carried out by the government. An <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap</b> is a signal that the economy is in the boom part of the trade cycle, resources are being used over their capacity, factories are operating with increasing average costs; wage rates increase because labour is used beyond normal hours at overtime pay rates. A case of the gap can arise when consumer or investor spending is very buoyant, when foreign demand is increasing or when government expenditure increases. According to some economists, such a situation arose in the United States in 1999-2000 and 2006-2007, when the unemployment rate was below 5%. Wages increase {{as a result of the}} increase in aggregate demand which in turn raises business costs. This leads to an increase in prices (inflation) and these higher prices reduce consumer purchasing power, causing aggregate demand to fall and the output gap to close. When the gap is finally eliminated, equilibrium is achieved, with actual GDP equal to potential GDP but at a higher price level. Economists warn that this is not an auto mechanism. Government action in the form of fiscal and monetary policies is a must to close the gap. Monetary policy can be used to contract the money supply in the economy by raising interest rates, which would reduce purchasing power, resulting in falling demand. Keynes, however, was not in favour of monetary methods. He suggested a method of progressive taxation, where the collections from the taxes would be saved and used once equilibrium is achieved in the economy, which he called 'forced savings' Another method is to cut transfer payments and subsidies, thus cutting down consumption.|$|E

Drawing on multi-period data from Japan, the model confirms {{the conventional wisdom that}} the appropriate policy response to an <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap</b> is to increase the interest rate when economic growth accelerates and decrease it when growth decelerates. However, the model indicates that to stabilize a deflationary gap, policymakers should decrease the interest rate when growth accelerates and increase it when growth decelerates. This prescription defies generations of conventional wisdom but fits the historical data remarkably well. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{incorporates}} zakat into {{a simple}} macroeconomic model of an Islamic economy and analyzes {{the role of}} zakat in the national income determination. The reduced form aggregate consumption function suggests that the determinants of consumption are: Zakat expenditure, taxes, income and asset holdings of individuals. Zakat {{could be used as}} a counter-cyclical policy through discretionary and non-discretionary fiscal policy. Discretionary fiscal policy is carried out by varying the disbursement of zakat to the recipients. During the expansion phase of the business cycle, the government reduces zakat expenditure to close the <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap.</b> This action helps increase the zakat surplus, in the Baitul-Mal. Likewise zakat expenditure could be increased by using the zakat surplus accumulated during the boom periods, when the economy is in the down-swing to spur aggregate spending and economic activities. Therefore, zakat could complement taxation and government spending as tools of stablization policy. Fiscal policy, Islamic economy, Zakat. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} econometric {{evidence on}} the effectiveness of targeting inflation {{in order to reduce the}} rate of inflation in Chile in the 1991 - 97 period. This paper shows that the inflation target altered the inflationary dynamic, by following through with out–ofsample forecasts with alternative time series models (ARMA, ARCH, GARCH, and VAR). Second, this paper estimates the Central Bank’s feedback rule by using a semi-structural VAR, which shows that an unexpected and temporal real interest shock can reduce the <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap.</b> However, this paper argues that the strategy of using unexpected and temporary shocks to explain the decline in inflation is misleading. The paper supports this with consideration to the fact that the inflation target was an announced, decreasing, and permanent policy. Third, by using an unrestricted VAR, this paper performs dynamic solutions that assume an exogenous and known path for the inflation target. The results indicate that the decreasing inflation target gradually led inflation to the single-digit range without a drop in output. However, the real appreciation observed during this period and connected with a capital inflow shock was also an important element to explain the decline in the rate of inflation. For example, a dynamic simulation carried out in this paper shows that it was necessary to substitute the PPP rule in order to reach a single-digit inflation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a model that {{circumvents}} the requirement of explicitly setting a period in which the fiscal budget is to be balanced, yet implies that increases in the growth of public debt are bound to increase inflation when there is no perceived commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit. The model is based on a modified version of the cash in advance constraint. The results of numerical simulations suggest that an increase in the growth of debt to finance current consumption leads to an equal increase in inflation. The timing of this increase varies with the size of the deficit and the pace of economic growth. It is shown that small increases in small deficits yield fairly significant increases in inflation.

40|$|Discussion in {{the article}} {{is focused on the}} reform of retail prices {{introduced}} on February 1, 1982. Analysis of changes in a price level and movements of prices in particular range of goods was preceded by a study of premises of the price reform. The following were specified in the group of these premises: the rapid exhaustion of stocks-in-trade in the years 1975 - 1981, a wide employment of fcrign crediting and a slight increase in the domestic market production. At the same time consumer incomes were increasing at a fast rate what caused a bias toward <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap</b> and pressure. The reform of retail prices introduced recently caused a high growth of prices and a reduction of consumers' real incomes. This has also effected a decrease of foodstuffs' subsidies, and subsidies of some non-food products and services, yet these subventions were not altogether eliminated. The prise rises and enacting a category of contract prices has not led to a market equilibrium situation. In case of some products a partial market recovery was observed and also a reduction of line ups in front of stores. Return to a market equilibrium position does not seem probable in view of slight stocks-in-trade, at least in the nearest future. Changes of price level have also effected the standard of living of consumers and caused transformations of a consumption model. The increase of food products' prices resulted in adding to a portion foodstuffs' expenses in all types of households.

40|$|The authors assess {{inflation}} in Czechoslovakia between 1985 and 1991 {{and identify the}} main causes of inflation through a literature survey and empirical studies. The official prices in centrally planned economies were never perceived by central planners to be fully market clearing. Only by coincidence would the overall price level correspond to the level associated with general equilibrium. What is missing in official price indices in centrally planned economies - including {{the consumer price index}} - is suppressed inflation, manifast in queuing for products, forced substitution of demand, and forced savings. Also missing is hidden inflation, associated with practices that disguise price increases behind cosmetic or other change in product quality. The authors argue that inflationary pressures in Czechoslovakia in 1985 - 89 originated mainly in the investment sector. Even though the investment sector was strictly controlled, making it difficult for open inflation to emerge, the scope for inflationary pressures was great in Czechoslovakia. Such pressures arose from a mixture of factors, including poor investment planning, accommodating government finance, and the high priority given to investments and social consumption. For Czechoslovakia, the official price indices show virtually no inflation between 1985 and 1989, when there were long waiting lists for such products as cars and state and cooperative flats. Trends in these price indices do not seem to depend on the method used for constructing them, according to the sensitivity tests conducted by Czechoslovakia's Federal Statistical Office. Obviously, the official price indices failed to capture the full extent of economic disequilibrium in that period. But the extent to which official price indices understated inflationary pressures was not serious in Czechoslovakia, compared with other centrally planned economies. Estimates of hidden inflation for 1985 - 89 range from 0. 5 percent to 2 percent a year in consumer markets and about 3 percent in the industrial sector. Estimates for suppressed inflation were less than 5 percent. The relatively small <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap</b> is indirectly confirmed by the sharp inflation associated with the recent price liberalization that subsided in a relatively short period, and both suppressed and hidden inflations have virtually disappeared. Estimates of hidden inflation were based on benchmark price comparisons between Czechoslovakia and such market economies as Austria. Those for suppressed inflation were based on disequilibrium econometric models of asset holdings and on conjecture tests.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{socio-economic}} situation in Poland in 1980 became {{a point of}} departure for the author's thought. State of economy set the country serious long term tasks of: a) re-orientation of social and economic policies, b) balancing demand and supplies on the market, c) defining the standard of living on the level of real capacities of the country, d) creating an economic model which would secure effectivity and developement of economy to meet increasing needs of the population. Substantial part of the population as well as the striking workers in 1980 did not realize the gravity of situation. The characteristic feature of postulates advanced at that time was that they were resulted not by the study of actual capacities of the national economy, but by the desire to fulfill often basic, material needs of the population, The two blocs of postulates ratified in the post-strike agreements were quite contrary to the economic situation of Poland. The first group of desiderata referred to increase of fages and social pecuniary benefits (at the existing market disequilibrium). The second group of postulates concerned reductions in worktime and earlier retirements for some social groups. Most of the agreements in the respect of population income increases were realized; yet, higher income not justified by adding to effectiveness of work were one of the reasons which affected augmenting of <b>inflationary</b> <b>gap.</b> In most of the cases the postulates pertaining to reductions in worktime and earlier retirements were materialized. The state was not prepared for so rapid reforms though. As a result production fell e. g. in the important industry of mining. All in all implementation of agreements in the scope of social policies could not produce a lot, contrary to execution of the postulates pertaining to citizens' liberties, freedom of speech and writings etc. The experience of the early 1980 's can induce certain conclusions for the future, their implementation can yield positive results and secure future growth of the living standard, by the developement of social infrastructure, among others. Conclusions are the following: 1. The social policies have to be always based on real possibilities of the state and to attribute to its growth. Their goal is to distribute produced goods and services in just and socially accepted way, instead of distributing fiat money without coverage. 2. Limited material possibilities require in turn to define a clear hierarchy of fulfilled needs and to indicate social groups concerned. 3. A distinct division has to be drawn between goods and services distributed within a scheme of social consumption and goods and services consummed directly by persons concerned as individual consumption. Failure to do so became one of the reasons of emergence of high social inequalities in Poland of 1970 's. 4. Another question is to include the whole society in social policies, and distribution of consumption funds; the system of authoritarian social policies broke down as its preferences could not suit the society.
