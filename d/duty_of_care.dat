5|$|The Defective Premises Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons as a private member's bill by Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971, and given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972, coming into force as the Defective Premises Act 1972 on 1 January 1974. The Act establishes a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> builders and their sub-contractors owe to the occupiers of property they construct or modify, and also establishes a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> landlords hold towards their tenants and any third parties who might be injured by their failure to maintain or repair property. The Act received a mixed reaction from critics; while some complimented it on its simple nature compared to the previously complex common rule laws, others felt that it was too limited for what was desired to be achieved, and that the wording used was at times both too vague and too specific.|$|E
5|$|The Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 (c. 31) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} occupiers' liability. The {{result of the}} Third Report of the Law Reform Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' Liability Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, coming into force on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> owed {{to them by the}} occupier, as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> It also covered the duty owed to parties to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding the liability for visitors. The Act introduced an element of liability for landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. The Act is still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' liability in English law along with the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} the bizarre facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in torts class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E

The general law on liability for omissions also applies to batteries, for example those of the continuing act (as in Fagan v MPC) and of a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> However, in R v Ireland the court ruled out psychological injury {{by means of a}} telephone as a form of battery, although it was not an important point in the case as other charges were brought.

5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{development in}} American corporate {{law is the}} recent explicit recognition, {{in a series of}} Delaware cases, that corporate managers owe a fiduciary <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> good faith in addition to their traditional <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and loyality. The <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> good faith was not created by those cases. On the contrary, the duty has long been explicit under the statutes and has also long existed implicitly in the case law. Nevertheless, the explicit recognition <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> good faith in recent Delaware cases shines a spotlight on that duty, and therefore makes it especially important to develop the contours <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> and to examine the duty from a normative perspective. Briefly, the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> good faith in American corporate law is comprised of a general baseline conception and specific obligations that instantiate that conception. The baseline conception consists of four elements: subjective honesty, or sincerity; nonviolation of generally accepted standards of decency applicable to the conduct of business; nonviolation of generally accepted basic corporate norms; and fidelity to office. Among the specific obligations that instantiate the baseline conception are the obligation not to knowingly cause the corporation to disobey the law and the obligation of candor even in non-self-interested contexts. Turning to the normative issue, there are several basic reasons why the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> good faith is desirable. To begin with, the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and loyalty do not cover all types of improper conduct by managers, because certain kinds of improper managerial conduct fall outside the spheres <b>of</b> those <b>duties.</b> Most <b>of</b> these types of conduct fall within the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> good faith. Furthermore, various rules limit a manager 2 ̆ 7 s accountability under the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and loyalty, and these limiting rules should be and are inapplicable to conduct that violates the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> good faith. Moreover, the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and loyalty characteristically (although not invariably) function as platforms for liability rules, while the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> good faith characteristically (although not invariably) functions as a condition to the application of rules that do not in themselves impose liability. This difference in characteristic function makes it desirable to treat good faith separately from care and loyalty. Finally, the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> good faith provides a principled basis for the courts to develop new specific fiduciary obligations that come to be seen as appropriate in response to changes in social and business norms, and in the general understanding of efficiency and other policy considerations that are applicable to corporate law, but cannot be easily accommodated within the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> or loyalty...|$|R

5|$|Sections 21–23 {{cover the}} review of agents and the {{liability}} of trustees for agents actions. Section 21 identifies that review and liability occurs when the trustees appoints agents, nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument. Section 22 provides a duty on trustees who delegate their powers, with the duty consisting of three elements. Firstly, trustees are required {{to make sure that}} agent is suitable for the job he is employed to do. Secondly, they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it. Thirdly, trustees are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it. Section 23 establishes trustees' liability for the actions of agents; a trustee is liable for negligence if he violates the general <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> set out in Section 1, but not otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The plaintiff, Helen Palsgraf, {{was taking}} her daughters to the beach in August 1924. As two men {{attempted}} to board a train before hers, one (aided by railroad employees) dropped a package that exploded, causing a large coin-operated scale on the platform to hit her. After the incident, she began to stammer, and subsequently sued the railroad, arguing that its employees had been negligent while assisting the man, {{and that she had}} been harmed by the neglect. In May 1927 she obtained a jury verdict of $6,000, which the railroad appealed. Palsgraf gained a 3–2 decision in the Appellate Division, and the railroad appealed again. Cardozo wrote for a 4–3 majority of the Court of Appeals, ruling that there was no negligence because the employees, in helping the man board, did not have a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> to Palsgraf as injury to her was not a foreseeable harm from aiding a man with a package. The original jury verdict was overturned, and the railroad won the case.|$|E
5|$|Palsgraf {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the legal world quickly. Dean William L. Prosser of the University of California Law School wrote that the Appellate Division's decision fell into the hands of Professor Francis H. Bohlen of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Bohlen was at that time the Reporter compiling the first Restatement of Torts for the American Law Institute (ALI), and Cardozo was informally one of the advisers. In that task, Bohlen was having difficulty dealing with the concept of <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> in negligence, especially involving unforeseeable plaintiffs, and Prosser related that Cardozo was treated to a learned discussion by the other advisers of a case that might come before his court and, convinced by the arguments, used them to decide Palsgraf. Kaufman doubted this story, which was told to Prosser by Dean Young B. Smith of Columbia, noting that the only meeting of the advisers between the two appeal decisions in Palsgraf took place in New York on December 12–13, 1927, beginning only three days after the Appellate Division ruled, and the notes reveal that Cardozo was absent; the chief judge was hearing arguments all that week in Albany. Nevertheless, the discussions and materials from the Restatement compilation likely influenced Cardozo in his decision.|$|E
40|$|This paper recasts an old {{objection}} to the will theory {{in the light of}} recent attempts to defend that theory, notably by Nigel Simmonds and Hillel Steiner. It enlists the idea <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> care-effectively restrictions over legal officials' discretionary exercise of powers-to form a dilemma for such theorists: either legal officials' discretion over powers is restricted by <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for the unempowerable, or it is not. If their discretion is unrestricted, then the will theory is insensitive to the (values of the) lives of the unempowerable, in virtue of the fact that these lives are viewed as not meriting direct normative consideration. If, on the other hand, their discretion is restricted by <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> then the will theory has no argumentative resources within its conceptual apparatus to ascribe or justify them. It is therefore incomplete as a theory of rights. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B. V...|$|R

5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E
