5|$|The Amami rabbit {{also faces}} huge threats from the {{invasive}} predators, being {{a major cause}} for the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> size. On the island of Amami, the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was released to control the population of a local venomous snake, and its numbers have increased dramatically. This mongoose, along with feral cats and dogs, are outpreying the Amami rabbit.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} several Neolithic burial chamber sites, {{as well as}} the remains of Duke Hakon's 13th-century house dating from the Norse {{occupation}} of the island. The population reached 380 or more in the nineteenth century, when a fishing station was opened at Crabbaberry in West Voe. Subsequently, there was a steady <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population,</b> although the numbers have increased from a low of 16 in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|As Tikal and its {{hinterland}} reached peak population, {{the area}} suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> levels.

5|$|During the 1930s, {{parts of}} the state began {{suffering}} the consequences of poor farming practices, extended drought and high winds. Known as the Dust Bowl, areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population,</b> dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl.|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd centuryBC, Roman {{territory}} saw {{an overall}} <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population,</b> partially {{due to the}} huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes into lower classes of the census and the proletarii. As a result, both the Roman society and its military became increasingly proletarianised. The Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers {{at the expense of}} the state, since many of the soldiers who made up its lower classes were now impoverished proletarii in all but name, and were too poor to afford their own equipment.|$|E
5|$|With {{only a small}} local {{population}} during medieval times, {{as a result of}} the introduction of industry, mass migration of village workers into Oldham occurred, resulting in a population change from under 2,000 in 1714 to 12,000 in 1801 to 137,000 in 1901 In 1851 its population of 52,820 made Oldham the 12th most populous town in England. The following is a table outlining the population change of the town since 1801, which demonstrates a trend of rapid population growth in the 19th century and, after peaking at 147,483 people in 1911, a trend of general <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> size during the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|There were <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> and <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> {{growth from}} 1900 to 1930, and from 1940 to 1970. These periods {{related to the}} {{migration}} of people from rural to urban areas for work, especially as mechanization reduced the need for agricultural laborers. In addition, these time periods related to the Great Migration of African Americans out of the Jim Crow South to northern and midwestern industrial cities for more opportunities. The African-American population became highly urbanized. Expansion of the railroads, auto and steel industries provided new work opportunities in the early 20th century.|$|R

5|$|Congregation Beth Israel {{experienced}} decline {{along with}} the rest of the city and state's Jewish community. The Jewish population in Mississippi peaked in 1927 at 6,420 and has since decreased steadily. By 2001, only 1,500 Jews remained in the state. Children of the original Jewish immigrants – mostly merchants – were more interested in going to college to become professionals than taking over family businesses. The rise of national retail chains pressured many Jews to move to larger cities, leaving empty storefronts to line streets of smaller cities that were once economic centers. As of 2006, there were thirteen Jewish congregations left in the state, and only two still had a full-time rabbi. Meridian as a whole has also seen a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population.</b> Between the censuses in 1980 and 2000, the city's population declined over 16% from 46,577 to 39,968.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{the green}} rosella was rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species. This {{was on the}} basis of its large range—greater than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)—and small rate of <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population.</b> The King Island {{subspecies}} is listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as vulnerable, and its population thought to number fewer than 500 birds. Around 70% of King Island's native vegetation has been cleared, and the remainder is highly fragmented and at risk of too-frequent bushfires. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E
5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, {{at least in the short}} term. In 217 BC, near the beginning of the Second Punic War, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century BC, Roman territory saw an overall <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population,</b> partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes.

40|$|<b>Declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> of {{wild animals}} are often natural cyclic {{phenomena}} {{that may be}} dependent on food supply, weather conditions, environmental changes or other factors. The population decreases are usually transient and breeding animals and offspring revert to previous numbers within several years. The impact of man in reducing habitats of animals, mainly forests, has caused a gradual <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> of many animals, mainly birds. Birds have also been particularly affected by the introduction by man of synthetic chemicals into the environment, often in large quantities, some with prolonged persistence. Populations of 52 % of all migratory raptors are threatened by habitat loss, 21 % by environmental contaminants, and 31 % by direct persecution; 30 % are threatened by two of these factors and 8 % by all three (Zalles and Bildstein, 2000). <b>Population</b> <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> raptors Catastrophic <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> of many raptor species and in breeding success were noted {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century throughout much of the developed world.

5|$|The road {{improved}} Independence's economy, since coaches often {{stopped there}} on the multi-day journey. However, the year of its construction {{would turn out to}} be the settlement's economic peak year. Gold production dropped off after 1884. Independence's <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population,</b> remote location and severe high-altitude winters cost it the opportunity to be seat of newly formed Pitkin County to Aspen, located on a larger plain further down the river and growing much more rapidly due to the Colorado Silver Boom. When a rail connection was made to that city in 1888, the stage road fell into disuse, further hurting Independence's economy. All but one of the remaining residents decamped as a group to Aspen on improvised cross-country skis during the severe winter of 1899. The holdout, J.R. Williams, remained until 1920. The nearby Williams Mountains were named for him.|$|E
5|$|This species {{grows in}} at least 2 {{distinct}} sub-populations, {{both of which are}} well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years {{as a result of the}} availability of inexpensive clones from tissue culture. I believe that these days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.|$|E
5|$|However, by {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the {{quarries}} slowly fell into disuse and by the 1960s all of the remaining industrial areas had closed and the quarries infilled, though the sandstone properties at St Alban's Place and Co-Operative Terrace stand as a reminder to Windy Nook's industrial history. The decrease in employment opportunities led to a steady <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> and although some housing developed along Stone Street and Coldwell Lane, the urban sprawl that enveloped most of the outlying settlements of Gateshead during the early 20th century never reached Windy Nook, so that in 1945 it remained largely unchanged in location and size. Despite some terraced housing being built in at Crossfield Park and Coltsfoot Gardens in the 197080's, the character of the suburb today remains suburban; the land is split 50/50 between residential properties and open green space and only 11.3% of the residential properties today are council housing. The result is that Windy Nook is a high-demand area for privately owned and social housing.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} several decades, {{biologists}} have grown increasingly concerned about <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> of two species of sage-grouse (Centrocercus spp.), a bird whose range covers a vast portion of eleven western U.

Recent <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> numbers of this bird across its range have generated concern among landowners and state wildlife officials that the bird may be listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Sage-grouse local working groups (LWGs) have emerged as a centerpiece of a voluntary effort to address <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> sage-grouse <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> the Intermountain West.

5|$|The great spotted kiwi, great grey kiwi, or roroa (Apteryx haastii) is {{a species}} of kiwi endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. The great spotted kiwi, {{as a member of}} the ratites, is flightless. It is the largest of the kiwi. The rugged {{topography}} and harsh climate of the high altitude, alpine, part of its habitat render it inhospitable to a number of introduced mammalian predators, which include dogs, ferrets, cats and stoats. Because of this, populations of this species have been less seriously affected by the predations of these invasive species compared to other kiwi. Nonetheless, there has been a 43% <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> in the past 45 years, due to these predators and habitat destruction. This has led it to be classified as vulnerable. There are less than 16,000great spotted kiwis in total, almost all in the more mountainous parts of northwest Nelson, the northwest coast, and the Southern Alps. A minority live on island reserves.|$|E
