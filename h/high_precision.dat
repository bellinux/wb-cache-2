5|$|Praseodymium {{has only}} one stable and {{naturally}} occurring isotope, 141Pr. It is thus a mononuclidic element, and its standard atomic weight can be determined with <b>high</b> <b>precision.</b> This isotope has 82 neutrons, a magic number that confers additional stability. This isotope is produced in stars through the s- and r-processes (slow and rapid neutron capture, respectively).|$|E
5|$|For many {{practical}} purposes, {{light and}} other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant space probes, {{it can take}} minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing {{the study of the}} history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the theoretical maximum speed of computers, since information must be sent within the computer from chip to chip. The speed of light can be used with time of flight measurements to measure large distances to <b>high</b> <b>precision.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under the {{assumption}} of equal population variances, the pooled sample variance provides a <b>higher</b> <b>precision</b> estimate of variance than the individual sample variances. This <b>higher</b> <b>precision</b> can lead to increased statistical power when used in statistical tests that compare the populations, such as the t-test.|$|R

5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very <b>high</b> <b>precision.</b> A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to the IK Pegasi system can be measured directly by observing the tiny parallax shifts of this system (against the more distant stellar background) as the Earth orbits around the Sun. This shift was measured to <b>high</b> <b>precision</b> by the Hipparcos spacecraft, yielding a distance estimate of 150 light years (with an accuracy of ±5 light years). The same spacecraft also measured the proper motion of this system. This is the small angular motion of IK Pegasi across the sky because of its motion through space.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was questioned}} by François Therrien and colleagues (2005), {{who found that}} the biting force of Carnotaurus was {{twice as high as}} that of the American alligator, which may have the strongest bite of any living tetrapod. These researchers also noted analogies with modern Komodo dragons: the flexural strength of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly, indicating that the jaws were not suited for <b>high</b> <b>precision</b> catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey. As a consequence, according to this study, Carnotaurus must have mainly preyed upon large animals, possibly by ambush.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the spacecraft's orbit and facilitate maneuvers, sixteen Sun sensors – eight primaries and eight backups – are placed around the spacecraft to calibrate solar direction relative to the orbiter's frame. Two star trackers, digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued stars, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and attitude. A primary and backup Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), provided by Honeywell, measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring-laser gyroscopes. These systems are all critically important to MRO, as it must be able to point its camera to a very <b>high</b> <b>precision</b> in order to take the high-quality pictures that the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft, so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.|$|E

50|$|Javas strictfp keyword enables strict floating-point {{calculations}} for {{a region}} of code. Strict floating-point calculations require that even if a platform offers <b>higher</b> <b>precision</b> during calculations, intermediate results must be converted to single/double. This ensures that strict floating point calculations return exactly the same result on all platforms. Without strict floating point a platform implementation is free to use <b>higher</b> <b>precision</b> for intermediate results during calculation. C# allows an implementation for a given hardware architecture to always use a <b>higher</b> <b>precision</b> for intermediate results if available, i.e. C# does not allow the programmer to optionally force intermediate results to use the potential lower precision of float/double.|$|R
