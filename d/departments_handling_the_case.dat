50|$|He {{suspended}} {{his private}} practice in 1969 to accept the post of Deputy Attorney General of the United States. This gave him responsibilities relating to the government's suit against ITT. Nixon and his aide John Ehrlichman told him to drop the case; this created a presumption that they were violating their obligations under legal ethics, and that, as an attorney himself, Kleindienst was obligated to report these ethical lapses to the state bars in the jurisdictions involved. In his official role he also repeatedly told Congress no one had interfered with his <b>department's</b> <b>handling</b> of <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} report are {{presented}} {{the results of}} the clinical and statistical observations conducted on the hemomyelogram of various leukemias occurring in the Chugoku-Shikoku District, with a special reference to the comparative studies carried on the bone marrow of patients treated in our <b>department,</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> in which bone-marrow tissue culture was conducted and those without the tissue culture separately. It is to be noted that chronic lymphocytic leukemia is not included in the present study as the number of such cases was to small. 1. In every leukemia generally immature cells are markedly increased in number; in acute leukemia blast cells occupy the major proportion; and in chronic leukemia young leucocytes in various stages of maturation are mixed. 2. Judging from <b>the</b> hemomyelogram, all <b>cases</b> of monocytic leukemia seems to occupy an intermediate position between acute leukemia and chronic leukemia. Hence it is difficult to divide it definitely as an acute leukemia or a chronic one. 3. It is worthy of attention that monocytic leukemia in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> given no bone-marrow tissue culture occupies only 9. 8 per cent of the total leukemia, whereas the same in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> given <b>the</b> bone-marrow tissue culture occupies as much as 45. 5 per cent of the total leukemia. Namely, it is to be noted that without the bone-marrow tissue culture {{it is often difficult to}} diagnose monocytic leukemia correctly and it is often mistaken for other leukemias, especially for acute myelogenous leukemia...|$|R
50|$|Between Brian's {{disappearance}} {{and his own}} death, Randy Shaffer {{joined the}} families of other missing adults in Ohio in lobbying the state legislature {{to pass a bill}} establishing a statewide protocol for such <b>cases.</b> At <b>the</b> time Brian disappeared, it was left up to individual <b>departments</b> how to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases,</b> and some parents felt that investigations into their relatives' disappearances had suffered as a result. By the time Randy died, the bill had become law.|$|R

After a thorough investigation was promised by Attorney General Eric Holder, Perez went to Florida, meeting with U.S. Attorney Robert O'Neil, family members of Trayvon Martin, and local officials to investigate whether the shooting was a racially motivated hate crime. The Justice Department launched a probe into Sanford police chief Bill Lee, who was fired two months after the beginning of the investigation.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> police <b>department's</b> <b>handling</b> of <b>the</b> Strauss-Kahn <b>case</b> {{was heavily}} criticized {{in his native}} France. Élisabeth Guigou, who as French {{minister}} of justice in 2000 had lobbied successfully for {{the passage of a}} law that forbids the publication of any images of an identifiable defendant in handcuffs who has not yet been convicted, criticized the walk, stating: [...] "I found that image to be incredibly brutal, violent and cruel...I don't see what the publication of images of this type adds." [...] Another former member of the French cabinet, Jack Lang, Minister of Culture in the early 1980s, likened the perp walk to a lynching. French Senator Jean-Pierre Chevènement, a longtime acquaintance of Strauss-Kahn's, wrote on his blog that [...] "The heart can only contract before these humiliating and poignant images...A horrible global lynching! And what if it were all a monstrous injustice?" [...] The French newspaper Le Monde editorialized: [...] "When one of the world's most powerful men is turned over to press photos, coming out of a police station handcuffed, hands behind his back, he is already being subjected to a sentence which is specific to him...Is it necessary that a man's fame deprive him of his presumption of innocence in the media? Because if they must assuredly be equal before the justice system, all men are not equal before the press." ...|$|R

Mitrice Richardson was a 24-year old African American woman who was released from the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department {{in the middle of the}} night without any means of fending for herself.
