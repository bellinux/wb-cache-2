5|$|Malaria <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> disease {{commonly}} associated with poverty: some evidence {{suggests that it is}} also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was {{a major factor in the}} slow economic development of the American southern states.|$|E
5|$|Archie is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} come home to him as she is the woman he loves. Peggy says she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> sweet and {{innocent}} old lady and that he has no idea whom he is messing with. She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has ever done. He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits him on the head.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Unni, Babu, Shaji, Shenoy, and MLA meet atop an {{apartment}} building to discuss {{the circumstances surrounding the}} gold they smuggled into Kozhikode and lost to an ambush while in transit from the airport. They suspect Ramesh is involved since he disappeared right after the incident. They devise a plan to kidnap Jayanthi in order to force Ramesh to return the gold. An unsuspecting Raju and Jayanthi become the targets of their surprise attack in which Jayanthi is rendered unconscious. Raju draws his concealed handgun and foils the kidnapping by shooting at his assailants. He collects the unconscious Jayanthi and transports her to a safe place. When she awakens, she finds herself surrounded by strangers. She also discovers that Raju <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> taxi driver rather he is part of an investigation to find Ramesh and the missing gold. Raju explains to her that Ramesh was involved in the smuggling, and has since become the target of the criminals. Jayanthi returns to Rekha's home for safety, and Chandrasekharan begins investigating Raju who, in a turn of events, has raised suspicion.|$|E

5|$|The earthly authority, whose {{words and}} actions should be cleaved to both in life (agriculture) and death (funerals), is called to minaa (an aluk priest). Aluk <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> belief system; it is a {{combination}} of law, religion, and habit. Aluk governs social life, agricultural practices, and ancestral rituals. The details of aluk may vary from one village to another. One common law is the requirement that death and life rituals be separated. Torajans believe that performing death rituals might ruin their corpses if combined with life rituals. The two rituals are equally important. During the time of the Dutch missionaries, Christian Torajans were prohibited from attending or performing life rituals, but were allowed to perform death rituals. Consequently, Toraja's death rituals are still practised today, while life rituals have diminished.|$|E

25|$|Similar to {{the issue}} of a point of {{reference}} is the issue of orientation: a displacement in 2 or 3 dimensions <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> length, but is a length together with a direction. (This issue does not arise in 1 dimension, or rather is equivalent to the distinction between positive and negative.) Thus, to compare or combine two dimensional quantities in a multi-dimensional space, one also needs an orientation: they need to be compared to a frame of reference.|$|E

25|$|Another {{recommended}} {{technique is}} from the Satipatthana Sutta, which outlines the practice of mindfulness, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> formal meditation, but a skill of attentive awareness and self monitoring. In developing mindfulness, one is advised {{to be aware of}} all thoughts and sensations that arise, even unwanted or unpleasant ones and continuously attend to such thoughts. Eventually, through habituation and exposure, the intensity and unpleasantness of such thoughts will disappear. Buddhist texts also promote the training of positive emotions such as loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity.|$|E
25|$|Passing {{laws that}} remove the few checks against mistreatment of prisoners {{will not help}} us win {{the battle for the}} hearts and minds of the {{generation}} of young people around the world being recruited by Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. Authorizing indefinite detention of anybody the Government designates, without any proceeding and without any recourse—is what our worst critics claim the United States would do, not what American values, traditions and our rule of law would have us do.

The flexibility of the line also means {{it is designed to}} help execution of offensive operations as rearguard and provide fire support to moving friendly groups. The necessary infrastructure elements have been built and multiple small rapid units were available (skier, rider and cyclist grousps mainly) with strength from platoon to company size.|$|E
