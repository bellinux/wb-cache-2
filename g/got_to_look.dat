500|$|Blink-182 was the band's first {{release on}} Geffen, which absorbed sister label MCA Records in 2003. Prior to it dissolving, MCA had {{attempted}} to penalize the band for breaking stipulations in their contract {{that they would have}} an album out by a specific quarter. MCA had previously rushed the band into recording Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, but the band had much more freedom with Geffen. [...] "Geffen came down and heard three songs and they said, 'This is the best record you've ever done, this is the record of your career, take as much time as you want, call us when it's done.' It just completely outlined the perspective of putting accounting before creative, and when you're in the entertainment business, you've got to put creative first. It's an art, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at it like an art, treat it like an art, and then you'll get the best product in the long run." ...|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{opened his}} junior season, {{and his first}} year under coach Pat Chambers, on November 5, 2011 in an {{exhibition}} game against Slippery Rock. He led the team in scoring with 19 points. Frazier also posted 7 assists and 6 rebounds, helping Penn State win the game 64–47. He {{took part in the}} Nittany Lions' first regular season contest on November 12 against Hartford, with 12 points, 6 assists, and 5 steals in spite of being given 28 minutes on the court. When asked on his communication with Frazier, Chambers said, [...] "I'm telling him to make plays... he has to be one of our leading scorers. He's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to score." [...] In the following game, Frazier made his second career display with 20 or more points. He also matched his career-high total on assists, with 10. This was his second double-double with Penn State. Frazier also finished with 6 rebounds, 3 steals, and 1 block. Chambers said in a post-game interview, [...] "I'm very greedy. I'm an old point guard, so I want more out of Tim Frazier, if you can imagine... what more means is even more leadership, even better habits. We're always trying to create the best habits we can for the most difficult situation.". Frazier helped power the 62–46 victory over Radford, the team's second consecutive win in the regular season. It was also Penn State's first round game in the Hall of Fame Tip Off tournament. In his next game against LIU-Brooklyn, Frazier scored a career-high 26 points and matched his assists record for the second straight game, with 10. It was his second-straight double-double and the third in his stint with Penn State. Chambers commented after the game, [...] "Tim was terrific. He was a great leader tonight. He did everything you ask your point guard to do tonight." [...] He helped the program reach a 3–0 record {{for the third time in}} 12 seasons. Following up on a loss to Kentucky, Frazier recorded 27 points on November 20, 2011 against South Florida. The next game, Frazier recorded a career-high 11 assists en route to his 4th double-double in 2011. On January 11, 2012, Frazier scored a career-high 30 points against Nebraska, with his team losing the game, 70–58. He led the Big Ten with eight 20-point games through the course of the year. By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 18.8 points, 6.2 assists, 4.7 rebounds, 2.4 steals, and 0.2 blocks. It was his highest scoring average with Penn State. He was named the John Lawther Team MVP, Second Team NABC All-District, All-Big Ten First Team, Academic All-Big Ten, Basketball Times' All-District, and Big Ten All-Defensive Team.|$|E

5000|$|Edden {{continued}} his fiddle playing throughout his adult life. At this point he {{was regarded as}} one of the best fiddlers from West Virginia. He won many fiddle contests. People would visit at odd hours just to hear him play, and on some occasions, people would have him play music over the phone while the neighborhood listened in. Other anecdotes appear from this era, such as how Edden would show up somewhere to play music, and would carry his fiddle in a flour sack (with the flour still inside it). His nephew, Currence, recalls when [...] "Edden just walked over to the corner and picked up the flour poke and they all <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> what he was getting. He pulled that old fiddle out and flour all over it. He dusted it off, blowed it off, you know. Some of them went to laughing and hollering about that flour. 'Upon my honor,' Edden said, 'that's just as good as the best cases every made,' he said, 'that flour makes her play good.'" ...|$|R
