5|$|The {{inaugural address}} was a <b>detailed</b> <b>statement</b> of the Whig agenda, {{essentially}} {{a repudiation of}} Jackson and Van Buren's policies. Harrison promised to reestablish the Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency (Henry Clay's American system); to defer to the judgment of Congress on legislative matters, with sparing use of his veto power; and to reverse Jackson's spoils system of executive patronage. He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government.|$|E

25|$|Gould's {{campaign}} was ultimately successful and Congress canceled the subsidy. Owed {{a million dollars}} by Pacific Mail, Roach was now in financial difficulty himself as nervous creditors began calling for immediate settlement of their debts. Roach bluffed {{his way out of}} the crisis by declaring his readiness to settle any debt within three days of receiving a <b>detailed</b> <b>statement.</b> But he now had to decide whether to foreclose on Pacific Mail in order to secure at least some of his investment in the ships, or to renegotiate the payment plan. He chose the latter, accepting Pacific Mail's old ships for their scrap value as part payment, and reducing its monthly payment obligation from $75,000 to $35,000. Roach was embittered by the affair, but ironically, his handling of the crisis increased his reputation as a businessman able to deal with adverse circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Because India {{does not}} permit a rape victim's name to be published, the victim was called [...] "Nirbhaya", which means fearless, because of her efforts to fight off her rapists and her insistence on making a <b>detailed</b> <b>statement</b> to the police before she died. However, {{following}} the death of their daughter, the parents were quoted in several media articles as saying they had no objections to using their daughter's name. [...] In the film the father states he is [...] "happy" [...] to reveal her name, Jyoti Singh Pandey, and on 5 March the father was quoted as saying he thought [...] "everyone should watch the documentary, which showed 'the bitter truth' about attitudes to women in India". Even still, on 6 March, the news outlet The Hindu ran an article [...] "Father objects to revealing gangrape victim’s name in 'India's Daughter'" [...] in which they quoted the father as saying that he planned to take legal action because her name was used.|$|E
500|$|When {{early in}} 1962, the police {{questioned}} Josiffe {{about the alleged}} theft of a suede jacket, Thorpe persuaded the investigating officer that Josiffe was recovering from mental illness, and was under his care. No further action was taken. In April 1962 Josiffe obtained a replacement National Insurance card which, he later said, was retained by Thorpe who had {{assumed the role of}} his employer. This was denied by Thorpe, and the [...] "missing card" [...] remained an ongoing source of grievance for Josiffe. He began to feel marginalised by Thorpe, and in December 1962, in a fit of depression, confided to a friend his intention to shoot the MP and commit suicide. The friend alerted the police, to whom Josiffe gave a <b>detailed</b> <b>statement</b> of his sexual relations with Thorpe, and produced letters to support his story. None of this evidence impressed the police sufficiently for them to take action, although a report on the matter was added to Thorpe's MI5 file.|$|E

2500|$|The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) {{was modeled}} on RCA. That {{bill would have}} {{established}} a Council on Environmental Quality {{in the office of}} the President, declared a national environmental policy, and required the preparation of an annual environmental report. President Nixon signed NEPA into law on January 1, 1970. The law created the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in the Executive Office of the President. NEPA required that a <b>detailed</b> <b>statement</b> of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment. The [...] "detailed statement" [...] would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement (EIS).|$|E

2500|$|Campbell, however, {{had little}} luck {{overcoming}} the tremendous antipathy toward Mulroney, despite a substantial bounce from the leadership convention. Chrétien saw an opportunity, and on September 19, released the entire Liberal platform. The 112-page document, Creating Opportunity, quickly {{became known as}} the Red Book because of its bright red cover. It was a very specific and <b>detailed</b> <b>statement</b> of exactly what a Chrétien government would do in office. The Red Book gave the Liberals the reputation as the party with ideas, since none of the other parties had anything comparable. Paul Martin, the man who led the team that produced the Red Book was less complimentary about the Red Book in private as during his time in office as Finance Minister, he was often reported to have said: [...] "Don't tell me about the Red Book, I wrote the damn thing, and I know that it is a lot of crap!".|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Jan Karski, who {{had been}} serving as a courier between the Polish {{underground}} and the Polish government in exile, was smuggled into the Warsaw Ghetto and reported to the Polish, British and American governments on the situation of Jews in Poland. In 1942 Karski reported to the Polish, British and US governments {{on the situation in}} Poland, especially the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto and the Holocaust of the Jews. He met with Polish politicians in exile including the prime minister, as well as members of political parties such as the Polish Socialist Party, National Party, Labor Party, People's Party, Jewish Bund and Poalei Zion. He also spoke to Anthony Eden, the British foreign secretary, and included a <b>detailed</b> <b>statement</b> on what he had seen in Warsaw and Bełżec. In 1943 in London he met the then much known journalist Arthur Koestler. He then traveled to the United States and reported to President [...] In July 1943, Jan Karski again personally reported to Roosevelt about the plight of Polish Jews, but the president [...] "interrupted and asked the Polish emissary about the situation of... horses" [...] in Poland. He also met with many other government and civic leaders in the United States, including Felix Frankfurter, Cordell Hull, William Joseph Donovan, and Stephen Wise. Karski also presented his report to media, bishops of various denominations (including Cardinal Samuel Stritch), members of the Hollywood film industry and artists, but without success. Many of those he spoke to did not believe him and again supposed that his testimony was much exaggerated or was propaganda from the Polish government in exile.|$|E

25|$|Another view of {{negotiation}} comprises four elements: strategy, process, tools, and tactics.

Processes and tools include the steps to follow and roles to take in preparing for and negotiating with the other parties. Tactics include more <b>detailed</b> <b>statements</b> and actions and responses to others' statements and actions. Some add to this persuasion and influence, asserting that these have become integral to modern day negotiation success, and so should not be omitted.|$|R

5000|$|One of the {{key issues}} in the case was that the trades in {{question}} had not been made by Vizard, but instead by a company called CTI, of which Vizard's accountant Gregory Lay was the sole shareholder and director.

5|$|Meher Baba's teachings can roughly {{be divided}} into two main categories: his metaphysics {{on the nature of the}} soul and the Universe, and {{practical}} advice for the spiritual aspirant.
