500|$|Another {{basic concept}} is the charge pump, {{a version of}} which is shown schematically in figure 6. [...] The charge pump capacitor, CP, is first charged to the input voltage. [...] It is then {{switched}} to charging the output capacitor, CO, in series with the input voltage resulting in CO eventually being charged to twice the input voltage. [...] It may take several cycles before the charge pump succeeds in fully charging CO but after steady state has been reached it is only necessary for CP to pump {{a small amount of}} charge equivalent to that being supplied to the load from CO. [...] While CO is disconnected from the charge pump it partially discharges into the load resulting in ripple on the output voltage. [...] This ripple is smaller for higher clock frequencies since the <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> is shorter, and is also easier to filter. [...] Alternatively, the capacitors can be made smaller for a given ripple specification. [...] The practical maximum clock frequency in integrated circuits is typically in the hundreds of kilohertz.|$|E

The influences of the air inlet temperatures and velocities have been investigated on the charging/discharging time of the PCM panels, heating/cooling load and effectiveness over the phase transition. These parameters play a vital on determining thermal performance of an air-PCM unit. Air inlet temperatures of 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C and air inlet velocities of 0. 6 m/s, 1. 6 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. have been studied. The increase of the air inlet velocity reduced the charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>time,</b> however not linearly. The time for the complete melting and solidification is substantially reduced when the velocity has been increased from 0. 6 m/s to 1. 6 m/s.

Next we show {{that even if the}} average discharge current remains the same, different discharge current profiles (distributions) may result in very different battery lifetimes. In particular, the maximum battery life is achieved when the variance of the discharge current distribution is minimized.
