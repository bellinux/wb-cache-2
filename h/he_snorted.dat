60|$|The {{only way}} in which Carrots's reply to this remark can be described, is by saying that <b>he</b> <b>snorted.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>snorted</b> defiantly. I {{noted with}} weary {{resignation}} that the breeze had got lighter while he raved. He {{was at it}} again.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Mark Boat's mad--stark ravin' crazy," [...] <b>he</b> <b>snorts,</b> {{returning}} to command. [...] "She says there's a bad blow-out ahead and {{wants me to}} pull over to Greenland. I'll see her pithed first! We wasted {{an hour and a}} quarter over that dead duck down under, and now I'm expected to go rubbin' my back all round the Pole. What does she think a postal packet's made of? Gummed silk? Tell her we're coming on straight, George." ...|$|R
5000|$|You want {{an inkling}} of how grim things are for black kids right now, try and find another current rap record that manages to mean a damn thing without {{slipping}} into gangsta suicide or Afrocentric cryptoracism. Since this one sank faster than Public Enemy, maybe it doesn't mean much either, but to me the East Flatbush trio radiates the hope hip hop was full of not so long ago. There's deep pleasure in their vocal tradeoffs and hard, wryly textured tracks. There's wordwise grace in rhymes that balance B-movie fantasy against everyday brutality without denial or despair. And there's joy in the nonpareil skills of reformed backward rapper Chip Fu. He coughs, <b>he</b> hiccups, <b>he</b> <b>snorts,</b> <b>he</b> stutters; he whinnies, wheezes, wows, and flutters.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{a shadow}} he casts over the sky!' said the King, a young man, whose divine right was never {{questioned}} by his female subjects. 'What a commotion in the waters, {{and what a}} wind <b>he</b> <b>snorts</b> forth! It certainly must be the largest fish that exists. I remember my father telling me that a monstrous fish once got entangled among our rocks, and {{this part of the}} island really smelt for a month; I cannot help fancying that there is a rather odd smell now; pah!' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>snorted,</b> as the billows snort [...] In {{darkness}} of the night; Betwixt his lean locks tawny-swart, [...] He glowered on the sight.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>snorted.</b> [...] "Wayland! If he gets past {{us without}} being called 'pasty' he's in luck. He's a 'lunger' {{if there ever}} was one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shan't I disturb his Holiness?" [...] said Penfentenyou heavily. [...] "Perhaps 'my sort of questions,"' <b>he</b> <b>snorted,</b> [...] "mayn't be {{discussed}} except at midnight." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{after two}} minutes of shamed and childish longing to sneak home <b>he</b> was <b>snorting,</b> [...] "Certainly I wasn't trying to get chummy with her! Knew there was nothing doing, all the time!" [...] and he ambled in to dance with Mrs. Orville Jones, and to avoid Louetta, virtuously and conspicuously.|$|R
5000|$|That night, Fat Mike buys a green powdery {{substance}} from a drug dealer, and <b>he</b> <b>snorts</b> a line with Limo and Kent in their hotel room. All of them begin to experience hallucinations, and Fat Mike declares he's [...] "never been so fucked {{up in his}} entire life." [...] He calls Melvin's hotel room and asks Melvin for help, but Melvin ignores him. Fat Mike goes up to Melvin's room and begins knocking on the door, but Melvin continues to ignore him. Finally, feeling guilty, Melvin heads down to Fat Mike's room, and Mike explains to him that his current situation is similar to when Melvin smoked PCP in 1985. Limo encourages Melvin to try the {{powdery substance}}, much to Mike's chagrin, and Melvin does half a line while Mike declares [...] "you just made the worst decision of your life." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, Cross revealed that <b>he</b> had <b>snorted</b> {{a small amount}} of cocaine at the 2009 White House Correspondents' Dinner. Cross said, [...] "It wasn’t like I got high...It was just about being able to say that I did it, that I did cocaine in the same room as the president." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>snorted</b> once more, causing {{me to feel}} {{rather like}} royalty {{receiving}} a twenty-one gun salute from the fleet. I can't remember ever having met a better right-and-left-hand snorter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We'll 'ave the 'ole church {{picked to}} pieces at this rate,' said the clerk. 'You shouldn't 'ave done it, {{and it was}} very wrong.' <b>He</b> <b>snorted</b> and shook his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Two watches on {{a single}} yardarm and unable to put a reef in a {{handkerchief}} like that!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>snorted.</b> [...] "What'll it be if we're off here a month?" ...|$|E
60|$|As he went down, the steer {{appeared}} {{to realize the}} man's helplessness, and with a weird <b>snort</b> <b>he</b> rushed forward, the lasso becoming tangled up on the front leg as he advanced.|$|R
2500|$|In an April 2007 {{interview}} for NME magazine, music journalist Mark Beaumont asked Richards what {{the strangest thing}} <b>he</b> ever <b>snorted</b> was, and quoted him as replying: [...] "My father. I <b>snorted</b> my father. <b>He</b> was cremated and I couldn't resist grinding him up {{with a little bit}} of blow. My dad wouldn't have cared ... It went down pretty well, and I'm still alive." ...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2007, Beaumont {{found himself}} at the centre of a media storm when NME {{magazine}} published his now-infamous interview with Keith Richards. Beaumont had asked Richards what the strangest thing <b>he</b> had ever <b>snorted</b> was, and quoted him as replying: ...|$|R
60|$|Hardly had I {{got rid of}} my charge {{than the}} bull came for me again. The trick I had played on him only served to {{increase}} his rage, and <b>he</b> <b>snorted</b> loudly.|$|E
6000|$|He flipped {{into bed}} with a solemn back-somersault and a ludicrous kick of his heels as he tucked his legs under the blankets. <b>He</b> <b>snorted,</b> [...] "Lord no! I never begrudge any man a nickel he can get away from me--fairly." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{seemed to}} want the owner, so I fled, distraught with fear, To the Main Drain sewage-outfall while <b>he</b> <b>snorted</b> in my ear-- Reached the four-foot drain-head safely and, in {{darkness}} and despair, Felt the brute's proboscis fingering my terror-stiffened hair.|$|E
60|$|Now as ill {{luck would}} have it, each of the twins wore a red shirt-waist. This color enraged the bull, and with a wild <b>snort,</b> <b>he</b> lowered his horns and rushed at the pair, as if to gore them through and through.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pilkington <b>snorted.</b> <b>He</b> {{had endured}} much and was {{prepared}} to endure more, but he drew the line at squandering his money on {{the man who had}} sneaked up behind his brain-child with a hatchet and chopped its precious person into little bits.|$|R
5000|$|Kilbey {{states that}} he [...] "loved" [...] heroin when <b>he</b> first <b>snorted</b> it and {{continued}} to use the drug while living in a Surry Hills, Sydney home that doubled as a recording studio. Kilbey then made the transition to injecting the drug {{with the assistance of}} a fellow heroin user who was a deregistered doctor, and he explained to McMillen that he also became fascinated in the culture surrounding the use of the drug—upon reflection, Kilbey described a [...] "rubbish world".|$|R
6000|$|... “Wolf Larsen!” <b>he</b> <b>snorted</b> {{a moment}} later. “Listen to the word, will ye! Wolf—’tis what he is. He’s not black-hearted like some men. ’Tis no heart he has at all. Wolf, just wolf, ’tis what he is. D’ye wonder he’s well named?” ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{seemed to}} want the owner, so I fled, distraught with fear, [...] To the Main Drain sewage-outfall while <b>he</b> <b>snorted</b> in my ear-- [...] Reached the four-foot drain-head safely and, in {{darkness}} and despair, [...] Felt the brute's proboscis fingering my terror-stiffened hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lonely," [...] <b>he</b> <b>snorted.</b> [...] "Gosh all hemlock, Allen, it ain't half as lonely {{as it used}} ter be, not by a jugful. Why, I {{remember}} the time ye could ride fer days an' days an' see nuthin' but buffalo or some other wild critters." ...|$|E
60|$|He was right. In a {{few minutes}} the horse backed into the snow-drift. Finding his hind-quarters imprisoned by a power that was too much even for his obstinacy to overcome, <b>he</b> gave another <b>snort</b> and a heavy plunge, which almost {{unseated}} his young rider.|$|R
40|$|Warning: Spoiler Alert! Some unforeseeable {{events in}} the movie, Flight, will be {{revealed}} in this review. Readers {{who have not yet}} seen the movie are forewarned. It’s just an ordinary day when the main character, commercial pilot William “Whip” Whitaker (played by Denzel Washington), wakes up after a long night of heavy drinking in a nondescript hotel room with a naked flight attendant (his coworker and apparent romantic interest, Trina Márquez). It’s an ordinary day when <b>he</b> <b>snorts</b> a few lines of cocaine to help negate the effects of alcohol before heading to the airport to fly a plane carrying 96 passengers and six crew members on a 52 -minute flight from Orlando, Florida, to Atlanta, Georgia. It’s an ordinary day when, after successfully flying through extreme turbulence, he chats nonchalantly with the passengers over the public address system, while discretely pouring three shots of vodka into his orange juice. It’s an ordinary day, until [...] . all hell breaks loose, and the plane dramatically crashes to the earth, killing two crew members and four passengers. In the hospital immediately following the crash, as Whip is just waking up from unconsciousness, his union representative says, “The way you landed that plane was nothin...|$|R
60|$|Minute by {{minute the}} hours wore away, and with every minute Ernest's indignation grew deeper and deeper. At last <b>he</b> heard the <b>snort</b> of the steam-launch {{ploughing}} its way lustily down the river, {{and he stood}} on the bank waiting for the guilty Harold to disembark.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had to wait}} a tedious {{hour before}} she saw a flivver {{rattling}} up with the garage man, who wasn't a man at all, but a fourteen-year-old boy. <b>He</b> <b>snorted,</b> [...] "Rats, you didn't need to send for me. Could have made it perfectly safe. Come on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Presently, however, Kaptein {{began to}} get restless. First <b>he</b> <b>snorted,</b> then {{he got up and}} snorted again. I could not make it out, so like a fool I got down off the waggon-box to have a look round, {{thinking}} it might be the lost oxen coming.|$|E
6000|$|... "You dink I vos noddings put a poy, hey!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>snorted.</b> [...] "I show you, ain't it! You pig loafer!" [...] And he ran Pold {{up against}} a {{partition}} and got the iron bar directly under the rascal's throat so that the fellow {{was in danger of}} strangling.|$|E
60|$|The gift {{of hiding}} private emotion and keeping up {{appearances}} before strangers is not, as many suppose, entirely {{a product of}} our modern civilization. Centuries before we were born or thought of there was a widely press-agented boy in Sparta who {{even went so far}} as to let a fox gnaw his tender young stomach without permitting the discomfort inseparable from such a proceeding to interfere with either his facial expression or his flow of small talk. Historians have handed it down that, even in the later stages of the meal, the polite lad continued to be the life and soul of the party. But, while this feat may be said to have established a record never subsequently lowered, there is no doubt that almost every day in modern times men and women are performing similar and scarcely less impressive miracles of self-restraint. Of all the qualities which belong exclusively to Man and are not shared by the lower animals, this surely is the one which marks him off most sharply from the beasts of the field. Animals care nothing about keeping up appearances. Observe Bertram the Bull when things are not going just as he could wish. <b>He</b> stamps. <b>He</b> <b>snorts.</b> <b>He</b> paws the ground. He throws back his head and bellows. He is upset, and he doesn't care who knows it. Instances could be readily multiplied. Deposit a charge of shot in some outlying section of Thomas the Tiger, and note the effect. Irritate Wilfred the Wasp, or stand behind Maud the Mule and prod her with a pin. There is not an animal on the list who has even a rudimentary sense of the social amenities; and it is this more than anything else which should make us proud that we are human beings on a loftier plane of development.|$|R
5000|$|A {{new unit}} manager named Martin Querns comes to Em City, {{empowering}} Adebisi, Pancamo, and Morales. He allows {{them and their}} followers to do as they wish {{as long as there}} is no violence in Em City. Drugs, therefore, flow freely, and Basil, along with Browne and Tidd, are pressured to entice [...] "babies" [...] (new customers) to buy drugs. Basil uses the money he brought to Oz to pretend to find his [...] "babies." [...] <b>He</b> meanwhile <b>snorts</b> the heroin that he buys, since he has become a full-blown addict.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} well to tell me not to worry," [...] she cried. [...] "How can I help worrying? Fillmore's simply a baby, and he's just playing the fool. He has lost his head completely. And I can't stop him! That is the awful part of it. I {{used to be able}} to look him in the eye, and he would wag his tail and crawl back into his basket, but now I seem to have no {{influence}} at all over him. <b>He</b> just <b>snorts</b> and goes on running round in circles, breathing fire." ...|$|R
