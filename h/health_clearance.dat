Based on psychological evidence and practice, it is recommended that any response to asylum seekers should include; • Prioritising the rights of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers including rights to safe haven, security and nurturance of their ethnic and cultural beliefs/values and identity, as these are all essential for psychological health. • Meeting Australia’s obligation under the UN Refugee Convention by upholding the fundamental right of refugees to seek protection by adopting a fair refugee status determination process. • Only use immigration detention as a short-term option, for as long as is needed to enable appropriate security and <b>health</b> <b>clearances</b> to be completed. • Detention should not take place offshore or in remote locations • Community-based alternatives to detention should be prioritised. • Children should not be detained. • Adequate mental health and other services to all asylum seekers and refugees, recognising that remote high security detention facilities outside of the migration zone inevitably compromises the ethical delivery of psychological services. Recognising the likely harm caused to asylum seekers who are issued with temporary visas or subjected to conditions that prolong the assessment of their refugee claims and/or restrict access to supports and services.

This report describes 2 patients with CF admitted for pulmonary exacerbations who were enrolled in an inpatient study to assess patient satisfaction and utility of MBW to measure LCI. Diagnostic testing indicated that these patients were infected with EV-D 68. Although their FEV 1 % improved to their previous baseline following treatment for pulmonary exacerbation, it was discordant with LCI.

40|$|Asbestos-containing {{materials}} {{in place in}} buildings, especially sprayed-on asbestos, are still an important <b>health</b> threat. <b>Clearance</b> of these materials has to be operated by specifically trained workers wearing specific individual protection suits after containment of the contaminated area. Good work practices are, however, not always applied. We report the case of two workers hired for ∼ 1 week to remove sprayed-on amosite asbestos during the remodeling of a former industrial hall. Regulatory protective equipments were not used. A legal action was initiated after disclosure of the working conditions. Medical examinations were performed 18 and 22 months after exposure. Workers denied any other asbestos exposure. Lung function tests and chest computed tomography scans were normal. Very high levels of asbestos fibers and bodies were discovered on mineralogical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) by phase contrast light microscopy and analytical electron microscopy. All fibers were amosite. An extrapolation considering duration of exposure, breathing pattern, and BALF fiber content suggests that the workers were exposed to airborne fiber concentrations {{in the range from}} several tens to about a hundred World Health Organization fibers per milliliter air. In conclusion, exposures to historical airborne fiber levels prevailing half a century ago may still occur today when the work regulations are not applied. In these conditions, even very short exposures may result in considerable lung fiber retention in case of amphibole exposure with the subsequent risk for developing asbestos-related diseases. Fiber analysis in BALF is useful to clarify such exposures. © 2011 The Author. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Although the partitioning of the HLW work in NMSS and the non-HLW work in RES generally causes no major problems, more coordination between the two offices is needed on issues that overlap the HLW and non-HLW areas. ! The HLW program needs to be expanded to have a modest long-term, “anticipatory ” research component, perhaps through collaboration between NMSS and RES. ! The Analytical Hierarchy Program used by RES to prioritize projects fails to account properly for the importance of waste-related research; the prioritization method should be revised to overcome this failure. 2 !
