40|$|Abstract: Residual {{stress in}} green compact is an {{important}} factor to influence the quality of the compact and corresponding powder metallurgy product. To understand the residual stress, a finite element model is set up to simulate the single and <b>double</b> <b>action</b> <b>pressing,</b> unloading and ejecting of powder compacting process. Results show that compaction type has significant influence on the rule of residual stress state and the <b>double</b> <b>action</b> <b>pressing</b> is more helpful {{to reduce the risk of}} cracking than the single action pressing. Also better lubricant condition is beneficial to improve residual stress in the green compact...|$|E
40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{production}} process of bi-layered ceramics tiles, formed from two layers with different densities - dense and porous - and with adjustable thickness. The novel production method comprises a <b>double</b> <b>pressing</b> <b>action,</b> fast and easy to implement industrially, that ensures {{the development of a}} perfect interface bonding between layers. The bi-layered ceramic tile is formed by an upper layer with density similar to a conventional porcelain stoneware tile, and a porous bottom layer, which promotes weight reduction of the product maintaining suitable mechanical strength. The introduction of porosity is achieved by means of the incorporation of pore forming agent - polypropylene (PP) - into the ceramic formulation, which undergoes complete and non-harmful thermal decomposition during firing. For comparison, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was also tested as porogen. The rapid and complete combustion of PP is suitable for fast-firing ceramic products, such as porcelain stoneware. In addition, the polymer decomposition does not induce defects in the ceramic pieces, and is environmentally acceptable. The produced tiles are lighter than conventional porcelain stoneware tiles, thus decreasing their transport and distribution costs. Additionally, the thermal attenuation provided by the porous layer could be valuable in innovative applications, such as ventilated facades. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
