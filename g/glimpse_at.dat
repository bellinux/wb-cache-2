5|$|Myst co-creators and {{brothers}} Rand and Robyn Miller often created fictional worlds and stories as young children. Their vision was refined by {{the works of}} fantasy and science fiction writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov; Star Wars offered them a <b>glimpse</b> <b>at</b> an exciting, fully realized fictional world. Younger brother Robyn began working on a children's novel called Dunnyhut; though he never completed the work, elements from the story influenced aspects of Mysts story.|$|E
5|$|The same {{model was}} used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through dry ice and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor <b>glimpse</b> <b>at</b> the end of Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual {{in that it is}} one of the very few episodes not to begin with a reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E

25|$|In 1918 Fraina was {{responsible}} for the first post-revolutionary collection of the writings of V.I. Lenin and Leon Trotsky to be published in the United States. The book, entitled The Proletarian Revolution in Russia, gave English-speaking readers their first <b>glimpse</b> <b>at</b> the ideas of the Russian Communist Party and spurred the desire for emulation on the part of many American radicals.|$|E
25|$|Storm chasing {{then reached}} popular culture in three major spurts: in 1978 with the {{broadcast}} of {{an episode of}} the television program In Search of...; in 1985 with a documentary on the PBS series Nova; and in May 1996 with the theatrical release of Twister which provided an action-packed but distorted <b>glimpse</b> <b>at</b> the hobby. Further early exposure to storm chasing encouraging some in the weather community resulted from several articles {{beginning in the late}} 1970s in Weatherwise magazine.|$|E

25|$|But {{the year}} would show a <b>glimpse</b> <b>at</b> the future: a band from La Plata called Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, with their comical costumes and nervy fast tempos, started performing. 1977 {{was a year}} of one-year wonders: Soluna (Gustavo Santaolalla's 2nd group), with their {{electric}} folk, and Orion's Beethoven, a progressive band that played since 1969 but had their moment of fame eight years later. Neither band sustained their popularity into 1978. Bubu with their album Anabelas was 1978's one-year wonder.|$|E
25|$|As {{parts of}} Jazz Track and Jazz at the Plaza, respectively, the 58 Sessions chronicled the {{transition}} from the brawny agitation of Milestones, to the cerebral tranquility of Kind of Blue. The recording sessions also became known as a stepping stone in Davis' move from bebop to modal jazz. The live side in particular was seen by critics as a <b>glimpse</b> <b>at</b> the sextet that would record Kind of Blue. The complimentary and seemingly spontaneous style of performance ethic and the relationship between Davis and his musicians was fundamental for his work during these sessions and improved onto the Kind of Blue sessions.|$|E
25|$|The Malvern Roller Mill {{was added}} to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 4, 1995 because of its local {{significance}} in the areas of industry and commerce. The building operated as a grinding mill for farmers and the nearby community of Malvern from its construction until it closed in 1942. It is the only known mill in northwestern Illinois that retains all of its equipment for an all roller and no grindstone process. If the millrace and turbines are clean the mill could operate as it did when it was in business. The Malvern Roller Mill provides a <b>glimpse</b> <b>at</b> the complexity of late 19th century milling operations.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Sanford Hall's construction, plume-hunting for the {{millinery}} trade had brought many coastal bird species {{to the brink of}} extinction, most notably the great egret. Frank Chapman was a key figure in the conservation movement that emerged during this time. His dioramas were created with the intention of furthering this conservationist cause, giving museum visitors a brief <b>glimpse</b> <b>at</b> the dwindling bird species being lost in the name of fashion. Thanks in part to Chapman's efforts, both inside and outside of the museum, conservation of these bird species would be very successful, establishing refuges, such as Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge, and eventually leading to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.|$|E
25|$|As the Dravanians {{prepare to}} resume their siege of Ishgard, Alphinaud {{suggests}} that they use Lady Iceheart to broker peace with Nidhogg through negotiation. Estinien offers his lance to aid this endeavor, promising to slay the great wyrm if words come to blows. Iceheart reveals that she too possesses the Echo {{and used it to}} <b>glimpse</b> <b>at</b> the truth behind the war. Born Ysayle, she took the name Iceheart after communing with the soul of Shiva, the mortal woman whose love for the great wyrm Hraesvelgr allowed man and dragon to coexist peacefully for two hundred years. Yet the Elezen grew envious of the dragons' power and conspired to steal Nidhogg's eye, the source of his strength. This, she claims, is the origin of the Dragonsong War. Aiming to avoid further bloodshed, Ysayle agrees to take the party to parley with Hraesvelgr for his aid in ending the war.|$|E

500|$|Mark Davies, the {{political}} reporter for BBC News Online, criticised the script's bias towards Brown and Sheen's apparently negative performance; [...] "Michael Sheen at first plays Blair {{in the style}} of Spitting Images David Steel puppet: bounding along next to his far superior colleague like an over-eager puppy. The actor later transforms Blair into something more sinister and cynical [...] Think Rik Mayall's Alan B'stard." [...] As with other critics, Davies admired Morrissey's performance, singling out the actor's grasp of Brown's physical tics. For the Daily Express, James Rampton singled out the balance of drama and humour. Upon broadcast in the United States—and in retrospect of The Queen—The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert called it [...] "tightly written and effectively acted, and yet it still plays more like a docudramatic re-creation than a Shakespearean <b>glimpse</b> <b>at</b> brotherly tension." [...] Of Morrissey, Gilbert wrote [...] "He brings depth to Brown, a Scot, as a moody, private workaholic whose passion is in ideas and not in performing to the public." ...|$|E

500|$|Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy {{gave the}} episode a four star review, stating that it {{provided}} [...] "another {{example of a}} resoundingly triumphant ending that conveys so much via [...] simple image".

Ian Berriman of SFX was more mixed, giving the episode three stars and comparing it to a re-written version of the series one episode [...] "Captain Jack Harkness". He felt that though the episode provided a [...] "likeably girlish side of Torchwood’s blandest character" [...] the characterisation did not add enough depth. Berriman acknowledged the [...] "sweet, surprisingly subdued, almost coy" [...] tone as an indicator of the programme's flexibility, but added that he [...] " [...] the show when it’s full-blooded and outrageous." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 gave a critical review, feeling that Toshiko and Tommy had [...] "no chemistry" [...] and that the episode seemed to convey that [...] "men die for women's wiles". She felt that despite the flaws of the romance plot, the episode provided some [...] "powerful stuff" [...] and that Tommy's plight was a strong concept if poorly resolved.|$|E
