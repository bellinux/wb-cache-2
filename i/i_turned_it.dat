500|$|Cagney's next notable {{role was}} the 1955 film Love Me or Leave Me, his third with Day. Cagney played Martin [...] "Moe the Gimp" [...] Snyder, a lame Jewish-American gangster from Chicago, a part Spencer Tracy had turned down. Cagney {{described}} the script as [...] "that extremely rare thing, the perfect script". When {{the film was}} released, Snyder reportedly asked how Cagney had so accurately copied his limp, but Cagney himself insisted he had not, having based it on personal observation of other people when they limped: [...] "What I did was very simple. I just slapped my foot down as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> out while walking. That's all".|$|E

But subsequently, Cissé was linked with a return to the English Premier League with Blackburn Rovers, Wigan Athletic, Tottenham Hotspur, Portsmouth and Bolton Wanderers said to be interested. Manchester City had their approach for Cissé rejected by Marseille boss, who said, [...] "He is wanted, that is for sure, I myself have been approached by Manchester City (about Cissé) but <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down categorically". On 26 January 2008, Cissé scored a hat-trick in Marseille's 6–1 win against Caen.|$|E
500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E

60|$|Sometimes I {{stand for}} hours and peer at my face and wonder at <b>it.</b> At times <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> upside down and gaze intently at it. I try to think what it means. It seems {{to look back at}} me with its great brown eyes as if it knew me and wanted to speak to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know where}} to <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> off. <b>I</b> didn't <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> on," [...] {{answered}} Jack Rover, {{the oldest of the}} four boys who had been fooling.|$|R
500|$|Arular {{takes its}} title from the {{political}} code name employed by M.I.A.'s father, Arul Pragasam, during his involvement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, popularly known as the Tamil Tigers; she contends that her father's [...] "revolutionary ideals" [...] are the album's thematic base. [...] "In Sri Lankan, arular means 'enlightenment from the sunshine' or something", she remarked, [...] "but a friend pointed {{out that it was}} a pun in English – 'a ruler' – which is funny because he is a politician. And my mum always used to say about my father, 'He was so useless, all he ever gave you was his name'. So <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> around and turned that something into nothing. And at the same time I {{thought it would be a}} good way to find him. If he really was an egomaniac, he'd be looking himself up and he'd get this pop album stealing his name that would turn out to be me, and he'd have to get in touch", a prediction which ultimately came true.) ...|$|E
2500|$|When I {{was offered}} the part of Frida <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down, {{and she was the}} second choice. I said 'I'm not playing the role of a woman with a {{moustache}} and a monobrow, and I'm not having same-sex relations on the screen' ... I'm not racist. I love all races, particularly white people. You know, I even like Roman Catholics.|$|E
2500|$|... {{returned}} {{home with a}} copy of my videotape. I gave it to him in exchange for his strict promise that its only use would be on Nightline. However, once he had the copy of the tape, ABC News released video, still pictures, and even transcripts of my interviews to news organizations throughout the world. Protected by its formidable legal and public relations department, ABC News made still photographs from the video, slapped the “ABC News Exclusive” logo on them, and hand delivered them to newspapers, wire services, and television...All of these pictures demanded that photo credit be given to ABC News... The story won a British Press Award for “Scoop of the Year” for a British paper I didn’t even know had published it...I even won a Peabody Award as a “correspondent for Nightline." [...] But <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down—-the first time anyone had rejected a Peabody in its 57-year history." ...|$|E

60|$|VIVIE. I don't {{object to}} it on that score in the least. <b>I</b> shall <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> to very good account, I assure you.|$|R

60|$|In reply he pencilled on a slip {{as though}} we were deaf, and finally laid the {{completed}} bill face down beside my plate. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> over and grew pale.|$|E
6000|$|I {{picked it}} up. It {{was a common}} square envelope. Thinking it {{contained}} a letter <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> over to read the address. Judge of my astonishment when I read the following:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Without it, can I {{not save}} you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall you--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I {{in no way}} repay your confidence?

6000|$|... "I don't {{count on}} {{sleeping}} very long; {{but if you}} should {{come up to the}} Potomac before <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> out, <b>it</b> {{would be a good idea}} to call me." ...|$|R
6000|$|For see, {{my friend}} goes shaking and white; [...] He eyes {{me as the}} basilisk: [...] <b>I</b> have <b>turned,</b> <b>it</b> appears, his day to night, [...] Eclipsing his sun's disk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Giving the lambda a fillip with my finger, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> upside down. So the {{sentence}} now read 'o nous estin augos', and is, you perceive, the fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> over {{in front}} and {{examined}} the palm. At sight of it my brain reeled. This was surely magic! Minnie Moore's hand, too, was scarred over with cuts, exactly like Aunt Emma's!" ...|$|E
60|$|Amaze and {{apprehension}} {{were quickly}} followed by relief, since Anatole's words suggested that Marsac had not remained. I took the letter, nevertheless, with some misgivings, and whilst <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> {{over in my}} hands I questioned the old servant.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may be {{sure there}} will be no lack of a lady if he sets his mind upon <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> was <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> over in my mind, and I thought of Matilda Thoroughbung." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is my duty,' {{repeated}} she to herself. 'If <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> from <b>it</b> {{because it}} is so dreadful to me, I shall not take up my cross! If she will only listen and not be angry!' ...|$|R

60|$|For {{two days}} <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> {{over in my}} mind, and on the third there came {{something}} which first brought all my resolutions to a head, and then blew them all to nothing like {{a puff of smoke}} in the wind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{got down}} to the last step, and I was putting my foot to the pavement, and I thought, Now I am going to turn my ankle. Wasn't it strange? And <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it.</b> How did you get me upstairs?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> over meditatively. The fancy seized {{me that it}} {{had been}} left there on purpose--my last chance!

6000|$|... 'I {{think the}} idea is right, Jacob. Absolutely, washing the cart may seem useless. So {{it is to the}} cart, but not to you. There is nothing like doing things as they should be done.

50|$|It {{was built}} from 1417 by Louis III, Elector Palatine, and {{replaced}} the Alte Veste, a Gothic {{building in the}} town center, as the electoral court. The original building on the north was added with a south wing, a moat and a gatehouse, by Elector Frederick <b>I</b> <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> into a fortress. Its present appearance with a high voluted gable was set in 1603 by Johannes Schoch, who redesigned the Zeughaus with an added tower on the south.

60|$|Someone {{caught me}} by the arm. <b>I</b> <b>turned.</b> <b>It</b> was the Lord Filippo, pale as the rest, his affectations all fallen from him, and the man himself {{revealed}} by the hand of an overwhelming sorrow.
