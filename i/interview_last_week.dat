40|$|Wolfgang Schäuble, the {{outgoing}} German finance minister, warned in an FT <b>interview</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> that ‘economists {{all over the}} world are concerned about the increased risks arising from the accumulation of more and more liquidity and the growth of public and private debt. ’ This follows an assessment by the Bank of International Settlements, whose chief economist, Claudio Borio, has tied inflated asset values to loose monetary policy: ‘We do not fully understand the factors at work. But surely the unprecedented gradual pace of monetary policy normalisation has played a role. Another factor could be market participants’ belief that central banks will not remain on the sidelines should unwarranted market tensions rise. All this underlines how much asset prices appear to depend on the very low bond yields that have prevailed for so long. ...|$|E
40|$|While meeting {{someone for}} a {{research}} <b>interview</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> I found myself outside {{an agent for}} Foreign Domestic Workers (FDW). The window was full {{of the details of}} women for prospective employers to browse. I was surprised to see how many of the details of the potential FDWs were on public display. These details included photographs, home addresses, date of birth, previous employers, and religion. Of further interest {{was the fact that the}} women whose domestic services were being advertised also had a list of criteria that they were willing or able to do. These included items like: -Will you work with pets? -Can you use electric appliances? -Are you willing to follow the rule of discipline (one for all the Foucault lovers) ? But what really caught my eye were the questions pertaining to pork. Are you willing to cook pork? Are you willing to eat pork? Many of the women (all of whom were listed as Muslim) had ticked the box that they were willing to eat pork. I have previously written about the compromises that Indonesian FDWs often make in order to please their employers and complete their contracts. Halal food practices are often sacrificed as a way to gain employment and pay off debt...|$|E

He also accused the government of handling its relations with Opposition parties in a [...] "crude and amateurish way" [...] which prevented any cross-party agreement on land reform, necessary for obtaining the two-thirds parliamentary majority for amending the Constitution. This would create a mess for the next government to clean up after the 2006 election, Ganilau said on 27 August.|$|R
40|$|Promoting {{weight loss}} among {{overweight}} low-income postpartum women has proven difficult. The study’s aims were to pilot-test ethnic-specific weight-loss interventions using randomized control-group designs for White/Anglo (n = 23), African American (n = 25), and Hispanic low-income postpartum women (n = 23) and draw lessons from psychosocial data and follow-up <b>interviews.</b> Interventions <b>lasting</b> 13 <b>weeks</b> were offered in group settings in the community. Similar to other randomized trials with low-income mothers, weight changes between intervention {{and control groups}} were nonsignificant in each ethnic group; however, changes correlated sig-nificantly with self-efficacy (Spearman r =. 50) for White/Anglo women and self-efficacy (Spearman r = −. 48) and perceived stress (Spearman r =. 48) for African American women. In follow-up interviews, women felt inter-ventions gave a good foundation for weight loss, but program and situational factors affected participation and weight loss. Control groups (mailed inter-ventions later) were generally more pleased with their assignment than intervention groups. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on May 17, 2016 wjn. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R

40|$|Background: To analyse the {{prevalence}} of seizures and use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the end-of-life (EOL) phase of patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) and to identify patient characteristics associated with the occurrence of seizures in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Methods: Patients were recruited from a cohort of adults with HGG diagnosed in 2005 and 2006 in three tertiary referral centres for patients with brain tumour. Physicians involved in the EOL care of patients who had HGG and had died were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding seizures and antiepileptic treatment in the last 3 months and in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Data on seizures and use of AEDs before the EOL phase were obtained from medical correspondence and hospital medical charts. Results: Out of 155 patients who had died, data for 92 patients were eligible for analysis. Twenty-nine percent of these 92 patients had seizures during the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life; 33 % of patients {{had a history of}} seizures and 22 % did not. Besides a history of status epilepticus (p= 0. 047), we identified no other significant risk factors for developing seizures in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Seventy percent of all patients used AEDs before the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. In 35 % of patients in whom AEDs were tapered, seizures occurred in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that seizures are a common symptom in patients with HGG during the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life and emphasise the importance of adequate AED treatment throughout the EOL phase...|$|R
