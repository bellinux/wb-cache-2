50|$|Richard E. Fuller, {{president}} of the Seattle Fine Arts Society, was the animating figure of SAM in its early years. During the Great Depression, he and his mother, Margaret MacTavish Fuller, donated $250,000 to build an art museum in Volunteer Park on Seattle's Capitol Hill. The city provided the land and received ownership of the building. Carl F. Gould of the architectural firm Bebb and Gould designed an Art Deco/Art Moderne building for the museum, which opened June 23, 1933.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper we {{reported}} {{the sequence of}} the beginning of a serine cycle gene cluster on the Methylobacterium extorquens AM 1 chromosome, containing the genes encoding serine glyoxylate aminotransferase (sgaA), hydroxypyruvate reductase (hprA), and 5, 10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (mtdA) (L. V. Chistoserdova and M. E. Lidstrom J. Bacteriol. 176 : 1957 - 1968, 1994). Here we present the sequence of the adjacent downstream region containing three full and one partial open reading frames. The <b>first</b> of the <b>full</b> <b>open</b> reading frames (orf 4) remains unidentified, while the other two (mtkA and mtkB) code for the two subunits of malate thiokinase, and the fourth, a partial open reading frame (ppcA), apparently encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Mutants containing insertion mutations in orf 4, mtdA, and mtdB all were unable to grow on C 1 compounds, showing that these three newly identified genes are indispensable for the operation of the serine cycle. Mutants in orf 4 were also unable to grow on C 2 compounds, but growth was restored by glyoxylate, suggesting that orf 4 might be required for the conversion of acetyl coenzyme A to glyoxylate...|$|R
40|$|Open defects are {{extremely}} common in CMOS circuits. They {{can either be}} a partial or complete breaking of an input line. The complete breaking of the line {{is referred to as}} strong or <b>full</b> <b>open</b> defect. Until few years ago, a <b>full</b> <b>open</b> defect on any interconnecting line has been considered as floating. In nanometric CMOS technology, in which gate leakage currents are not negligible, <b>full</b> <b>open</b> defect lines cannot be considered to be electrically isolated. The final value of the node is independent of the initial state of the node and totally depends on the topological characteristics of the gate. Experimental evidence of the behavior of all basic gates at 90 nm, 64 nm and 32 nm is provided; this shows a decrease in the drain current to gate leakage current ratio, in the technology scaling. The effect of <b>full</b> <b>opens</b> at the gates has also been tested by varying the PVT conditions. These variations provide a range of variation for the <b>full</b> <b>open</b> input voltage and gate leakage current. The effect of <b>full</b> <b>opens</b> on various circuits like the full adder has also been documented at various nanometric levels. 1...|$|R

40|$|An Interconnect <b>full</b> <b>open</b> defect {{breaks the}} {{connection}} between the driver and the gate terminals of downstream transistors, generating a floating line. The behavior of floating lines is known to depend on several factors, namely parasitic capacitances to neighboring structures, transistor capacitances of downstream gate(s) and trapped charges. For nanometer CMOS technologies, the reduction of oxide thickness leads to a significant increase in gate tunneling leakage. This new phenomenon influences the behavior of circuits with interconnect <b>full</b> <b>open</b> defects. Floating lines can no longer be considered electrically isolated and are subjected to transient evolutions, reaching a steady state determined by the technology, downstream interconnect and gate(s) topology. The occurrence of such defects and the impact of gate tunneling leakage are expected to increase in the future. In this work, interconnect <b>full</b> <b>open</b> defects affecting nanometer CMOS technologies are analyzed and the defective logic response of downstream gates after reaching the steady state is predicted. Experimental evidence of this behavior is presented for circuits belonging to a 180 nm and a 65 nm CMOS technologies. Technology trends show that the impact of gate leakage currents is expected to increase in future technologies. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
