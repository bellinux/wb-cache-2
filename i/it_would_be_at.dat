5|$|Gandhi, at age 22, {{was called}} to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned {{that his mother had}} died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from him. His {{attempts}} at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because he was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses. He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but he was forced to stop when he ran foul of a British officer. In 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted Gandhi. Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of £105 plus travel expenses. He accepted it, knowing that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least one year commitment in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.|$|E

25|$|During {{postnatal}} development, KCC2 {{levels are}} strongly upregulated while NKCC1 levels are down regulated. This change in expression correlates to a developmental {{shift of the}} chloride ion concentration within neurons from high to low intracellular concentration. Effectively, as the chloride ion concentration is reduced, the chloride gradient across the cellular membrane is reversed such that GABAA receptor and glycine receptor stimulation causes chloride ion influx, making the internal neuronal environment more negative (i.e. more hyperpolarized) than <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> rest. This is the developmental shift of inhibitory synapses from the excitatory postsynaptic responses of the early neural development phase to the inhibitory postsynaptic responses observed throughout maturity.|$|E

Phone service was restored to most of the region after 30 hours without service, However, areas near the Nepal-India border remained without power on 17 April. On 20 April, the Bihar Electricity Board said that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least a month to repair all damaged electrical transmission towers.

25|$|KCC2 {{levels are}} low during {{mammalian}} embryonic development, when neural networks {{are still being}} established and neurons are highly plastic (changeable). During this stage, intracellular chloride ion concentrations are high due to low KCC2 expression {{and high levels of}} a transporter known as NKCC1 (Na+/K+ chloride cotransporter 1), which moves chloride ions into cells. Thus, during embryonic development, the chloride gradient is such that stimulation of GABAA receptors and glycine receptors at inhibitory synapses causes chloride ions to flow out of cells, making the internal neuronal environment less negative (i.e. more depolarized) than <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> rest. At this stage, GABAA receptors and glycine receptors act as excitatory rather than inhibitory effectors on postsynaptic neurons, resulting in depolarization and hyperexcitability of neural networks.|$|E
25|$|Israel is {{emerging}} as a popular destination for medical tourists. In 2006, 15,000 foreigners travelled to the country for medical procedures, bringing in $40 million of revenue. The advantages of Israel for health tourism include good natural resources; stable, comfortable climate all year round; a progressive medical systems, and scenic locations which have a calming effect on patients. Medical tourists choose Israel for several reasons. Some come from European nations such as Romania where certain procedures are not available. Others come to Israel, most commonly from the United States, because they can receive quality health care {{at a fraction of}} the cost <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> home, for both surgeries and in-vitro fertilization treatments. Other medical tourists come to Israel to visit the Dead Sea, a world-famous therapeutic resort. The Israel Ministry of Tourism and several professional medical services providers have set out to generate awareness of Israel's medical capabilities.|$|E

On 14 April Shackleton recorded the nearby pack [...] "piling and rafting against the masses of ice"—if the ship was caught in this disturbance [...] "she would be crushed like an eggshell". In May, as the sun set for the winter months, the ship was at 75°23′S, 42°14′W, still drifting northwards. [...] <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least four months before spring brought the chance of an opening of the ice, and there was no certainty that Endurance would break free in time to attempt a return to the Vahsel Bay area. Shackleton now considered the possibility of finding an alternative landing ground on the western shores of the Weddell Sea, if that coast could be reached.

2500|$|Refolding of α-helical transmembrane {{proteins}} in vitro is technically difficult. There are relatively {{few examples of}} the successful refolding experiments, as for bacteriorhodopsin. In vivo, all such proteins are normally folded co-translationally within the large transmembrane translocon. The translocon channel provides a highly heterogeneous environment for the nascent transmembane α-helices. A relatively polar amphiphilic α-helix can adopt a transmembrane orientation in the translocon (although <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the membrane surface or unfolded in vitro), because its polar residues can face [...] the central water-filled channel of the translocon. Such mechanism is necessary for incorporation of polar α-helices into structures of transmembrane proteins. The amphiphilic helices remain attached to the translocon until the protein is completely synthesized and folded. If the protein remains unfolded and attached to the translocon for too long, it is degraded by specific [...] "quality control" [...] cellular systems.|$|E

2500|$|Three {{months later}} Poirot goes {{to visit the}} convent Casey's {{daughter}} entered, in a remote part of the western coast of Ireland. He discovers that she had died two months earlier. Poirot makes the acquaintance {{of one of the}} locals who helps him break into the convent – where he recovers the goblet. He returns it to Power and tells him that the nuns were using it as a chalice. Casey's daughter probably took it there to atone for her father's sins and the nuns were ignorant of its ownership and ancient history. Poirot deduced <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the convent as there had been no trace of anyone having the goblet after it was stolen. Therefore, it was somewhere where [...] "ordinary material values did not apply". The mention of Casey's daughter being a nun supplied the obvious place. Poirot shows Power how, during the Renaissance, the Pope used a hidden mechanism in the goblet to put the poison in the victim's drink. Poirot suggests no good will come out of owning an object with such an evil history. If it is given back to the convent, the nuns will say masses for Power's soul. He reminds Power of his boyhood in western Ireland. Power agrees; he has got what he wants, which was to own the goblet. Poirot returns the goblet to the convent as the gift of a man so unhappy he does not know he is unhappy.|$|E
