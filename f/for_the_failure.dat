5|$|A melancholic Darryl finally assembles {{a conference}} room meeting with several {{potential}} new hires, but utters several discouraging remarks about the job and exits, leaving Andy alone {{to take charge of}} the process. Andy does not know what he is doing and all of the applicants walk out. Darryl blames himself <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> and demands that Andy fire him, leaving Andy baffled and with no choice but to handle the hiring of new warehouse staff himself.|$|E
5|$|Keating blamed {{government}} regulators <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of Lincoln Savings and sued for {{control over the}} bank. The suit was dismissed in August 1990, with the judge calling the seizure fully justified., Keating's legal fees were running at $1 million per month.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{germanium}} spontaneously extrudes {{very long}} screw dislocations, {{and this is}} one of the primary reasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of older diodes and transistors made from germanium; depending on what they eventually touch, they may lead to an electrical short.|$|E

30|$|There are {{two main}} reasons which are the bamboo joints and drill hole <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> of <b>the</b> {{specimens}} under two eccentric directions, particularly the first one. <b>The</b> tensile <b>failure</b> always happens earlier than <b>the</b> compression <b>failure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> laminated bamboo as defects influence the tensile strength more than compression strength.|$|R
5|$|Ryzhkov and Gorbachev {{continued}} {{their work on}} economic reform and in 1987 began drafting the Law on the State Enterprise, which restricted the authority of central planners. This would later come into effect and give workers an unrealistically high level of power. Nikolai Talyzin, Chairman of the State Planning Committee, became the scapegoat <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of this reform and on the orders of Ryzhkov he was replaced by Yuri Maslyukov.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Browning {{was awarded}} the Order of Polonia Restituta (II class) by the Polish government-in-exile, but his {{critical}} evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major-General Stanisław Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Some writers later claimed that Sosabowski had been made a scapegoat <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of Market Garden. Montgomery attached no blame to Browning or any of his subordinates, or indeed acknowledged failure at all. He told Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, {{that he would like}} Browning to take over VIII Corps in the event that Richard O'Connor, the GOC, were transferred to another theatre.|$|E
5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of Adlertag. While {{the gap between}} the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The breaking of the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British easy access to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E

5000|$|Southwark Council {{pleaded guilty}} in 2017 to four charges {{concerning}} breaches to safety regulations. It was fined £270,000, reduced from £400,000 because it had pleaded guilty, plus £300,000 costs. The council expressed [...] "sincere regret <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> that {{were present in the}} building".|$|R
5|$|In December, both Erich Hartmann and Gerhard Barkhorn, Graf’s best pilots, {{returned}} to active duty. Within a month, they both achieved their 300th victories. On New Year’s Day, the Luftwaffe's western command launched Operation Bodenplatte, against Allied air forces {{based in the}} Low Countries. It was an unsuccessful attempt to support the Battle of the Bulge offensive. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure,</b> Göring fired Galland as General of the Fighters. In response, a meeting of senior Geschwadern commanders, in early January (including Graf), agreed to approach Göring and demand major changes. When confronted, Göring was furious and immediately demoted all the fighter leaders aside from Graf, who stayed as Kommodore of JG52 because of the unit’s exemplary war record. Göring told Graf he needed him against the imminent Soviet attack.|$|E
5|$|In January 1837, Smith {{and other}} church leaders created a joint stock company, called the Kirtland Safety Society, {{to act as}} a quasi-bank; the company issued bank notes {{capitalized}} in part by real estate. Smith encouraged the Latter Day Saints to buy the notes, and he invested heavily in them himself, but the bank failed within a month. As a result, the Latter Day Saints in Kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility. Smith was held responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure,</b> and there were widespread defections from the church, including many of Smith's closest advisers. After a warrant was issued for Smith's arrest on a charge of banking fraud, Smith and Rigdon fled Kirtland for Missouri in January 1838.|$|E
5|$|In October 1675 the Swedish fleet under Gustaf Otto Stenbock put to sea, but sailed {{no further}} than Stora Karlsö off Gotland before it had to turn back to Stockholm after less than two weeks, beset by cold and stormy weather, disease, {{and the loss of}} vital equipment. Stenbock, held {{personally}} responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> by King Charles XI, was forced to pay for the campaign out of his own pocket. During the winter of 1675–76 the Swedish fleet was placed under the command of Lorentz Creutz, who attempted to put to sea in January to February 1676, but was iced in by exceptionally cold weather.|$|E

5000|$|Historian Timothy Snyder {{has argued}} that the theory served the Stalinist regime both as self-justification <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> of its {{policies}} of collectivization (which were to be blamed on [...] "saboteurs" [...] rather than on the inadequacies of Soviet planning), and as an ideological tool <b>for</b> <b>the</b> continuation of mass repression: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} years {{were marked by}} Cracovia's slow decline. The last success - vice-championship of Poland (1949) - was then followed by the team's worsening position, which culminated in 1954, when Cracovia was demoted to the second division. An ill-considered policy of Cracovia's decision-makers should be blamed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures.</b> <b>The</b> club was tied to Kraków's Transit Authority, {{which turned out to}} be a very bad solution, as it did not bring sufficient funds to make running the club feasible.|$|R
5|$|J.E.B. Stuart {{deprived}} Lee of cavalry intelligence {{during a}} good part of the campaign by taking his three best brigades on a path away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the meeting engagement on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability for the situation originate in the relatively vague orders issued by Lee, but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Like many Kentuckians, Stevenson was {{sympathetic}} to the southern states' position in the lead-up to the Civil War, but he opposed secession {{as a means of}} dealing with sectional tensions. In the 1860 presidential election, he supported his close friend, John C. Breckinridge. Desiring to avert the Civil War, he advocated acceptance of the several proposed compromises, including the Crittenden Compromise, authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden. He blamed the Radical Republicans' rigid adherence to their demands <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of all such proposed compromises, and on January 30, 1861, denounced them in a speech that the Dictionary of American Biography called the most notable of his career in the House.|$|E
5|$|Minardi boss Paul Stoddart said {{immediately}} after the race that nine teams– all but Ferrari– agreed not to race, and had Jordan not reversed its decision at the last minute, Minardi would also have boycotted the race. In his later, lengthier, statement, he indicated that although it had been Michelin's failure to provide a reliable tyre which had initiated the events, he laid the full blame <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> to reach some accommodation (which would have allowed a race to happen, {{for the benefit of}} the many fans who had paid considerable money for travel and tickets) at the feet of Max Mosley and the FIA, with a small share of the blame going to what he characterized as the obstructionist Ferrari team leader, Jean Todt. He furthermore called for Mosley's resignation.|$|E

5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of {{the labor}} market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after, the {{religious}} reformers (and protégés of Cromwell) Robert Barnes, William Jerome and Thomas Garret were burned as heretics. Cromwell, meanwhile, {{fell out of}} favour although it is unclear exactly why, for {{there is little evidence}} of differences of domestic or foreign policy. Despite his role, he was never formally accused of being responsible for Henry's failed marriage. Cromwell was now surrounded by enemies at court, with Norfolk also able to draw on his niece's position. Cromwell was charged with treason, selling export licences, granting passports, and drawing up commissions without permission, and may also have been blamed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of the foreign policy that accompanied the attempted marriage to Anne. He was subsequently attainted and beheaded.|$|E
5|$|The First Test was a {{continuation}} of the trend of English batsmen being largely unable to cope with Australia's pacemen. Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match, and at Trent Bridge only he and Compton managed this feat. Apart from Hardstaff, none of the remaining batsmen passed 25. Wisden's verdict was that England fought back very well, but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on the first day. Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display worthy of a draw, and blamed the first innings batting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> to prevenet defeat. However, he believed the English tactics to be justified and should have been continued.|$|E

25|$|In his {{writings}} from that period, Mariátegui observed that fascism {{was a response}} to deep social crisis, that it based itself on the petty bourgeoisie of town and country, and that it relied heavily on a cult of violence. According to him, fascism was the price that a society in crisis paid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> of <b>the</b> left.|$|R
5|$|Wright told Lee {{that it was}} {{relatively}} easy {{to get to the}} crest, but it was difficult to stay there. A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left and could have reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made slow progress and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part of the blame <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle.|$|E
5|$|Władysław {{tried to}} regain the tsar's throne himself, {{organizing}} a campaign in 1616. Despite some military victories, {{he was unable to}} capture Moscow. The Commonwealth gained some disputed territories in the Truce of Deulino, but Władysław was never able to reign in Russia; the throne during this time was instead held by tsar Michael Romanov. He held on to the title, without any real power, until 1634. Likely, the failure of this campaign showed Władysław the limits of royal power in Poland, as major factors <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> included significant autonomy of the military commanders, which did not see Władysław as their superior, and lack of funds for the army, as the Polish parliament (sejm) refused to subsidize the war.|$|E
5|$|A team of {{earthquake}} and engineering {{experts from the}} United States spent {{a period of time}} in Armenia in December 1988 and January 1989. The group, including a structural engineer who specialized in seismic-resistant designs, agreed that building inadequacies were the primary reason why the strong (but not huge) earthquake was so damaging, although the freezing temperatures also {{played a role in the}} unusually high death toll. The engineers who scrutinized the damaged buildings and the rescue workers who had dismantled the buildings while extricating survivors ascribe both design shortcomings and improper construction methods <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of the buildings. The Soviets had modified their construction style to accommodate the known seismic risk in the area, but they acknowledged to the team that many of the buildings were not built to withstand an earthquake of that magnitude. An engineer with the team stated that the regulations for the area mandated that buildings be required to stand up against events measuring seven or eight on the twelve degree Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The earthquake's effects were assessed at ten on that seismic scale.|$|E

25|$|The massive {{famine in}} the early 1930s (which was {{organized}} partly by the state) was blamed on religious believers who supposedly were infiltrating the collective farms and wrecking them from within.
