40|$|From the Introduction]. Uneven {{development}} of regions within a national state has, {{as one of}} its dimensions, an imbalance in the distribution of employment opportunities. Countries such as Italy, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Belgium, among others, provide examples of this phenomenon. In each of these countries there exists a locational problem - some region (or set of regions) experiences difficulty in attracting new industry and the employment opportunities associated with new industry activity. Recognizing this locational problem, a variety of national governments (including the four cited above) have attempted to modify the relative attractiveness of regions to firms by offering inducements to firms to locate in relatively disadvantaged regions. Typically, the inducement {{takes the form of a}} locational cost reduction mechanism. In Smith's (1966) terminology, the national government seeks to expand the spatial margins to profitability so as to include disadvantaged regions. Examples of such inducements are direct capital grants (utilized in Ireland), interest rate subsidies (utilized in Belgium), and <b>employment</b> <b>premiums</b> (utilized in the United Kingdom) ...|$|R

30|$|Unlike rich countries, {{there is}} no {{collective}} or political interest in protecting and developing {{the private sector in}} poor countries. This lack of political interest explains the frequency of populist policies and continuous rule violating behaviour. The relatively small private sector necessitates a narrow tax base and a low <b>employment</b> <b>premium.</b> Inevitably, the state becomes the largest source of employment and, by extension, represents a formidable political force. In this context, “good” institutions are unlikely to be effective and the evidence indeed supports this. Countries across Africa, Asia and LAC with diminishing returns production structures are well known for being highly corrupt with weak institutions and enforcement {{of the rule of law}} (Khan 2000, 2006, 2009). North et al. (2007) argue on the contrary and explain that the form of political organization rather than economic structure determines how institutions perform. In their view, importing “inclusive” institutions on limited access orders (societies where political and economic access to key resources are limited to an elite group) do not transform society since the way elite factions are organized is at odds with these institutions.|$|E
30|$|The {{consensus}} in the empirical literature is that there exists a substantial paid <b>employment</b> <b>premium</b> over being self-employed. Hamilton (2000) finds that taking into account within sector earnings growth and without distinguishing between own-account self-employed and recruiters, there is a 35 % differential between median earnings of a self-employed individual and a paid employee with 10 {{years of experience in}} the USA. To rationalize workers’ career choices, “results suggest that the nonpecuniary benefits of self-employment are substantial”. Critiquing the shortcomings of the existing literature Hamilton (2000) goes on to say “results presented here are of a reduced form [...] structural estimates of the compensating wage differential, for example, would require [...] the probability of observing particular employment and earnings sequences”. To my knowledge, this is the first paper that attempts to structurally estimate the nonpecuniary benefits of self-employment while taking into account different employment options, including starting and growing one’s own business. A priori, it is not clear which sector has the preferable employment and earnings profile. On the one hand, those in paid employment are better exposed to other jobs in paid employment and can climb the job ladder thusly. However, the self-employed {{are far more likely to}} become recruiters. If their firm successfully grows, so will their earnings. Consistent with the empirical literature, this paper too finds a large positive amenity associated with self-employment.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{definition}} and measurement of college major specificity and estimates its labor market return over a worker’s life cycle. After reviewing the variety of measures which {{have been used to}} measure specialization, we propose a new approach: a Theil measure based on the transferability of skills across occupations. We calculate and compare representative measures using data from the American Community Survey, National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, and the Baccalaureate and Beyond. We then use these measures to estimate the return to specialized higher education. Our consistent finding is that the most "general" majors are the ones that pay off the most over time. While there is an initial earnings premium to majors with a tight connection to the labor market and to those classified as "vocational", this fades by age 30. Meanwhile, majors that teach versatile, transferable skills earn the most at every age. Employment returns are largely consistent with these earnings estimates. While vocational majors display a persistent <b>employment</b> <b>premium</b> over the life cycle, most other measures suggest that graduates from general majors work more hours, {{are more likely to be}} employed, and are more likely to be employed full time. Overall, major specificity explains 22 % of the variation across majors in earnings and 28 % of the variation in work hours. Publisher PD...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the federal {{government}} has increased its reliance on payroll taxes. This approach is revealed most directly in <b>Employment</b> Insurance <b>premiums</b> but also emerges in planned increases for Canada Pension Plan premiums. Economic criteria support these moves to the extent that premiums are strongly linked to benefit entitlements. However, much of the EI and increased CPP premiums are unrelated to benefits and thus constitute general payroll taxes. Such taxes compare favourably in economic terms with some alternative taxes but are regressive when imposed with a ceiling on taxable earnings. These developments appear to be driven by political pressures rather than economic criteria. If the government is politically constrained from raising the rates of other, more visible taxes (such as income tax and GST), then the payroll tax changes may be economically optimal choices subject to the constraint. In the longer run, basic reform of the other taxes and reduced reliance on general payroll taxes would be desirable. ...|$|R

40|$|Using an {{unbalanced}} {{panel of}} about 260, 000 Swedish firm-level observations {{over the period}} 1997 - 2006, this paper shows {{that half of the}} firms exporting goods are service firms that account for a substantial and increasing share of the total value from exports of goods. Between 1997 and 2006 this fraction increased from 25 % to 34 %. Previous research provides little systematic evidence of this extension of goods exports among service firms or the benefits of exporting. This paper shows that service firms do become exporters for the same reasons as manufacturing firms. Besides, they are a self-selection of larger, more productive and high-equity firms, with more skilled labour, higher capital intensity and stronger links to multinational groups. However, the export productivity premium is larger for service firms than for manufacturers. No evidence is found to indicate that exporting increases the growth rate of productivity. In contrast, the annual <b>employment</b> growth <b>premium</b> from exporting is substantial for business services, 2 % per year, compared to 0. 5 % for the retail and wholesale business.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} two seeming paradoxes in {{the realm}} of employer-provided health insurance: First, businesses consistently claim that they bear the burden of the insurance they provide for employees, despite theory and empirical evidence indicating that workers bear the full incidence. Second, benefit generosity and the percentage of premiums paid by employers have decreased in recent decades, despite the preferential tax treatment of employer-paid benefits relative to wages—trends unexplained by the standard incidence model. This paper offers a revised incidence model based on nominal wage rigidity, in an attempt to explain these paradoxes. The model predicts that when the nominal wage constraint binds, some of the burden of increasing insurance premiums will fall on firms, particularly small companies with low-wage employees. In response, firms will reduce employment, decrease benefit generosity, and require larger employee premium contributions. Using Current Population Survey data from 2000 – 2001, I find evidence for this kind of wage rigidity and its associated impact on the <b>employment</b> and <b>premium</b> contributions of low-wage insured workers during a period of rapid premium growth.

The composition of African-origin migrants has also changed dramatically: in the midtwentieth century, the majority were white and came from only three countries; but today, about one-fifth are white, and African-origin migrants hail from across the entire continent. Little is known about the implications of these changes for their labor market outcomes in the United States. Using the 2000 – 2011 waves of the American Community Survey, we present a picture of enormous heterogeneity in labor market participation, sectoral choice, and hourly earnings of male and female migrants by country of birth, race, age at arrival in the United States, and human capital. For example, controlling a rich set of human capital and demographic characteristics, some migrants— such as those from South Africa/Zimbabwe and Cape Verde, who typically enter on <b>employment</b> visas—earn substantial <b>premiums</b> relative to other African-origin migrants.

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that the incomes of the elderly are on average much {{lower than those of}} the non-elderly reflecting their limited participation in the labour market. But do the elderly have lower levels of economic well-being? Indeed, the financial circumstances of the elderly differ significantly from those of the non-elderly and these differences may compensate for lower income, increasing consumption potential relative to the non-elderly. In his paper, Malcolm Hamilton uses hitherto unexploited data from Statistics Canada’s Survey of Consumer Spending to examine the financial circumstances of the elderly and discusses the implications for the design of Canada’s retirement income system. Hamilton notes that there are five reasons why the unadjusted incomes of senior households should not be compared to those of younger households. Younger households often support children; devote a significant portion of their income to acquiring and financing consumer durables (cars, appliances, furniture) that seniors already possess; incur employment-related expenses (union dues, day-care, commuting costs, insurance); save part of their income for retirement; and pay higher taxes, including CPP and <b>Employment</b> Insurance (EI) <b>premiums.</b> Hamilton presents fascinating data for different types of households on uses of income by age group. He shows that the amount of income available for consumption, that is income after taxes, mortgage payments, savings, union dues, day-care and provision for children, is actually greater for fully retired senior couples than for prime age couples ($ 30, 400 versus $ 28, 600) even though average before-tax income of prime age couples is double that of senior couples. According to Hamilton, the data suggest that seniors need only around 50 per cent of their employment income to maintain their standard of living, not the 70 per cent that is commonly assumed in pension discussions. The implications of this finding for the design of the retirement system are many. Since government transfers replace 40 per cent of the income of the typical retiring Canadian, average Canadians will need {{little in the way of}} occupational pensions or retirement saving to live comfortably after 65. Most Canadians can retire in comfort if they eliminate debt and save a modest amount to supplement government pensions.
