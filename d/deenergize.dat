40|$|The transmembrane {{movement}} of radiolabeled, nonmetabolizable glucose analogs in Streptococcus mutants Ingbritt was studied {{under conditions of}} differing transmembrane electrochemical potentials (delta psi) and pH gradients (delta pH). The delta pH and delta psi were determined from the transmembrane equilibration of radiolabeled benzoate and tetraphenylphosphonium ions, respectively. Growth conditions of S. mutants Ingbritt were chosen so that the cells had a low apparent phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) -dependent glucose:phosphotransferase activity. Cells energized under different conditions produced transmembrane proton potentials ranging from - 49 to - 103 mV but did not accumulate 6 -deoxyglucose intracellularly. An artificial transmembrane proton potential was generated in <b>deenergized</b> cells by creating a delta psi with a valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential and a delta pH by rapid acidification of the medium. Artificial transmembrane proton potentials up to - 83 mV, although producing proton influx, could not accumulate 6 -deoxyglucose in <b>deenergized</b> cells or 2 -deoxyglucose or thiomethylgalactoside in <b>deenergized,</b> PEP-depleted cells. The transmembrane diffusion of glucose in PEP-depleted, KF-treated cells did not exhibit saturation kinetics or competitive inhibition by 6 -deoxyglucose or 2 -deoxyglucose, indicating that diffusion was not facilitated by a membrane carrier. As proton-linked membrane carriers {{have been shown to}} facilitate diffusion {{in the absence of a}} transmembrane proton potential, the results therefore are not consistent with a proton-linked glucose carrier in S. mutans Ingbritt. This together with the lack of proton-linked transport of the glucose analogs suggests that glucose transmembrane movement in S. mutans Ingbritt is not linked to the transmembrane proton potential...|$|R

50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will <b>deenergize</b> the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|E

If glucose-energized cells were washed in potassium phosphate and suspended in potassium phosphate buffer, there was no detectable uptake. Cells <b>deenergized</b> with 2 -deoxyglucose and incubated in sodium phosphate buffer were still able to transport serine, and this result indicated that the chemical sodium gradient was capable of driving transport. However, when the <b>deenergized</b> cells were treated with valinomycin and diluted into sodium phosphate to create both an artificial membrane potential and a chemical sodium gradient, rates of serine uptake were fivefold greater than in cells having only a sodium gradient. If <b>deenergized</b> cells were preloaded with sodium (no membrane potential or sodium gradient), there was little serine transport. Nigericin and monensin, ionophores capable of reversing sodium gradients across membranes, strongly inhibited sodium-dependent uptake of the three amino acids. Membrane vesicles loaded with potassium and diluted into either lithium or choline chloride were unable to transport serine, but rapid uptake was evident if sodium chloride {{was added to the}} assay mixture. Serine transport had an extremely poor affinity for sodium, and more than 30 mM was needed for half-maximal rates of uptake. Serine transport was inhibited by an excess of threonine, but an excess of alanine had little effect.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{influence}} of pH on opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) in both <b>deenergized</b> and energized mitochondria {{in the presence of}} Pi. In <b>deenergized</b> mitochondria from rat brain and heart, we observed the expected inhibition of Ca 2 +-induced PTP opening at increasingly acidic pH values. Unexpectedly, mitochondria energized with either electron transport complex I or complex II substrates displayed the opposite behavior, acidic pH promoting rather than inhibiting PTP opening. We show that the potentiating effect of acidic pH is due to an increased rate of Pi uptake. The data also revealed that brain mitochondria are more heterogeneous than heart or liver mitochondria in relation to onset of a permeability transition, and that this heterogeneity depends on their Pi transport capacity. Taken together, these results indicate that the inhibitory effects of acidic pH on the PTP may be overcome in situ by an increased rate of Pi uptake, and that ischemic and postischemic acidosis may worsen rather than relieve PTP-dependent tissue damage...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe flagellar motor of Escherichia coli (E. coli) {{is driven}} by a proton-motive force (PMF), hence it was of {{interest}} {{to determine whether the}} motor is symmetrical {{in the sense that it}} can be rotated by any polarity of PMF. For this purpose the cells had to be <b>deenergized</b> first. Conventional deenergization procedures caused irreversible loss of motility, presumably due to ATP-dependent degradative processes. However, E. coli cells <b>deenergized</b> by incubation with arsenate manifested a slow, reversible depletion of PMF. In this procedure there was a sufficiently long time window, during which a considerable proportion of the cells lost their motility and could be made to rotate again by an artificially-imposed PMF. The motors of these cells rotated in response to any PMF polarity, but positive and negative polarities rotated different sub-populations of cells and the direction was almost exclusively counterclockwise. The reason for the unidirectionality of the rotation was not the intervention of the chemotaxis system. A number of potential reasons are suggested. One is the arsenate effect on the motor function found previously [Margolin, Y., Barak, R. and Eisenbach, M. (1994) J. Bacteriol. 176, 5547 – 5549]. A possible interaction between arsenate and the motor is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Multiuser {{transmission}} {{methods for}} {{digital subscriber line}} (DSL) systems have become of interest {{with the potential for}} increased data rate and loop reach. These methods often assume that the set of crosstalk interferers, called the crosstalk profile, and their associated channel responses are known. For DSL systems, the interferers are often uncoordinated, so that in a dynamic environment where DSL transmitters can energize and <b>deenergize,</b> the crosstalk profile cannot be transmitted to the user of interest. While the crosstalk channel estimation problem in a dynamic environment can be intractable for general transmission systems, channel and crosstalk analysis can make use of the specific DSL environment. Namely, the physical channels in a DSL system do not change rapidly, and hence estimates of the crosstalk channel can be saved for future reference. For this reason, we introduce the concept of a channel profile. We develop several algorithms to detect the crosstalk profile and investigate the asymptotic behavior of the new algorithms. Simulations show that for typical crosstalk interference scenarios, the observation time to determine the correct crosstalk profile at probability of error less than 10 (- 3) can be less than 2 ms...|$|E

40|$|AbstractReactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS: {{superoxide}} radical, O 2 −; hydrogen peroxide, H 2 O 2; hydroxyl radical, OH), which {{arise from the}} univalent reduction of dioxygen are formed in mitochondria. We summarize here results which indicate that ROS, and also the radical nitrogen monoxide (‘nitric oxide’, NO), act as physiological modulators of some mitochondrial functions, but may also damage mitochondria. Hydrogen peroxide, which originates in mitochondria predominantly from the dismutation of superoxide, causes oxidation of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides and thereby stimulates a specific Ca 2 + release from intact mitochondria. This release is prevented by cyclosporin A (CSA). Hydrogen peroxide thus contributes {{to the maintenance of}} cellular Ca 2 + homeostasis. A stimulation of mitochondrial ROS production followed by an enhanced Ca 2 + release and re-uptake (Ca 2 + ‘cycling’) by mitochondria causes apoptosis and necrosis, and contributes to hypoxia/reperfusion injury. These kinds of cell injury can be attenuated at the mitochondrial level by CSA. When ROS are produced in excessive amounts in mitochondria nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids are extensively modified by oxidation. Physiological (sub-micromolar) concentrations of NO potently and reversibly <b>deenergize</b> mitochondria at oxygen tensions that prevail in cells by transiently binding to cytochrome oxidase. This is paralleled by mitochondrial Ca 2 + release and uptake. Higher NO concentrations or prolonged exposure of cells to NO causes their death.

However, <b>deenergized</b> cells which were treated with valinomycin, loaded with potassium, and diluted into sodium or sodium plus potassium to create an artificial electrical gradient (ΔΨ) plus a chemical gradient of sodium (ΔpNa) or ΔpNa alone transported glucose at a rapid rate. Cells which were loaded with potassium plus sodium and diluted into sodium (ΔΨ with sodium, but no ΔpNa) also took up glucose at a rapid rate. Potassium-loaded cells that were diluted into buffers which did not contain sodium (ΔΨ without sodium) could not take up glucose. An artificial ZΔpH which was created by acetate diffusion could not drive glucose transport even if sodium was present.

Strain H 18 grew more slowly on lactate than glucose (0. 2 versus 0. 4 h- 1, respectively), {{and more than half}} of the lactate was initially converted to succinate. Succinate was only utilized after growth on lactate had ceased. Although nonenergized and glucose-energized cells had similar proton motive forces and ATP levels, glucose-energized cells were unable to transport succinate. Transport by nonenergized cells was decreased by small increases in osmotic strength, and it is possible that energy-dependent inhibition of succinate transport was related to changes in cell turgor. Since cells which were <b>deenergized</b> with 2 -deoxyglucose or iodoacetate did not transport succinate, it appeared that glycogen metabolism was providing the driving force for succinate uptake. An artificial delta pH drove succinate transport in <b>deenergized</b> cells, but an artificial membrane potential (delta psi) could not serve as a driving force. Because succinate is nearly fully dissociated at pH 7. 0 and the transport process was electroneutral, it appeared that succinate was taken up in symport with two protons.

40|$|AbstractThe {{opening of}} the {{cyclosporin}} A-sensitive permeability transition pore (MTP) in <b>deenergized</b> mitochondria was induced only at millimolar Ca 2 +. Pretreatment of the mitochondria with ‘inducers’, such as duroquinone and phenylarsine oxide, allowed observing the pore opening at 0. 01 – 0. 1 mM Ca 2 +. Duroquinone caused a rapid (within 20 s) NAD(P) H oxidation which {{was followed by a}} slow (20 min) induction of the pore sensitive to low Ca 2 +. Phenylarsine oxide capable of cross-linking of vicinal SH-groups caused pore formation without the oxidation of NAD(P) H. The pore opening by both ‘inducers’ was prevented by N-ethylmaleimide. We propose that oxidation or cross-linking of critical dithiol(s) in membrane proteins increase the sensitivity of a putative ‘Ca 2 +-sensor’ that regulates the permeability transition pore opening...|$|R

Since DC bus systems cannot sustain high fault currents, suitable protection strategy in DC lines is indispensable. This paper presents a novel use of {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) for fault detection and fault location in a low voltage DC bus microgrid system. In the proposed scheme, the faults on DC bus can be fast detected and then isolated without <b>deenergizing</b> the entire system, hence achieving a more reliable DC microgrid. The neural network is trained based on the different short circuit faults in DC bus to ensure its validity. A microgrid with ring DC bus, which is segmented into overlapping nodes and linked with circuit breakers, is built in PSCAD/EMTDC to test {{the performance of the}} protection scheme...|$|R
