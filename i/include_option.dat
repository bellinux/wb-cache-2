We argue that the disparity in the informativeness of US and UK executives' trades at exercise is related to important differences in executive remuneration, and in the regulation and taxation of executive stock options.

40|$|Thesis {{is mainly}} {{focused on the}} theme of {{tangible}} fixed assets and its renewal, it also offers options of financing of renewed assets. Theoretical part addresses tangible assets and its classification. Later on the focus is shifted towards tangible fixed assets under the circumstances of its appraisal and amortization. Next chapter of the theoretical part is about possible sources of financing, which <b>include</b> <b>option</b> of using own resources or those of outside origin. The thesis also contain a financial analysis point of view on the company and its assets. Last but not least the focus is moved to accounting reports and taxes, which affect purchases of tangible fixed assets. Practical part of the thesis is about introduction of the company, circumscribing of completely or significantly amortized assets, followed by a draft for renewal of specific part of company's fixed tangible assets which has been deteriorated over the time. Institutions addressing loans and leasing devised proposals of financing through loans or financial leasing. Among the possible means of financing was included even the option of using company own assets.

40|$|Existing {{research}} {{has yet to}} identify a risk premium that accounts for important empirical properties of exchange rate returns such as the forward premium anomaly: the tendency for currencies with high interest rates to appreciate against currencies with lower interest rates. This paper examines the forward premium anomaly {{through the lens of}} an arbitrage-free pricing model for the exchange rate and term structure of interest rates in two currencies. Previous papers in this literature have failed to match exchange rate volatility, which is a vital component of the risk premium in exchange rate returns. The model in this paper generalizes previous models and is estimated using the joint time-series of U. S. and U. K. swap rates, dollar/pound exchange rate returns, and prices of at-the-money exchange rate options. I <b>include</b> <b>option</b> prices because they are highly sensitive to the level of volatility and to the pricing of volatility risk. When options are used to estimate the model, it successfully captures both exchange rate volatility and the term structure of interest rates in the U. S. and U. K. Using simulated data, I show that the model also replicates the empirical findings in Fama (1984) and accounts for the forward premium anomaly...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Changes in the {{healthcare}} sector make hospitals more responsible for their investment decisions. There {{is a need to}} focus more on the investment decision making process and to determine the consequences of these investments. For this reason, this thesis discusses the ways in which a model is developed to assist the real estate decision making process regarding the investment opportunities at the UMCG. The goal of the thesis was to: Develop a model by which decisions, regarding investments in the real estate at the UMCG, can be made. From this goal, two central questions were derived. The first focuses on the method used in the model: What {{is the best way to}} analyse investment opportunities to serve as the foundation of the model and that fits with the UMCG and its surroundings? The second question focuses on the development and working of the model itself: In which way can a model be developed that assists the decision making process for real estate projects at the UMCG? Method Literature study, consultation of stakeholders and testing the model. The literature study focuses on the methods of investment decisions that exist within the academic community. Stakeholders were consulted to discuss the progress thus far, to list possible improvements and to obtain information. When the model was developed and applied to an old case, the future users of the model tested it to see if the model and the manual that supports the model were understandable and usable. Results The literature provided information for comparison of three different methods of analysing investment opportunities: the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Real Options Analysis (ROA) and Direct Capitalisation (DC). The DCF method was favoured, mainly because it is accurate and easily understandable. This last argument allows the model to be used by financial and non-financial persons. The Net Present Value (NPV) of all possible different alternatives was given as output and was compared to each other to determine the best alternative. This NPV lists the total present value of all the cash flows during the lifespan of a project. The Weighted Average cost of Capital (WACC) is the weighted average between the cost of debt and cost of equity and was used to determine the discount factor. Calculating this for the UMCG resulted in a WACC of 6, 07 %. The input consists out of the operational income and expenses, the initial investment income or expenses and the duration of the project. The output was given by the NPV and a sensitivity analysis to see what happens if the revenues rise of fall up to 5 %. An important feature of the model was its flexibility so it can be used for real estate investments for any project within the UMCG. The model was applied to a current case where the psychiatric department for adults (UCP) and children (UCKJP) need new housing. Please note that the absolute values of the NPVs contain a large degree of uncertainty, because the allocating of the Academisch Component en Rijksbijdrage (AC&R) and the overhead expenses may not be fully accurate. Any improvements that are done to make these input parameters more reliable would greatly improve the accuracy of the NPV. This lack of accuracy on the NPV was not a great problem since the main function of the model is to compare different alternatives and the uncertain input was the same for each alternative. This means that the ranking of the alternatives remains the same regardless of the height of the AC&R and overhead expenses. Another limitation was that the model can only list options that are available now, not ones that may come available in the future. This limits the number of alternatives that can be listed. Further improvements on this matter can be made by expanding the model to <b>include</b> <b>option</b> or decision trees that can list all possible options. Conclusion The best way to analyse investment opportunities to serve as the foundation of the model and that fits with the UMCG and its surroundings is to use the DCF method in which the NPV is used as output. The WACC is used to determine the discount factor. By listing the requirements of the model, the input and output parameters became clear. Applying the model to a case and testing it by the future users showed that the model works as it should. Further improvements to the model can be made by finding a better peer group when calculating the WACC, using option trees to add flexibility and improving the allocation of certain centralized budgets. ...|$|E
