In this research, landslide susceptibility is evaluated through the study of a variety of instability landforms: landslides, scarps and areas uphill from crown.

It is included in a wider research project, aimed at defining the landslide hazard {{in the area of}} the map no. 250 ‘‘Castelnuovo di Garfagnana’’ (1 : 50 000 scale). This study is based on the realization of a landslides inventory map and statistical data analysis using probabilistic methods. The methodology applied in ranking slope instability proceeded step by step. At first, geomorphologic investigation was performed in order to realize a landslide inventory map. A GIS database was created to collect the characteristics related to landslides geometry, type of movement and state of activity. Geo-engineering survey and characterization with in situ and laboratory tests allowed assessing Rock Mass Classification and geotechnical properties of soils (texture and consistency). The statistical approach for evaluating the landslide susceptibility is based on the assumption that the landslide probability for the currently landslides-free areas could be evaluated studying the conditions which led to past and present instability. A set of environmental factors, thought to be related to landslides, were analysed and their spatial distribution organized in different layers. Then, GIS-supported spatial analysis, conditional and multivariate analysis, allowed to calculate the connections between <b>instability</b> <b>factors</b> and landslide distribution. This step evolved towards two distinct statistical methods, both indirect and quantitative, leading to a classification of the land surface in some different susceptibility domains. Conditional analysis was applied to a particular type of terrain unit named Unique Condition Unit (UCU) that is a unique combination of the <b>instability</b> <b>factors.</b> The computer-aided evaluation of the landslide index within each UCU represents the probability of landslide occurrence, according to Bayes statistical concept.

Previous works have applied multivariate methods and neural networks for mapping landslide susceptibility. This study proposed {{a new approach}} to integrate decision tree model and spatial cluster statistic for assessing landslide susceptibility spatially. A total of 2057 landslide cells were digitized for developing the landslide decision tree model. The relationships of landslides and <b>instability</b> <b>factors</b> were explicitly represented by using tree graphs in the model. The local Getis-Ord statistics were used to cluster cells with high landslide probability. The analytic result from the local Getis-Ord statistics was classed to create a map of landslide susceptibility zones. The map was validated using new landslide data with 482 cells. Results of validation show an accuracy rate of 86. 1 % in predicting new landslide occurrence. This indicates that the proposed approach is useful for improving landslide susceptibility mapping.

The landslide susceptibility is generally modeled by evaluating the relationship between the spatial distribution of <b>instability</b> <b>factors</b> (environmental and triggering factors) and the distribution of the existing instability phenomena (landslide inventory). The geomorphological features of slopes can be considered as predisposing <b>factors</b> of <b>instability.</b> The geomorphological complexity can be defined as the descriptive feature which synthesizes and classifies the multiplicity of effects which determine the topographical surface and which are determined by the sequence and overlapping in time of the morphogenetic factors.

Landslides are {{the most}} frequent and damaging type of disaster in Karanganyar, Central Java, Indonesia, {{with a total of}} 399 victims and eight deaths in 261 reported events between January, 2010 and May, 2012. On December 27, 2007, one landslide event within the region took the lives of 65 individuals following two days of heavy rain on a steep slope that lacked forest coverage due to modification by farming activity. The controls of slope instability and failure are often associated with local environmental conditions such as lithology, structure, hydrology, and slope class. The exact contribution to slope instability of any given physical factor is subject to the specific environmental situation in the area of interest. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} extrapolate predictive slope-instability factors through the statistical weighting and ranking of those factors in Karanganyar using a combination of quantitative and qualitative justifications. To accomplish this, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was employed in ESRI ArcGIS 10. 2. 2 using field data, remotely sensed physical conditions, and subjective assessments based on data quality and landslide theory. AHP has been demonstrated as a tool to compare individual GIS cells, or pixelclusters, on the basis of presence of theoretical slope <b>instability</b> <b>factors</b> in order to reveal where <b>instability</b> <b>factors</b> are present in the highest amount. The prediction model was tested through direct visitation of the field-site and comparison of the locations of actual severe landslide events and the geographic distribution of landslide incident reports from the Karanganyar disaster management office. The method as applied at present is based on a landslide inventory of only a small portion of the region. Given this limitation, it was still observed to be moderately successful in identifying general areas of slope instability. Due to the low cost requirement, AHP is an attractive approach for preventing loss of life from landslides and similar earth movements in Southeast Asia and other regions with similar socio-economic conditions or difficult, densely-vegetated topography. Suggestions are made to further iterate the model using specific, fit-for-purpose data that is high resolution, recent, and obtained with the intention of building an AHP model...|$|R
