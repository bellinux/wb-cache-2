50|$|Most of the postorbital bar {{is made up}} of the postorbital bones, {{which are}} very robust {{relative}} to other cryptodontians as in other geikiids. However, compared to other geikiids, the postorbital bar of Bulbasaurus is relatively smooth and free of bosses. The sides of the postorbitals, which would have anchored jaw musculature, are very concave. Near the back, the postorbitals curve and converge to form a somewhat pinched intertemporal bar that overlaps the parietal bones to varying extents. The squamosal bones also contribute to the postorbital bar; its back edge along the postorbital bar is somewhat twisted in Bulbasaurus, which is seen in other cryptodontians but is taken to an extreme by Aulacephalodon and Pelanomodon, where the bone has become entirely twisted such that the <b>interior</b> <b>faces</b> outwards. Projections of the squamosal bones partially surround the posttemporal fenestrae on the rear of the skull, like Aulacephalodon, Pelanomodon, Oudenodon, and Tropidostoma.|$|E
50|$|The <b>interior</b> <b>faces</b> of many sherds and amphora {{bodies were}} {{coated with a}} blackish substance, {{reminiscent}} of Mediterranean wine amphoras that were sealed with a resin to prevent the liquids inside from leaching through the ceramic. One sherd, comprising approximately the lower 15 cm of an amphora, was split vertically down through the toe button. The piece {{was filled with a}} solid mass of resin, probably excess that collected in the bottom when the interior of the vessel was being sealed, or perhaps being the transport item itself. This revealed that the toe button was hollow. Buttons generally receive the brunt of damage in shipping amphorae as they rest on dunnage, other cargoes, hulls, and docksides. None of the buttons examined showed wear beyond what one would expect for new vessels being transported from potter’s shop to dock to ship. Perhaps this indicates that the amphoras were new and not reused (Pedersen, 2008: 83).|$|E

Cohesive elements are inserted adaptively at <b>interior</b> <b>faces</b> when the effective traction acting on those face reaches the cohesive strength of the material. The insertion of cohesive elements changes the geometry of the boundary and, frequently, the topology of the model as well.

The efficiency and versatility 1 of the approach is demonstrated with the aid of two examples of application to dynamic fracture. ...|$|E
