She {{is the author of the}} well-reviewed Savoring the Past: The French Kitchen and Table from 1300 to 1789, and of the biography of Marie-Antoine Carême, French exponent of grande cuisine, in Alan Davidson's Oxford Companion to Food (1999). At her request (she did not want to wash dishes and wanted a durable but <b>disposable</b> <b>dish)</b> the MIT Media Lab's Counter Intelligence Group created its Dishmaker, a machine that made dishes on demand out of food-safe materials and recycled them afterwards. She developed [...] "The Cook's Oracle", a searchable database that establishes relationships among recipes in cookbooks from different historical periods. Wheaton hopes to find someone who will continue her database, now on Microsoft Access, and make it available.|$|E
30|$|Normally a {{constant}} shear stress is specified. The disadvantage {{is that the}} resulting rotational speed decreases continuously as the viscosity increases. The rate of deformation would therefore no longer be constant. This, however, is decisive for the comparability {{of the effect of}} shear on the test specimen [15]. Therefore the shear rate is kept constant. The measuring temperature is kept constant and, {{with the aid of a}} disposable measuring system, consisting of a disposable plate and a <b>disposable</b> <b>dish,</b> it is possible to measure several specimens without having to go to the effort of removing the hardened adhesive. The time-dependent viscosity function is evaluated as the result. Here, the time t_s (start time) when the curve begins to rise is of special interest.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{widespread}} use of <b>disposable</b> <b>dishes</b> and their 500 - 600 years recycling and also carcinogenicity, {{the goal of this}} laboratory study is to investigate the possibility of using polystyrene (PS) <b>disposable</b> <b>dishes</b> wastes in making asphalt surfaces to decrease environmental problems in recycling and burial of these materials and also to analyze their effect on technical characteristics of asphalt mixtures. In addition, PS materials are used in four methods: 1 -added to bitumen, 2 -bitumen replaced with PS, 3 -added to aggregates, 4 - same-sized soft aggregates replaced with PS. In each of aforementioned instances, bitumen or asphalt mixture technical characteristics change much or a little. PS can resolve major problems of water percolation and drainage in asphalt surfaces and the obtained asphalt mixture has more strength and resistance to control sample. Consequently, while using the obtained mixture improves asphalt mixtures properties and reduces the consumption of aggregates, it exploits large amounts of PS wastes in civil engineering constructions.

The foundation of a successful management program is an effective monitoring program that provides information on pest presence and abundance over time and space to help in making management decisions. By using the standard trap made from <b>disposable</b> Petri <b>dishes</b> and a dog food-based bait, mite activity was monitored weekly in five dry-cured ham aging rooms from three commercial processing facilities from June 2012 to September 2013. Results indicated that mite numbers in traps in facilities typically had a pattern of sharp decline after fumigation, followed by a steady increase until the next fumigation. Average trap captures varied due to trap location, indicating that traps could be used to identify locations where mite infestation of hams {{may be more likely to}} occur. Experiments were also conducted in 6 m x 3 m climate-controlled rooms to determine the effects of some physical factors on trap capture. Factors such as trap design, trap location, trap distance, duration of trapping, and light conditions had significant effects on mite capture. Mites also responded differently to light emitting diodes of different wavelengths, either as a component of the standard trap or as a stand-alone stimulus to orientation. To determine the relationship between trap capture and mite density, experiments were carried out in the climate-controlled rooms. Mite density was varied but trap number remained constant for all mite densities. There was strong positive correlation between trap capture and mite density. In simulated ham aging rooms, the distribution of mites on hams was determined and different sampling techniques such as vacuum sampling, trapping, rack sampling, ham sampling and absolute mite counts from whole hams were compared and correlated. Results showed weak or moderate correlations between sampling techniques in pairwise comparisons. Two sampling plans were developed to determine the number of samples required to estimate mite density on ham with respect to fixed precision levels or to an action threshold for making pest management decisions. Findings reported here can help in the optimization of trapping and sampling of ham mite populations to help in the development of efficient, cost-effective tools for pest management decisions incorporated with alternatives to methyl bromide...|$|R

It enables us to identify when, how, and where a phenomenon of interest takes place such as gene expression and interaction of molecules. To understand the sequential events happening in the brain, it is of special importance to assess more than one parameter simultaneously. In this protocol, we describe detailed methods of simultaneous and long-term measurement of gene expression and neuronal activity from a cultured brain slice. We introduce bioluminescence imaging using CCD camera for measurement of gene expression and multi-electrode array dish for recording of neuronal activity, which enables us to analyze not only functions in a single cell but also cellular communications. The present bimodal recording system reveals spatiotemporal relationship between gene expression and neuronal activity in a single neuron, which promotes us to understand complex phenomena in the brain. ### Introduction Long-term monitoring of cellular activities of neurons is crucial to understand brain functions in mammals. However, current in vivo monitoring systems such as PET or fMRI are still far from focusing cellular functions, while in vitro monitoring using cultured brain slices presents sometime outcomes difficult to interpret in reference to a specific brain function. With respect to the latter issue, circadian rhythms (ca. 24 h rhythms), is unique. Circadian rhythms are detected not only in a single organism but also in cells and tissues, which enables us to analyze the brain in vitro without missing a functional marker. In mammals, the central clock which generates circadian rhythm and entrains to environmental time cues is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus (1, 2). The unilateral SCN contains about 10, 000 neurons (3) and individual SCN neurons show circadian rhythms in electrical activity, cytosolic Ca 2 +, and gene expressions (4 - 9). However, specific cell networks are required for the expression of circadian rhythm in a tissue level, namely for functioning as the SCN circadian pacemaker. A current hypothesis of circadian rhythm generation in a single cell is a molecular feedback loop composed of several clock genes, such as *Period (Per), Cryptochrom (Cry), Clock* and *Bmal 1 *, and their protein products. The molecular oscillation transmits circadian signals to other cellular functions such as membrane potential and finally to behavioral activity rhythms. In turn, signals from other SCN cells modify the molecular oscillation through intracellular signal transduction (10). To understand the structure and functions of circadian pacemaker in the SCN, a sequential events happing in a single oscillating cell and cellular communication in the SCN should be monitored. Recently, we established simultaneous and long-term measurement of clock gene expression, (Per 1) or clock gene product (PER 2) and electrical activity at a single cell level in a cultured mouse SCN slice (11). We monitored clock gene expression and clock gene product by means of bioluminescence imaging using a luciferase reporter and electrical activity using a Multi-electrode array dish, respectively (11 - 14). The protocol provides useful information to scientists who are interesting in cell and tissue level events not only related to the brain but also other bodily functions. ### Materials 1. Collagen (Cellmatrix, Type I-C, Nitta Gelatin) - Buffer for collagen solution (refer to Table 1) - 10 x DMEM for MED coating with no supplemental materials sterilized with a 0. 22 µm pore size filter (store in 0. 2 ml/ 1. 5 ml tube at - 30 ºC until it is used). - Culturing medium in CO 2 incubator: DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen cat. No. 12100 - 046) + 32. 1 mM NaHCO 3, 20 mg/L kanamycin (Gibco) sterilized with a 0. 22 µm pore size filter. 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) for first 3 days, 5 % culture media supplements after 3 culture day. - Recording medium in air: DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen cat. No. 12100 - 046) + 10 mM HEPES, 2. 7 mM NaHCO 3, 20 mg/L kanamycin (Gibco) sterilized with a 0. 22 µm pore size filter. 5 % culture media supplements. - FBS (Gibco) - Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Sigma, cat. No. H 8264) - Culture media supplements (refer to Table 2) - D-Luciferin potassium salt (Wako, 126 - 05116) ### Equipment 1. MED probe (MED-P 210 A, Alpha med scientific) - MED 64 system (Alpha med scientific) - Tissue chopper (McIlwain) - EM-CCD camera (ImagEM, Hamamatsu photonics) - CO 2 incubator - 100 mm Petri dish - O 2 permeable film (High-sensitivity membrane kit, YSI) - Dissecting microscope - Scalpel blades (No. 10 curved) - Transfer pipette (Falcon) - Laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet ### Procedure - **Preparation of the MED probes** 1. The MED probe is placed in a sterilized <b>disposable</b> Petri <b>dish</b> (100 mm diameter). - Rinse with sterilized distilled water (SDW) three times, and then with 70 % EtOH one time about 15 - 30 min. - Rinse the MED probe again with SDW 3 times, and dry up and expose to UV light for 15 - 30 min. - On the day before culture (or the same day of culture), treat the surface of the MED probe with brief (within one second) and repeated exposures to blue flame to increase its hydrophilicity. Exposure was repeated 8 - 12 times and each exposure followed by cooling for ~ 10 sec. - Put the MED probe in to 4 ºC for about 15 min. - Put collagen Type 1 -C 0. 8 ml (Nitta gelatin; Cellmatrix), x 10 DMEM 0. 1 ml, and buffer (Table 1) 0. 1 ml into the 1. 5 ml tube on ice, and gently mix. - The MED probe is place on a cold pack, and apply the mixed collagen solution into the probe. After evenly wet the whole surface of MED probe, rest of the collagen solution must be removed as much as possible. - Apply SDW in the Petri dish outside of the MED probe to keep moisture. Incubate the MED probe in 37 ºC for 1 - 2 hours to firm the collagen gel. Be sure that the collagen gel is formed by microscopic observation, since collagen some lot of Collagen Type I-C does not form collagen gel. - Rinse with SDW one time, and the MED probe is pre-incubated with culturing medium contained 5 % FBS until it is used. - **SCN slice preparation for long term culturing on the MED probes** - Hypothalamic slices (200 µm thick) containing the SCN are obtained from the hypothalamic block (≈ 2 × 1 x 5 mm) of mice of 2 - 5 days of age using a tissue chopper. - After trimming, hypothalamic slice containing the SCN is placed on the collagen-coated MED probe using a transfer pipette. Set the slice so that the SCN covers the electrodes. - Removed medium on the MED probe, and then the SCN slice is incubated in a CO 2 incubator with 100 % humidity for 1 - 2 h until the slice attaches to the collagen gel. - After 1 - 2 h incubation, add 250 μl culturing medium contained 5 % FBS into the MED probe, and the SCN is incubated in a CO 2 incubator. Half volume of medium (add 250 μl and remove 250 μl) is exchanged every day for first 10 culture days, thereafter medium exchange is performed every other day. For first three days, medium should contain 5 % FBS, but thereafter 5 % of supplement instead of serum. Within a few days, neurites start to extend from the periphery of the explants as shown in Figure 1 b. - **Measurement of clock gene and neuronal activity rhythms from the SCN on the MED probe** - To measure clock gene expression from the SCN neuron, transgenic mice carrying a luciferase reporter are used. Transfection of luciferase reporter may also be used. We used transgenic mice carrying a luciferase reporter listed below. - ・ Per 1 -luc (Per 1 promoter driven luciferase reporter) (14) - ・ PER 2 ::LUC (Luciferase reporter fused to Per 2 protein) (15) - One to three weeks after preparation, recording is started by setting the MED probe with cultured SCN slice in an MED connector. The connector is then placed in the stage-top incubator of a microscope. To keep humidity of and oxygen level for cultured SCN slice stable, the MED probe is sealed with O 2 permeable film by attaching the film {{to the edge of the}} probe wall with silicone grease. 16, Stage-top incubator (280 mm width x 200 mm depth x 70 mm height) is made of an acrylic glass of 8 mm thick. Temperature in the incubator is controlled by circulated warmed air (Figure 1 a). - Bioluminescence is captured by an EM-CCD camera, and microscope should be covered dark box to prevent unnecessary light. Since intensity of bioluminescence is very weak, expose time could vary 20 - 60 min depending on the reporter signals. Bioluminescence imaging of the SCN on the MED probe is shown in Figure 1 b. CCD camera is set at the top or the bottom port of the microscope. For the upright microscope, a CCD camera is set at the top port, and the stage-top incubator needs a whole for the objective lens. The hole should be sealed with insulation foam, and the lens may be warmed with e. g. heating band. For the inverted microscope, a CCD camera is set to the bottom port of the microscope. The stage-top incubator does not need a hole on the top, but the objective lens beneath the MED probe needs to be warmed. Electrodes interrupt the bioluminescence signals when images are taken from the bottom port of the microscope. - Spontaneous firing frequency is counted if an amplitude of an action potential is exceeded a threshold level. In the SCN slice, we set the threshold level to signal to noise ratio ≈ 2. 0. ### Timing - Step 1 - 4 : Pre-treatment for coating: 60 - 90 min - Step 5 - 9 : Collagen coating: 2 - 2. 5 h - Step 10 - 13 : Preparation of SCN slice culture: 15 min per one slice - Step 14 - 18 : Recording: It is possible to record about 2 - 3 weeks without medium exchange. ### Troublshooting For long-term and simultaneous measurements of neuronal activity and bioluminescence from the SCN, the MED probe should be prepared with special care. - 4, Exposure of|$|R
