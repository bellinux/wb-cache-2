R Courtenay (New Zealand). The effects of <b>dipping</b> <b>time,</b> preheat temperature and particle size distribution on coating thickness and surface finish were investigated. Consistent trends in coating thickness growth with <b>dipping</b> <b>time</b> were obtained for both nylon- 11 and polyethylene powders with increases in coating thickness with preheat temperature. For the same preheat temperature, the lower melting point of polyethylene results in thicker coatings compared to those of nylon- 11. There is a negligible change in the coating thickness for sieved powders compared to that for unsieved powders. A pre-heat temperatures of between 240 degrees C and 300 degrees C is necessary to achieve an acceptable surface finish with both nylon- 11 and polyethylene powders. To minimize errors in achieving the desired coating thickness, dipping times shorter than 2 s are not recommended. The use of graphs of coating thickness versus <b>dipping</b> <b>time</b> in combination with the coating surface roughness plots presented in this paper enable the optimal choice of pre-heat temperature and <b>dipping</b> <b>time</b> to achieve acceptable surface finish.

Figure 1 shows the variation of contact angle of the hydroxylated Si(001) surfaces as a function of <b>dipping</b> <b>time</b> in the TPDA solution, which were obtained in this study by using a sessile water drop technique. A clean Si surface has usually a contact angle less than 15 – 20 °, which indicates its hydrophilic nature. As seen in Fig. 1, there was a steep increase in contact angle values when we were interacted these hydrophilic surfaces with the TPDA solution, due to hydrophobic chains of TPDA molecules (or oligomeric forms discussed above). Longer dipping times resulted higher contact angles, but a plateau value was reached around a <b>dipping</b> <b>time</b> of 12 h, which, most probably correspond full coverage of the substrate surface, as also discussed in the related literature recently [25 – 27].

40|$|Solar {{selective}} absorber (SSA) is a layer {{which is}} selective to absorb solar radiation and convert it into maximum heat energy. The {{purpose of this}} research is to synthesize the SSA based on copper nitrate and cobalt nitrate precursor, to determine the influence of molar ratio and <b>dipping</b> <b>times</b> number to absorptance, and emittance of SSA using the sol gel dip coating method [...] Aluminum plates with size of 2 x 4 cm 2 were cleaned using phosphoric acid 10 % by volume at temperature ± 50 oC for 10 minutes and then washed again with distilled water. Sol precursor was prepared by mixing copper nitrate and cobalt nitrate in ethanol solvent and the addition of propionic acid as catalyst and complexing agent. This solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The coatings were synthesized by varying molar ratio of [Cu]/[Co] of 0, 25; 1; and 4 with the number of dipping 1 - 10 times. The coatings then were annealed at temperature of 550 oC for 1 hour. Reflectance spectra in the UV-Vis-NIR show that an increasing number of dipping and decreasing in the molar ratio of [Cu]/[Co] improved the absorptance (). SSA layer with best absorptance i. e. 84, 788 % is synthesized using precursors with a molar ratio of 4 at 10 <b>dipping</b> <b>times,</b> and emittance (ε) generated amount 8, 999 %...|$|R

TiO 2 thin films were synthesized by chemical bath deposition method. Crystallization and phase transitions of thin films were studied by X-ray diffraction.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{lightweight}} 100 % cotton fabric was successfully modified by the sol-gel method to impart high ultraviolet radiation (UVR) blocking property to the fabric surface. The cotton fabric was dipped in the nanosol solution for 1, 5 and 10 minutes, dried at 90 ºC for 10 minutes with thermal post-treatment at 120 ºC for 2 minutes. Comparison of coatings of samples prepared using different <b>dipping</b> <b>time</b> was made. The durability {{of the treatment}} was investigated by performing repeated home laundering. Excellent du-rability of the treatment was obtained, which indicates about good adhesion between the coating and the fabric surface. Before and after laundering tests ultraviolet protective properties of the textile samples were determined according to the standard, results of samples with <b>dipping</b> <b>time</b> 10 minutes show that textiles after treatment with nanosol have excellent ultraviolet protection properties, as well after launder-ing tests (50 washing-drying cycles) still provide excellent ultraviolet protection.

40|$|Perovskite is a {{promising}} light harvester {{for use in}} photovoltaic solar cells. In recent years, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has been dramatically increased, making them a competitive source of renewable energy. An important parameter when designing high efficiency perovskite-based solar cells is the perovskite deposition, which must be performed to create complete coverage and optimal film thickness. This paper describes an in-depth study on two-step deposition, separating the perovskite deposition into two precursors. The effects of spin velocity, annealing temperature, <b>dipping</b> <b>time,</b> and methylammonium iodide concentration on the photovoltaic performance are studied. Observations include that current density is affected by changing the spin velocity, while the fill factor changes mainly due to the <b>dipping</b> <b>time</b> and methylammonium iodide concentration. Interestingly, the open circuit voltage is almost unaffected by these parameters. Hole conductor free perovskite solar cells are used in this work, {{in order to minimize}} other possible effects. This study provides better understanding and control over the perovskite deposition through highly efficient, low-cost perovskite-based solar cells...|$|E
30|$|We {{proposed}} and investigated the electrical and optical properties of undoped Ga 2 O 3 NP layer combined with SWNTs {{by using the}} simple spin and dip-coating methods for deep UV LEDs. From the I-V curve characteristics, the Ga 2 O 3 NP/SWNT layer showed a high current level of 0.4 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 A at 1 V. Compared with the undoped Ga 2 O 3 NP layer, optical transmittance of Ga 2 O 3 NPs/SWNT layer after 15 <b>times</b> of <b>dipping</b> was decreased by only 15 % at 280 nm. By adjusting the <b>dipping</b> <b>times</b> in the Ga 2 O 3 NP/SWNT layer, we obtained improved optical transmittance of 77.0 % at 280 nm after 15 times of dip-coating processes.|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films of}} beta barium borate have been {{prepared}} by liquid phase epitaxy on Si 2 +-doped alpha-BaB 2 O 4 (alpha-BBO, the high temperature phase of barium berate) (001) and (110) substrates. The results of X-ray diffraction indicate that the films show highly (001) preferred orientation on (001) -oriented substrates while the films grown on (110) substrates are textured with (140) orientation. The crystallinity of these films was found to depend on growth temperature, rotation rate, <b>dip</b> <b>time</b> and orientation of substrate. Growth conditions were optimized to grow films with (001) orientation on (001) substrates reproducibly. The films show second harmonic generation of 400 nm light upon irradiation with 800 nm Ti: Sapphire femtosecond laser light. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{movement}} towards integrating complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) into the NHS {{and a growing number}} of general practitioners (GPs) are personally practising CAM to treat their NHS patients (direct integrative practice). While research has begun to examine <b>DIP,</b> <b>time</b> constraints and related issues [...] of importance not only to practitioners but also to those purchasing and planning health care [...] have not yet received in depth attention. In response this paper examines GP therapists 2 ̆ 7 experiences of the clinical reality of their DIP. The analysis reveals how a lack of time is perceived by GP therapists as a serious constraint upon their CAM practice and also how they employ a number of strategies in an attempt to overcome such difficulties...|$|R
