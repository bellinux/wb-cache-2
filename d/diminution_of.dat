The noble gases, except helium and probably neon, as well as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen cause a decrement in mental function, but their effect on psychomotor function (processes affecting the coordination of sensory or cognitive processes and motor activity) varies widely. The effects of carbon dioxide consistently result in a <b>diminution</b> <b>of</b> mental and psychomotor function. The noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon are more narcotic than nitrogen at a given pressure, and xenon has so much anesthetic activity {{that it is a}} usable anesthetic at 80% concentration and normal atmospheric pressure.

5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, coyote fur was {{considered}} worthless. This {{changed with the}} <b>diminution</b> <b>of</b> beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became {{a great source of}} income (75 cents to $1.50 per skin) for wolfers in the Great Plains. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs, but can be used for coats and jackets, scarves, or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making trimmings, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E

Antigonus capitalised on his Peloponnesian victory to wrest back control of Macedonia and become the preeminent power in Greece. The {{establishment}} of Macedonian dominance led to a breakdown of the Spartan-Macedonian alliance. In a bid to further his own royal ambitions, Areus had Sparta join a coalition of Greek poleis and fought Macedon in the Chremonidean War. The war ended in a crushing Spartan defeat with Antigonus defeating and killing his former ally Areus in a battle on the Isthmus of Corinth in 265 BC. The defeat was so disastrous for Sparta that they would not rise to be a regional power until the reign of Cleomenes III thirty years later.|$|E

5|$|Sherman's {{financial}} expertise and {{his friendship with}} Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not consulted party leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step of referring {{all of them to}} committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination after an hour of debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends in the next four years, taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the backlash against the <b>diminution</b> <b>of</b> silver coinage.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of direct election, the new Constitution was seen as such a radical break with the old system, by which delegates were elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make the constitutional change less radical. The more difficult problem was the issue of apportionment. The Connecticut delegation offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each state in the lower house would be apportioned based on the relative size of the state's population, {{while the number of}} representatives in the upper house would be the same for all of the states, irrespective of size. The large states, fearing a <b>diminution</b> <b>of</b> their influence in the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal. Unable to reach agreement, the delegates decided to leave this issue for further consideration later during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|Oil spills {{present a}} {{localized}} threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other <b>diminution</b> <b>of</b> aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if {{the enforcement of}} water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. River otters may be victims of canine distemper, rabies, respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection. In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys).|$|E

60|$|There {{are several}} ways of roofing or {{protecting}} independent walls, according to the means nearest at hand: sometimes the wall has a true roof all to itself; sometimes it terminates in a small gabled ridge, made of bricks set slanting, as constantly {{in the suburbs of}} London; or of hewn stone, in stronger work; or in a single sloping face, inclined to the outside. We need not trouble ourselves at present about these small roofings, which are merely the <b>diminutions</b> <b>of</b> large ones; but we must examine the important and constant member of the wall structure, which prepares it either for these small roofs or for weights above, and is its true cornice.|$|R

5|$|Scholars of {{the late}} army {{have to contend with}} a {{dramatic}} <b>diminution</b> <b>of</b> the epigraphic record in the 3rd and 4th centuries, compared with the 1st and 2nd centuries. diplomas were no longer issued to retiring auxiliaries after 203 (most likely because almost all were already Roman citizens by then). In addition, there was a huge {{reduction in the number of}} tombstones, altars and other dedications by Roman servicemen. Official stamps of military units on building materials (e.g. tiles) are much rarer. But this trend should probably not be seen as indicating a decline in the army's administrative sophistication. Papyrus evidence from Egypt shows that military units continued to keep detailed written records in the 4th century (the vast bulk of which are lost due to organic decomposition). Most likely, the decline in inscriptions is due to changing fashion, in part influenced by the increase in barbarian recruits and the rise of Christianity. The dearth of inscriptions leaves major gaps in our understanding {{of the late}} army and renders many conclusions tentative.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that sulfate fertilisation significantly enhances the content of mustard oil glucosides in glucosinolate containing plants. However, with respect to tissue cultures and in vitro-plants, corresponding data are missing. In this study the influence of sulfur on the accumulation of glucosinolates was analyzed in nasturtium in vitro-plants (Tropaeolum majus). The glucotropaeolin content in plants grown on standard media (MS) varied between 10 and 50 µmol/g DW, corresponding to only about 20 % to 70 % of the glucotropaeolin content in earth grown plants. A fivefold enhance-ment of the sulfate concentration resulted in a massive increase in the glucotropaeolin content of the in vitro-plants. A decline of sulfate in the medium leads to corresponding <b>diminutions</b> <b>of</b> the gluco-sinolates accumulated. These data clearly demonstrate the high impact of sulfur availability on glucosinolate biosynthesis and accumulation...|$|R

40|$|To throw light {{upon the}} {{humification}} process during the heaping of "Sokusei Taihi" method which was deviced before two decades by Agricultural Experiment Station in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, {{for the purpose}} of obtaining well-rotted compost as short time as possible, and recommended up to now, humification process was investigated in the scale of 1 / 1875 of the usual standard process. And the sample taken {{at the end of the}} pre-heaping period, namely after 14 days; the second sample taken in the main-heaping period, namely after 31 days; the third one, after 45 days; the forth one, after 73 days; the fifth one, namely after 99 days were analysed, respectively, on the chemical components by the WAKSMAN'S proximate analysis with some modification. And they were compared with the original sample, and investigated the humification process. The <b>diminutions</b> <b>of</b> dry matter and organic matter in the pre-heaping period, when only lime was applied, are very slow, but the color darkens a little, fat and oil decreases, and the compost becomes emolient. After the addition <b>of</b> nitrogen, the <b>diminutions</b> <b>of</b> them are rapid and cellulose content decreases sooner than that of hemicellulose. The hemicellulose is subtracted from 2 % HCl soluble organic matter residue to give presumably uronic acid, bacterial and fungus slimes and gums. This part increases in main-heaping period, when the microbial activity is vigorous, as shown in Table 1 and then decreases very slowly, and when the compost is applied to soil, this part is presumed to play a roll for the improvement of soil structure. The gradual increase in the base exchange capacity in each sample of rice straw compost as humification proceeds, is estimated that this relates to the increase of the 72 % insoluble matter which is, namely, lignin or lignin-humus complex, and also to the oxidation degree of the lignin-humus complex. And finally, these experiments suggest (cf. Fig. 1) that the 45 th days humification is enough to obtain well-rotted compost of rice straw by "Sokusei Taihi" method. [table...|$|R
