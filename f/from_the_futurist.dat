50|$|Richard Stephen Kirby (July 16, 1949—September 24, 2009) was {{a theologian}} and {{chaplain}} with interests in astronomy, cosmology, and futurology.

50|$|Futurism was {{an early}} twentieth-century {{movement}} in Italy that sought to free <b>the</b> country <b>from</b> what <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> saw as <b>the</b> dead weight of its classical past. <b>The</b> <b>Futurists</b> were preoccupied with the technology and dynamism of modern life. The movement found its expression primarily in literature and art.|$|R
50|$|Given {{its unique}} {{objectives}} and material, {{the practice of}} futures studies only rarely features employment of the scientific method {{in the sense of}} controlled, repeatable and verifiable experiments with highly standardized methodologies. However, many futurists are informed by scientific techniques or work primarily within scientific domains. Borrowing <b>from</b> history, <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> might project patterns observed in past civilizations upon present-day society to model what might happen in the future, or borrowing <b>from</b> technology, <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> may model possible social and cultural responses to an emerging technology based on established principles of the diffusion of innovation. In short, the futures practitioner enjoys the synergies of an interdisciplinary laboratory.|$|R
50|$|His {{poems are}} {{characterized}} by the so-called titanic lyric subject, resulting from the neo-romantic lyrical subject, with the features of Nietzschean superman and Whitman's pantheism. In addition, many poems reveal a strong expressionist influence. Podbevšek's initial enthusiasm for futurism was later attenuated: what remained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> influences was the celebration of art and some stylistical elements, but even those can actually {{be attributed to the}} emerging expressionism. Differently from the futurists, Podbevšek had a highly ambivalent attitude to the war.|$|E
50|$|The title derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> work Future Shock by Alvin Toffler. The hero is a {{survivor}} in a hypothetical world of quickly changing identities, fashions and lifestyles, where individuals are still controlled and oppressed {{by a powerful}} and secretive state apparatus. His highly developed computer skills enable him to use any public telephone to punch in a new identity, thus reinventing himself, within hours. As a fugitive, he must do this {{from time to time}} to escape capture. The title is also a metaphor for survival in an uncertain world.|$|E

40|$|Between 1911 and 1913, two Italian {{brothers}} named Anton Giulio Bragaglia and Arturo Bragaglia produced Futurist photography {{which they}} termed "photodynamism. " These images, {{together with the}} theoretical manifesto Fotodinamismo futurista, represent a remarkable effort in avant-garde photography and theory in the early 20 th century. The Bragaglias' intent in making these photographs was to produce deeply emotional images of modern dynamic motion which convey the spiritual essence of human beings that becomes exteriorized {{in the process of}} physical movement. Through a short, intense campaign in 1913, Umberto Boccioni succeeded in expelling the Bragaglias <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> movement. Because of this, the importance of their photography has often been neglected, underrepresented or misrepresented in scholarship. This thesis offers an alternative reading of the photodynamic project based on its occult foundation and a better sense of how to understand photodynamism {{within the context of the}} movement and the broader history of photography...|$|E
40|$|What would theater history {{look like}} were it written {{backwards}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> banquets and Dali dinners and performance art? Canonical histories of theater take as {{their point of}} departure that which counts as theater in the modern period—namely, theater as an autonomous art form—and search for its "origins " in fused art forms. Central {{to the notion of}} theater as an independent art are plays, and as an indication of the maturing of this form, a dedicated architecture or theater (literally a place of seeing). Canonical theater histories are written with the aim of understanding how modern theater came to be. The search is, understandably, for corollaries in the past. Thus, Oscar G. Brockett’s History of Theatre is a history of drama and its performance: it does not view courtly banquets, tournaments, royal entries, and street pageants as performance genres in their own right but as occasions for plays and playlets. Such histories attend not to the fusion, but to the seeds of what would become an independent art form called theater. It has taken considerable cultural work to isolate the senses, create genres of art specific to each, insist on their autonomy, and cultivate modes of attentiveness that give some senses priority over others. To produce the separate and independent arts that w...|$|E

40|$|Reading Bruce Chatwin's The Songlines, the Australian {{landscape}} appears, in the Dreamtime, like {{a musical}} score {{in which the}} lines of different songs make up a cartography of simultaneity. After centuries of sedentary lifestyle, 20 th Century man lends his ear to his sonic city. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> Luigi Russolo to Murray Schafer, we could draw an arc which would demonstrate the tension of sedentary man's listening. During {{the first half of}} the 20 th Century, man opens his ears to the sounds of the city builds instruments which reproduce the sounds that machines produce. Later, when the hum of the streets is unbearable to him, then his ears will attune to the pressure of the sound and to his ecological and aesthetic analysis. In consequence, a sonic cartography becomes a map which attends to the distribution of a simultaneity of lines which are difficult to reconcile; demonstrating the formation of geographical-sonic strata which correspond to different kinds of classes and cultures. Sonic cartographies are ultimately a guide as to the place where each listener resides in this territory and the way in which he aims to interact with it. Each sonic cartography of a city reveals a multiplicity of cities to the ear. In a sonic cartography the ear recovers its nomadism because the sound is subjected to constant change. Along with sonic/acoustic ecology we would also have to consider what Guattari calls 'mental ecology'. This mental ecology could permit the intoning of the city we want to create and listen t...|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1916, Tristan Tzara took {{distance}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Italian <b>Futurists,</b> rejecting <b>the</b> militarist and proto-fascist stance of their leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Richter notes that, by then, Dada had replaced Futurism {{as the leader}} of modernism, while continuing to build on its influence: [...] "we had swallowed Futurism—bones, feathers and all. It is true that in the process of digestion all sorts of bones and feathers had been regurgitated." [...] Despite this and the fact that Dada did not make any gains in Italy, Tzara could count poets Giuseppe Ungaretti and Alberto Savinio, painters Gino Cantarelli and Aldo Fiozzi, as well as a few other Italian <b>Futurists,</b> among <b>the</b> Dadaists. Among the Italian authors supporting Dadaist manifestos and rallying with the Dada group was the poet, painter and in the future a fascist racial theorist Julius Evola, who became a personal friend of Tzara.|$|R
40|$|In New York City and Paris, two {{well-established}} {{cities with}} rich histories, {{new technology and}} ideas {{at the turn of}} the 20 th century brought a new spirit and significant energy. Scientific progress in construction, manufacturing, and design enabled the development of the urban metropolis, which constituted a drastic change <b>from</b> <b>the</b> old world cities that preceded them. Many artists chose to depict the changing cities, employing different techniques and subject matters to portray the world around them. Two such painters are Robert Delaunay and Joseph Stella, who utilized innovative technological structures as vehicles for their opinions and expressions concerning modern life and the changing image of the city. Delaunay and Stella focused almost exclusively on the Eiffel Tower and the Brooklyn Bridge, which became both beloved symbols of the specific cities and independently venerated technological accomplishments. The worship of such structures, and more inclusively, all things modern, was denoted “modernolatry,” a term borrowed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Italian <b>Futurists...</b>|$|R
