25|$|Patent {{infringement}} typically {{is caused}} by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. The scope of the patented invention or the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> is defined in {{the claims of the}} granted patent. There is safe harbor in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research. This safe harbor does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes, or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug. In general, patent infringement cases are handled under civil law (e.g., in the United States) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also (for example, Argentina, China, France, Japan, Russia, South Korea).|$|E

"Limitation {{proceedings}} {{would enable}} patentees to narrow down the protection conferred by a patent post-grant {{by means of}} a simple, quick and inexpensive administrative procedure.

Using the limitation procedure, patent proprietors may themselves reduce the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>protection</b> claimed in a manner which is binding, and thus generally preclude disputes over the validity of a patent.

40|$|The {{recognized}} role of caspases as executioners of apoptosis, led us {{to investigate}} their involvement in death responses induced by okadaic acid (OA) in HeLa S- 3 and MCF- 7 cells. A one-day treatment with OA induced accumulation of the 85 kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) fragment in cell lysates but the response was prevented if cells were treated with OA {{in the presence of}} the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-FMK and Z-DEVD-FMK. The HeLa S- 3 and MCF- 7 cells were found to contain measurable levels of the intact caspase- 2, - 7, -g and - 9 zymogens, whereas caspase- 3 was found only in HeLa cells. After one day of OA treatment, pro-caspase- 2, - 3, - 7 and - 9 isoforms were found processed in HeLa cells, whereas only pro-caspase- 2 was processed in MCF- 7 cells. Pro-caspase- 8, in turn, was mostly unprocessed in both cell lines. The possible interference of caspase inhibitors on cell death was also evaluated, and we found that both Z-VAD-FMK and Z-DEVD-FMK could contribute different <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> MCF- 7 and HeLa cells from toxic effects caused by OA. We concluded that OA triggers multiple pathways of caspase processing, contributing to death responses triggered by OA in HeLa S 3 and MCF- 7 cells. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
