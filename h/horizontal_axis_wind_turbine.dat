50|$|The loads on both {{horizontal}} axis wind turbines (HAWTs) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are cyclic; that is, the thrust and torque {{acting on the}} blades is dependent on where the blade is.

40|$|The {{increasing}} size of <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Axis</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines</b> and {{the trend}} to install wind farms further offshore demand more robust design options. If the pitch {{system could be}} eliminated, the availability of <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Axis</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines</b> should increase. This research investigates the use of active stall control to regulate power production in replacement of the pitch system. A feasibility study is conducted using a blade element momentum code and taking the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5 MW turbine as baseline case. Considering half of the blade span is equipped with actuators, the required change in the lift coefficient to regulate power was estimated in Cl = 0 : 7. Three actuation technologies are investigated, namely Boundary Layer Transpiration, Trailing Edge Jets and Dielectric Barrier Discharge actuators. Results indicate {{the authority of the}} actuators considered is not sufficient to regulate power, since the change in the lift coefficient is not large enough. Active stall control of <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Axis</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines</b> appears feasible only if the rotor is re-designed from the start to incorporate active-stall devices.

50|$|A {{panemone}} windmill {{is a type}} {{of vertical}} axis wind turbine. It has a rotating axis positioned vertically, while the wind-catching blades move parallel to the wind. By contrast, the shaft of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> (HAWT) points into the wind while its blades move at right-angles to the wind's thrust. That is, a panemone primarily uses drag whereas the blades of a HAWT use lift.|$|E
50|$|A fixed-speed HAWT (<b>Horizontal</b> <b>Axis</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbine)</b> {{inherently}} increases its {{angle of}} attack at higher wind speed as the blades speed up.

However, {{on some of these}} blade sets, it was observed that the degree of blade pitch tended to increase audible noise levels.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{model for}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> (HAWT) aerodynamics is blade element momentum (BEM) theory.

This allows the rotor blade to be analyzed in sections, where the resulting forces are summed over all sections to get the overall forces of the rotor. The theory uses both axial and angular momentum balances to determine the flow and the resulting forces at the blade.|$|E

50|$|CWATs {{are a new}} acronym that {{encompasses}} the class of machines formerly known as DAWTs (diffuser augmented wind turbines).

In the 1990s the Grumman technology was licensed to a New Zealand company, Vortec Wind.

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are designed}} to deliver optimal power at rated wind speeds. Site specific designs, therefore are highly desirable. Lift based turbines are more efficient than stall based turbines. Stall regulated turbines require suitable section profiles. However, the three dimensional effects dominated by rotation are not properly understood. The wind turbine blades are highly flexible. Aeroelastic analysis incorporating both structural dynamics and computational fluid dynamics forms {{the basis of this}} study. Of many effects, the blade flexibility plays a crucial role in optimal design. This requires a good understanding of the aeroelastic behavior of turbine rotors. Effect of flexibility on turbine performance is still unexplored. Following the demand for lighter blades, new composite materials and advanced fabrication methods were introduced, resulting in reduced structural damping, a property which until recently was not possible to model and enhance. Therefore it is necessary to accurately construct the computational model of the wind turbine blade. This report describes the structural modeling of a wind turbine blade similar to NAL's 500 kW low speed <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> blade designed for Indian wind conditions.
