5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, {{there is no doubt}} that the <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E
5|$|The spells of the Book of the Dead {{made use}} of several magical {{techniques}} which {{can also be seen}} in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of spells are for magical amulets, which would protect the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a Book of the Dead papyrus, these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy. Everyday magic {{made use of}} amulets in huge numbers. Other items in direct contact with the body in the tomb, such as headrests, were also considered to have amuletic value. A number of spells also refer to Egyptian beliefs about the magical <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> saliva.|$|E
5|$|The {{kings and}} queens regnant of England and the kings of France were the only Christian rulers who claimed the divine gift (divinitus) to cure by {{touching}} or stroking the diseased. This special aptitude {{was thought to be}} evidence of God's high esteem of the two monarchies, though they never agreed upon whose predecessors the ability was first conferred. In England, Saint Edward the Confessor (r. 1042–1066) was said to be the first monarch to possess the <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the royal touch. The French, who normally traced the origins of their monarchs' divine gift back to Philip I (r. 1059–1108) or even Robert II (r. 987–1031), denied that Saint Edward used the royal touch. They insisted that the first English monarch to claim the ability was Henry I (r. 1100–1135), and that his touching was a politically influenced imitation of the gift granted exclusively to French monarchs.|$|E

25|$|Some {{critics are}} {{skeptical of the}} <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> psychotherapeutic relationships.

25|$|In antiquity and the Middle Ages, most Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the Orient {{believed}} in the protective and <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> amulets or blessed objects. Talismans used by these peoples {{can be broken down}} into three main categories: talismans carried or worn on the body, talismans hung upon or above the bed of an infirm person, and medicinal talismans. This third category can be further divided into external and internal talismans. For example, an external amulet can be placed in a bath.|$|E

25|$|The {{early life}} of Saint Martin {{was written by}} Sulpicius Severus, who knew him personally. It expresses the {{intimate}} closeness the 4th-century Christian felt with the Devil in all his disguises, and has many accounts of miracles. Some follow familiar conventions— casting out devils, raising the paralytic and the dead. Others are more unusual: turning back the flames from a house while Martin was burning down the Roman temple it adjoined; deflecting {{the path of a}} felled sacred pine; the <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> a letter written from Martin.|$|E
25|$|The rich, gilded {{ornaments}} of the iconostasis are Jankovits' real style-marks. He {{worked with}} lime wood, and carved his decorative elements in two artistic styles: Zopf style appears in vivid plant motifs; and Classicism {{is represented by}} geometrical patterns, like the ribbons on pilasters or the carved tassels on the doors. The foliage usually has additional significance in ecclesiastical art. Acanthus leaves, the most common motifs on the iconostasis, symbolize heaven and the eternal life. Olive {{plays an important role}} in Biblical stories and it has many religious aspects too. There are two large olive branches under the Calvary scene, on the top of the icon screen. It represents peace in the first place, but in the Old Testament it stands for blessing, wisdom, trust, faith in God, and grace of God too, in the story of Noah. The olive is the tree of life in Paradise, and it also refers to the <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the Blessed Virgin Mary, especially in Eastern rites where Mary's veneration plays an important role. Grape motifs decorate the icon frames and the holy doors. The Bible contains many examples of the symbolical meaning of vines and grapes. They can symbolize peace and well-being, and might refer to Israel, but in most cases the vine is a symbol of Jesus, its fruits representing the Apostles. Following the same symbolism, the vine can also refer to Mary, whose fruit is Jesus. The most common flower of the carved festoons is the rose, which is the symbol of Mary in Christian art. Tulips, the flower of the virginity and purity, appear in the festoons as well beside the rose heads.|$|E

500|$|Hippocratic {{medicine}} was humble and passive. The therapeutic approach {{was based on}} [...] "the <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> nature" [...] ("vis medicatrix naturae" [...] in Latin). According to this doctrine, the body contains within itself the power to re-balance the four humours and heal itself (physis). Hippocratic therapy focused on simply easing this natural process. To this end, Hippocrates believed [...] "rest and immobilization [...] of capital importance." [...] In general, the Hippocratic {{medicine was}} very kind to the patient; treatment was gentle, and emphasized keeping the patient clean and sterile. For example, only clean water or wine were ever used on wounds, though [...] "dry" [...] treatment was preferable. Soothing balms were sometimes employed.|$|E
