We use an accurate equation of state and wide opacity grids which combine the Rosseland and Planck absorption means through a depth-dependent weighting function. The numerical method is based on single side shooting and incorporates algorithms designed for stiff initial value problems. A few properties of the model are discussed for a circumstellar disc around a sun-like star and a <b>disc</b> <b>feeding</b> a 10 8 M ⊙ central black hole.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to specify the impact of structural and operational parameters of the centrifugal disc spreader on the spatial distribution of fertilizer varied in terms of physical properties (urea, ammonium sulfate, nitrochalk). The spatial distribution was characterized by parameters of the stationary spread pattern in the polar coordinate system: average angle and average radius of the stationary spread pattern of fertilizer. In the study, the selected parameters which significantly affecting spread quality were: rotation speed of the <b>disc,</b> <b>feed</b> position of fertilizer on the disc and the vanes angle on the disc. In order to determinate the impact on spatial distribution, the results were statistically analyzed based on the analysis of variance.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. This paper examines the temperature profiles and flow characteristics of thin liquid films on a rotating surface {{by means of an}} Infrared (IR) thermal imaging camera. The challenges of obtaining accurate temperature measurements using thermographic techniques, in particular for thin liquid films of varying thicknesses, are outlined in this study. The captured images of the liquid film provide a visual insight into the heat transfer mechanism as the cold liquid moves from centre of a rotating disc towards its edges. The effect of liquid film viscosity, rotational speed, <b>feed</b> flowrate and <b>disc</b> temperature on heat transfer efficiency from the heated disc to the cold film is investigated. The temperature profiles obtained by the Infrared camera are compared to those estimated by a theoretical model of disc/film heat transfer. The results provide an excellent platform for qualitative analysis of heating thin liquid films in highly accelerated centrifugal fields. The quantitative analysis is, however, associated with some degrees of uncertainty due to the limitations described in this paper. mp 201...|$|R
40|$|I {{review the}} recent {{progresses}} {{that have been}} obtained, especially {{through the use of}} high-resolution numerical simulations, on the dynamics of self-gravitating accretion discs. A coherent picture is emerging, where the disc dynamics is controlled by a small number of parameters that determine whether the disc is stable or unstable, whether the instability saturates in a self-regulated state or runs away into fragmentation, and whether the dynamics is local or global. I then apply these concepts to the case of AGN discs, discussing the implications of such evolution on the feeding of supermassive black holes. Nonfragmenting, self-gravitating discs appear to play a fundamental role in the process of formation of massive black hole seeds at high redshift (∼ 10 – 15) through direct gas collapse. On the other hand, the different cooling properties of the interstellar gas at low redshifts determine a radically different behaviour for the outskirts of the accretion <b>discs</b> <b>feeding</b> typical AGNs. Here the situation is much less clear from a theoretical point of view, and while several observational clues point to the important role of massive discs at a distance of roughly a parsec from their central black hole, their dynamics is still under debate...|$|R
40|$|We use a suite {{a cooling}} halo {{simulations}} {{to study a}} new mechanism for rapid accretion of hot halo gas onto star-forming galaxies. Correlated supernovae events create converging 'superbubbles' in the halo gas. Where these collide, the density increases, driving cooling filaments of low metallicity gas that <b>feed</b> the <b>disc.</b> At our current numerical resolution (20 pc) we are only able to resolve the most dramatic events; these could {{be responsible for the}} build-up of galaxy discs after the most massive gas-rich mergers have completed (z < 1). As we increase the numerical resolution, we find that the filaments persist for longer, driving continued late-time star formation. This suggests that SNe-driven accretion could act as an efficient mechanism for extracting cold gas from the hot halo, driving late-time star formation in disc galaxies. We show that such filament feeding leads to a peak star formation rate (SFR) of ∼ 3 M_ sun yr^- 1, consistent with estimates for the Milky Way. By contrast, direct cooling from the hot halo ('hot-mode' accretion, not present in the simulations that show filament feeding) falls short of the SNe-driven SFR by a factor of 3 - 4, and is sustained over a shorter time period. The filaments we resolve extend to ∼ 50 kpc, reaching column densities of ∼ 10 ^ 18 cm^- 2. We show that such structures can plausibly explain the broad dispersion in Mg II absorption seen along sight lines to quasars. Our results suggest a dual role for stellar feedback in galaxy formation, suppressing hot-mode accretion while promoting cold-mode accretion along filaments. This ultimately leads to more star formation, suggesting that the positive feedback effect outweighs the negative. Finally, since the filamentary gas has higher angular momentum than that coming from hot-mode accretion, we show that this leads to the formation of substantially larger gas discs.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new application of electropolishing using a low-cost disc-form electrode offering fast {{improvement of the}} surface roughness of SKD 61. It requires no expensive special-purpose equipment or heavy material removal as conventional electrochemical machining does, and it also avoids the complex pre-polishing of the workpiece before the electropolishing. Round bars or round tubes produced by traditional turning, drawing, form rolling, or extrusion, can be successively electropolished using the designed disc-form electrodes. Five electrode designs are discussed. The experimental parameters include rotational speed of workpiece, electrical current rating and pulse period, electrode geometry, and electrode <b>feed</b> rate. Thinner <b>disc</b> and larger disc taper angle are associated with larger discharge space for the electrode, thus the polishing is more effective. A smaller end radius of the disc electrode produces higher current density and provides faster feed rate and a better polishing effect. A disc with discharge flute performs better, and larger flute back rake angle, side rake angle, wider flute, and deeper flute depth are also advantageous. Although the use of pulsed current slightly outperforms the fluted electrode using continuous current, it sacrifices both machining time and cost. The best electrode design is identified.

TMT promoter–b-glucuronidase plants {{revealed that the}} TONOPLAST MONOSACCHARIDE TRANSPORTER 1 (TMT 1) and TMT 2 genes exhibit a tissue- and cell type–specific expression pattern, whereas TMT 3 is only weakly expressed. TMT 1 and TMT 2 expression is induced by drought, salt, and cold treatments and by sugar. During cold adaptation, tmt knockout lines accumulated less glucose and fructose compared with wild-type plants, whereas no differences were observed for sucrose. Cold adaptation of wild-type plants substantially promoted glucose uptake into isolated leaf mesophyll vacuoles. Glucose uptake into isolated vacuoles was inhibited by NH 4 þ, fructose, and phlorizin, indicating that transport is energy-dependent and that both glucose and fructose were {{taken up by the}} same carrier. Glucose import into vacuoles from two cold-induced tmt 1 knockout lines or from triple knockout plants was substantially lower than into corresponding wild-type vacuoles. Monosaccharide <b>feeding</b> into leaf <b>discs</b> revealed the strongest response to sugar in tmt 1 knockout lines compared with wild-type plants, suggesting that TMT 1 is required for cytosolic glucose homeostasis.

This process utilises centrifugal force to break up molten slag into droplets, which are then quenched into solidified granules by a flow of cold air. In this process the sensible heat of slag is recovered as hot air. In the present work, a previously developed steady-state, two-dimensional and multiphase CFD model was applied to perform parametric numerical experiments to investigate {{the effects of a}} number of parameters on the liquid film thickness at the disc edge, which included liquid mass <b>feeding</b> (pouring) rate, <b>disc</b> spinning speed, disc radius, liquid viscosity, density and surface tension.

To reduce the number of simulations needed, Box and Behnken's fractional factorial design of numerical experiment was adopted. Furthermore, in order for the modelling results to be applicable to atomisation of different liquids using spinning discs of different sizes, a dimensionless correlation was developed based on dimensional analysis of the numerical simulation data. The modelling results indicate that the liquid film thickness can be significantly influenced by the disc radius and spinning speed, the liquid mass feeding rate, viscosity and density, whereas the liquid surface tension has a negligible effect...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new analytical {{model for the}} accretion of particles from a rotating and charged spherical shell of dilute collisionless plasma onto a rotating and charged black hole. By assuming a continuous injection of particles at the spherical shell and by treating the black hole and a featureless accretion disc located in the equatorial plane as passive sinks of particles we build a stationary accretion model. This may then serve as a toy model for plasma <b>feeding</b> an accretion <b>disc</b> around a charged and rotating black hole. Therefore, our new model is a direct generalization of the analytical accretion model introduced by E. Tejeda, P. A. Taylor, and J. C. Miller (2013). We use our generalized model to analyze {{the influence of a}} net charge of the black hole, which will in general be very small, on the accretion of plasma. Within the assumptions of our model we demonstrate that already a vanishingly small charge of the black hole may in general still have a non-negligible effect on the motion of the plasma, as long as the electromagnetic field of the plasma is still negligible. Furthermore, we argue that the inner and outer edges of the forming accretion disc strongly depend on the charge of the accreted plasma. The resulting possible configurations of accretion discs are analyzed in detail...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{long-term}} behaviour of the equatorial disc of the Be/X-ray binary X Persei (X Per), combining new low-resolution IUE spectra and IR photometry with UV, optical and IR observations {{collected from the}} literature. We find that the near-UV continuum level of X Per varies along with the optical brightness. From the UV observations, we also find that during optical high states the flux excess due to the intrinsic stellar variability and/or electron scattering in the disc is at most 15 - 20 per cent of the photospheric flux. From the data taken in discless and near-discless states (optical low states) we show that the stellar photosphere can be modelled with T-eff = 31000 K and log g = 4. With this model we derive E(B - V) = 0. 39, and estimate the distance to X Per as 950 +/- 200 pc (assuming R-* = 9 R.). We fit the (quasi-) simultaneous optical and IR photometry with a simple disc model including free-bound and free-free radiation. We find that {{the density of the}} disc at the photosphere of the star varies along with the brightness of X Per, and that in optical high states the disc in X Per is among the densest of all Be stars: rho(0) = (1. 5 +/- 0. 3) x 10 (- 10) g cm(- 3). The disc density at the photosphere varies by a factor of at least 20 from optical high to low states. During disc build-up and break-down phases, and also in phases when the disc is relatively stable, we find a very steep radial density gradient of the disc of X Per. This may reflect the limitations of some of the assumptions in our model. We find that in a disc-loss event the disc loses mass {{at a rate of about}} 5 x 10 (- 9) M. yr(- 1). For a disc build-up phase we find a disc-mass growth rate of about 4 x 10 (- 9) M. yr(- 1).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of a disc galaxy forming in a high-resolution fully cosmological simulation to investigate the nature of the outer regions of discs and their relevance for the disc formation process. Specifically, we focus on the phenomenon of misaligned disc components and find that the outer disc warp is a consequence of the misalignment between the inner disc and the surrounding hot gaseous halo. As the infalling cold gas sinks toward the centre of the galaxy, it is strongly torqued by the hot gas halo. By the time the fresh gas reaches the central disc-forming region its angular momentum is completely aligned with the spin of the hot gas halo. If the spin of the hot gas halo, in turn, is not aligned with that of the inner disc, a misaligned outer disc forms comprised of newly accreted material. The inner and outer components are misaligned with each other because they respond differently to infalling substructure and accretion. The warped <b>disc</b> <b>feeds</b> the main gas disc due to viscous angular momentum losses, but small amounts of star formation in the warp itself form a low-metallicity thick disc. We show that observations of resolved stellar populations in warped galaxies in the local universe could provide evidence for the presence of these processes and therefore indirectly reveal ongoing gas accretion and the existence of hot gas halos.

Previously, we reported induction of RNA interference effects in B. cockerelli via in vitro-prepared dsRNA/siRNAs after intrathoracic injection, and after feeding of artificial diets containing these effector RNAs. In order to deliver RNAi effectors via plant hosts and to rapidly identify effective target sequences in plant-feeding B. cockerelli, here we developed a plant virus vector-based in planta system for evaluating candidate sequences. We show that recombinant Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) containing B. cockerelli sequences can efficiently infect and generate small interfering RNAs in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), tomatillo (Physalis philadelphica) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants, and more importantly delivery of interfering sequences via TMV induces RNAi effects, as measured by actin and V-ATPase mRNA reductions, in B. cockerelli feeding on these plants. RNAi effects were primarily detected in the B. cockerelli guts. In contrast to our results with TMV, recombinant Potato virus X (PVX) and Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) did not give robust infections in all plants and did not induce detectable RNAi effects in B. cockerelli.

40|$|Quasar microlensing effects make it {{possible}} to measure the accretion disc sizes around distant supermassive black holes that are still well beyond the spatial resolution of contemporary instrumentation. The sizes measured with this technique appear inconsistent with the standard accretion disc model. Not only are the measured accretion disc sizes larger, but their dependence on wavelength is in most cases completely different from the predictions of the standard model. We suggest that these discrepancies may arise not from non-standard accretion disc structure or systematic errors, as it was proposed before, but rather from scattering and reprocession of the radiation of the disc. In particular, the matter falling from the gaseous torus and presumably <b>feeding</b> the accretion <b>disc</b> may at certain distances become ionized and produce an extended halo that is free from colour gradients. A simple analytical model is proposed assuming that a geometrically thick translucent inflow acts as a scattering mirror changing the apparent spatial properties of the disc. This inflow may be also identified with the broad line region or its inner parts. Such a model is able to explain the basic properties of the apparent disc sizes, primarily their large values and their shallow dependence on wavelength. The only condition required is to scatter significant portion of the luminosity of the disc. This can easily be fulfilled if the scattering inflow has large geometrical thickness and clumpy structure. Comment: accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics; 13 pages, 8 figures, one tabl...|$|R

This study examines asexual propagation as a method for culturing a geographically widespread and commonly traded species of host sea anemone, Entacmaea quadricolor. Two experiments were done: the first to establish whether size or colour morph influenced survival after cutting into halves or quarters; and the second to see whether feeding was needed to maximise survival and growth after cutting. Survival rates were high in both experiments, with 89. 3 and 93. 8 % of the anemones cut in half, and 62. 5 and 80. 4 % cut in quarters surviving in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Anemones that were cut in half were larger in size, and healed and grew quicker than those cut in quarters.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of XMM–Newton observations of 11 Seyfert galaxies {{that appear to be}} missing a broad iron Kα line. These objects represent a challenge to the established paradigm for active galactic nuclei, where a relatively cold accretion <b>disc</b> <b>feeds</b> the central black hole. In that paradigm, X-ray illumination of the accretion disc should lead to continuum and fluorescence emission from iron which is broadened and shifted by relativistic effects close to the hole. We extend the work of Nandra et al., who found no evidence for such a component in an earlier analysis of these objects, by testing a variety of more complex relativistic reflection models. Specifically, we consider the possibility that the disc is highly ionized, and/or that the reflection is heavily blurred by strong relativistic effects in a Kerr geometry. We find that in 8 / 11 of the observations with no apparent broad iron line, the fit is significantly improved when an ionized or strongly blurred reflector is included, and that all 11 observations allow for such a component. The disc inclinations are found generally to be around 60 ◦, which when combined with a steep emissivity profile results in strong relativistic blurring of the reflection, rendering the Kα line difficult to distinguish from the underlying continuum. Nevertheless, relativistic reflection does appear to be present, and the strength of the smeared reflection is similar to that expected from a flat disc illuminated by a point source. Such blurred reflection and the associated steep radial emissivity profiles are consistent with the gravitational light bending of the continuum photons close to the black hole...|$|R

Simple spherically symmetric models of SMBH feedback at the Eddington luminosity can successfully explain the Mbh–σ and nuclear cluster mass MNC–σ correlations, as well as why larger bulges host SMBH while smaller ones host nuclear star clusters. However, these models do not specify how SMBH feed on infalling gas whilst simultaneously producing feedback that drives gas out of the galaxy.

40|$|Gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray flares are {{believed}} to mark the late-time activity of the central engine. We compute the temporal evolution of the average flare luminosity in the common rest-frame energy band of 44 GRBs taken from the large Swift 5 -yr data base. Our work {{highlights the importance of}} a proper consideration of the threshold of detection of flares against the contemporaneous continuous X-ray emission. In the time-interval 30 < t < 1000 s, we find ∝ t^(− 2. 7 ± 0. 1); this implies that the flare isotropic energy scaling is Eiso,flare ∝ t^(− 1. 7). The decay of the continuum underlying the flare emission closely tracks the average flare luminosity evolution, with a typical flare-to-steep-decay luminosity ratio Lflare/Lsteep = 4. 7. This suggests that flares and continuum emission are deeply related to one another. We infer on the progenitor properties considering different models. According to the hyperaccreting black hole scenario, the average flare luminosity scaling can be obtained in the case of rapid accretion (t_acc<<t) or when the last∼ 0. 5 M_sun of the original 14 -M_sun progenitor star is accreted. Alternatively, the steep ∝ t^(− 2. 7) behaviour could be triggered by a rapid outward expansion of an accretion shock in the material <b>feeding</b> a convective <b>disc.</b> If instead we assume the engine to be a rapidly spinning magnetar, then its rotational energy can be extracted to power a jet whose luminosity is likely to be between the monopole (L ∝ e^(− 2 t)) and dipole (L ∝ t^(− 2)) cases.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} proposed that giant protoplanets migrating inward through the disc {{more rapidly than}} they contract could be tidally disrupted when they fill their Roche lobes ~ 0. 1 AU away from their parent protostars. Here we consider the process of mass and angular momentum exchange between the tidally disrupted planet and the surrounding disc in detail. We find that the planet's adiabatic mass-radius relation {{and its ability to}} open a deep gap in the disc determine whether the disruption proceeds as a sudden runaway or a balanced quasi-static process. In the latter case the planet <b>feeds</b> the inner <b>disc</b> through its Lagrangian L 1 point like a secondary star in a stellar binary system. As the planet loses mass it gains specific angular momentum and normally migrates in the outward direction until the gap closes. Numerical experiments show that planet disruption outbursts are preceded by long "quiescent" periods during which the disc inward of the planet is empty. The hole in the disc is created when the planet opens a deep gap, letting the inner disc to drain onto the star while keeping the outer one stalled behind the planet. We find that the mass-losing planet embedded in a realistic protoplanetary disc spawns an extremely rich set of variability patterns. In a subset of parameter space, there is a limit cycle behaviour caused by non-linear interaction between the planet mass loss and the disc hydrogen ionisation instability. We suggest that tidal disruptions of young massive planets near their stars may be responsible for the observed variability of young accreting protostars such as FU Ori, EXor and T Tauri stars in general.

In addition to direct mortality by typical acute toxicity (lethal effect), insecticides may also impair various key biological traits of the exposed insects through physiological and behavioral sublethal effects. Identifying and characterizing such effects could be crucial for understanding the global effects of insecticides on the pest and therefore for optimizing its management in the crops. We assessed the effects of sublethal and low-lethal concentrations of four widely used insecticides on the fecundity, honeydew excretion and feeding behavior of B. tabaci adults. [br/] The probing activity of the whiteflies feeding on treated cotton seedlings was recorded by an Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG). The results showed that imidacloprid and bifenthrin caused a reduction in phloem feeding even at sublethal concentrations. In addition, the honeydew excretions and fecundity levels of adults <b>feeding</b> on leaf <b>discs</b> treated with these concentrations were significantly lower than the untreated ones. While, sublethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos and carbosulfan did not affect feeding behavior, honeydew excretion and fecundity of the whitefly.

Our results show that aside from the lethal effect, the sublethal concentration of imidacloprid and bifenthrin impairs the phloem feeding, i. e. the most important feeding trait in a plant protection perspective. Indeed, this antifeedant property would give these insecticides potential to control insect pests indirectly. Therefore, the behavioral effects of sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid and bifenthrin may play an important role in the control of whitefly pests by increasing the toxicity persistence in treated crops...|$|R

Data indicated that the lowest relative consumption rate (RCR) and the relative growth rate (RGR) were recorded using acetone extract at 10 % for leaf discs bioassay (5. 88 ± 0. 75 and 0. 07 ± 0. 05 mg/mg/day, respectively). The efficiency of the conversion of ingested food (ECI) and the efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) were significantly lowered using methanol extract at 10 % in artificial diet bioassay (2. 5 ± 0. 58 and 2. 55 ± 0. 6 %, respectively). The highest approximate digestibility (AD) of S. littoralis larvae was found in both extracts for the artificial diet bioassay. Moreover, larvae exposed to 10 % methanol extract in artificial diet test exhibited a delayed growth rate by 17. 7 days, relative to control at the same concentration, compared to 5. 7 days noted using acetone extract in leaf disc test. The antifeedant activity, growth and metabolism parameters are appropriate tools in feeding tests and extracts’ activity evaluation. They could provide profound understanding of the choice of the best plant extracts that could be proposed as bioinsecticides in a more environmentfriendly approach...|$|R
40|$|The cottonwood leaf beetle, Chrysomela scripta F. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most serious defoliators of Populus plantations in North America. This research was conducted to understand the relationship between poplar leaf secondary chemicals and adult beetle feeding preferences;Leaf surface chemicals from a cottonwood leaf beetle-preferred poplar clone, 2 ̆ 7 Eugenei 2 ̆ 7 (Populus deltoides x Populus nigra), was found to induce feeding in the adult cottonwood leaf beetle. The feeding stimulants were isolated and identified as n-beheryl alcohol (C 22), n-lignoceryl alcohol (C 24), n-hexacosanol (C 26), n-octacosanol (C 28), n-triacontanol (C 30), and [alpha]-tocopherylquinone ([alpha]-TQ), (2 -(3 -hydroxy- 3, 7, 11, 15 -tetramethyl-hexadecyl) - 3, 5, 6 -trimethyl- 3 ̆c 1, 43 ̆ebenzoquinone). It is the first time that long chain fatty alcohols and [alpha]-TQ have been identified as cottonwood leaf beetle adult feeding stimulants. And it is the first time that [alpha]-TQ has been reported as a feeding stimulant for an insect. Fatty alcohols or [alpha]-TQ alone do not induce beetle feeding significantly, but a mixture of alcohols and [alpha]-TQ synergistically stimulates beetle feeding;Field-planted University of Washington poplar pedigree materials (parent clones ILL- 129, Populus deltoides, and 93 - 968, Populus trichocarpa, F, clones, 53 - 242 and 53 - 246, and 87 F 2 selections) were used for leaf <b>disc</b> <b>feeding</b> tests. Field cage feeding tests were performed with parent and F 1 clones. Leaf surface chemicals, long chain fatty alcohols and [alpha]-TQ, and the phenolic glycosides tremulacin and salicortin were analyzed to correlate chemical abundance with cottonwood leaf beetle adult feeding preference. The beetles showed varied feeding preferences among parent clones, F 1 clones, and F 2 clones. Contents of the alcohols or the phenolic glucosides did not explain adult beetle feeding preference. Content of [alpha]-TQ on the leaf surface, in the presence of the alcohols, could explain the adult beetle feeding preference. The beetle preferred to feed on clones with [alpha]-TQ rather than on clones without [alpha]-TQ. As the amount of [alpha]-TQ increased, the feeding preference increased, and then decreased as the amount of [alpha]-TQ increased further...|$|R
40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) of {{the families}} steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae are a promising prospective control agent of the large pine weevil, Hylobius abietis L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a major pest in Irish forestry. Applications of EPN to tree stumps in Ireland and the UK {{have been shown to}} significantly reduce adult H. abietis populations emerging from the stumps. To date however, little work had been done on the host-finding abilities of applied EPN in the field and how those EPN will interact with adult H. abietis either already on site or those that emerge from the stumps. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the behavioural interactions between two EPN species and adult H. abietis and to assess one of the methods used to investigate the impact of applied EPN strains on the indigenous EPN population. To investigate if adult H. abietis react to the presence of EPN, one thousand nematodes were applied to the head region of adult weevils and grooming responses were recorded (Chapter 3). Insects that had Steinernema carpocapsae applied on average groomed for significantly longer (44. 16 seconds), than those that had Heterorhabditis downesi applied (11. 33 seconds). In order to gain an insight into the possible cause of these different insect reactions to these two EPN species observations of nematode behaviour on adult H. abietis were carried out (Chapter 3). Infective juveniles (IJs) of S. carpocapsae {{were more likely to be}} observed standing or moving across the body of the insect while H. downesi IJs were more likely to be observed not moving. It is thought that this difference in behaviour has caused the differences observed in H. abietis grooming reactions. Adult H. abietis were tested to see if the presence of EPN in the substrate would alter the amount of time the insects would take to leave the area (Chapter 3). There was no difference found in the time taken to leave S. carpocapsae or H. downesi treated substrates when compared to controls. The impact of EPN presence in the substrate on H. abietis feeding was also investigated (Chapter 3). Steinernema carpocapsae was found to reduce the level of <b>feeding</b> on bark <b>discs</b> after two days when compared to controls in a choice test. This difference was not found with H. downesi or after two days post-application with either nematode species. Adult H. abietis that had been exposed to EPN did not significantly change the amount of <b>feeding</b> on bark <b>discs</b> compared to non-exposed controls (Chapter 3). In all nematode treatments, infected weevils fed more than non-infected weevils in that treatment. Weevils that died during the assay fed more than those that did not die when exposed to a low dose of H. downesi but not in the other EPN treatments. As weevils that died that were not exposed to EPN also fed more it is thought that this is not due to nematode exposure. Weevils were able to mount an immune response to both S. carpocapsae and H. downesi as encapsulated IJs of each species were found upon dissection of the exposed insects. Foraging strategies of entomopathogenic nematodes have been the subject of several studies but most have been based on simple substrates such as agar and have not reflected the ability of certain EPN species to infect hosts in cryptic field habitats. The presence of twigs in the substrate increased H. abietis larval mortality by S. carpocapsae. Insects that were able to feed differed in their mortality from those that could not in a sand/peat mixed substrate but this difference was not found in a sand only substrate (Chapter 4). The presence of twigs or insect feeding did not alter the mortality of H. abietis larvae to H. downesi in a sand substrate. The various life stages of H. abietis were tested for susceptibility to EPN infection (Chapter 4). The adult proved to be relatively insusceptible to EPN infection at low doses, with a two day exposure of 200 IJs killing none of the adult weevils exposed. Continuous exposure on filter paper at doses up to 4000 IJs resulted in a higher mortality rate. In a peat medium with an eight hour exposure mortality was different for each EPN species tested with S. carpocapsae killing more adult insects than both S. feltiae and H. downesi at all doses. When larvae and pupae were tested for EPN susceptibility it was found that larvae were highly susceptible to even low concentrations for both continuous and limited exposure. Pupae were found to be less susceptible than callow adults as insects that fully pupated during assays became readily infected by EPN (Chapter 4). The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method for assessing levels of hybridisation between EPN strains was assessed to examine the level of accuracy possible with this method (Chapter 5). A certain level of inheritance patterns of strains of known parentage was possible but this level proved too low for statistically valid examination. The AFLP method proved to be difficult to reproduce when assessing EPN gene flow...|$|R
