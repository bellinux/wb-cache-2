500|$|Outwardly {{similar to}} the Il-4, the Il-6 was faster and had a longer and slimmer {{fuselage}} fitted with a completely new, highly tapered wing with an aspect ratio of 8. The engine nacelles were streamlined to reduce drag and increase speed as the engine radiators were mounted in the wing center section, fed by slits in {{the leading edge of}} the wing. Defensive armament was greatly improved with five [...] cannon fitted on <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings</b> in the nose, dorsal turret, two waist positions and a ventral blister forward of the tailplane.|$|E
2500|$|The DH.2 {{was armed}} with a single [...]303in (7.7mm) Lewis gun which was {{originally}} able to be positioned on one of three <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings</b> in the cockpit, with the pilot transferring the gun between mountings in flight {{at the same time}} as flying the aircraft. Once pilots learned that the best method of achieving a kill was to aim the aircraft rather than the gun, the machine gun was fixed in the forward-facing centre mount, although this was initially banned by higher authorities until a clip which fixed the gun in place, but could be released if required, was approved. A clip was devised by Major Lanoe Hawker, who also improved the gunsights and added a ring sight and an [...] "aiming off model" [...] that helped the gunner allow for leading a target.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the type}} tourelle (turret model), fed from 100-round {{replaceable}} magazines, {{was used in}} <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings,</b> where it was generally fitted with an Alkan 1935 reflector gunsight.|$|E
50|$|With the FN Typ 2000, the car also gained <b>flexible</b> engine <b>mountings.</b> This was {{followed}} by the Typ 2700 which, for the first time, was powered by engines designed and built by FN themselves.|$|R
50|$|This car's tiny six-cylinder engine, Motor Sport {{magazine}} {{described it}} as a miniature six, reflected the brief vogue for less vibratory 6, 8, 12 and 16 cylinder engines soon superseded by greatly improved <b>flexible</b> engine <b>mountings.</b> Their overhead camshaft engines were so good that cars built on their Hornet Special chassis developed an outstanding reputation on the road and in club competition.|$|R
50|$|Also in July 1932 the Pilot {{received}} the wholly new chassis of the Ten Special, its <b>flexible</b> engine <b>mountings,</b> Startix {{and the new}} gearbox and freewheel. The new brakes were Lockheed hydraulic with large diameter drums, they were self-compensating and self-lubricating. The Speed Pilot's special engine had a high efficiency head and a higher compression ratio and a special camshaft. The wheelbase was 8 inches longer.|$|R
5000|$|The Cassard {{class is}} powered by four SEMT Pielstick 18 PA6V 280 BTC diesels {{creating}} a sustained [...] driving two shafts. This gives the ships a maximum speed of 29.5 kn {{and a range of}} [...] at 17 kn. The SEMT Pielstick diesels are capable of double super-charging. The engines are placed upon <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings</b> reducing the noise signature of the ship.|$|E
5000|$|The Type 1 {{machine gun}} was {{developed}} for aerial use for the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy during World War II. It was an adaptation of the German MG 15 machine gun. (Note that the 12.7mm Ho-103 and H-104 machine guns are {{also known as the}} [...] "Type 1 machine gun", but are actually a 12.7mm adaption of the Browning M1919 machine gun in fixed and <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings,</b> respectively.) ...|$|E
5000|$|While the new car's chassis {{is little}} {{changed from the}} Wizard the engine now {{provides}} Cushioned Power endowed by its new <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings.</b> The engine clutch and gearbox unit is suspended at three points on rubber. The four speed gearbox now has synchromesh between third and top and freewheel except on the cheapest [...] "Family" [...] model. All gears are [...] "silent". The freewheel can be locked by a control on the facia. Startix optional engine starting is now fitted.|$|E
50|$|Daimler {{required}} an advanced new model {{to compete with}} Rolls-Royce's New Phantom of 1925. Though Packard had introduced its Twin-Six many years earlier {{it was to be}} a decade or more before luxury manufacturers like Rolls-Royce, Hispano-Suiza, Lincoln, Voisin and Lagonda made their own (and Packard returned to it). In fact by the mid-1930s <b>flexible</b> engine <b>mountings</b> and improved carburation had made so many cylinders unnecessary. What did return them to a certain level of popularity was the push for higher performance requiring higher crankshaft speeds. Daimler introduced their first 26 hp straight-eight in mid-1934 and their last (poppet valve) V12s were built in 1937 or 1938.|$|R
5000|$|... 1974 Citroën CX: The car {{was one of}} {{the most}} modern of its time, {{combining}} Citroën's unique hydro-pneumatic integral self-leveling suspension and speed-adjustable DIRAVI power steering (first introduced on the Citroën SM). The suspension was attached to sub frames that were fitted to the body through <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings,</b> to improve even more the ride quality and to reduce road noise. The British magazine Car described the sensation of driving a CX as hovering over road irregularities, much like a ship traversing above the ocean floor.|$|E
50|$|Outwardly {{similar to}} the Il-4, the Il-6 was faster and had a longer and slimmer {{fuselage}} fitted with a completely new, highly tapered wing with an aspect ratio of 8. The engine nacelles were streamlined to reduce drag and increase speed as the engine radiators were mounted in the wing center section, fed by slits in {{the leading edge of}} the wing. Defensive armament was greatly improved with five 20 mm cannon fitted on <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings</b> in the nose, dorsal turret, two waist positions and a ventral blister forward of the tailplane.|$|E
50|$|The MG FF was a drum-fed, 20 mm {{aircraft}} autocannon, {{developed in}} 1936 by Ikaria Werke Berlin of Germany. It was a derivative of the Swiss Oerlikon FF F cannon, itself a {{development of the}} German World War I Becker 20 mm cannon, and {{was designed to be}} used in fixed or <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings,</b> as both an offensive and a defensive weapon. It saw widespread use in those roles by the German Luftwaffe, particularly during the early stages of World War II, although from 1941 onwards it was gradually replaced by the Mauser firm's 20 mm MG 151/20.|$|E
50|$|At the 1952 Commercial Motor show, they {{displayed}} {{a new model}} called the Endeavour, which was a general purpose vehicle designed for a payload of 30 cwt. They also showcased two Tough Ten models, one a bare chassis, and one with a milk float body. The Endeavour had a heavy duty traction motor, which was attached to a sub-frame by Metalastic <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings.</b> A Layrub shaft delivered power to the double reduction rear axle. Helecs used a controller which was built as a removable unit, so that removing two bolts and some electrical connections allowed the whole panel to be withdrawn from the vehicle. A Layrub shaft was also used on the Tough Ten vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The CX suspension’s {{ability to}} soak up large {{undulations}} and yet damp out rough surfaces was extraordinary, with a consistent ride quality, empty, or fully laden. The suspension was attached to sub frames that were fitted to the body through <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings,</b> to improve even more the ride quality and to reduce road noise. The British magazine Car described the sensation of driving a CX as hovering over road irregularities, much like a ship traversing above the ocean floor. This suspension was used under license by Rolls-Royce on the Silver Shadow. The Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 was not built under license, but copied the Hydropneumatic suspension principles after the less effective Mercedes-Benz 600 Air suspension installation.|$|E
5000|$|The DH.2 {{was armed}} with a single [...]303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis gun which was {{originally}} able to be positioned on one of three <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings</b> in the cockpit, with the pilot transferring the gun between mountings in flight {{at the same time}} as flying the aircraft.

5000|$|The 7.62×51mm NATO round {{nevertheless}} met the designer's {{demands for}} fully automatic reliability with a full-power round. It remained the main machine gun round {{for almost all}} NATO forces well into the 1990s, even being used in adapted versions of older [...]30-06 machine guns such as the Browning M1919A4 from the WWII era. The [...]303 British Bren gun was also subject to conversion to fire the 7.62x51mm NATO round. the converted weapon being reclassified as the L4 Light machine gun. These have been replaced to a considerable extent in the light machine gun role by 5.56×45mm NATO weapons, such as {{the widespread use of}} the M249 SAW, but the 7.62 round is still the standard chambering for most general-purpose machine guns such as the M60E4, the M240 and the German HK21 and MG3, and <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings</b> such as helicopters, jeeps, and tanks. It is also commonly found in coaxial mount applications such as found in parallel with the main gun on tanks.|$|E
40|$|The {{philosophy}} of base isolation of structures, generally using <b>flexible</b> <b>mountings</b> and mechanical energy dissipating devices, is reviewed. Applications {{of the approach}} to buildings, bridges, nuclear power plants, equipment and structures rocking on their foundations are described. Where possible, recommended code provisions and design rules are given. The characteristics of the mechanical energy dissipating devices developed to date are discussed and material specification provisions presented. The requirements for construction of base isolated structures and for maintenance of the devices are given. Finally, recommendations are made on matters for future research. The authors comprise a working group {{set up by the}} Management Committee of the New Zealand National Society for Earthquake Engineering to prepare recommendations for the design and construction of base isolated structures 3 suitable for the guidance of designers and approving authorities...|$|E
