5|$|When Captain Scarlet was {{repeated}} by Central Television {{in the latter}} half of the decade, changes were made to the episode's opening sequence to remove dialogue in which the Mysterons allude to surveillance equipment that is being rotated to facilitate inspection of the Martian Exploration Vehicle. Since the <b>imaging</b> <b>device</b> resembles a missile battery (as the Zero X astronauts mistake it for), this re-edited version inadvertently gives an impression of stronger hostility on the part of the Mysterons.|$|E
25|$|Used {{primarily}} in ultrasound imaging, capturing the image {{produced by a}} medical <b>imaging</b> <b>device</b> is required for archiving and telemedicine applications. In most scenarios, a frame grabber is used in order to capture the video signal from the medical device and relay it to a computer for further processing and operations.|$|E
25|$|Gel {{electrophoresis}} {{is used in}} forensics, molecular biology, genetics, microbiology and biochemistry. The {{results can}} be analyzed quantitatively by visualizing the gel with UV light and a gel <b>imaging</b> <b>device.</b> The image is recorded with a computer operated camera, {{and the intensity of}} the band or spot of interest is measured and compared against standard or markers loaded on the same gel. The measurement and analysis are mostly done with specialized software.|$|E
50|$|Time-resolved PSP {{applications}} involve {{pulsed excitation}} and delay and gating of the <b>imaging</b> <b>devices.</b> One can thus determine pressure differentials {{as a function}} of time. In this case, the <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> must be synchronized to the excitation. Multi-channel digital delay/pulse generators provide that synchronization.|$|R
30|$|In <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> and applications, {{we often}} {{have to deal with}} {{degraded}} low resolution (LR) images due to because of the theoretical and practical limits of <b>imaging</b> <b>devices.</b> In visual surveillance and satellite imaging systems, certain regions of interest in the input video must be magnified for more detailed analyses. However, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory images using conventional image zooming techniques and the interpolation methods. Expensive <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> capable of capturing images of higher resolution or higher quality may not be desirable for higher cost.|$|R
40|$|Pocket-size <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> are a {{completely}} new type of echo machines which have recently reached the market. They are very cheap, smartphone-size hand-held echo machines with limited technical capabilities. The aim of this European Association of Echocardiography (EAE) position paper is to provide recommendations {{on the use of}} pocket-size <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> in the clinical arena by profiling the educational needs of potential users other than cardiologists experts in echo. EAE recommendations about pocket-size <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> can be summarized in: (1) pocket-size <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> do not provide a complete diagnostic echocardiographic examination. The range of indications for their use is therefore limited. (2) Imaging assessment with pocket-size <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> should be reported as part of the physical examination of the patient. Image data should be stored according to the applicable national rules for technical examinations. (3) With the exception of cardiologists who are certified for transthoracic echocardiography according to national legislation, specific training and certification is recommended for all users. The certification should be limited to the clinical questions that can potentially be answered by pocket-size devices. (4) The patient has to be informed that an examination with the current generation of pocket-size <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> does not replace a complete echocardiogram. Peer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|David Henneberry, a Watertown {{resident}} {{outside the}} search area, {{noticed that the}} tarp was loose on his parked boat {{on the evening of}} April 19, two hours after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted. He then saw a body lying inside the boat in a pool of blood. Authorities surrounded the boat and a police helicopter verified movement through a thermal <b>imaging</b> <b>device.</b> The person inside the boat started poking at the tarp, and police shot at the boat.|$|E
25|$|Imaging {{methods in}} TEM use the {{information}} contained in the electron waves exiting from the sample to form an image. The projector lenses allow for the correct positioning of this electron wave distribution onto the viewing system. The observed intensity, I, of the image, assuming sufficiently high quality of <b>imaging</b> <b>device,</b> can be approximated as proportional to the time-averaged amplitude of the electron wavefunctions, where the wave that forms the exit beam is denoted by Ψ.|$|E
25|$|Optical fiber is {{also used}} in imaging optics. A {{coherent}} bundle of fibers is used, sometimes along with lenses, for a long, thin <b>imaging</b> <b>device</b> called an endoscope, {{which is used to}} view objects through a small hole. Medical endoscopes are used for minimally invasive exploratory or surgical procedures. Industrial endoscopes (see fiberscope or borescope) are used for inspecting anything hard to reach, such as jet engine interiors. Many microscopes use fiber-optic light sources to provide intense illumination of samples being studied.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{enhanced}} {{types of}} active range <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> {{are available for}} capturing dynamic scenes. By using intensity and range images, data derived from different or the same range <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> can be fused. In this paper, an automatic image-based coregistration methodology is presented which uses a RANSAC-based scheme for the Efficient Perspective-n-Point (EPnP) algorithm. For evaluating the methodology, {{two different types of}} range <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> have been investigated, namely Microsoft Kinect and PMD [vision] CamCube 2. 0. The data sets captured with the test devices have been compared to a reference device with respect to the absolute and relative accuracy. As the presented methodology can cope with different configurations concerning measurement principle, point density and range accuracy, it shows a high potential for automated data fusion for range <b>imaging</b> <b>devices.</b> 1...|$|R

25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM, also sometimes conventional transmission {{electron microscopy}} or CTEM) is a microscopy technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100 nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from {{the interaction of the}} electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and focused onto an <b>imaging</b> <b>device,</b> such as a fluorescent screen, a layer of photographic film, or a sensor such as a charge-coupled device.|$|E
25|$|The term radioisotope, {{which in}} its general sense refers to any {{radioactive}} isotope (radionuclide), {{has historically been}} {{used to refer to}} all radiopharmaceuticals, and this usage remains common. Technically, however, many radiopharmaceuticals incorporate a radioactive tracer atom into a larger pharmaceutically-active molecule, which is localized in the body, after which the radionuclide tracer atom allows it to be easily detected with a gamma camera or similar gamma <b>imaging</b> <b>device.</b> An example is fludeoxyglucose in which fluorine-18 is incorporated into deoxyglucose. Some radioisotopes (for example gallium-67, gallium-68, and radioiodine) are used directly as soluble ionic salts, without further modification. This use relies on the chemical and biological properties of the radioisotope itself, to localize it within the body.|$|E
25|$|During encoding, {{participants}} are typically exposed to 1–10 visual patterns while {{connected to a}} brain <b>imaging</b> <b>device.</b> As the subject encodes the visual patterns researchers are able to directly view the activation of areas involved in visual memory encoding. During recall subjects again need to have all visual stimuli removed {{by means of a}} dark room or blindfolding to avoid interfering activation of other visual areas in the brain. Subjects are asked to recall each image clearly in their mind's eye. While recalling the images researchers are able view the areas activated by the visual memory task. Comparing the control 'baseline' state to the activated areas during the visual memory task allows researchers to view which areas are used during visual memory.|$|E

25|$|Typically a TEM {{consists}} of three stages of lensing. The stages are the condenser lenses, the objective lenses, and the projector lenses. The condenser lenses are responsible for primary beam formation, while the objective lenses focus the beam that comes through the sample itself (in STEM scanning mode, there are also objective lenses above the sample to make the incident electron beam convergent). The projector lenses are used to expand the beam onto the phosphor screen or other <b>imaging</b> <b>device,</b> such as film. The magnification of the TEM {{is due to the}} ratio of the distances between the specimen and the objective lens' image plane. Additional stigmators allow for the correction of asymmetrical beam distortions, known as astigmatism. It is noted that TEM optical configurations differ significantly with implementation, with manufacturers using custom lens configurations, such as in spherical aberration corrected instruments, or TEMs using energy filtering to correct electron chromatic aberration.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin {{was also}} experimenting with the {{cathode ray tube}} to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an {{electronic}} camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic <b>imaging</b> <b>device.</b> Thus RCA, {{on the basis of}} Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application, he also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.|$|E

500|$|When launched, the HST carried five {{scientific}} instruments: the Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC), Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS), High Speed Photometer (HSP), Faint Object Camera (FOC) and the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS). WF/PC was a high-resolution <b>imaging</b> <b>device</b> primarily {{intended for}} optical observations. It {{was built by}} NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and incorporated a set of 48 filters isolating spectral lines of particular astrophysical interest. The instrument contained eight charge-coupled device (CCD) chips divided between two cameras, each using four CCDs. [...] Each CCD has a resolution of 0.64 megapixels.
