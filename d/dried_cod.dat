5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the decline of Bristol's Iceland trade for 'stockfish' (freeze <b>dried</b> <b>cod)</b> was a hard blow to the local economy, encouraging Bristol merchants to turn west, launching unsuccessful voyages of exploration in the Atlantic by 1480 in search of the phantom island of Hy-Brazil. More recent research, however, has shown that the Iceland trade was never more than a minor part of Bristol's overseas trade and that the English fisheries off Iceland actually increased during the late 15th and 16th centuries. In 1487, when king Henry VII visited the city, the inhabitants complained about their economic decline. Such complaints, however, were not uncommon among corporations that wished to avoid paying taxes, or which hoped to secure concessions from the Crown. In reality, Bristol's customs accounts show that the port's trade was growing strongly during the last two decades of the fifteenth century. In great part this was due of the increase of trade with Spain.|$|E
25|$|Cod {{has been}} an {{important}} economic commodity in international markets since the Viking period (around 800 AD). Norwegians traveled with <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> and soon a <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1,000 years, enduring the Black Death, wars and other crises, and is still an important Norwegian fish trade. The Portuguese began fishing cod in the 15th century. Clipfish is widely enjoyed in Portugal. The Basques {{played an important role in}} the cod trade, and allegedly found the Canadian fishing banks before Columbus' discovery of America. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast cod stocks. Many cities in the New England area are located near cod fishing grounds. The fish was so important to the history and development of Massachusetts, the state's House of Representatives hung a wood carving of a codfish, known as the Sacred Cod of Massachusetts, in its chambers.|$|E
25|$|The main trade {{continued}} cross channel, {{where the}} Islands were given concessions, France, such as St Malo with 60-100 ships {{a year in}} the 1680s, expanding to Spain and Ireland, with agents being appointed to source local goods for export and to find buyers for imported goods. These included <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> from Newfoundland, cloth, wine, wool, leather and household goods.|$|E

Barrels of <b>dried</b> <b>cod,</b> 1,000-2,000 quintals a year, each weighing roughly 50kg, being exported by ship to the Caribbean or western Europe. Sometimes there was a three way trade with ships returning to the Channel Islands where the ship chandlers and merchants benefited.|$|E
25|$|In 1795 Murdoch {{developed}} {{a replacement for}} isinglass, a precipitate made from sturgeon used in the clarifying of beer to remove impurities, {{which had to be}} imported from Russia at great expense. Murdoch's replacement was made from <b>dried</b> <b>Cod</b> and was much cheaper than the 25 shillings a pound which isinglass cost. This cost saving was so attractive that the Committee of London Brewers paid £2000 for the right to use his invention.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} export traded from Bergen was <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> {{from the}} northern Norwegian coast, which started around 1100. The city was granted monopoly with regard to trade from the north of Norway, by King Håkon Håkonsson (1217-1263). Stockfish was the main reason that the city became one of North Europe's largest centres for trade at the time. By the late 14th century, Bergen had established itself as {{the centre of the}} trade in Norway. The Hanseatic merchants lived in their own separate quarter of town, where Middle Low German was used, enjoying exclusive rights to trade with the northern fishermen who each summer sailed to Bergen. Today, Bergen's old quayside, Bryggen, is on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites.|$|E

25|$|Moors in Muslim Spain began rice {{cultivation}} around the 10th century. Consequently, Valencians often made casseroles of rice, fish, and spices for family gatherings and religious feasts, thus establishing {{the custom of}} eating rice in Spain. This led to rice becoming a staple by the 15th century. Afterwards, it became customary for cooks to combine rice with vegetables, beans, and <b>dry</b> <b>cod,</b> providing an acceptable meal for Lent. Along Spain's eastern coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.|$|R
25|$|The entire period saw mercantilism as {{the basis}} for commerce, which {{involved}} import regulations and tariffs, monopolies and privileges throughout the county granted to burghers. The lumber industry became important in the 17th century through exports especially to England. To avoid deforestation, a royal decree closed a large number of sawmills in 1688; because this mostly affected farmers with small mills, by the mid 18th century only a handful of merchants controlled the entire lumber industry. Mining increased in the 17th century, the largest being the silver mines in Kongsberg and the copper mines in Røros. Fishing continued to be an important income for farmers along the coast, but from the 18th century <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> started being salted, which required fishermen to buy salt from merchants. The first important period of Norwegian shipping was between 1690 and 1710, but the advantage was lost with Denmark–Norway entering the Great Northern War in 1709. However, Norwegian shipping regained its strength {{towards the end of the}} century.|$|E

Mussels are commonly seen here in addition to fish specialties of Sète, Bourride, Tielles and Rouille de seiche. In the Languedoc [...] jambon cru, sometimes known as jambon de montagne is produced. High quality Roquefort comes from the brebis (sheep) on the Larzac plateau. The Les Cévennes area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, pâtés and goat cheeses. [...] Catalan influence {{can be seen in}} the cuisine here with dishes like brandade made from a purée of <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> wrapped in mangold leaves. Snails are plentiful and are prepared in a specific Catalan style known as a cargolade. Wild boar can be found in the more mountainous regions of the Midi.|$|E

40|$|It was studied {{that the}} effect of {{supercritical}} drying (SCD) on the structure and activity of Mn-substituted hexaaluminate catalyst (LaMnAl 11 O 19) for methane combustion. The catalyst was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. Two kinds of anions (OH- and CO 32 -) existed in the hydrothermal reaction. The precipitation took place homogeneously and a mixture of Al(OH) (3), La- 2 (CO 3) (3) and MnCO 3 was produced. The results of differential thermal analysis-mass spectroscopy revealed that the OH groups on Al(OH) (3) were partly substituted by the oxyethyl groups during SCD process. Aggregation of Al atoms was retarded by such surface modification. The temperature of decomposition of La- 2 (CO 3) (3) dried by SCD was about 313 K lower than that dried by conventional oven <b>drying</b> (<b>COD).</b> The temperatures of decomposition of La, (CO 3) (3) and dehydration of Al(CH) (3) fell into a narrow range owing to the difference of decomposition temperature. Such a mixture of La- 2 (CO 3) (3) and Al(OH) (3) promoted the formation of hexaaluminate phase. The XRD demonstrated that hexaaluminate is the major phase of the catalyst dried by SCD, white LaAlO 3 is the major one of the catalyst <b>dried</b> by <b>COD.</b> T- 10 (temperature for 10 % conversion of methane) for the catalyst dried by SCD is 718 K, which is lower than that (773 K) for the catalyst <b>dried</b> by <b>COD.</b> The temperature for 90 % conversion of methane (T- 90) is decreased from 1 013 to 918 K by replacing COD with SCD method...|$|R
