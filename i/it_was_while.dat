5|$|Despite this protest, {{two sets}} of {{illustrations}} for Candide were produced by the French artist Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune. The first version was done, at Moreau's own expense, in 1787 and included in Kehl's publication of that year, Oeuvres Complètes de Voltaire. Four images were drawn by Moreau for this edition and were engraved by Pierre-Charles Baquoy. The second version, in 1803, consisted of seven drawings by Moreau which were transposed by multiple engravers. The twentieth-century modern artist Paul Klee stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>while</b> reading Candide that he discovered his own artistic style. Klee illustrated the work, and his drawings were published in a 1920 version edited by Kurt Wolff.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{difficulty}} of the task of educating his brother while earning a living, Jacques-Joseph decided to send his younger brother to the well-regarded school of the Abbé Dussert in November 1802, where Champollion would stay until the summer of 1804. During this period, his gift for languages first became evident: he started out learning Latin and Greek, but quickly progressed to Hebrew and other Semitic languages such as Arabic, Syriac and Chaldean. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>while</b> a student here that he took up interest in Ancient Egypt, likely encouraged in this direction by Dussert and his brother, both orientalists.|$|E

5|$|When old enough, Brunt was {{enrolled}} at Ellesmere College, where his mischievous streak became quickly apparent through pranks and dares; once, {{while in the}} sanatorium with mumps, he slipped a laxative into the matron's tea. Nevertheless, he is fondly remembered at the school. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>while</b> he was at Ellesmere that he contracted measles, resulting in his need to wear glasses.

5|$|According to his autobiography, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>while</b> {{he was in}} {{bed with}} a fever that Wallace thought about Thomas Malthus's idea of {{positive}} checks on human population growth and {{came up with the idea}} of natural selection.

From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E
