25|$|On 30 July 1808 Meleager, {{under the}} command of Captain Frederick Warren, had been sailing from Port Royal, Jamaica, when in the evening the master, believing that land in sight was Portland Point, set a course that would take her well clear of land. Still, less than half an hour later lookouts spotted broken water ahead; {{although}} the helmsman attempted to turn Meleager, she struck. Efforts to get her off or to stem in the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> were unsuccessful. During the night the crew took down the masts and made rafts; once daylight arrived the task became to get everyone safely on shore. A line was strung to the shore of Bare Bush Key and all but three crewmen made it safely ashore. For the next few days the crew worked to salvage a large amount of stores and the guns.|$|E
25|$|Water {{resources}} {{management in}} Syria is confronted with numerous challenges. First, {{all of the}} country's major rivers are shared with neighboring countries, and Syria depends {{to a large extent}} on the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from Turkey through the Euphrates and its tributaries. Second, high population growth and urbanisation increase the pressure on water resources, resulting in localized groundwater depletion and pollution, for example in the Ghouta near Damascus. Third, there is no legal framework for integrated water resources management. Finally, the institutions in charge of water resources management are weak, being both highly centralized and fragmented between sectors, and they often lack the power to enforce regulations. Water resources policies have been focused on the construction of dams, the development of irrigated agriculture and occasional interbasin transfers, such as a pipeline to supply drinking water to Aleppo from the Euphrates. There are 165 dams in Syria with a total storage capacity of 19.6km³. Demand management through metering, higher tariffs, more efficient irrigation technologies and the reduction of non-revenue water in drinking water supply has received less emphasis than supply management. The government implements a large program for the construction of wastewater treatment plants including the use of reclaimed water for irrigation.|$|E
500|$|Heavy {{rain fell}} along {{and west of}} the storm's track, most prodigiously in the Shenandoah Valley. Reports of [...] or more were common; in Dale Enterprise, [...] of rain fell {{in a period of}} 18 hours. Nearly [...] of rain fell over Staunton in a {{similarly}} short span of time. The rapid <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> caused a lake in Staunton's Gypsy Hill Park to rise until its earthen dam failed around 10 p.m. local time, sending a large volume of water rushing into the town's business district. Along the way, the torrent swept away 25 homes, one of which was occupied by a family of four. Power was cut to the town after floodwaters inundated the electric plant, and multiple hotels, stores, and other businesses were extensively damaged. As waters rose, victims were forced to await rescue from their roofs. A local waterway known as Lewis Creek also overflowed its banks and contributed to the flooding. The Staunton flood took the lives of six people, and inflicted as much as $500,000 in property damage. In the countryside, about 40 horses and mules drowned.|$|E

500|$|As Baalham {{made his}} inspection, others {{observed}} {{the extent of}} the damage, and a mood of concern and anxiety began to develop as news spread. With the ship's four pumps working at full capacity, Luce attempted to stanch the leak by passing a large canvas sail over the ship's bow. [...] This, he hoped, could be fastened over the holes in the hull to lessen the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> but the jagged iron debris protruding from the hull quickly tore the sail apart. The ship's carpenter tried to stuff the breaches with mattresses and other materials, but the holes were by then too far below the waterline to be reached. Realizing that his ship was in serious danger of sinking, Luce decided to run for the nearest land, in the hopes of reaching safety while Arctic was still afloat; Cape Race was about four hours distant, if the ship could be kept moving. This decision meant abandoning Vesta, but Luce rationalized that the French vessel was likely to sink at any moment, and that remaining with her might well condemn his own passengers and crew to the same fate. After vainly attempting to signal his intention to Gourlay and his crew, who were being left to fend for themselves, Luce ordered full speed ahead. [...] A few minutes later, Arctic ploughed into a lifeboat that had been launched from Vesta. All but one of its dozen occupants were killed, mostly crushed under Arctics paddle wheels. [...] The single survivor was a fisherman, François Jassonet, who jumped clear and was hauled aboard Arctic by a rope.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1895, heavy rains caused the Sweetwater River to rise to record levels, and the dam's outlets and spillways were unable to handle the excess <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> For more than 40 hours during {{the peak of the}} storm, the {{reservoir}} overtopped the dam by nearly two feet, spilling over in a massive waterfall. The floods caused severe damage to the abutments of the dam and eroded the riverbed below, but the dam survived. In response to the danger of future floods, work began in 1910 to raise the dam to a height of [...] To do this, a -tall vertical masonry parapet was added {{to the top of the}} dam, the spillways were reconstructed, and the intake tower was raised. This was finished in 1911, and gave the reservoir an additional capacity of about [...]|$|E
2500|$|Wednesday 19 February 2014 late in {{the evening}} a leakage was found near a storage tank with {{radioactive}} water. The water contained 230.000.000 bq/l. The water did flow over the barrier around the tank, into the grounds around it. TEPCO estimated that some 100 metric tons were lost. [...] After the waterflow into the tank was cut off, the leakage stopped, According to TEPCO nothing was flown into the ocean nearby. Further investigations were done after the cause of the leakage. A valve was opened by error, this caused an <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to the tank. Around 2 p.m. on 19 Feb. an alarm went off, indicating that the tank was dangerously filled. This alarm was ignored, because no radioactive water was transferred to the tank. The tank, however, got overfilled, and the radioactive access water left the tank along the rain-gutter. Because all rainwater is directed outside the barriers around the tanks, the overflowing radioactive water seeped directly into the grounds. According to TEPCO all leakage was due to human error. The patrols were doubled to twice a day, and the number of workers involved was increased 6 times to 60 people. Because the leak was about 700 meters from the coastal line, TEPCO did believe that none of this water had reached the ocean.|$|E
50|$|Water in a liman is {{brackish}} with {{a variable}} salinity: {{during periods of}} low fresh-water intake it may become significantly more saline as a result <b>of</b> evaporation and <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> sea <b>water.</b>|$|R

60|$|This {{operation}} was soon accomplished. The blanket was passed under {{the boat and}} made fast. By pressing against the injured part it checked the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Then the cargo was shifted, {{and part of it}} was transferred to the other boats, and soon they were advancing as pleasantly, though not as quickly as before, while the Captain explained that he had brought a solution of gutta-percha {{for the express purpose of}} repairing damages to the boats, but that it was impossible to use it until they could disembark either on land or on an iceberg.|$|E

5000|$|The {{process can}} be divided into four stages, and starts with a bay with some kind of {{threshold}} sill or band of vegetation that slows the influx <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from the sea. As the land rises the threshold becomes shallower and the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> sea <b>water</b> slower.|$|R
50|$|Coastal lagoons {{are usually}} {{connected}} to the open ocean by inlets between barrier islands. The number {{and size of the}} inlets, precipitation, evaporation, and <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> fresh <b>water</b> all affect the nature of the lagoon. Lagoons with little or no interchange with the open ocean, little or no <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> fresh <b>water,</b> and high evaporation rates, such as Lake St. Lucia, in South Africa, may become highly saline. Lagoons with no connection to the open ocean and significant <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> fresh <b>water,</b> such as the Lake Worth Lagoon in Florida {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, may be entirely fresh. On the other hand, lagoons with many wide inlets, such as the Wadden Sea, have strong tidal currents and mixing. Coastal lagoons tend to accumulate sediments from inflowing rivers, from runoff from the shores of the lagoon, and from sediment carried into the lagoon through inlets by the tide. Large quantities of sediment may be occasionally be deposited in a lagoon when storm waves overwash barrier islands. Mangroves and marsh plants can facilitate the accumulation of sediment in a lagoon. Benthic organisms may stabilize or destabilize sediments.|$|R
50|$|The name Breakwater {{originated}} from a rock ford constructed across the Barwon River by Geelong's first Police magistrate, Captain Foster Fyans, in 1837.

50|$|While {{excavating}} the tunnel, engineers encountered difficult geological {{problems like}} fractured rock and massive <b>inflows</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> which caused severe delays. One {{of the three}} TBMs on the westbound tunnel was buried by a ground collapse. In order {{to speed up the}} tunnel boring, an additional working interface in Interchange Station No. 2 (under Ventilation Shaft No. 2) was built. Along the tunnel alignment, there are six major faults, ninety-eight fracture zones, and thirty six high-pressure groundwater sources. Hence, serious tunnel collapses with groundwater flooding took place periodically during tunnel construction. Altogether, 25 lives were lost during 15 years of construction.|$|R
50|$|Anoxia {{is quite}} common in muddy ocean bottoms where there are both high amounts of organic matter and the low levels <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> oxygenated <b>water</b> through the sediment.

50|$|The over-mineralized endorheic basins of the Kuma-Manych {{depression}} created soil salinization and {{the appearance}} of unusable agricultural areas. An <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> with less mineralization may partially flush salinity from soils at higher elevations.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{water from}} Sycamore Creek drained into the estuary. However, in the 1880s the {{construction}} of a railroad through the area blocked off the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> In the 1870s and early 1880s, Bradley's Race Track surrounded the lake.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, the 1375 {{kilometer}} long Qaraqum Canal was built. Draining the Amu-Darya river, it enabled huge {{areas to}} be opened for cotton production. It also greatly diminished the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to the Aral Sea, resulting in an ecological catastrophe.|$|E

30|$|The late <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> cold Oyashio <b>water,</b> {{from late}} April through to May, can {{decrease}} {{the egg and}} larval production because the low temperature stunts gonad growth (e.g., Sastry and BlakeSource [1971]). Sensitivity experiments showed that the clockwise velocity modified by terrestrial discharge could diminish the anticlockwise <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> cold Oyashio <b>water</b> (Figure  14), which can suppress the decrease <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> temperature in the bay. The high correlation between the simulated volume flux and the observed spat density (Figure  15) can secondarily explain how the relationship between larval production and Oyashio water volume {{is affected by the}} terrestrial discharge.|$|R

40|$|The Bay of Bengal {{receives}} a large influx of freshwater from precipitation and river discharge. Outflow of excess freshwater and <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> saltier <b>water</b> {{is required to}} prevent the bay from freshening. Relatively fresh <b>water</b> flows out <b>of</b> the bay along its boundaries and <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> saltier <b>water</b> occurs via the Summer Monsoon Current (SMC), which flows eastward from the Arabian Sea into the bay. This saltier water, however, slides under the lighter surface <b>water</b> <b>of</b> the bay. Maintaining the salt balance of the bay therefore demands upward mixing of this saltier, subsurface water. Here, we show that an efficient mechanism for this mixing is provided by upward pumping <b>of</b> saltier <b>water</b> in several bursts during the summer monsoon along the meandering path of the SMC. Advection by currents can then take this saltier water {{into the rest of}} the basin, allowing the bay to stay salty despite a large net freshwater input...|$|R
50|$|Farmers were {{attracted}} to the Coachella Valley's inexpensive land, year-around growing season and what was initially a plentiful supply of groundwater. They soon realized, however, that the aquifer's water supply was finite and CVWD was voted into existence by Coachella Valley residents and established by the state Legislature on January 9, 1918 with the primary responsibility to protect local <b>water</b> resources. One <b>of</b> the first actions taken by the District was to claim {{the rights to the}} Whitewater River (the valley's only source of natural replenishment) to ensure that natural <b>inflows</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to the valley would stay in the valley and benefit the groundwater basin. To better manage the groundwater basin (the only source <b>of</b> <b>water</b> that was then being used for agricultural irrigation) and minimize groundwater pumping, the District looked for alternate sources <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to irrigate agriculturally productive land.|$|R
