25|$|Thatcher's {{political}} and economic philosophy emphasised free markets and <b>entrepreneurialism.</b> Since gaining power, she had experimented in selling off a small nationalised company, the National Freight Company, to its workers, with a surprisingly large response. After the 1983 election, the Government became bolder and sold off most of the large utilities which had been in public ownership since the late 1940s. Many in the public took advantage of share offers, although many sold their shares immediately for a quick profit. The policy of privatisation, while anathema to many on the left, has become synonymous with Thatcherism.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, higher {{economic}} inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates {{at the individual}} level (self-employment). However, most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity. Necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter ("push" [...] motivations), whereas opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement-oriented motivations ("pull") such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products, services, or underserved market needs. The economic impact of the former type of <b>entrepreneurialism</b> tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth.|$|E
