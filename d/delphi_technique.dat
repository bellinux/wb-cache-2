50|$|In his {{doctoral}} thesis, Rikkonen (2005) {{examined the}} utilization of Delphi techniques in scenario planning and, concretely, in construction of scenarios.

It is therefore recommended to use Delphi in order to make the scenarios more profound and to create confidence in scenario planning. Further benefits lie in the simplification of the scenario writing process and the deep understanding of the interrelations between the forecast items and social factors.|$|E

40|$|Disagreement among experts is {{a central}} topic in social epistemology. What should an expert do when confronted with the {{different}} opinion of an epistemic peer? Possible answers include the steadfast view (holding to one’s belief), the abstemious view (suspending one’s judgment), and moderate conciliatory views, which specify criteria for belief change when a peer’s different opinion is encountered. The practice of <b>Delphi</b> <b>techniques</b> in healthcare, medicine, and social sciences provides a real-life case study of expert disagreement, where disagreement is gradually transformed into consensus. An analysis of Delphi shows that moderate conciliatory views are descriptively more adequate than rival views. However, it also casts doubt on whether the debate in social epistemology is explanatory relevant vis-à-vis real life cases of expert disagreement, where consensus replaces truth, and acceptance is more explanatorily relevant than belief...|$|R

50|$|The Policy Delphi, {{according}} to Flor (1991), is {{a variation of}} the <b>Delphi</b> <b>technique.</b> It is a tool for the analysis of policy issues seeking the involvement and participation of anonymous respondents (usually representatives of the different stakeholders of the policy). Herein, the desirability and feasibility of certain policies are assessed from the points of view of the different stakeholders. Meanwhile, {{according to}} Turoff (1975), the policy Delphi aims to create the best possible contrasting insights to resolve a major policy problem. Herein, the decision maker is interested on having a group that will give him options and supporting evidences where he can choose from for him to make a solution, rather than having a group that will produce the decision for him. “The Policy Delphi is, then, a tool for the analysis of policy issues and not a mechanism for making a decision” (Turoff, 1975). Turoff (1975) notes the challenging nature of policy Delphi as a means for policy analysis, “both for the design team and for the respondents” (Turoff, 1975). As a process, the policy Delphi undergoes the following six phases: (1) Formulating the issue; (2) Citing options; (3) Deciding preliminary stance about the issue; (4) Searching and getting reasons for disputes; (5) Assessing the underlying reasons; (6) Reassessing the options.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to H-Delivery Task W 3. 2 : Technology Characterisation. It provides a detailed review of existing Delphi literature dealing with low carbon technologies which either complement or {{compete with the}} future of hydrogen energy. Several aspects of hydrogen have been explored using <b>Delphi</b> <b>techniques.</b> These include: · identifying barriers {{to the use of}} hydrogen in transport · exploring the future usefulness of hydrogen related technologies on a European scale · exploring energy technologies which could be synergistic / competitive with hydrogen including renewables in Spain, Africa, Finland and Saudi Arabia as well as fossil fuels. · energy reviews applying to Europe and US. These analyses still leave some gaps worth exploring. There has not been a Delphi survey analysing hydrogen production since 1978. The past survey was compromised by the failure of fission based electricity generation with spare capacity for hydrogen production to materialise. In addition, a hierarchy of hydrogen societal welfare impacts has been identified but their potential has not been explored...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although the <b>Delphi</b> <b>technique</b> {{has been}} {{commonly}} {{used as a}} data source in medical and health services research, its application in economic evaluation of medicines has been more limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the methodology of the <b>Delphi</b> <b>technique,</b> to present a case for using the technique in economic evaluation, and to provide recommendations to improve such use. METHODS: The literature was accessed through MEDLINE focusing on studies discussing the methodology of the <b>Delphi</b> <b>technique</b> and economic evaluations of medicines using the <b>Delphi</b> <b>technique.</b> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The <b>Delphi</b> <b>technique</b> can be used to provide estimates of health care resources required and to modify such estimates when making inter-country comparisons. The <b>Delphi</b> <b>technique</b> can also contribute to mapping the treatment process under investigation, to identifying the appropriate comparator to be used, and to ensuring that the economic evaluation estimates cost-effectiveness rather than cost-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Ideally, economic evaluations of medicines should be based on real-patient data. In the absence of such data, evaluations need to incorporate the best evidence available by employing approaches such as the <b>Delphi</b> <b>technique.</b> Evaluations based on this approach should state the limitations, and explore the impact of the associated uncertainty in the results. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{emerging}} evidence-based decision-making phenomenon {{represents a}} new opportunity for nursing professionals. This opportunity arises because managed care brings {{about a new}} motivation to incorporate existing evidence and research skill into the health care delivery process. In order to participate fully in managed care systems nursing research must be uncompromising in its focus {{on the characteristics of}} the client group, the processes of intervention and the outcomes of intervention. It is argued that evidence- based nursing, as a process, needs to consider three questions. How do we know what practice needs to be changed? How do we enable this change in practice? and how do we ensure that change brings about no further harm? The greatest danger in the process of identification and prioritizing by a group is the bias that can occur because of conscious and unconscious habits associated with power relationships within groups.
