5|$|In 1942, the school's name {{changed to}} the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, and in 1953, the degree program changed {{to the modern}} Master of Business Administration (MBA). Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tuck School catered {{primarily}} to Dartmouth students, accepting undergraduates during their third year. Under Dean Karl Hill, Tuck shifted its focus to soliciting a national student body. The resulting expansion in the late 1960s saw additional growth of the campus {{with the construction of}} a new dormitory and the Murdough Center, which contains the Feldberg Business and <b>Engineering</b> <b>Library.</b> Under Deans Richard West (1976–1983) and Colin Blaydon (1983–1990), the school's curriculum and faculty expanded extensively, and applications increased by one-third. Since the late 1980s, Tuck has continued to expand in student body and faculty size, and has seen the establishment of two new campus buildings as well as several research centers and nondegree business programs.|$|E

The next day, Gill presented the statue as their patron saint and traced his ancestry back to ancient times between classes. The presentation successfully broke up classes, and led to his christening as Alexander Frederick Claire, patron saint of UT engineers, exactly one year later.
