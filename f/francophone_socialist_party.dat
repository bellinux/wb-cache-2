50|$|The modern Belgian <b>Socialist</b> <b>parties</b> are the {{descendants}} of the Belgian Labour Party. They have lost much of their early Marxist trends.

The Socialists also split along linguistic lines in 1978. Bruno Tobback is the current head of the Flemish <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> and Elio Di Rupo is the current president of the <b>Francophone</b> <b>Socialists.</b> In general, the Walloon Socialists tend to concentrate on domestic issues. In the 1980s, the Flemish Socialists focused heavily on international issues, and on security in Europe in particular, where they frequently opposed U.S. policies. However, first with Willy Claes, then Frank Vandenbroucke and with Erik Derycke as Foreign Minister, all three Flemish <b>Socialists,</b> the <b>party</b> made a significant shift to the centre adopting less controversial stances on foreign policy issues.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Francophone</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PS) and Christian democrats (cdH) {{promote the}} {{conservation}} of the current Belgian welfare state, and therefore oppose any further regionalisation of the federal social policies.

They also state that they minimize {{the importance of the}} Brussels-Capital Region as a constitutional component of the federal state. Their approach is to build strong links between the different components of the French-speaking part of Belgium, including Brussels and Wallonnia as well as the municipalities with a French-speaking presence around Brussels and in Voeren. The aim of this approach is to create a strong autonomous Francophone component within the federal state. Écolo, the Francophone Green party, supports an improvement of the political links between the communities.
