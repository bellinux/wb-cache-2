Psychotherapy {{may be an}} opportunity to revise insecure attachment and handle <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems.</b> This study examined attachment styles and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> in a clinical sample of psychotherapy patients (n = 168) {{at the start of}} psychotherapy. The main aim was to study how self-reported attachment styles, measured by the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), correlated with <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> measured using the Inventory of <b>Interpersonal</b> <b>Problems</b> (IIP). Avoidant-related and anxious-related attachment scales correlated positively to the total IIP scores. Inconsistent with findings in non-clinical samples, specific <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> in the dominant and affiliative parts of the IIP correlated positively to both the anxious-related and the avoidant-related attachment scales. The findings imply that a challenge for the therapist at the start of psychotherapy is to balance providing security with encouraging exploration of feelings, thoughts, and behaviour in the patient’s <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> in current relationships. Exploring individual profiles of attachment styles helps to clarify motives in expressed <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems...</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{is ongoing}} debate among psychologists {{as to the}} extent to which {{deference}} in a relationship is determined by a person's innate personality type or is the result of a person's experiences and conditioning. In interpersonal relationships, a partner can assume a submissive role to fit in or to make him or herself acceptable to the other partner, and can be a benign aspect of a relationship. On the other hand, it may be an indication of an <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problem,</b> such as partner abuse.

5000|$|While the 1988 {{study was}} {{influential}} {{for the course}} of future research on OGM and depression, it could not explain why OGM was {{more common in the}} depressed individuals, an issue that still plagues OGM research today. Though the causal direction of the relationship between OGM and depression is still uncertain, the presence of an overgeneral memory predicts the course and maintenance of depressive symptoms. For individuals who have seemed to recover from depression, memory often remains overgeneral. [...] In addition, there is evidence that higher levels of OGM predict even greater depressive symptoms up to seven months later. [...] There is considerable evidence that OGM maintains depressive symptoms and acts as a vulnerability factor for future recurrence. Failure with <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problem</b> solving, increased rumination, difficulties imagining the future, and avoidance of negative emotions are all associated with OGM and are believed to be key factors in the maintenance of depression. Due to the vast research on depression and OGM, it has been widely accepted that an overgeneral memory is a risk factor for future episodes of depression and can influence the maintenance and length of depressive episodes.|$|E

[...] Moreover, the use of role reversal in <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problem</b> situations has been found to stimulate cooperation, help participants better understand each other and each other’s arguments and position, elicit new interpretations of the situation, change attitudes about the problem, and improve perceptions about the other person’s efforts at solving the issue, willingness to compromise and cooperate, and trustworthiness. [...] As a result of this research, {{it has been suggested that}} one way to improve cooperative skills is to improve affective role taking abilities.

40|$|The general {{objective}} of this thesis was to examine aspects of adolescents perceived interpersonal relations, {{in view of the}} association between adolescents’ <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> and self-concepts, and considering influential factors such as behavioural problems, depression, perceptions of parental rearing styles, type of relationships and sex. All of the studies examined participants from the four-year longitudinal research project in Umeå, which was designed to investigate the psychic health and social context of adolescents with psychological and antisocial problems (Armelius & Hägglöf, 1998), except for the normal adolescents in study I, who took part in a project with purpose to determine norms for an intake interview that is used for adolescents in different settings in Sweden. Study I addressed the impact of type of relationship on adolescents interpersonal behaviour, and the results were discussed in terms of interpersonal theory and the complementarity principle. Study II investigated the association between self-concept and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> in normal adolescents. Different <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> were systematically related to three self-concept patterns, and showed the importance of considering the combination of self-love and self-autonomy to understand <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> in adolescents. In study III the associations between self-concept, and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> were investigated, also considering depression as a factor, in a group of adolescents with conduct problems. This study revealed sex differences: boys’ <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> mainly were associated with self-control, an imbalance between self control and autonomy, and depression, whereas girls’ <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> mainly were associated with low self-love and depression. Study IV examined the relationship between memories of perceived parenting styles and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems.</b> Also in this study, sex differences were shown.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} {{reliability and validity}} of an inventory to measure high school students' problem solving strategies and abilities with <b>Interpersonal</b> <b>Problem</b> Solving Inventory (IPSI), which is originally developed to assess college students' problem solving strategies and abilities. IPSI consist of 50 items constructed in a form of 5 sub-scale. These five sub-scales are called; Approaching problems in a negative way, Constructive problem solving, Lack of self-confidence, Unwilling to take responsibility, and Insistent-persevering approach. The sample consist of 482 pupils, 48. 1 % of boys (232), 51. 9 % of girls (250). % 34. 2 of these students were in 9 th grade, % 33. 8 of them were in 10 th grade, and % 32 of them were in 11 th grade. The results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) show that the scale consists of five <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problem</b> solving. The relationships between sub-scale scores of high school student showed similar results to the college students' sub-scale score. Confirmatory factor analysis, criterion validity, similar and different structure validity of the sub-scales were proved. The internal consistency values of Cronbach Alfa for the sub-scales are found between. 67 and. 89; the test-retest reliability is found between. 67 and. 84. The {{reliability and validity of}} the inventory showed that five sub-scales have the ability to measure the <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problem</b> solving ability and behavior for high school students...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} {{validity and reliability}} of <b>Interpersonal</b> <b>Problem</b> Solving Inventory in which whether it has psychometric properties that measure adults in their approach to interpersonal problems and behavior. The inventory includes five subscales which are called; Approaching problems in a negative way, Constructive problem solving, Lack of self-confidence, Unwilling to take responsibility, and Insistent-persevering approach. The scale consists of 50 items constructed in a form of 5 -point scale. The sample includes 610 adults, 324 females and 286 males, and aged between 30 to 73. Problem Solving Inventory (PSI) which is administered to 99 participants and Trait Anxiety Scale (TAS), which were administered to 93 participants, were used to obtain the similar and different construct validity of <b>Interpersonal</b> <b>Problem</b> Solving Inventory. The scale was administered to 43 adults twice for 4 and 6 -week interval and the test-retest reliability are found between. 62 and. 82. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis show that the scale consists of five <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problem</b> solving. In addition, there are positive correlations between TAS and PSI.

40|$|Abstract: Alcohol {{dependence}} is a {{heavy burden}} on patients, their families, and society. Epidemiological studies indicate that alcohol dependence will affect many individuals {{at some time in}} their lives, with men affected more frequently than women. Since alcohol-dependent patients often exhibit a lack of social skills and suffer from <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems,</b> the aim {{of this study is to}} elucidate whether men and women experience the same <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems.</b> Eighty-five alcohol-dependent patients (48 men; 37 women) after detoxification and 62 healthy controls (35 men; 27 women) were recruited. <b>Interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> were measured with the Inventory of <b>Interpersonal</b> <b>Problems</b> (IIP- 64). Additionally, alcohol-dependent patients were interviewed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and were subtyped according to Lesch’s Alcohol Typology (LAT). There were no significant gender differences in the AUDIT and LAT between alcohol-dependent men and women. <b>Interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> of alcohol-dependent men differed significantly in one out of eight dimensions from controls; alcohol-dependent men perceive themselves as colder than male controls. Alcohol-dependent women differed in four out of eight interpersonal dimensions from female controls. Alcohol-dependent wome...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} explores the {{prevalence}} of <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> within {{a representative sample of}} leaders and followers in the Norwegian working population employing self reported data from the Inventory of <b>Interpersonal</b> <b>Problems</b> – Circumplex. The results show that leaders tend to be more domineering and assertive, and less social avoidant, distrustful and exploitable than followers. The study also shows that the leader subsample can be divided into two clusters regarding those characteristics. One cluster, consisting of 31 per cent of the leaders, exhibits an elevated problem profile comparable to that of a sample of psychiatric patients, indicating severe <b>problems</b> in <b>interpersonal</b> relationships, while the other cluster shows a lower profile than the patient sample. The follower subsample also comprises two clusters resembling those of the two leader clusters. The present study indicates that <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> may be quite frequent in organisations, and that levels of <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> do not easily differentiate leaders from followers. However, the two clusters with elevated problem profiles indicate that <b>interpersonal</b> <b>problems</b> within organisations may be explained by personality factors...|$|R
