We have assigned most of them by n. m. r., using two-dimensional proton-proton double-quantum-correlation and nuclear-Overhauser-effect spectroscopy experiments. This allowed us to identify 2 -O-sulphated L-iduronic acid and D-glucuronic acid residues as well as 6 -sulphated N-acetylgalactosamine (presumably 4 -O-sulphated as well). 2 -O-Sulphated iduronic acid was present to similar extents (6 - 10 % of total uronic acids) in pig skin <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> and pig intestine <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate,</b> whereas glucuronic acid represented 17 % of the uronic acid of pig skin <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> and was virtually absent (1 %) from the other preparation. 6 -O-Sulphated N-acetylgalactosamine was present in minor amounts in pig intestine <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> only.

These effects were observed when polyanionic macromolecules recovered from pooled urine samples of stone-formers or normal controls were dissolved in urine ultrafiltrate and similarly tested. That the urinary polyanions were the active modifiers in the test system was further corroborated by the reversal of crystallization activity of urine samples and the urinary polyanions after they had been through an acidification-reneutralization procedure.

40|$|Connective tissue {{function}} {{is defined as}} the formation and maintenance of shape, without which centralised physiologies (circulatory, digestive or nervous) could not have evolved. Two elements, inextensible (collagenous) fibrils and compression-resistant interfibrillar soluble polymers (proteoglycans), cope with all usual stresses. Relationships between the two are highly specific, as demonstrated by electron histochemistry based on Cupromeronic blue and critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) methodologies. Recent ideas on (1) the protofibrillar or modular structure of collagen fibrils, (2) the nature of specific binding sites for proteoglycans on fibrils, and (3) fundamental similarities in secondary and tertiary structures of the glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronan, chondroitin, keratan and <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphates)</b> are described. They have greatly illuminated the study of extracellular matrix structure and function in normal, pathological (osteogenesis imperfecta) and ageing tissues. The small proteoglycans are proposed to be tissue organisers, orienting and ordering the collagen fibrils [...] thus shaping the tissue at a molecular and ultimately macro level. These interfibrillar structures are based on their bifunctional character, the protein parts binding to collagen fibrils at specific sites and the glycosaminoglycans duplexing and aggregating to hold the proteins and hence the collagen fibrils at defined distances from each other, rather like yardsticks.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made of the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans by human skin fibroblasts cultured on plastic or collagen gel substrata. Confluent cultures were incubated with [3 H]glucosamine and Na 235 SO 4 for 48 h. Radiolabelled glycosaminoglycans were then analysed in the spent media and trypsin extracts from cells on plastic and in the medium, trypsin and collagenase extracts from cells on collagen gels. All enzyme extracts and spent media contained hyaluronic acid, heparan sulphate and <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Hyaluronic acid was the main 3 H-labelled component in media and enzyme extracts from cells on both substrata, although it was distributed mainly to the media fractions. Heparan sulphate was the major [35 S]sulphated glycosaminoglycan in trypsin extracts of cells on plastic, and <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> was the minor component. In contrast, <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> was the principal [35 S]sulphated glycosaminoglycan in trypsin and collagenase extracts of cells on collagen gels. The culture substratum also influenced the amounts of [35 S]sulphated glycosaminoglycans in media and enzyme extracts. With cells on plastic, the medium contained most of the heparan sulphate (75 %) and <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> (> 90 %), whereas the collagenase extract was the main source of heparan sulphate (60 %) and <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> (80 %) from cells on collagen gels; when cells were grown on collagen, the medium contained only 5 - 20 % of the total [35 S]sulphated glycosaminoglycans. Depletion of the medium pool was probably caused by binding of [35 S]sulphated glycosaminoglycans to the network of native collagen fibres that formed the insoluble fraction of the collagen gel. Furthermore, cells on collagen showed a 3 -fold increase in <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> synthesis, which could be due to a positive-feedback mechanism activated by the accumulation of <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> in the microenvironment of the cultured cells. For comparative structural analyses of glycosaminoglycans synthesized on different substrata labelling experiments were carried out by incubating cells on plastic with [3 H]glucosamine, and cells on collagen gels with [14 C]glucosamine. Co-chromatography on DEAE-cellulose of mixed media and enzyme extracts showed that heparan sulphate from cells on collagen gels eluted at a lower salt concentration than did heparan sulphate from cells on plastic, whereas with <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> the opposite result was obtained, with <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> from cells on collagen eluting at a higher salt concentration than <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> from cells on plastic. These differences did not correspond to changes in the molecular size of the glycosaminoglycan chains, but they may be caused by alterations in polymer sulphation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> is a {{prominent}} feature of several different proteoglycans and occurs {{in almost every}} tissue of the body. It is an unbranched polymer containing the repeating disaccharide unit of N-acetylgalactosamine and D-glucuronic acid or L-iduronic acid. The polymer can be highly sulphated resulting in an unusual and largely unknown diversity in the chain. The unique step in <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> synthesis is the conversion of glucuronic acid into iduronic acid, performed {{by the action of}} the <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> C 5 -epimerase. This is followed by a subsequent C 4 -sulphation of the N-acetylgalactosamine unit by a 4 -O-sulphotransferase. C 5 -epimerase and 4 -O-sulphotransferase were quantitated in tissues producing dermatan/chondroitin sulphate of different structures. Varying amounts of enzyme activity corresponded to different amounts of iduronic acid and, in tissue devoid of iduronic acid no epimerase could be demonstrated. In contrast, adequate amounts of 4 -sulphotransferase were detected indicating a regulating role for the C 5 -epimerase in <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> synthesis. A possible mechanism to generate the varation in content and organisation of iduronic acid in <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> is the influence of various cytokine expressions. To investigate this, fibroblasts were either treated with epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-ÃŸ and platelet derived growth factor-BB singly or in combination. This resulted in a profound change in proteoglycan production, where biglycan in particular was increased after treatment with a combination of cytokines. Furthermore, treatment with cytokines decreased the C 5 -epimerase activity, which resulted in a change in <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> structure with an increased number of glucuronic acid residues. The 4 -O-sulphotransferase and glycosaminoglycan chain length was unaffected. The co-polymeric structure of <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> is essential for the interaction with matrix components such as cytokines, proteases and cell surface receptors. An increased knowledge of the structure and how its synthesis is regulated would create a greater understanding of tissue remodelling in physiological, as well as pathophysiological conditions...|$|E

The galactosaminoglycan component (<b>dermatan</b> sulphatechondroitin <b>sulphate</b> copolymers) was isolated and subjected to various degradation procedures including digestion with testicular hyaluronidase, chondroitinase-AC and-ABC and periodate oxidation followed by alkaline elimination. The galactosaminoglycans from the various sources displayed significant structural differences {{with regard to the}} distribution of various repeating units, i. e. IdUA-GalNAc-SO 4 (L-iduronic acid-N-acetyl-galactosamine sulphate), GlcUA-GalNAc-SO 4 (D-glucuronic acid-N-acetylgalactosamine-sulphate) and IdUA(-SO 4) -GalNAc (L-iduronosulphate-N-acetylgalactosamine). The galactosaminoglycans of the cell residue contained larger amounts of IdUA-GalNAc-SO 4 than did those isolated from the medium or those released by trypsin. In contrast, the glycans from the latter 2 sources contained large proportions of periodate-resistant repeat periods [GlcUA-GalNAc-SO 4 and IdUA(-SO 4) -GalNAc]. Periods containing L-iduronic acid sulphate were particularly prominent in copolymers found in the medium. Kinetic studies indicated that the 35 S-labelled glycosaminoglycan of the cell residue accumulated radioactivity more slowly than did the glycans of other fractions, indicating that the material remaining with the cells was not exclusively a precursor of the secreted polymers. The presence of copolymers rich in glucuronic acid or iduronic acid sulphate residues in the soluble fractions {{may be the result of}} selective secretion from the cells.

At the present time the fibromodulin domains implicated in the interactions with fibrillar collagens remain unknown. In experiments reported here, we have sought to identify the structural requirements for fibromodulin interaction with collagen and for the control of type I collagen fibrillogenesis. Circular dichroism spectra and fibrillogenesis inhibition studies show that fibromodulin structure and its collagen fibrillogenesis control function are strictly dependent on the presence of intact disulphide bridge(s). In addition, we show that the binding of fibromodulin (or fibromodulin-derived fragments) to type I collagen is not necessarily correlated with fibrillogenesis inhibition. To isolate fibromodulin domains, the native proteoglycan was submitted to mild proteolysis. We have isolated an alpha-chymotrypsin-resistant fragment which contains the bulk of the N-terminal and central region of the molecule including the leucine-rich repeats 4 and 6 reported for decorin to be involved in type I collagen binding. This fragment does not bind to type I collagen. Using enzymes with different specificities, a number of large fragments of fibromodulin were obtained, suggesting a compact structure for this molecule which is relatively resistant to proteolysis. None of these N-glycosylated fragments were able to bind to type I collagen in co-sedimentation experiments. Taken together these results suggest that fibromodulin-type I collagen interactions leading to fibrillogenesis inhibition require more than one binding domain.

Samples were collected under resting ('basal') conditions as well as after pilocarpine stimulation and were separated into gel and sol phases by centrifugation. Macromolecules were partially purified by using gel chromatography on Sepharose CL- 4 B, and the species that were eluted with the void volume were then separated into two major populations with isopycnic density-gradient centrifugation in CsCl. The major component from the gel phase of pilocarpine-induced secretions had a buoyant density typical of mucins and was observed as linear and apparently flexible chains by electron microscopy. Reduction of disulphide bonds gave subunits that could be further cleaved by trypsin digestion into components of approximately {{the same size as}} the high-Mr glycopeptides obtained from other mucins after this treatment. In contrast, the dominant species in the gel phase of the 'basal' secretion had a significantly higher buoyant density than expected for mucins and was largely unaffected by reduction, as studied by gel chromatography. The macromolecules were fragmented by trypsin, suggesting that they contain a polypeptide backbone. This more dense component also predominated in the sol phase both from the 'basal' secretions and from the pilocarpine-released secretions. Digestion with DNAase, chondroitin ABC lyase or heparan sulphate lyase had no effect, which shows that this component is not DNA, a <b>dermatan</b> sulphate/chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> or a heparan sulphate proteoglycan. In contrast, endo-beta-galactosidase and keratanase caused some fragmentation, suggesting that the molecules contain some linkages of the poly-(N-acetyl-lactosamine) type, although the degradation was not as extensive as expected for keratan sulphate. Treatment with alkaline borohydride resulted in extensive fragmentation of the high-Mr glycopeptides from both components, indicating that the glycans were oligosaccharides that were probably O-linked. The monosaccharide compositions of both components were consistent with that expected for mucins. The data are in keeping with the major component from the pilocarpine-stimulated gel secretions being a mucus glycoprotein and the more dense component being a mucin-like molecule, possibly related to the keratanase-sensitive material isolated from canine trachea by Varsano, Basbaum, Forsberg, Borson, Caughey & Nadel [(1987) Exp.

J. 307, 457 - 463]. In the present study, we report that C 91 T is synthesized normally in the endoplasmic reticulum as a 66 kDa glycosylated protein, which is very similar in size to wild-type 4 -sulphatase. However, C 91 T neither underwent normal Golgi processing, shown by lack of modification to form mannose 6 -phosphate residues on its oligosaccharide side chains, nor did it traffic to the lysosome to undergo normal endosomal-lysosomal proteolytic processing. Instead, C 91 T remained in an early biosynthetic compartment and was degraded. The molecular chaperone, immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP), was associated with newly-synthesized wild-type and mutant 4 -sulphatase proteins for extended periods, but no direct evidence was found for involvement of BiP in the retention or degradation of the C 91 T protein. This suggested that prolonged association of mutant protein with BiP does not necessarily infer involvement of BiP in the quality control process, as previously implied in the literature. The predicted BiP binding sites on 4 -sulphatase map to beta-strands and alpha-helices, which are co-ordinated together in the folded molecule, indicating that BiP interacts with critical protein folding or contact sites on 4 -sulphatase.

The proteoglycan {{was separated from}} collagen and hyaluronic acid by precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride and CsCl-density-gradient centrifugation. Further purification was performed by ion-exchange, affinity and molecular-sieve chromatography. The proteoglycan bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose in 1 M-NaCl. It gave a positive reaction with periodic acid/Schiff reagent and contained 8. 3 % of uronic acid. The <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate,</b> the only glycosaminoglycan component, was composed of 74 % iduronosylhexosamine units and 26 % glucuronosylhexosamine units.

The molar ratio of oligosaccharide chains to <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> was approx. 3 : 1. From these results the proposed structure of proteodermatan sulphate is: one <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> chain (average Mr 17500), three O-glycosidic oligosaccharide chains and probably N-glycosidic oligosaccharide chain(s) bound to one core-protein molecule (Mr 55000) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractExtensive {{data on the}} {{glycosaminoglycan}} (GAG) {{composition and}} the collagen fibril diameter distribution have been collected for a diverse range of connective tissues. It is shown that tissues with the smallest diameter collagen fibrils (mass-average diameter < 60 nm) have high concentrations of hyaluronic acid and that tissues with the largest diameter collagen fibrils (mass-average diameter âˆ¼ 200 nm) have high concentrations of <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> It is suggested that the lateral growth of fibrils beyond a diameter of about 60 nm is inhibited {{by the presence of}} an excess of hyaluronic acid but that this inhibitory effect may be removed by an increasing concentration of chondroitin sulphate and/or <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> It is also postulated that high concentrations of chondroitin sulphate will inhibit fibril growth beyond a mass-average diameter of âˆ¼ 150 nm.

40|$|The {{lysosomal}} storage disorder, mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), commonly manifests with {{upper airway}} obstruction and sleep disordered breathing (SDB). The success of current therapies, including haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) {{may be influenced}} by a number of factors and monitored using biomarkers of metabolic correction. We describe the pattern of SDB seen in the largest MPS I cohort described to date and determine therapies and biomarkers influencing the severity of long-term airway disease. Therapeutic, clinical and biomarker data, including longitudinal outcome parameters from 150 sleep oximetry studies were collected in 61 MPS I (44 Hurler, 17 attenuated) patients between 6 months pre to 16 years post-treatment (median follow-up 22 months). The presence and functional nature of an immune response to ERT was determined using ELISA and a cellular uptake inhibition assay. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine significant correlators of airway disease. The incidence of SDB in our cohort is 68 %, while 16 % require therapeutic intervention for airway obstruction. A greater rate of progression (73 %) and requirement for intervention is seen amongst ERT patients in contrast to HSCT treated individuals (24 %). Multivariate analysis identifies poorer metabolic clearance, as measured by a rise in the biomarker urinary <b>dermatan</b> sulphate: chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> (DS:CS) ratio, as a significant correlator of increased presence and severity of SDB in MPS I patients (p[*]=[*] 0. 0017, 0. 008). Amongst transplanted Hurler patients, delivered enzyme (leukocyte iduronidase) at one year is significantly raised in those without SDB (p[*]=[*] 0. 004). Cellular uptake inhibitory antibodies in ERT treated patients correlate with reduced substrate clearance and occurrence of severe SDB (p[*]=[*] 0. 001). We have identified biochemical and therapeutic factors modifying airway disease across the phenotypic spectrum in MPS I. Interventions maximising substrate reduction correlate with improved long-term SDB, while inhibitory antibodies impact on biochemical and clinical outcomes. Monitoring and tolerisation strategies should be re-evaluated to improve detection and minimise the inhibitory antibody response to ERT in MPS I and other lysosomal storage diseases. Future studies should consider the use of sleep disordered breathing as an objective parameter of clinical and metabolic improvemen...|$|R
40|$|Human skin {{fibroblasts}} cultured on collagen gels {{produced two}} <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> species, one, enriched in iduronic acid residues, that bound {{specifically to the}} collagenous fibres of the gel, the other, enriched in glucuronic acid, that accumulated in the culture medium. Collagen-binding and collagen-non-binding dermatan sulphates were also produced by cells grown on plastic surfaces, but in these cultures each constituent was released into the growth medium. Net synthesis of <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> was 3 -fold higher in cells maintained on collagen gels.

40|$|Summary Immunohistochemical {{localization}} of {{chondroitin sulphate}} and <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> proteoglycans (PGs) {{was observed in}} 70 tumour tissues, using monoclonal antibodies 9 A- 2 and 3 B- 3 raised against core molecules obtained from chondroitin sulphate PG by chondroitinase ABC-treatment. They recognize a stub of ADi- 4 S and ADi- 6 S binding to core protein via a linkage tetrasaccharide, respectively. The antibody 6 B 6 raised against <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> PG obtained from an ovarian fibroma capsule in our laboratory was also used. The interstitial fibrous elements, so-called 'specific stroma ' within the cancer cell nests contained chondroitin 4 -sulphate PG as revealed with 9 A- 2, whereas the surrounding connective tissue and the preexisting fibrous connective tissue involved in the tumour growth consisted of <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> PG with {{a considerable amount of}} chondroitin 4 -sulphate PG. Chondroitin 6 -sulphate PG as revealed with 3 B- 3 was located in the connective tissue proliferating from blood vessels and muscle tissue in association with the invasive growth of tumour cells. Chondroitin 6 -sulphate PG was also observed in the basement membrane components of some tumours. In non-epithelial tumours (fibrogenic, chondrogenic, osteogenic and neurogenic tumours), chondroitin 4 -sulphate was in fibrous portions. When collagenization and hyalinization progressed, <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> PG was observed to increase in quantity.

Hyaluronic acid (56 %) <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> (15. 6 %) and chondroitin 6 -sulphate (9. 1 %) were the major components, but chondroitin 4 -sulphate, heparan sulphate and heparin were also present, together with two further fractions tentatively suggested to be a heparan sulphate-like fraction and a <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> fraction, both of short chain length or low degree of sulphation...|$|E
40|$|Heparan {{sulphate}} and <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{have both}} antithrombotic and anticoagulant properties. These are, however, significantly weaker {{than those of}} a comparable amount of standard pig mucosal heparin. Antithrombotic and anticoagulant effects of glycosaminoglycans depend {{on their ability to}} catalyse the inhibition of thrombin and/or to inhibit the activation of prothrombin. Since heparan sulphate and <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> are less sulphated than unfractionated heparin, we investigated whether the decreased sulphation contributes to the lower antithrombotic and anticoagulant activities compared with standard heparin. To do this, we compared the anticoagulant activities of heparan sulphate and <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> with those of their derivatives resulphated in vitro. The ratio of sulphate to carboxylate in these resulphated heparan sulphate and <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> derivatives was approximately twice that of the parent compounds and similar to that of standard heparin. Anticoagulant effects were assessed by determining (a) the catalytic effects of each glycosaminoglycan on the inhibition of thrombin added to plasma, and (b) the ability of each glycosaminoglycan to inhibit the activation of 125 I-prothrombin in plasma. The least sulphated glycosaminoglycans were least able to catalyse the inhibition of thrombin added to plasma and to inhibit the activation of prothrombin. Furthermore, increasing the degree of sulphation improved the catalytic effects of glycosaminoglycans on the inhibition of thrombin by heparin cofactor II in plasma. The degree of sulphation therefore appears to be an important functional property that contributes significantly to the anticoagulant effects of the two glycosaminoglycans...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} {{the effects of the}} two most widely used glycosaminoglycans (<b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> and heparin) on both the structural and biological properties of collagen based modified membranes (COL/GAGs membranes) designed for tissue engineering. The molecular weight of <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> and heparins was correlated with the membrane feasibility and the cell (fibroblasts and keratinocytes) ability to adhere and proliferate on the COL/GAG membranes. Microstructure and physico-chemical properties of COL/GAGs membranes were examined using scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry; the free amino group content and the swelling properties were also detected. The morphology, proliferation and growth behaviour of keratinocytes and fibroblasts were investigated using microscopical approach and in vitro colorimetric assay. Both fibroblasts and keratinocytes are able to growth and proliferate on COL/dermatan sulphate membranes. Fibroblasts revealed significantly higher proliferation on the membranes prepared with heparin if compared to the proliferation on the membrane without heparin (COL membrane).

40|$|The small <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> protein decorin interacts via {{its core}} protein with fibrillar collagens, and its {{glycosaminoglycan}} chains were proposed {{to be capable}} of self-association. It was therefore of interest to study the role of decorin in the contraction of cell-populated collagen lattices. Stable transfection of dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO cells with decorin cDNA resulted in impaired collagen lattice contraction. Using normal human skin fibroblasts in serum-free cultures, inclusion of 0. 3 microM decorin in the culture medium also led to a delayed collagen gel contraction. Protein-free <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> and the dermatan sulphate-degrading enzyme chondroitin ABC lyase were ineffective. Potential interactions between <b>dermatan</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains were studied by gel filtration. A shift in the elution position of [35 S]sulphate-labelled decorin-derived glycosaminoglycans by unlabelled decorin could be observed only when the chains were prepared by trypsin. Chains liberated by beta-elimination or by cathepsin C were eluted at identical positions in {{the presence or absence of}} decorin. It is therefore unlikely, that the effect of decorin on collagen-gel retraction is brought about solely by glycosaminoglycan-glycosaminoglycan interactions...|$|E
