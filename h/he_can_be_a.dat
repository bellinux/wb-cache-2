5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Andrei and Foma have a {{conversation}} about Foma’s faults, especially lying. Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his cassock is tacky, and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. We cut to banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E

25|$|Fred Tupper (Neil Crone)– The local loudmouth and {{the host}} of a talk show on the local radio station, he often equates Muslims to terrorists who want to take over the country. However, at times he finds himself in the awkward {{position}} of siding with the Muslim community, as evidenced in the first season. A flashback episode revealed that his distrust of Muslims stems more from an unpleasant encounter with Baber than from any deeply held prejudices. His radio rants are primarily a ratings-grabbing persona; while <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> blowhard jerk on and off the air, he treats pretty much everyone with equal condescension (not just Muslims). By season 3, it is revealed that his objectionable comments {{have more to do with}} habit and keeping ratings up, than any active dislike of Muslims. In fact, when he believes he is dying, he is downright friendly to everyone (including Muslims) and almost declares his love to Fatima. She graciously allows him his dignity when he claims it is in fact her hummus that he loves. Fred Tupper is also a divorcee.|$|E

At the major league level, he finished fifth among rookies with 14 home runs, nine of which were in August, the most among any major league player during that stretch. Of his 70 starts at the major league level, 28 were at first base, 27 in right field, and 16 in left field, while of his 78 starts in Triple-A, 59 came in left field and 19 came at first base. Ruf struggled to find a spot on the Phillies roster at which he could contribute, despite strong performance: [...] "Even after proving <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> productive offensive contributor and showing his defensive versatility, Ruf's spot in the Phils’ lineup may not be locked in for next season."

He admits that he does not mind being considered as a [...] "bit of rough" [...] by women. He has developed a reputation as a loner, in addition to his image as a sex symbol and an admitted [...] "bit of rough," [...] a label that he considers unfair.

Paste magazine writer Bonnie Stiernberg called Pete Campbell [...] "one of the most complex, underrated characters on TV today" [...] and called the dripping sink [...] "more like a fucking geyser in reality, and if he doesn’t do something to plug it up soon, he’s going to drown." [...] Jordan Bartel of the Chicago Tribune called the episode [...] "a classic" [...] and saw a possible Emmy nomination for Vincent Kartheiser, but felt the kitchen sink symbolism and ending voiceover was a little heavyhanded. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post praised Lane's character and Slattery's direction during the fight sequence, singling out Don, Bert, and Roger's reactions as [...] "absolute comedy gold". She also compared the Pete character to former U.S. President Richard Nixon because: [...] "there's a sense with Pete that there's always a chip on his shoulder and he'll eternally feel misunderstood and undervalued. He'll always inspire a mixture of pity and exasperation, because he's smart and insightful, but <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> piece of work." ...|$|E

500|$|Author Mihir Bose, in his book, The {{magic of}} Indian cricket: cricket {{and society in}} India. commented that [...] "The cricket world had gotten too used to the {{stereotype}} of the meek Indian cricketer. All that has changed under Ganguly, perhaps for the better." [...] He credits Ganguly for not being shy of taking on responsibility. [...] "He showed that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> leader of a team, which has greats like Sachin and Dravid in the side, without any problems. Under Ganguly's leadership, India started winning matches and tournaments, previously lacking from the team considerably." [...] Within a few years of his captaincy, Ganguly rewrote the rules of being a captain of a cricket team. Unlike some of his predecessors, Ganguly was considered impartial, non-parochial, and forever pushed his players to perform better. Off the field, his interactions with the media, his fans, and detractors were uncompromisingly honest and earned him the respect of cricket followers everywhere. However, along with this respect came the criticisms. Ganguly was condemned as a hot-tempered man who refused to listen to other's opinions and abided by his own rules and regulations. Matthew Engel, ICC sport critic, noted that this [...] "turning deaf" [...] to other's opinions would one day harm Ganguly and that it was sheer luck that he existed on the sporting world.|$|E
500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't give a damn who the man is. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E
500|$|Boyd is {{generally}} deployed as a winger, {{and has been}} used on the left-wing throughout {{the majority of his}} career. He has described himself as a winger, but has stated that he prefers to play [...] "in the hole" [...] because the position allows him to get more time on the ball. He has expressed his willingness to [...] "play anywhere" [...] to help the team, believing his versatility across the midfield and attacking areas to be one of his main strong-points. He said [...] "I have played {{on both sides of the}} park and will always try my best to do a good job regardless of where the manager plays me". Under former Peterborough United manager, Jim Gannon, Boyd was given a [...] "free-role", essentially playing across the midfield and behind the strikers. Gannon said [...] "if we can get him free in attacking areas <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great creative force". Gannon believes that Boyd is at his best when he [...] "is saved from doing defensive work that wingers may have to do", and as a result, during Gannon's short spell at Peterborough, was deployed just behind the strikers as part of a 3–4–1–2 formation. Boyd has also been used as a striker by manager Mark Stimson during the first half of Stevenage's 2006–07 campaign. He is predominantly left-footed, and scores the majority of his goals with his left-foot, but is also comfortable using his right. Kieran Trippier, Boyd's teammate at Burnley, said of Boyd: [...] "He's great to play with, with a good left foot and a great engine".|$|E

After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing.

Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted.

500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} positive. The {{political}} {{journalist and author}} Andrew Rawnsley was critical of Blair's writing style in The Observer. [...] "It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in longhand 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe," [...] he wrote. [...] "He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> ghastly writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs {{to be given a}} travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... I could say that it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly." [...] Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being [...] "a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects than I had anticipated." [...] Julian Glover, a columnist in The Guardian, said that [...] "no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream—or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience. By turns honest, confused, memorable, boastful, fitfully endearing, important, lazy, shallow, rambling and intellectually correct, it scampers through the last two decades like a trashy airport read." [...] The Sunday Telegraph was extremely critical of Blair's writing style. [...] "If Blair wants to tell you a funny story, he makes the mistake of signalling in advance that you should be laughing—what happened was 'hilarious', his first weekend at Balmoral was 'utterly freaky'—thereby strangling the anecdote at birth. The book, like its author, is slightly embarrassing." [...] In the journal History Today, Archie Brown, Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University was critical of what he believed to be Blair's flawed sense of leadership, but had praise for the chapter on the Northern Ireland peace process: [...] "Blair's role in the Northern Ireland settlement was perhaps his single most noteworthy achievement. His account of it is also the best chapter in a book which, even by the standards of memoirists who fancy themselves to be remarkable leaders, is strikingly egocentric." ...|$|E
500|$|Zack's role in Crisis Core has {{received}} a mainly positive reaction. IGN's Ryan Clements particularly praised Zack's relationships with the other main characters. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish agreed with Clements, arguing that Zack's story contrasted with other RPG plots, calling it [...] "the heart of the game." [...] Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot labelled Zack a [...] "likable and complex hero," [...] arguing that he [...] "transcends the usual spiky-haired heroism and teenage angst with an uncommon maturity that develops as the game continues." [...] GameSpy's Gerald Villoria described Zack as [...] "King of the Nice Guys," [...] noting that even though <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "pretty hate-worthy character if you're the jaded type who mocks the typical Final Fantasy storyline," [...] players who dislike him could come to appreciate him. Zack was also called an [...] "endearing main character" [...] by Game Revolution who stated that despite what the character goes through during the game, he still retains his friendly attitude. Like other reviewers, RPGamer viewed him to have the [...] "full, soulful carriage of a Final Fantasy hero" [...] due to his personal conflicts, despite his [...] "artfully teased hair and devil-may-care grin." [...] Although Eurogamer's Simon Parkin found Zack's physical appearance to be highly similar to Cloud's, he added that [...] "this fan service doesn't put a foot wrong until he reaches into his [...] pocket, pulls out a mobile phone and speaks." [...] He also praised Zack's English voice actor for doing a good job, noting [...] "his character's maturing and developing over the 15-hour storyline." [...] IGN AU's Patrick Kolan agreed, calling Rick Gomez's work as [...] "pretty likeable." [...] GamesRadar's AJ Glasser commented that the way Zack obtains the Buster Sword {{and the way he}} gives it to Cloud is the [...] "ultimate payoff" [...] of Crisis Core, stating that the fact gamers know how the game will end is a serious detraction. When Ayaka finished the song [...] "Why" [...] for Crisis Core, she mentioned that she wanted to deliver it alongside Zack's fate [...] "to the hearts of many people." [...] IGN UK's Dave McCarthy noted how Zack's role in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII evolved as the series developed, to the point of him getting his own game.|$|E

Generally speaking, I think of keeping them in watertight compartments. Everybody knows my opinions, but as for my dreams and my stories, they should be allowed their full freedom, I think.
