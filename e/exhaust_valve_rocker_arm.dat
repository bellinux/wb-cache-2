50|$|The {{multivalve}} Sprint {{version of}} the Triumph Slant-4 engine used a system where the camshaft was placed directly over the inlet valves, with the same cams that opened the intake valves directly also opening the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> through <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All 645 {{engines are}} {{two-stroke}} 45-degree V-engines. Each cylinder is of 645 cuin L displacement, hence the name; with a bore of 9+1/16 in, {{a stroke of}} 10 in and a compression ratio of 14.5:1. The engine is a uniflow design with four poppet-type <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> in the cylinder head and charge air scavenging ports within {{the sides of the}} cylinders. All engines use a single overhead camshaft per bank, with <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> operated by two cam lobes (each of which operates two <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> through a [...] "bridge") and one cam lobe to operate the Unit injector which is {{in the center of the}} four <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves.</b> <b>Rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are roller-equipped to eliminate friction while hydraulic valve actuators are used to eliminate valve lash. Post-1995 710 engines employ Electronic Unit injectors, however these injectors still utilize a camshaft-actuated piston pump, as on non-EFI injectors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Porsche-designed V16 {{was modified}} as a V12 when in 1938 the Grand Prix regulations {{set a limit}} of 3 litres on supercharged engines. Originally designed as a 6-litre, the first Auto Union engines displaced 4,360 cc and developed [...] They had two cylinder blocks, inclined at an angle of 45 degrees, with a single overhead camshaft to operate all 32 valves. The intake valves in the hemispherical cylinder heads were connected to the camshaft by <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> while for the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> were connected to the camshaft by pushrods that passed through tubes situated above the spark plugs; thus the engine had three valve covers. The engine provided optimum torque at low engine speeds, and Bernd Rosemeyer later drove an Auto Union around the Nürburgring in a single gear to prove the engine's flexibility.|$|R

500|$|The latest {{revision}} of the Buick 3.8-litre V6 engine was fitted to the VR Commodore, featuring rolling-element bearings in the <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and increased compression ratios. These changes combined to deliver an increase in power to [...] and further improvement in noise, vibration, and harshness levels. Wheels magazine awarded the VR Commodore Car of the Year in 1993.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve train}} {{consists}} of <b>valves,</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> pushrods, lifters, and camshaft(s). Valve train opening/closing and duration, {{as well as}} the geometry of the valve train, controls the amount of air and fuel entering the combustion chamber at any given point in time. Timing for open/close/duration is controlled by the camshaft that is synchronized to the crankshaft by a chain, belt, or gear.|$|R
50|$|General Motors (GM) {{introduced}} Intake Valve Lift Control (IVLC) on {{the third}} generation Ecotec engine. The system provides two-stage variable valve lift in addition to continuous variable timing. Continuously commanded by engine control unit, the <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> switches between high-lift and low-lift profiles on the camshaft, actuated by an oil control valve through a two-feed stationary hydraulic lash adjuster, allowing for either 4.0 or 10.5 mm lift.|$|R

50|$|There are {{currently}} two main types of cylinder deactivation used today, {{depending on the}} type of engine. The first is for the pushrod design which uses solenoids to alter the oil pressure delivered to the lifters. In their collapsed state, the lifters are unable to elevate their companion pushrods under the <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> resulting in <b>valves</b> that cannot be actuated and remain closed. The second is used for overhead cam engines, and uses a pair of locked-together <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> that are employed for each <b>valve.</b> One <b>rocker</b> follows the cam profile, while the other actuates the valve. When a cylinder is deactivated, solenoid-controlled oil pressure releases a locking pin between the two <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> While one arm still follows the camshaft, the unlocked arm remains motionless and unable to activate the valve.|$|R
2500|$|The VR {{followed}} in March 1994, mirroring the model {{change of the}} standard VR Commodore, incorporating engineering improvements as well as sheet metal changes. The updated running gear included a new electronically controlled version of the GM 4L60-E automatic transmission, and the latest revision of the Buick 3.8-litre V6 engine. The engine now featured rolling-element bearings in the <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> increasing compression ratios from the VQ II series engine. These changes combined to deliver an increase in power to [...] and further improvement in noise, vibration, and harshness levels. In terms of equipment, a driver's airbag became standard on both the Statesman and Caprice.|$|R
50|$|In the {{overhead}} camshaft (OHC) design, the cylinder head contains the valves, spark plugs and inlet/exhaust tracts {{just like the}} OHV engine, but the camshaft is now also contained within the cylinder head. The camshaft may be seated centrally between each offset row of inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves,</b> and still also utilizing <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> (but without any pushrods), or the camshaft may be seated directly above the <b>valves</b> eliminating the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and utilizing 'bucket' tappets.|$|R
50|$|Increased Valvetrain Friction and Wear: Because OHV engines {{generally}} {{use only}} a single intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> the valves are larger and heavier than those used in multivalve OHC engines. Furthermore, when the valve is closed, the spring must accelerate not only the <b>valve</b> and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> but also the pushrod and lifter. Therefore, OHV engines must use heavier valve springs than OHC engines (multivalve or otherwise). As a result, valvetrain friction and wear is increased. This is especially true with high performance OHV engines utilizing high lift/duration/ramp rate cams with heavier than stock valve springs.|$|R
50|$|The oil {{and water}} pumps are located {{at the rear of}} the engine and the {{lubrication}} system uses a dry sump. Titanium is used for the <b>valves</b> and the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> have a diamond-like coating. Each cylinder has an independent, electronically controlled throttle body.|$|R
50|$|A top {{overhaul}} only covers {{the replacement of}} components inside the cylinder head without removing the engine from the vehicle, such as <b>valve</b> and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> replacement. It {{may or may not}} include a valve job. A major overhaul however covers the whole engine assembly, which requires the engine to be removed from the vehicle and transferred to an engine stand. An overhauled engine refers to a major overhaul. By comparison, a major overhaul costs more than a {{top overhaul}}.|$|R
5000|$|Cylinder Heads — GT-40 [...] "High Flow" [...] Cast Iron {{heads were}} installed. They were milled for 62.5 cc {{combustion}} chambers.

Part Numbers: F3ZZ-6049-B (head), F3ZZ-6507-A (intake <b>valve),</b> F3ZZ-6505-A (<b>exhaust</b> <b>valve),</b> and F3ZE-6529-AB (<b>rockers).</b>|$|R
50|$|A direct-injection turbo version (101 bhp) {{with four}} valves per cylinder, called the DiTD was {{introduced}} in the June 1998 Mazda 626 Wagon 2.0 DiTD. Engine has SOHC <b>valve</b> train with <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and mechanically adjusted screws (no hydraulic valve lifters), with Denso V5 rotary injection pump and Denso PCM.|$|R
50|$|At low speeds, The T-lever's wing section floats freely, {{enabling}} the low-lift cams {{to operate the}} <b>valves.</b> The intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> contain internal pistons, which are retained by springs in a lowered position while the engine speed is below the MIVEC switchover point, to avoid contacting the high-lift T-shaped levers. At high speeds, hydraulic pressure elevates the hydraulic pistons, causing the T-lever to push against the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> which in turn makes the high-lift cam operate the valves.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} built on 5/8 in thick plate frames, {{arranged}} outside the coupled wheels. It had a boiler with an inside diameter of 2 ft, set at an operating pressure of [...] Its inclined cylinders were arranged outside the plate frames and had a bore of 6 in and a 10 in stroke.

50|$|With the Class 16A, Hendrie {{experimented with}} four-cylinder simple {{expansion}} (simplex) steam power. All four cylinders were arranged in line below the smokebox. The Walschaerts <b>valve</b> gear had <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> {{attached to the}} tail ends of the outer piston valves which passed through the frames and then actuated the adjacent inner piston's valves. It operated in the simplex configuration, whereby steam is fed directly to all four cylinders and spent steam is exhausted by all cylinders directly through the smokebox and up the chimney.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difficulty}} of incorporating VTEC {{for both the}} intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> in a SOHC engine has been removed on the J37A4 by a novel design of the intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Each <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> on the J37A4 corresponds to one primary and one secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Therefore, there are a total of twelve primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and twelve secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> However, each secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> is shaped similar to a [...] "Y" [...] which allows it to contact two intake valves at once. One primary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> corresponds to each secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> As {{a result of this}} design, there are only six primary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and six secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Opel had {{introduced}} {{a new generation of}} petrol/gasoline engines in 1966 with the Rekord B and these were the engines that reappeared in the Rekord E in 1977. As before, the stroke length was fixed at 69.8 mm: differences in engine size were achieved by varying the cylinder bore. The engine featured an unusual Camshaft in Head (CIH) configuration. The chain-driven camshaft was positioned directly above the cylinders but this was not a conventional ohc design. The camshaft operated the <b>valves</b> using <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> because the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves ends. One reason for this may have been cosmetic. Opel's so-called (CIH) engine configuration allowed the Rekord to incorporate the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments called for.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{the design}} {{aspects of the}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> {{geometry}} has been studied and changed to maximize the cam information exchange to the <b>valve</b> which the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> imposes, as set forth by the Miller US Patent, #4,365,785, issued to James Miller on December 28, 1982, {{often referred to as}} the MID-LIFT Patent. Previously, the specific pivot points with <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> design was based on older and less efficient theories of over-arcing motion which increased wear on valve tips, valve guides and other valve train components, besides diluting the effective cam lobe information as it was transferred through the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> motion to the valve. Jim Miller's MID-LIFT Patent set a new standard of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> geometrical precision which defined and duplicated each engine's specific push-rod to valve attack angles, then designing the rocker's pivot points so that an exact perpendicular relationship on both sides of the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> was attained: with the valve and the pushrod, when the valve was at its [...] "mid-lift" [...] point of motion.|$|R
5000|$|The inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> were {{mechanically}} {{operated by}} means of separate cams, tappets and <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Opel had {{introduced}} {{a new generation of}} engines a year earlier with the Rekord B and these were the engines that reappeared in the Rekord C. The engine featured an unusual Camshaft in Head (CIH) engine configuration. The chain-driven camshaft was positioned directly above the cylinders but this was not a conventional ohc design. The camshaft operated the <b>valves</b> using <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> because the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves heads. One reason for this may have been cosmetic. Other automakers such as BMW with their 1500 launched in 1962 and Volkswagen with their NSU designed K70, which finally made it to the showrooms in 1970, squeezed vital centimeters off the height of the engine unit by canting it over at an eccentric angle in the engine bay. Opel's so-called (CIH) engine configuration similarly enabled the Rekord to incorporate the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments demanded.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{beginning}} with the J37A4 3.7L SOHC V6 engine introduced on all 2009 Acura TL SH-AWD models, SOHC VTEC was incorporated for use with intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves.</b> The intake and exhaust rocker shafts contain primary and secondary intake and exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> respectively. The primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> contains the VTEC switching piston, while the secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> contains the return spring. The term [...] "primary" [...] does not refer to which <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> forces the <b>valve</b> down during low-RPM engine operation. Rather, {{it refers to the}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> which contains the VTEC switching piston and receives oil from the rocker shaft.|$|R
5000|$|Honda's {{advanced}} VTEC technology departs {{greatly from}} its previous incarnations by no longer relying on switching between {{two sets of}} lobes on a given camshaft. It instead uses a single cam lobe per <b>valve,</b> and two <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> per <b>valve</b> whereby the second <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> has a movable pivot point, there by provide the varying cam lift. Advanced VTEC motors still use the now standard oil pressure controlled variable cam gear angle mechanism. With these two technologies combined Honda has developed an infinitely variable valve timing and lift system ("VVTL"). Previous versions of VTEC included only staged VVTL i.e. High-Low. With the introduction of i-VTEC the systems gained infinitely variable valve timing but still only staged lift i.e. High-Low. The [...] "infinitely variable" [...] portion of the A-VTEC {{is what makes it}} stand out as a serious evolutionary step in the world of VTEC.|$|R

50|$|In {{comparison}} to the VF750 almost every component had weight shaved off it, each con-rod lost 90g, <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> 6g, intake <b>valve</b> 0.5g, <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> 1.5g, pistons 20g, piston rings 1.3g per set, valve springs 17g each.|$|R
50|$|The AY12 {{was used}} in an under 1,300 cc class with a 76 mm to 76.8 mm piston. The intake valve was 40-41 mm and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> were 33 mm or 34 mm. The pistons were also a special design and the <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> system was {{different}} from the standard A12 due to the crossflow layout.|$|R

40|$|Maintenance, when optimized, {{has become}} {{in recent years}} {{one of the most}} {{important}} functions contributing to profitability. As a significant component in the overall cost budget, maintenance optimization can lead to benefits in terms of important reductions in operating costs. Therefore any model that contributes to improving the prediction procedures of the equipment condition is a tool of the upmost importance. In fact, by predicting the state of equipment it is possible to forecast its ability to produce in conformity with quality norms and requirements. Reliability models are a tool serving Maintenance in the achievement of this aim. Among the range of options available, non parametric models enable us to avoid establishing at the outset defined hazard or reliability functions; within the non parametric range the proportional hazards model allows simultaneous evaluation of the various factors involved in failure modes. In this work the proportional hazard model is applied to two complex types of equipment for which maintenance costs assume significant values, a mineral mill and four grinding machines for automobile engine parts. The proportional hazard model, which implies that hazards are proportional to each other within each given group of co variables that affect the occurrence of failures, and the relative influence of each factor within the group, provides a forecast of the future reliability of the equipment to which it is applied. The Maintenance Manager is able, on the basis of this data, to define the optimal maintenance to carry out on the equipment during the period covered by the forecast. In the case of the four grinders, the proportional hazard model with time dependent co variates is applied to two machines, both producing the same type of component - <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> A relation is established between the condition and quality co variates. In conclusion the advantages and disadvantages of the model, from the phase of defining co variates and failure modes through to results analysis are summarizedAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

50|$|The hemi head {{always has}} intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> stems {{that point in}} {{different}} directions, requiring a large, wide cylinder head and complex <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> geometry in both cam-in-block and overhead cam engines. This adds to the overall width of the engine, limiting the vehicles in which it can be installed.|$|R
50|$|In early engines, these covers did not exist. As the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are {{critical}} to having the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> operate, {{it was necessary to}} keep them constantly oiled. With these early engines, the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> would have to be frequently oiled as the oil was constantly being thrown off or contaminated with dirt from the outside environment. The rocker cover was invented to keep the oil in and the dirt out. This part is now found on virtually every existing internal combustion engine today.|$|R
50|$|As {{popularity}} and marketing {{value of the}} VTEC system grew, Honda applied the system to SOHC (single overhead camshaft) engines, which share a common camshaft for both intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves.</b> The trade-off was that Honda's SOHC engines benefitted from the VTEC mechanism only on the intake valves. This is because VTEC requires a third center <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> and cam lobe (for each intake and exhaust side), and, in the SOHC engine, the spark plugs are situated between the two exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> leaving no room for the VTEC <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Additionally, the center lobe on the camshaft cannot be utilized by both the intake and the exhaust, limiting the VTEC feature to one side.|$|R
