5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> behavior.|$|E

Afterward, we briefly describe three representatives of cognitive appraisal theories of emotion with the focus on entrepreneurship. Finally, we present a model of how to study <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> cognitions in entrepreneurial decision-making and point out implications for future research, for practice, and for teaching...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to test the {{relationships}} between physical environment, price perceptions, consumption <b>emotions,</b> <b>and</b> customer satisfaction in Chinese resort hotels. Five hundred self-administered questionnaires were distributed, and 340 were returned. Findings from this study reveal that the physical environment is a significant predictor of consumption <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> price perceptions, which in turn affect customer satisfaction. Moreover, consumption <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> price perceptions significantly mediate the relationship between physical environment and customer satisfaction. The management of resort hotels needs to consider that an attractive physical environment can be used for developing positive consumption <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> price perceptions among customers, which may then increase their satisfaction...|$|R

Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games.

40|$|Children's {{emerging}} morality {{involves the}} development of moral <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> moral cognition. Developmental research suggests that emotions {{play an important role}} in dealing with moral conflict situations, and they help children differentiate moral concepts from other social judgments. However, <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> their role in moral cognition and moral behavior have yet to be addresses systematically in empirical research. In this volume, the authors show how integrative developmental research on children's moral <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> moral cognition can help us understand how children's morality evolves. As both moral <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> moral cognition are related to children's moral, prosocial behavior, as well as to their immoral, aggressive behavior, studying how moral <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> moral cognition interact is not only of conceptual significance to developmental researchers, but also of practical importance to educators. A central premise of the volume is that moral emotions interact with moral cognition in different ways across development. An integrative developmental perspective on moral <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> moral cognition thus offers an important conceptual framework for understanding children's emerging morality and designing developmentally sensitive moral intervention strategies. The authors summarize the empirical literature linking moral emotions to moral cognition and discuss promising conceptual avenues and methodological approaches to study children's moral <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> moral cognition. They also provide examples illustrating how the principles of integrative moral education can be applied in educational practice...|$|R

5|$|While later {{reviews of}} the album saw It Was Written in a {{different}} light than previous reviews had, the subject matter was still seen as a major flaw of the album. Music critics perceived Nas' violent, fantastical mafioso stories as lacking the <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> truthfulness of his debut album. While Illmatic is often held as Nas's magnum opus, It Was Written was not only perceived by critics as part of a sophomore jinx, but was also the first of Nas's subsequent work to be heavily judged and compared to the former. However, It Was Written has been noted as his commercial breakthrough by critics, as it boosted the rapper's image in the mainstream and helped attract a much larger fan-base.|$|E

Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> was perfectly able {{to understand the nature of}} what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{increasingly}} {{negative impact of}} global digital piracy worldwide, there is strong enthusiasm among scholars and business practitioners {{to find a solution}} to this phenomenon. Most research on digital piracy behaviour primarily concentrates on the economic, personal and situational factors that influence the intention to pirate; however, I take a different approach by focusing on the psychological variables of <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> virtues and using these new sets of psychological variables for theoretical and empirical modelling. Built on the existing research, this study creates a new conceptual framework and a set of hypotheses to investigate the role of virtues (ambition and equality) in the relationship between manipulated <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> felt <b>emotions</b> (shame <b>and</b> guilt). The study aims to develop an understanding of the relationship between felt <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> pro-social post digital piracy behaviours (repair behaviour, advice behaviour, compensation behaviour, report behaviour, and discontinuance behaviour). The study also investigates the role of virtues (ambition and equality) in the relationship between felt <b>emotions</b> (shame <b>and</b> guilt) and pro-social post digital piracy behaviours. The study tests the hypotheses using data from 500 respondents. These respondents were New Zealand residents currently residing in the Auckland region. To test the theoretical model, the study uses path analysis – based moderation and mediation analysis as well as their combination as a “conditional process model” using the process tool for SPSS. Results of the study indicate that the hypothesized model of the effect of virtues on the relationship between manipulated <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> felt <b>emotions,</b> {{as well as on the}} relationship between felt <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> digital piracy outcome behaviours fits the data. Findings from the study indicate that the virtue of ambition and the virtue of equality moderate the relationship between manipulated <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> felt <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> the relationship between felt <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> digital piracy outcome behaviours differently. This study provides an important contribution to the understanding of the digital piracy phenomenon by establishing the linkage between <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> pro-social digital piracy outcomes and by integrating the role of individuals’ virtues in these relationships. The theoretical framework and the findings of the thesis will potentially stimulate scholars to conduct further academic research...|$|R

40|$|Several authors (Frijda, Manstead, & Bem, 2000; Van Veen & Lasky, 2006) {{suggest that}} <b>emotions,</b> cognitions, <b>and</b> identities are {{intrinsically}} related. Authors in social psychology (Fiedler & Bless, 2000; Frijda, Manstead, & Bem, 2000; Rosiek, 2003) have considered how beliefs are particularly sensitive to affective influences <b>and</b> how <b>emotions,</b> cognitions, <b>and</b> identities are intrinsically related. Understanding this relationship would help researchers to reveal complex key issues in beliefs research, {{such as the}} relationship between beliefs and action. Yet, although research on beliefs in applied linguistics {{goes back to the}} 70 s and 80 s, there has been scant connection with <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> identities. This paper aims to reflect on the relationship between beliefs, <b>emotions,</b> <b>and</b> identities by looking at these coconstructing, overlapping concepts to advance our understanding of language learning and teaching. Through a review of studies on beliefs, <b>emotions,</b> <b>and</b> identities within applied linguistics and other areas, I illustrate how beliefs <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> are intrinsically <b>and</b> interactively related, and how beliefs within a socio-historical context influence the construction of identities. Identities influence the kinds of <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs that individuals attribute to themselves <b>and</b> to others. <b>Emotions,</b> in turn, can influence identities and how we construct them.

5|$|Stratton saw humans not as {{machines}} {{to be analyzed}} mechanistically, but also as seating will, <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> drives, all of which had to analyzed as scientifically as the traditional psychological concepts of sensation, perception and memory. He also believed in a supreme actuality behind the world registered by our senses. This was the theme of his last published book, Man-Creator or Destroyer, completed in 1952 when he was eighty-seven years old. His book Developing Mental Power was a foray into educational psychology, addressing the question of general versus specific training in terms teachers could understand and use. Stratton aimed at this goal via a simple and generally applicable look at the basic workings of mental life. John F. Dashiell, writing in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, found this a failure. Dashiell saw the path from the psychological concepts—emotion, intelligence, and will—to teaching methodology, not clearly described in the book. Stratton also applied psychological concepts {{to figure out how}} to avert war. He was optimistic it was possible to harness the creative and destructive facets of individuals to get nations to coexist peacefully. He saw nations as consisting of ethnicities and races which had to coexist in harmony. In line with the prevailing view in his field, he did not see the races as inherently equally intelligent.|$|E

Lee) tells Dexter the gas in the cabin was turned on while the stove was lit, and when Dexter sees his own satellite navigation system while cataloging evidence, he realizes that Lila must have found the cabin. He meets with her at the aquarium and tells her that he, like her, has no <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> lives a life devoid of feeling. They form plans to leave Miami together, though Dexter secretly intends to kill her. When he visits her apartment the next day, though, he finds Debra there, trying to persuade Lila to leave town. Dexter is forced to lie about running away with Lila in front of Debra, so a hurt Lila then leaves with what she recognizes as Dexter's bag of murder equipment. She goes to Rita's house and drugs the babysitter so that she can abduct the children, Astor and Cody (Christina Robinson and Preston Bailey). When Dexter realizes that Astor and Cody are missing, he goes straight to Lila's apartment, where she lights another fire and locks the three of them inside. Rita calls Debra for her help, and Debra decides to skip her flight to Oregon with Lundy to help with finding the children. Dexter manages to free Astor and Cody through a small window and eventually rams down a thin wall allowing him to escape.|$|E

We distinguish three ways in which <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> wellbeing might be essentially related: constitutive, causal, and epistemic. We argue that, while there is some room for holding that emotions are constitutive ingredients of an individual’s wellbeing, all the attempts to characterise the causal and epistemic relations in an essentialist way are vulnerable to some important objections. We conclude that the causal and epistemic relation between <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> wellbeing is much less strong than is commonly thought...|$|R
