The developed and richer developing countries have begun to address the consequences of the crisis and have announced various <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli.</b> The G 20 countries have announced <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli</b> worth around 1. 5 % of GDP, or some US$ 2 trillion, to cushion the consequences of the {{global financial}} crisis. It will matter greatly for poor countries (non-G 20) countries, such as African countries, whether part of such a stimulus is provided in poor countries or whether the entire stimulus is kept in the G 20.

5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> are particularly effective.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{evidence}} on episodes of large stances in fiscal policy, both in cases of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli</b> and in that of fiscal adjustments in OECD countries from 1970 to 2007. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>stimuli</b> based upon tax cuts {{are more likely to}} increase growth than those based upon spending increases. As for fiscal adjustments, those based upon spending cuts and no tax increases are more likely to reduce deficits and debt over GDP ratios than those based upon tax increases. In addition, adjustments on the spending side rather than on the tax side are less likely to create recessions. We confirm these results with simple regression analysis. ...|$|R

We demonstrate that a changing mass of firms {{is a crucial}} dimension for evaluating fiscal policy since it can both accelerate and decelerate the impacts of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli.</b> When <b>fiscal</b> interventions cause the mass of firms to decline, an additional crowding-out effect of investment in new firms results in a multiplier below that of the standard RBC model. In the presence of demand <b>stimuli,</b> <b>fiscal</b> multipliers are small and the mass of firms may decline. This holds in particular under distortionary tax financing. By contrast, policies that disburden private agents from income taxes are effective in boosting economic activity and product creation. ...|$|R
25|$|In 2008, a rapid {{shift of}} opinion took place among many {{prominent}} economists {{in favour of}} Keynesian stimulus, and, from October onward, policy makers began announcing major stimulus packages, in hopes of heading off {{the possibility of a}} global depression. By early 2009 there was widespread acceptance among the world's economic policy makers about the need for <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Yet by late 2009 the consensus among economists began to break down. In 2010 with a depression averted but unemployment in many countries still high, policy makers generally decided against further <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus,</b> with several citing concerns over public debt as a justification. Unconventional monetary policy continued to be used in attempts to raise economic activity. By 2016, increasing concerns had arisen that monetary policy was reaching the limit of its effectiveness, and several countries began to return to <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli</b> {{at different levels of}} the government debt-to-GDP-ratio for a sample of 17 European countries from 1970 to 2010. This is implemented in an interacted panel VAR framework in which all coefficient parameters are allowed to change continuously with the debt-to-GDP ratio. We find that responses to government spending shocks exhibit strong non-linear behaviour. While the overall cumulative effect of a spending shock on real GDP is positive and significant at moderate debt-to-GDP ratios, this effect turns negative as the ratio increases. The total cumulative effect on the trade balance is negative at first but switches sign at higher levels of debt. Consequently, depending on the degree of public indebtedness, our results accommodate long-run fiscal multipliers which are greater and smaller than one or even negative as well as twin deficit and twin divergence behaviour within one sample and time period. From a policy perspective, these results lend additional support to increased prudence at high public debt ratios because the effectiveness of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli</b> to boost economic activity or resolve external imbalances may not be guaranteed...|$|R

Those policies increase the incentives to post vacancies, hence employment. Furthermore, by reducing marginal costs they also reduce inflation and increase private consumption. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to identify, in the economic literature, the main factors which constrain the transmission of the fiscal shocks to the real economy. The interest in finding the most efficient <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli</b> in recovery the economies passing through crisis period has got increased as soon as the expansionary monetary policy promoted by most of the central banks has not generated an increase of the confidence in the private economic agents and, as a consequence, an increase of consumption and of the private investments. Even though it represents the Keynesian solution for recovery the economies which have been affected by the crisis, the fiscal expansion promoted during the recession periods does not generate the same expected positive effects any more (increase of consumption, significant decrease of unemployment, increase of revenues in economy), as they are conditioned by the reaction of the private economic agents to the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli.</b> For example, the decision to decrease taxation may not automatically generate the significant increase of consumption (a condition for spreading the multiplier effect in economy), under the terms of pessimism or of the difficulty to access loans. As a result, the fiscal multipliers tend to be rather proper, and their value decreases more during the deep economic recession periods...|$|R
30|$|Each {{regime has}} also its own policy prescriptions. The Keynesian {{unemployment}} regime focuses on monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli</b> to increase output and employment back to equilibrium as it presumes that the equilibrating force from adjustment of prices and wages is inherently slow. The classical unemployment regime concentrates on reducing real wages to increase employment; reducing taxes on labor income, e.g., contributes to this. The repressed inflation regime requires restrictive monetary and fiscal policies to reduce inflation. The labor hoarding regime needs {{an increase in}} real wages to restore equilibrium in goods and labor markets.|$|R
