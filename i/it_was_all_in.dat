[...] "These were not people who wrote things down in the computer or in notebooks. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> their heads," [...] he said, adding that much of the knowledge would not be recoverable.

500|$|Al Kooper {{recalled}} {{that both the}} album title, Blonde on Blonde, and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions. [...] "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What {{do you want to}} call this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|As Kiedis {{begins to}} sing, he appears on camera bathed in purple light with blue {{fluorescent}} {{stars as a}} backdrop, surrounded by clouds. As the camera pans closer, {{an image of the}} skyline of Van Sant's home city, Portland, is superimposed from his chin downwards. Flea and Chad Smith are then placed into the image while playing their instruments. Van Sant wanted superimposing to be a notable component in the overall theme of the video; the idea came from a project he worked on with novelist William S. Burroughs. The scenes in the studio are coupled with scenes of Kiedis walking the streets of L.A., wearing a white T-shirt with [...] "To Hell And Back" [...] printed on the front; as he walks, the camera focuses on various people. He can, at various points in the video, be seen {{standing in front of the}} Belmont Tunnel before its closure. This, according to Kiedis, was vital; he felt that the studio portion alone would not convey enough emotion: [...] "the first time we shot [...] <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> a studio and that didn't seem to capture everything we needed to capture. It needed more; it needed to be combined with an outdoor, streets-of-Los-Angeles thing". Towards the end, Kiedis is seen running down the Los Angeles River channel in slow motion; the background is a nuclear explosion (the [...] "Baker" [...] shot of Operation Crossroads). The video ends with various superimposed images of the band, followed by Frusciante playing alone on a pedestal—this time with an inverted shot of the ocean as the sky.|$|E

500|$|Television critics reacted mostly mixed to [...] "Welcome Back, Carter", {{calling the}} storyline [...] "hit-or-miss." [...] In a {{simultaneous}} {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the show, and the broadcast of American Dad! that followed it, The A.V. Club's Rowan Kaiser noted the apparent lack of guest stars in the episode, adding, [...] "I can't help but feel [...] {{is a good thing}} in for Family Guy." [...] In the conclusion of his review Kaiser praised the [...] "shock humor" [...] in the limousine jousting scene, but compared Carter's catchphrases to [...] "the kind of groan-inducing meta-humor that [...] The Cleveland Show aims for." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a C rating, the second best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Cleveland Got His Groove Back" [...] and tying with the American Dad! episode [...] "Son of Stan". In a slightly more neutral review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's cutaways, stating that they [...] "came back with a vengeance this week." [...] Hughes went on to comment negatively on the scene involving Carter being woken up and hinting at incest with his daughter, noting, [...] "It's weird that while the pedophile character of Herbert doesn't bother me at all, this potential admission really does. Maybe because it adds an element of incest, or seemed more genuine than Herbert's over-the-top antics. But really, it's just another throwaway gag in the world of Seth MacFarlane." [...] Actor Jonathan Lipnicki, who was parodied in the episode, responded to his portrayal by stating, [...] "I don't feel bad about what they said on Family Guy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> good fun, I've worked on that show [...]" ...|$|E

Private Jacob McNeil {{was one of the}} soldiers who participated in the capture of the Shawnee Chief Cornstalk, and tried to prevent his murder at Fort Randolph (West Virginia).

2500|$|With a lead of 77, England {{pressed on}} in the second innings, Gooch (79), Atherton (42) and Hick (36) making starts before the wobbles set in.

[...] After claiming overnight {{that they would not}} be batting for the draw, Australia's main worry soon became avoiding defeat once they slipped to 30/3: Watkin (4-65) ripped out the top order. Border and the Waughs added a little steel, but an inspired Malcolm came on after lunch and had Border caught behind and Mark Waugh (49) caught by Ramprakash, before trapping Steve Waugh in front, leaving Australia 106/6.

2500|$|In 1907 Gardner {{returned}} to Britain for several months' leave, {{spending time with}} his family and joining the Legion of Frontiersmen, a militia founded to repel the threat of German invasion.

Gardner became very friendly with this side of his family, whom his Anglican parents avoided because they were Methodists. According to Gardner, the Surgenesons readily talked about the paranormal with him; the patriarch of the family, Ted Surgeneson, believed that fairies were living in his garden and would say [...] "I can often feel they're there, and sometimes I've seen them", though he readily admitted the possibility that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> his imagination. It was from the Sergenesons that Gardner claimed to have discovered a family rumour that his grandfather, Joseph, had been a practising witch, after being converted to the practice by his mistress. Another unconfirmed family belief repeated by Gardner was that a Scottish ancestor, Grissell Gairdner, had been burned as a witch in Newburgh in 1610.|$|E

Universal chairman Sid Sheinberg {{insisted on a}} dramatic re-edit of the film {{to give it a}} happy ending, cutting out the reveal that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> Sam's mind, a decision that Gilliam resisted vigorously. At one point, there were two editing teams working on the film, one without Gilliam's knowledge. As with the cult science fiction film Blade Runner (1982), which had been released three years earlier, a version of Brazil was created by the studio with a more consumer-friendly ending. After a lengthy delay with no sign of the film being released, Gilliam took out a full-page ad in the trade magazine Variety urging Sheinberg to release Brazil in its intended version. Gilliam soon conducted private screenings of Brazil (without the studio's approval) for film schools and local critics. On the same night Universal's award contender Out of Africa premiered in New York, Brazil was awarded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association award for [...] "Best Picture". This prompted Universal to finally agree to release a modified 132-minute version supervised by Gilliam, in 1985.|$|E
