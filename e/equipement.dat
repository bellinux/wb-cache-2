Hydro-Québec <b>Équipement,</b> another division of Hydro-Québec, and Société d’énergie de la Baie James built these transmission lines, electrical substations, and generating stations.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a proposal for}} a framework allowing the interoperability between ISP management domains for the purpose of satisfying end to end user requirements based on agreed SLAs (Service Level Agreement). The paper considers future policy based enabled equipments and management centres based on the ongoing work undertaken in the frame of the rap (resource allocation protocol) and policy framework groups of the IETF. Policy based management enables automation of management activities in a particular domain. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the possibility to merge policy based management with active networking paradigms in order to render more flexible the deployement of inter ISP policies. In this environment, capsules (active packets) will act on behalf of users or third party service providers, to obtain the best end to end communication services for end users. Thus we describe an architecture where capsules are used for service negotiation and configuration of physical network <b>equipements.</b> Different types of capsules and applications are considered to ensure interaction between a client and an ISP, an ISP with another ISP and finally between an ISP and its <b>equipements...</b>|$|R
