He wrote in gusts; the labor limæ et mora was a thing he did not know. Yet his writings have great merit. His newspaper essays abound in happy illustration and brilliant careless thought.

Hence their popularity, which many of them still retain. 'In his larger lyrical pieces,' observes the same not injudicious critic, 'we discover fearless singularity; wild imagination, dwelling rather on the grand and frightful than on the beautiful and soft; deep, but seldom long-continued feeling; at times far-darting thoughts, original images, stormy vehemence; and generally a glowing, self-created, figurative diction.

6000|$|... 'A wounded spirit who can bear.' Well {{might the}} apostle say, 'If {{in this life}} only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable' (1 Cor 15:19). Bunyan had enjoyed holy {{emotions}} full of glory, and now the devil was threatening him, {{not only with the}} loss of heaven, but the terrors of hell. The Puritan, Rogers, describes religious melancholy as 'the worst of all distempers, and those sinking and guilty fears which it brings along with it are inexpressibly dreadful; what anguish, what desolation! I dare not look to heaven; there I see the greatness of God, who is against me. I dare not look into his Word; for there I see all his threats, as so many barbed arrows to strike me to the heart. I dare not look into the grave; because thence I am like to have a doleful resurrection; in this doleful night the soul hath no evidence at all of its former grace.'[158] Bunyan's experience reminds us of the impressive language of Job--a book full of powerful imagery and magnificent ideas, in which Bunyan delighted, calling it 'that blessed book.'[159] Job goes on, from step to step, describing his mental wretchedness, until he rises to a climax, God 'runneth upon me like a giant' (16:7-22). 'Thou huntest me as a fierce lion' (10:16). 'The arrows of the Almighty are within me; they drink up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me' (6:4). Poor Bunyan, in the depth of his distress, cried unto God, and was heard and relieved from these soul troubles. He recollected the joyful ascent of Lazarus from the extreme of human misery to the height of celestial enjoyments. His spirit was sweetly revived, and he was enabled, with delight, to hope yet in God, when that word fell with great weight upon his mind, 'O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?' 'At this he became both well in body and mind at once; his sickness did presently vanish, and he again walked comfortably in his work for God.'[160] The words, 'by grace are ye saved,' followed him through the rest of his pilgrimage. His consolation was, that 'a little true grace will go a great way; yea, and do more wonders than we are aware of. If we have but grace enough to keep us groaning after God, it is not all the world that can destroy us.'[161] He had now become deeply instructed in the school of Christ, and was richly furnished with the weapons of spiritual warfare; 'a scribe instructed into the kingdom of heaven, like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old' (Matt 13:12). Or, as 'the man of God, perfected, thoroughly furnished unto all good works' (2 Tim 3:17). It was powerfully impressed upon his mind that all his inward conflicts were to be made use of in preparing him to instruct others. All the events of his Saviour's life passed before his mind as if he had stood by as a witness to his birth--his walking with his disciples; his wondrous parables and stupendous miracles; his mental and bodily sufferings; his sacrifice, burial, ascension, intercession, and final judgment; all passed in vivid review before the eye of his mind; and then, he says, 'as I was musing with myself what these things should mean, methought I heard such a word in my heart as this, I have set thee down on purpose, for I have something more than ordinary for thee to do'; which made me the more to marvel, saying, 'What, my Lord, such a poor wretch as I?'[162] Such was his <b>inward</b> <b>call</b> to the ministry; and it being attended with the three requisites usually insisted on among Dissenters--ability, inclination, and opportunity--he was sent out as an itinerant preacher in the surrounding villages in 1655, and laid the foundation of many churches, which now flourish to the praise of the glory of Divine grace. In some of these villages the gospel had never before been preached; they were strongholds of Satan. These were fit places for the full display of his intrepid energy.|$|E

5000|$|Some synergists {{believe that}} monergism is fatalistic; because they {{interpret}} it {{to believe that}} a man is not free to resist God's (outward) call.

Opponents of monergism would argue that this type of freedom is akin to being free to take the one-and-only choice available. But again, if freedom is simply the ability to do as we please; then, how that freedom is brought to pass is irrelevant. Moreover, if we are at enmity with God, we will never be pleased to love or have saving faith in God; as synergism states that we can. See Romans 8:6-8: [...] "For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God."These arguments are both aspects of the general argument that monergism means that God chooses individuals without any condition provided by the individual (See the [...] "U" [...] in T.U.L.I.P. - i.e. Unconditional Election). Therefore, according to monergism, the only reason that one person is saved and another is not is because God sovereignly decided, without any conditions provided by the two individuals, to save one of them. It follows that the only reason people are not saved is because God sovereignly chooses not to save some individuals. Therefore, monergism is said to lead to the conclusion that God does not in fact love every human being, as God's Word declares; [...] " [...] I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon Me, but I will not answer; they shall seek Me early, but they shall not find Me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord:" [...] Proverbs 1:26-29. Nor want to save every person, as GOD's Word declares; [...] " [...] Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth. Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth He yet find fault? For who hath resisted His will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed it, Why hast Thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? What if God, willing to shew His wrath, and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: And that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory..." [...] Romans 9:18-23. By contrast, Synergists maintain that God does not save certain individuals because they do not desire to be saved. According to both monergism and synergism, God will not force His will or His forgiveness on those who do not desire it.|$|E
40|$|Summary In {{the early}} 17 th century, an {{important}} {{debate in the}} Reformed Church in the Dutch Republic was that between the Reformed and the Remonstrants. The national synod of Dort resolved this debate with {{a rejection of the}} Remonstrants’ ideas. In this discussion, one of the main issues was the relationship between election by God and the free will of men. To explain why not everybody who receives God’s call – in the Gospel or through nature – responds to it by believing in Christ and repentance, the Canons of Dort distinguished between the external preaching of the Gospel and the internal illumination by God. Those who only receive the external Word, are not able to believe the Gospel due to their sinfull nature. On the other hand, the combination of the preaching and the internal illumination and act of God results in true belief in God. 	This difference between internal illumination or internal calling and the external preaching or the external call is the topic of this thesis. To understand the difference between the external and internal calling correctly from a 21 st century viewpoint, we need to know what theologians in the 17 th century considered to be internal calling and external calling and how they saw the relationship between those two. This is even more interesting, as we realize that the distinction between internal and external {{is at the center of}} the Cartesian philosophy of subjectivity, the philosophy that became influential in the late 17 th century. Therefore, this thesis aims to answer the question: what is meant by external and internal and how do these terms relate in the Reformed theology in the 17 th century? 	In this thesis, the investigation is focused on one key representative of the late 17 th century theology – the period in which the Cartesian influence became important. This representative is Petrus van Mastricht, a Reformed theologian with a fairly moderate position in the Reformed church, who however was involved in a lively debate with Cartesians. The main question of this thesis is divided in four subquestions: 1. 	What is the historical context of Petrus van Mastricht, in particular related to the Cartesian debate? 2. 	How does Van Mastricht describe internal and external calling and their relationship? 3. 	How does Van Mastrichts description relate to his key sources for this terminology? 4. 	Could an effect of the Cartesianism on Van Mastricht be established, with regard to his description of internal and external calling? 	With regard to Van Mastricht, the investigation focuses on his main dogmatic work, the Theoretico-practica theologia and also his main polemic book against the Cartesians, the Novitatum cartesianum gangraena, is included. As four important sources of the Theoretico-practica theologia, the following works are taken into account: the Summa theologiae of Thomas Aquinas (1225 ? – 1274), the Leiden Synopsis purioris theologiae (1625), the Medulla of William Ames (1576 - 1633) and the Disputationes selectae of Gisbertus Voetius (1589 - 1676). Besides that, I also compare Van Mastricht with a contemporary and key Reformed theologian, Francis Turretin (1623 - 1687). Question 1 : Historical context of Petrus van Mastricht Van Mastricht was a theologian with a good international education and reputation. He became professor in theology, first in Germany and later in Utrecht, where he was the successor of Voetius. As a representative of the Reformed tradition, he was fairly moderate, but also fiercely debating with Cartesian theologians. In this respect, Van Mastricht’s Gangraena was one of the main writings against the Cartesians in this period. Question 2 : The relationship between external and internal calling Van Mastricht defines external calling as the call that is received by the external senses, the sense of hearing and the intellect. The internal call is received by the soul, which Van Mastricht distinguishes from intellect and will. External and internal calling have the same message and cause, only the way through which they operate is different. In fact, it is only one call, with an internal and an external component. According to Van Mastricht, calling as such does not result in faith. Calling as such is just a moral cause, which recommends somebody what would be good, but is not a cause sufficient for faith. Here, an internal, physical cause is needed: the internal renewal of the heart by the regeneration. This regeneration changes the will, and causes that the intellect and will become faithful. In this respect, the regeneration is needed before someone can actually respond in faith to the God’s call. Question 3 : Van Mastricht’s relationship to his sources Van Mastricht’s theology of calling is in line with mainstream Medieval and Reformed theology, which also asserts that internal and external calling cooperate, but that an internal act of God is needed for faith. Van Mastricht’s position is in particular aligned with those of Aquinas, Voetius and Polyander (1568 - 1646). Aquinas actually uses the same subdivisions in his terminology as Van Mastricht, although he grants the will a somewhat more important role. In comparison with Polyander, Van Mastricht has a somewhat different distinction between calling and regeneration. One of the Leiden Synopsis authors, Polyander, considers the internal act of God still to be part of calling, while Van Mastricht defines that a regeneration. Nevertheless, the distinction between internal and external calling (including a part of regeneration for Van Mastricht) is fairly similar. On the other hand, Rivetus (1572 - 1651) uses in the same Synopsis a more pronounced distinction between external and internal calling. For Rivetus, the difference between external and internal calling is perfectly in line with respectively ineffective and effective calling. Ames has the same opinion: only the elect receive the internal, effective calling. This position differs from Van Mastricht, who states the internal and external usually cooperate and that also those who do not receive faith can have received the <b>inward</b> <b>call.</b> Question 4 : Cartesian influence The comparison with his sources and also with Turretin shows that Van Mastricht’s description of external an internal calling is not unique, but rather in line with an important stream in Reformed thought. On the other hand, there could be a – rather small – Cartesian influence, as Van Mastricht does elaborate on the specific internal human ‘faculties’ in more detail than Turretin or any of his sources (as far as considered in this study). In this respect, in particular the difference with Turretin is striking, as Turretin does not like to talk about internal human ‘faculties’ in relationship to the external calling, as he reserves any real internal effect of calling for the elect only. Moreover, Van Mastricht considers the soul as perceptive, which seems to be a Cartesian opinion, while Turrettini does explicitly argue that the soul cannot be perceptive. As Van Mastricht deals in his Gangraena specifically with these ‘faculties’ in his debate with Cartesians, it could be that this debate has urged him to be more precise. This could be an indication of Cartesian influence on his thinking about internal and external calling. This study on the subject of internal and external calling in the 17 th century Reformed theology shows that the distinction between internal and external has not always the same meaning. Therefore, we have to be careful in interpreting these terms. In this respect, interpreting internal calling as effective calling and external calling as ineffective is not a correct interpretation of this distinction. This interpretation is valid for some theologians, such as Turretin and Ames, but not for others, such as Van Mastricht and Voetius...|$|E

In the particular case of the Müller-Lyer (ML) il-lusion, the critical part of the stimulus is the central line (shaft), while the fins represent the context that can modify the perceived length of the central line. The fins usually come in two forms: <b>inward</b> (), also <b>called</b> arrowhead, and outward (><), featherhead fins. The length of the central shaft, i. e., the line is overestimated when it ends in outward fins, or is underestimated when it ends in inward fins. The example of the ML illusion can be seen in Figure 1. The ML illusion comes in several different variations. This illusion will also emerge if the double fins are replace...|$|R
2500|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of an inertial reference frame stationary {{with respect to the}} road, the car is accelerating {{toward the center of the}} circle. This acceleration is necessary because the direction of the velocity is changing, despite a constant speed. This <b>inward</b> acceleration is <b>called</b> centripetal acceleration and requires a centripetal force to maintain the circular motion. [...] This force is exerted by the ground upon the wheels, in this case thanks to the friction between the wheels and the road. The car is accelerating, due to the unbalanced force, which causes it to move in a circle. (See also banked turn.) ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>inward</b> man I <b>call</b> the new creature, {{of which}} the Spirit of God is the support, as my soul {{supports}} my body. But, I say, this new man is not always well. He knows nothing that knows not this. Now being sick, things fail. As when a man is not in health of body, his pulse beats so as to declare that he is sick; so when a man is not well within, his inward pulse, which are his desires--for I count the desires for {{the pulse of the}} inward man--they also declare that the man is not well within. They beat too little after God, weak and faintly after grace; they also have their halts, they beat not evenly, as when the soul is well, but so as to manifest all is not well there.|$|R
5000|$|A {{propeller}} {{that turns}} clockwise to produce forward thrust, {{when viewed from}} aft, is called right-handed. One that turns anticlockwise {{is said to be}} left-handed. Larger vessels often have twin screws to reduce heeling torque, counter-rotating propellers, the starboard screw is usually right-handed and the port left-handed, this is called outward turning. The opposite case is <b>called</b> <b>inward</b> turning. Another possibility is contra-rotating propellers, where two propellers rotate in opposing directions on a single shaft, or on separate shafts on nearly the same axis. Contra-rotating propellers offer increased efficiency by capturing the energy lost in the tangential velocities imparted to the fluid by the forward propeller (known as [...] "propeller swirl"). The flow field behind the aft propeller of a contra-rotating set has very little [...] "swirl", and this reduction in energy loss is seen as an increased efficiency of the aft propeller.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks the}} {{potentials}} of studying aerodynamic characteristics of <b>inward</b> cavities <b>called</b> dimples, {{as an alternative}} to the classical vortex generators. Increasing stalling angle is a greater challenge in wing design. But our examination is primarily focused on increasing lift. In this paper, enhancement of lift is mainly done by introduction of dimple or cavity in a wing. In general, aircraft performance can be enhanced by increasing aerodynamic efficiency that is lift to drag ratio of an aircraft wing. Efficiency improvement can be achieved by improving the maximum lift co-efficient or by reducing the drag co-efficient. At the time of landing aircraft, high angle of attack may lead to stalling of aircraft. To avoid this kind of situation, increase in the stalling angle is warranted. Hence, improved stalling characteristic is the best way to ease landing complexity. Computational analysis is done for the wing segment made of NACA 0012. Simulation is carried out for 30 m/s free stream velocity over plain airfoil and different types of cavities. The wing is modeled in CATIA V 5 R 20 and analyses are carried out using ANSYS CFX. Triangle and square shapes are used as cavities for analysis. Simulations revealed that cavity placed on wing segment shows an increase of maximum lift co-efficient when compared to normal wing configuration. Flow separation is delayed at downstream of the wing by the presence of cavities up to a particular angle of attack...|$|R
