It was such a splendid opportunity, anyhow, for breaking contracts, cutting salaries, and taming the stars.... Me, they gave the salary treatment. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> on without the raise my contract called for, or quit, [...] Schulberg said, using the questionable dodge of whether I'd be good for the talkies. Questionable, I say, because I spoke decent English in a decent voice and came from the theater. So without hesitation I quit.|$|E
500|$|Further Sky was {{met with}} {{received}} positive reviews music critics. AbsolutePunk staff member Aj LaGambina considered the release [...] "easily digestible" [...] and praised its [...] "cohesiveness". He thought the songs were composed well, despite the short recording time-frame. LaGambina described the production as [...] "well balanced" [...] and praised Fisher's vocals as [...] "com a very long way" [...] from the band's first album, I Wish <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Stay</b> Here (2011). The only criticism the reviewer appointed to the EP was the percussion which sounded [...] "a bit cymbal heavy." [...] Alternative Press contributor Brian Kraus wrote that the band stuck with the alternative rock sound that they had used on Colourmekindness for this EP. He described Fisher's vocals as [...] "stretch across the canvas", and not too dissimilar {{to those of the}} members of Swervedriver. Kraus considered [...] "Animal Nitrate" [...] the [...] "most sprawling song" [...] of the set.|$|E

She also said that she [...] "was the wildest thing out there. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> up longer, drink more and kick the biggest ass in town. I was on the ragged edge." ...|$|E

2500|$|Evert versus Goolagong was {{the match}} for the 1975 US Open title, which the first set went to the superbly playing Googlagong in five games to seven. Goolagong was playing a {{slashing}} and attacking style of game during the first set and into {{the first part of}} the second set, but Evert fought back with a track down ever ball mentality, which this allowed Evert to win the second set six games to four. In the final set, Evert was down one game to two, she rallied off five more games in a row to win six games to two. To this, Evert responded [...] "I was down on myself the whole match. I felt the pressure. But after two-all in the third set, I don't know what happened but I got more confident. I knew if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> in there I could win the match." [...] This is exactly what she did, and this was her first-time that she won the US Open, which is her national open.|$|E
