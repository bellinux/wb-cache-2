5000|$|The {{biological}} function of ERGIC2 protein is unknown, {{although it was}} initially identified as a candidate tumor suppressor of prostate cancer, and {{has been shown to}} induce cell growth arrest and senescence, to suppress colony formation in soft agar, and to decrease invasive potential of human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3 cells). [...] It is now believed to be a chaperon molecule involved in protein trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi. The protein contains two hydrophobic transmembrane domains that help anchoring the molecule on the ER membrane, such that its large luminal domain orients inside the ER lumen and both the N- and C-termini are facing the cytosol. ERGIC2 forms a complex with two other proteins, ERGIC3 and ERGIC32, resulting in a shuttle for protein trafficking between ER and Golgi. [...] It has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, such as beta-amyloid, protein elongation factor 1alpha, and otoferlin. Therefore, it may {{play an important role in}} cellular functions besides of being a component of a protein trafficking shuttle.More recently, a variant transcript of ERGIC2 has been reported. [...] It has a deletion of four bases at the junction of exons 8 and 9, resulting a <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutation</b> after codon #189. The variant transcript encodes a truncated protein of 215 residues, which loses 45% of the luminal domain and the transmembrane domain near the C-terminus. This effectively abrogates its function as a protein transporter. A similar variant is also reported in armadillo. So this is not a random mutation.

Laboratory {{confirmation}} of the clinical disease, which occurs in the autumn of most years in Denmark, has been achieved previously using antigen ELISA and electron microscopy. Results An unusually large number of clinically suspected cases of myxomatosis were observed in Denmark during 2007. Myxoma virus DNA was detected, using a new real time PCR assay which targets the M 029 L gene, in over 70 % of the clinical samples submitted for laboratory confirmation. Unexpectedly, further analysis revealed that a high proportion of these viral DNA preparations contained a <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutation</b> within the M 135 R gene that has previously been identified as a virulence factor. This <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutation</b> results in expression of a greatly truncated product. The same <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutation</b> has also been found recently within an avirulent strain of myxoma virus (6918). However, three other frame-shift mutations found in this strain (in the genes M 009 L, M 036 L and M 148 R) were not shared with the Danish viruses but a single nucleotide deletion in the M 138 R/M 139 R intergenic region was a common feature. Conclusions It appears that expression of the full-length myxoma virus M 135 R protein is not required for virulence in rabbits. Hence, the <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutation</b> in the M 135 R gene in the nonpathogenic 6918 virus strain is not sufficient to explain the attenuation of this myxoma virus but one/some of the other frame-shift mutations alone or in conjunction with one/some of the thirty two amino acid substitutions must also contribute. The real time PCR assay for myxoma virus is a useful diagnostic tool for laboratory confirmation of suspected cases of myxomatosis. </p...|$|E

A 20 -year-old female patient with adenomatous polyposis underwent a right colectomy at 13 years of age. Five years later, she developed an abdominal desmoid tumor that was resected. After 2 more years, a recurrent desmoid tumor {{was found in the}} same region. This tumor grew rapidly and quickly became massive. The doubling time was estimated to be 122 days, based on the computed tomography findings. When we analyzed the APC gene in the recurrent desmoid tumor, we found a novel <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutation</b> at codon 1564. This <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutation</b> changed TTA to TAG, which is a stop codon. Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis for OPN, a GRGDS (glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine) - containing adhesive molecule, revealed abundant amounts of OPN mRNA and protein expression in this desmoid tumor. We postulated that the truncated APC protein and OPN expression might be involved in the invasive nature of this recurrent desmoid tumor. A primary cell culture derived from the desmoid tumor was assessed for chemosensitivity to 5 -fluorouracil, cisplatin, doxorubicin, colchicine, docetaxel, and anti-OPN antibody. Docetaxel was found to have the strongest inhibitory effect on cell growth. As a result, docetaxel was administered to this patient (60 mg/m 2 /month) for 3 cycles.

Single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis was used to screen the ileal Na/bile acid cotransporter gene (SLC 10 A 2) for FHTG-associated mutations. Analysis of 20 hypertriglyceridemic patients with abnormal bile acid metabolism revealed 3 missense mutations (V 98 I, V 159 I, and A 171 S), a <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutation</b> (646 insG) at codon 216, and 4 polymorphisms in the 5 flanking sequence of SLC 10 A 2. The SLC 10 A 2 missense mutations and 5 flanking sequence polymorphisms were not correlated with bile acid production or turnover in the hypertriglyceridemic patients and were equally prevalent in the unaffected control subjects. In transfected COS cells, the V 98 I, V 159 I, and A 171 S isoforms all transported bile acids similar to the wild-type SLC 10 A 2. The 646 insG <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutation</b> abolished bile acid transport activity in transfected COS cells but was found in only a single FHTG patient.

To uncover the molecular basis of papaya flesh color, we took map-based cloning and candidate gene approaches using integrated genetic and physical maps. A DNA marker tightly linked to flesh color colocalized on a contig of the physical map with a cDNA probe of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) chromoplast-specific lycopene Î²-cyclase, CYC-b. Candidate gene sequences were obtained from amplified fragments and verified by sequencing two bacterial artificial chromosomes containing the two alleles. Sequence comparison revealed a 2 -bp insertion in the coding region of the recessive red flesh allele resulting in a <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutation</b> and a premature stop codon. A color complementation test in bacteria confirmed that the papaya CpCYC-b is the gene controlling fruit flesh color. Sequence analysis of wild and cultivated papaya accessions showed the presence of this <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutation</b> in all red flesh accessions examined.

40|$|Studies {{using the}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae aging model have {{uncovered}} life span regulatory pathways that are partially conserved in higher eukaryotes 1 - 2. The simplicity {{and power of}} the yeast aging model can also be explored to study DNA damage and genome maintenance as well as their contributions to diseases during aging. Here, we describe a system to study age-dependent DNA mutations, including base substitutions, <b>frame-shift</b> <b>mutations,</b> gross chromosomal rearrangements, and homologous/homeologous recombination, as well as nuclear DNA repair activity by combining the yeast chronological life span with simple DNA damage and mutation assays. The methods described here should facilitate the identification of genes/pathways that regulate genomic instability and the mechanisms that underlie age-dependent DNA mutations and cancer in mammals.
