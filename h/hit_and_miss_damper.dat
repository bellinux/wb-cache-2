50|$|Rather than {{repeating the}} {{algorithm}} m times, implement it exhaustively (i.e. n times, once for each instance) for relatively small n (up to one thousand). Furthermore, rather than finding the single nearest <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> single nearest <b>miss,</b> which may cause redundant and noisy attributes {{to affect the}} selection of the nearest neighbours, RELIEFF searches for k nearest <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> <b>misses</b> <b>and</b> averages their contribution to the weights of each feature. k can be tuned for any individual problem.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Modern {{application}} specific system-on-chip plat-forms allow customization of caches. Such flexibility {{enables the}} designers {{to identify the}} suitable cache configurations through design space exploration of caches. Trace-driven simulation is widely used to obtain the cache <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> <b>misses</b> for design space exploration. However, simulation is normally slow. Meanwhile, as the embedded system moves toward cache hierarchies with multi-level caches, such expanded design space leads to extremely long simulation time. In this paper, we propose a rapid design space exploration technique for two-level unified caches. Given the application trace, our technique determines the cache <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> <b>misses</b> for multiple cache configurations in a single pass. Our exploration technique adopts a novel LRU linked list data structure, lookup tables, and search algorithms to effectively improve the exploration time. Experimental results indicate that our analysis is 7 – 239 X times faster compared to the fastest known design space exploration technique, in estimating cache <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> <b>misses</b> for popular embedded benchmarks.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of a cache replacement policy expresses {{to what extent}} the execution history may influence the number of cache <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> <b>misses</b> during program execution. We present an algorithm to compute the {{sensitivity of}} a replacement policy. We have implemented this algorithm in a tool called RELACS that can handle a large class of replacement policies including LRU, FIFO, PLRU, and MRU. Sensitivity properties obtained with RELACS demonstrate that the execution history can have a strong impact on the number of cache <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> <b>misses</b> if FIFO, PLRU, or MRU is used. A simple model of execution time is used to evaluate the impact of cache sensitivity on measured execution times. The model shows that measured execution times may strongly underestimate the worst-case execution time for FIFO, PLRU, and MRU...|$|R

Gabor wavelet edge filters are used at two scales and these are combined using algorithm fusion to locate edges of various sizes (scales) under varying contrast and noise conditions. This novel algorithm fusion approach is tested on different microscopy images of several materials and shown to be robust to these changing imaging conditions.
