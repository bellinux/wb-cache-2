50|$|Alien Workshop (AWS) is an {{independent}} American skateboarding company that was founded in 1990 by Chris Carter, Mike Hill, and Neil Blender in Dayton, Ohio. Following periods under the ownership of the Burton snowboard company and original team rider Rob Dyrdek in 2012, the company was acquired by Pacific Vector Holdings in October 2013. Alien Workshop produced skateboard <b>decks,</b> <b>wheels,</b> apparel, and other skateboard accessories prior to its closure in May 2014.In 2015, Alien Workshop was revived with an all-amateur team and distribution through Tum Yeto.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to summarize the load and resistance criteria for highway bridge plank decks, and to estimate the reliability of plank decks designed by AASHTO Code. Both transverse and longitudinal planks for a variety of typical stringer spacings and plank sizes are considered. Truck traffic load data is based on the model used to calibrate the 1994 AASHTO LRFD Code. However, for plank <b>decks,</b> <b>wheel</b> load rather than whole vehicle weight is most important, and these statistics are developed for this study. For wood planks, dead load and dynamic load are not significant. The limit state considered is flexural strength, and resistance statistics are presented for wood planks in terms of modulus of rupture. Special flat-wise use data are presented to account for section aspect ratio as well as edge of load application. The reliability analysis is carried out using the procedure developed for calibration of AASHTO LRFD. Reliability indices for both AASHTO Standard and AASHTO LRFD Code are presented for plank decks. The results indicate that there are considerable differences in plank reliabilit...|$|R

A mountainboard {{is made up of}} components including a deck, bindings to secure the rider to the <b>deck,</b> four <b>wheels</b> with pneumatic tires, and two steering mechanisms known as trucks. Mountainboarders, {{also known as}} riders, ride specifically designed boardercross tracks, slopestyle parks, grass hills, woodlands, gravel tracks, streets, skateparks, ski resorts, BMX courses and mountain bike trails. It is this ability to ride such a variety of terrain that makes mountainboarding different from other board sports.|$|R

5|$|The {{ship was}} to have been {{equipped}} with two 82m-long hangar <b>decks</b> for <b>wheeled</b> aircraft and a third 128m-long hangar deck for seaplanes; all of the hangars were 18.5m wide.

The ship's designers intended to mount a take off deck on the bow, which would have been 30m long and 10.5m wide. According to naval historian Erich Gröner, the ship was designed to carry either 13 fixed-wing or 19 folding-wing seaplanes, along with around 10 wheeled aircraft.

5000|$|In vessels with whipstaffs (long {{vertical}} poles extending above deck, {{acting as}} a lever to move the tiller below deck), relieving lines were attached to the tiller or directly to the whipstaff. When wheels were introduced, their greater mechanical advantage lessened {{the need for such}} assistance, but relieving tackle could still be used on the tiller, located on a <b>deck</b> underneath the <b>wheel.</b> [...] Relieving tackle was also rigged on vessels going into battle, to assist in steering in case the helm was damaged or shot away. When a storm threatened, or battle impended, the tackle would be affixed to the tiller, and hands assigned to man them. Additional tackle was available to attach directly to the rudder as surety against loss of the tiller.|$|R

5000|$|Riser pads {{increase}} {{the distance between}} the wheels on a longboard and the deck in order to prevent wheel bite (when the <b>deck</b> scrapes the <b>wheels,</b> causing the wheels to stop turning). They also reduce the strain on the deck from the trucks being directly in contact with it and the vibration caused through riding. Riser pads are normally made of plastic. Shock pads, which are more rubbery than riser pads, serve the same function only with more emphasis on reducing strain and less on increasing {{the distance between the}} <b>wheels</b> and <b>deck.</b> Riser pads also come angled which can make the board turn more or less. Angled risers are usually used by LDP's(Long Distance Pumper) to help aid the rider in pumping (propelling the board with turns) ...|$|R
5|$|HMS Argus was a British {{aircraft}} carrier that {{served in the}} Royal Navy from 1918 to 1944.

After commissioning, the ship was heavily involved for several years {{in the development of the}} optimum design for other aircraft carriers. Argus also evaluated various types of arresting gear, general procedures needed to operate a number of aircraft in concert, and fleet tactics. The ship was too top-heavy as originally built and had to be modified to improve her stability in the mid-1920s. She spent one brief deployment on the China Station in the late 1920s before being placed in reserve for budgetary reasons.|$|R

Campbell was the first Secretary-class cutter to transfer for duty with the Navy (on 1 July 1941) {{and the first to}} sail on escort of convoy duties when she escorted Convoy HX-159 which sailed on 10 November 1941.

In the evening--above all, if Tommy had produced some of his civilisation--yarns and music were the rule. Amalu had a sweet Hawaiian voice; and Hemstead, a great hand upon the banjo, accompanied his own quavering tenor with effect. There was {{a sense in which}} the little man could sing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the performance test and long-term monitoring of the prestressing force inside concrete performed on a pretensioned Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) deck. The force is measured by applying a 7 -wire strand embedded with an FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor. The performance test was conducted on a 3. 7 [*]m × 1. 8 [*]m pretensioned <b>deck</b> specimen through <b>wheel</b> loading tests to verify the applicability of the measurement method. In addition, a 12. 3 [*]m long and 4. 8 [*]m wide bridge with a pretensioned UHPC deck was erected and long-term monitoring was conducted over three years to verify the applicability of the method to real bridges. The effectiveness of the measurement method of the prestressing force inside concrete is verified, and the long-term monitoring data are used to investigate various temperature compensation methods. The results show that the proposed method enables effective measurement of small changes in the prestressing force inside the concrete. These changes are caused by the external forces acting on the bridge in service and provide sufficient durability for long-term sensing. The analysis of the prestressing force obtained through long-term monitoring reveals the necessity of conducting temperature compensation for the consistency of the data acquired using the FBG sensor. Moreover, the selection of the thermal expansion coefficient appears also to be of critical importance for temperature compensation...|$|R
60|$|Finally, {{about six}} bells of the watch, the {{stranger}} wore ship and bore down across our bows, hoisting English colours, at sight of which I could scarce forbear a cheer. At this instant, Captain Griggs woke {{to the fact}} that his helm was still lashed, and bestowing a hearty kick on his prostrate quartermaster stuck fast to the pitchy seams of the <b>deck,</b> took the <b>wheel</b> himself, and easing off before the wind to bring the vessels broadside to broadside, commanded that the guns be shooed to the muzzle, an order that was barely executed before the brigantine came within close range. Aboard her was all order and readiness; the men at her guns fuse in hand, an erect and pompous figure of a man, in a cocked hat, on the break of her poop. He raised his hand, two puffs of white smoke darted out, and I heard first the shrieking of shot, the broadside came crashing round us, one tearing through the mainsail below me, another mangling two men in the waist of our schooner, and Griggs gave the order to touch off. But two of his guns answered, one of which had been so gorged with shot that it burst in a hundred pieces and sent the fellow with the swab to perdition, and such a hell of blood and confusion as resulted is indescribable. I saw Griggs in a wild fit of rage force the helm down, the schooner flying into the wind. And by this time, the brigantine having got round and presented her port battery, raked us at a bare hundred yards, and I was the first to guess by the tilting forward of the mast that our hull was hit between wind and water, and was fast settling by the bow.|$|R
