The so-called water wars of 2000 and 2006 in Cochabamba and El Alto, respectively, added social unrest and conflict into the difficulties of managing water resources in Bolivia. Evo Morales’ administration is currently developing an institutional and legal framework aimed at increasing participation, especially for rural and indigenous communities, and separating the sector from previous privatization policies. In 2009, the new Environment and Water Resources Ministry was created absorbing the responsibilities previously under the Water Ministry.

25|$|Water {{resources}} {{management in}} the country, in particular water quality, quantity and Watershed management faces major challenges today. Despite {{of the lack of}} systematic data limiting an accurate and detailed assessment of the scope of the problems, there is a consensus that: (i) the overall poor quality of surface, groundwater and coastal water resources {{is the result of a}} lack of waste water management and agricultural run-off, causing health problems that disproportionally affect the poor; (ii) water scarcity is a regional problem resulting from poor demand management in irrigation, urban water supply and tourist infrastructure in drier regions; (iii) weak watershed management leads to soil erosion and amplifies the damage and frequency of flooding; and (iv) the overall lack of solid waste management pollutes water sources, causes disease and is a nuisance for inhabitants and visitors alike. The DR <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the process of reducing its role as main investor for water resources infrastructure and services provider decentralizing some responsibilities to local and regional government, water users organizations, and private companies.|$|E

The latter includes a gender sensitive national education policy compliant with world standards, such as those outlined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Examples of this and other educational measures at work are the government's enactment of legislation aimed at securing the educational interests of girls, promoting the growth of an Early Childhood Development (ECD) program designed to reach parents and care-givers in their homes {{as well as in the}} ECD centers for 0- to 5-year-old children, and introducing incentive packages to encourage teachers to work in remote rural areas.|$|E

25|$|The Scottish Government {{conducted}} a three-month-long consultation which ended on 9 December 2011 and the analysis {{was published in}} July 2012. Unlike the consultation held in England and Wales, Scotland considered both civil and religious same-sex marriage. Whilst the Scottish <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> favour of same-sex marriage, it stated that no religious body {{would be forced to}} hold such ceremonies once legislation is enacted. The Scottish consultation received more than 77,000 responses, and on 27 June 2013 the Government published the bill. In order to preserve the freedom of both religious groups and individual clergy, the Scottish Government believed it necessary for changes to be made to the Equality Act 2010 and communicated with the UK Government on this matter; thus, the first same-sex marriages in Scotland did not occur until this had taken place. Although the Scottish bill concerning same-sex marriage had been published, the 'Australian' reported that LGBT rights campaigners, celebrating outside the UK Parliament on 15 July 2013 for the clearance of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill in the House of Lords, declared that they would continue the campaign to extend same-sex marriage rights to both Scotland and Northern Ireland, rather than solely Northern Ireland, where there are no plans to introduce such legislation. On 4 February 2014, the Scottish Parliament overwhelmingly passed legislation legalising same-sex marriage. The bill received royal assent as the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 on 12 March 2014. The law took effect on 16 December 2014, with the first same-sex weddings occurring for those converting their civil partnerships into marriage. Malcolm Brown and Joe Schofield from Tullibody were scheduled {{to be the first to}} be declared husband and husband just after midnight on 31 December, following a Humanist ceremony, but they were superseded by couples marrying on 16 December. Nonetheless, Brown and Schofield were married on Hogmanay.|$|E

500|$|Provisions in {{statutes}} {{declaring that}} certain decisions by public authorities shall be conclusive evidence of some facts {{have been found}} by the Singapore courts to be valid, and therefore {{have the effect of}} preventing applicants from challenging most– but not all– of such decisions by way of judicial review. In Galstaun v. Attorney-General (1980), the applicant alleged that the Collector of Land Revenue had compulsorily acquired more of his land that was required for public purposes pursuant to the Land Acquisition Act. The High Court held that the argument had to be rejected in the light of section 5(3) of the Act, which provided that the President's declaration that land was needed for a public purpose [...] "shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for the purpose specified therein". The Court said: [...] "When the Government declares that a certain purpose is a public purpose it must be presumed that the <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> possession of facts which induce the Government to declare that the purpose is a public purpose". However, in Teng Fuh Holdings Pte. Ltd. v. Collector of Land Revenue (2006), the Court clarified that section 5(3) cannot prevent judicial intervention if there is evidence that the Government exercised its power of compulsory acquisition in bad faith.|$|E
