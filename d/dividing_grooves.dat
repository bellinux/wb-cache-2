40|$|Gemination is a {{developmental}} anomaly {{caused by an}} incomplete division of a single tooth germ. Geminated teeth tend to have two crowns (or one mesiodistally wide crown) sharing a single root and pulp chamber. In the case of one large crown, a longitudinal <b>groove</b> <b>dividing</b> the crown and the root into almost equal halves or an incisal notch could be present. In this case, a 22 -year-old man suffered from pulp infection, which resulted in pulp necrosis and swelling caused by a geminated maxillary central incisor that had suffered previous trauma.

50|$|The {{cephalothorax}} {{is almost}} entirely covered by a carapace, only the insertion of the eyestalks protruding slightly beyond it. A deep transverse groove, called the cervical <b>groove,</b> <b>divides</b> the anterior 40% of the carapace from the posterior 60%. At the front, the carapace bears a fairly long rostrum, which is wide at the base, giving it a triangular outline when seen from above. From the side, it is curved in a weak S-shape, bending initially upwards, and then curving slightly forwards again. The cephalothorax becomes slightly wider behind the cervical groove. The carapace, including the rostrum, is covered with forward-pointing teeth (pointed tubercles), including two rows side-by-side along the animal's midline; these rows bridge the cervical groove, but become weaker in the posterior half of the carapace. Beneath the carapace is a branchial chamber, containing 28 pairs of gills.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe crystal {{structure}} of cytochrome c 3 from the sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Norway strain, {{has been determined}} through the fitting of the recently completed primary structure to a 2. 5 A resolution electron density map. The phase calculations were based on three mercurial derivatives; anomalous scattering data were used to refine the four heme iron positions. A preliminary refinement of the molecular model {{has led to a}} conventional crystallographic R factor of 34 %. Cytochrome c 3 is folded in two structural domains with one heme in each, the two other heme moieties lying in a large <b>groove</b> <b>dividing</b> the molecule. The core of the protein is the compact four-heme cluster which presents a relatively high degree of solvent exposure. The structural pattern of redox centers suggests that electron transfer might occur through direct contacts between some of the heme groups, via the overlapping system of pi oribitals or via intervening amino acid side chains or both.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. The design of an All-Reflection Michelson Interferometer {{for use in}} the ultraviolet region is presented. Two different Mercury light sources, a pen- ray lamp and a germicidal lamp, were used to evaluate the performance of the instrument at 253 7 A. The interferometer uses a pinhole aperture at the focus of an off-axis parabolic mirror to obtain a collimated input beam. A plane diffraction grating with sinusoidal <b>grooves</b> <b>divides</b> the beam into two orders. Planar mirrors reflect the beams back to the grating where they are directed to the detector. The beams recombine to form a linear interference pattern which is recorded by an ultraviolet detector. Data-reduction software was developed for this instrument. This software performs coherent addition of the interference pattern and creates a doubled-sided interferogram. The resulting spectrum is obtained using Fourier Transform techniques. The results of the data-reduction software suggest there is a sampling error associated with the detector. Overall, the All-Reflection Michelson Interferometer is well suited for remote sensing of mid- to extreme-ultraviolet ionospheric emissions from a sounding rocket, space shuttle or satellite platform.

40|$|The {{parasite}} Cryptosporidium parvum {{has three}} 14 - 3 - 3 proteins: Cp 14 e, Cp 14 a and Cp 14 b, with only Cp 14 e similar to human 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in sequence, peptide-binding properties and structure. Structurally, Cp 14 a features the classical 14 - 3 - 3 dimer {{but with a}} uniquely wide pocket and a disoriented RRY triad potentially incapable of binding phosphopeptides. The Cp 14 b protein deviates from the norm significantly: (i) In one subunit, the phosphorylated C-terminal tail is bound in the binding groove like a phosphopeptide. This supports our binding study indicating this protein was stabilized by a peptide mimicking its last six residues. (ii) The other subunit has eight helices instead of nine, with aA and aB forming a single helix and occluding the peptide-binding cleft. (iii) The protein forms a degenerate dimer with the two binding <b>grooves</b> <b>divided</b> and facing opposite directions. These features conspire to block and disrupt the bicameral substrate-binding pocket, suggesting a possible tripartite auto-regulation mechanism {{that has not been}} observed previously.

Methods: Single center, selection of patients for cataract surgery deemed low risk and suitable for surgical teaching cases. Individual lens thickness measurements from biometry were calculated with known phaco tip dimensions to give an individualized safe number of phaco tip depths for <b>grooving</b> during <b>divide</b> and conquer. This technique was then applied during cataract surgery. Results: Utilization of this technique allows calculation and determination of an appropriate number of phaco tip depths of grooving for each individual patient. This technique was applied as a teaching tool for surgical trainees, with subsequent successful safe cataract surgeries completed. No posterior capsule ruptures were noted for these cases. Conclusion: By combining the biometric measurements of an individual patient’s lens thickness together with known phaco tip dimensions, individualized safe groove depths can be theoretically determined and applied during divide and conquer cataract surgery.

40|$|During {{its life}} cycle, the cribellate spider Austrochilus sp. {{passes through the}} ecri­bellate nymphal, or spiderling stage (= the first instar, after leaving the egg sac), which has three pairs of spinnerets. According to the {{position}} and distribution of spigots on the spinnerets, these spigots {{are assumed to be}} connected to glandu­lae ampullaceae major, glandulae ampullaceae minor, glandulae piriformes and glan­dulae aciniformes. Such a spinning apparatus allows spiderlings to make drag­lines, attachment discs and silk for the molting platform. The cribellum, just like the calamistrum, is not developed in this stage. Instead the precribellum is present, which is similar to spinnerets in its shape (two protuberances <b>divided</b> by a <b>groove</b> and the presence of setae that look like spigots), but with a cuticle similar to the cribellum. The spinning apparatus of Austrochilus sp. shows one possible way in which the transformation of the anterior median spinnerets into the cribellum could have occurred during the evolution of silk-producing organs. In the following nymphal stage, the cribellum, the calamistrum and also the pa­racribellum are developed. Spiders in this stage are capable, after dispersal, of weaving complete webs, which serve as snares as well as retreats. The spigots of the paracribellum are on the posterior median and posterior lateral spinnerets...|$|R
40|$|Sardinia {{is a major}} Island in the Mediterranean with a high {{incidence}} of multiple sclerosis, a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. Disease susceptibility in Sardinian population has been associated with five alleles of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II DRB 1 gene. We performed 120 ns of molecular dynamics simulation on one predisposing and one protective alleles, unbound and in complex with the two relevant peptides: Myelin Basic Protein and Epstein Barr Virus derived peptide. In particular we focused on the MHC peptide binding groove dynamics. The predisposing allele was found to form a stable complex with both the peptides, while the protective allele displayed stability only when bound with myelin peptide. The local flexibility of the MHC was probed <b>dividing</b> the binding <b>groove</b> into four compartments covering the well known peptide anchoring pockets. The predisposing allele in the first half cleft exhibits a narrower and more rigid groove conformation in the presence of myelin peptide. The protective allele shows a similar behavior, while in the second half cleft it displays a narrower and more flexible groove conformation in the presence of viral peptide. We further characterized these dynamical differences by evaluating H-bonds, hydrophobic and stacking interaction networks, finding striking similarities with super-type patterns emerging in other autoimmune diseases. The protective allele shows a defined preferential binding to myelin peptide, as confirmed by binding free energy calculations. All together, we believe the presented molecular analysis could help to design experimental assays, support...|$|R
