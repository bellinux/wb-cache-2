500|$|On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were {{announced}} as 2012 inductees to the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. Slovak's brother James accepted the award {{on his behalf}} and gave a speech honoring his brother. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Kiedis expressed his excitement with Slovak's induction, explaining [...] "He's a beautiful person that picked up a guitar in the 1970s and didn't {{make it out of}} the 1980s, and he is getting honored for his beauty". [...] Flea echoed those comments on the same day: [...] "Hillel grew up loving rock and roll so much, he hasn't been here for some time, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it would mean to him. It's a powerful thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. We want to keep going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the players have enjoyed it and it gives you a wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going to be sad, one was going to be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because I feel for Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 Tomlinson donated £200,000 as {{patron of}} the Human Milk Bank of Cheshire and North Wales. The charity {{provides}} babies on Special Care Baby Units with milk from donor mothers, significantly improving their chances of survival and long-term development. He said: [...] "Due to my own recent experiences with my health, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> hospitals and appeals appreciate help and assistance. This is such an important service which can help so many families and I'm very honoured to be the patron." ...|$|E
6000|$|Winston nodded. [...] "You did. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> your promise was worth, but {{in view of}} {{the risks}} you ran, I had not {{expected}} you to turn up at the Grange." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had studied}} myself; I had had {{experience}} of myself; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>I</b> loved her, and how happy I should be," [...] pursued the Carrier. [...] "But I had not--I feel it now--sufficiently considered her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bathsheba {{could not}} face the haymakers now. Her heart erratically flitting hither and thither from perplexed excitement, hot, and almost tearful, she retreated homeward, murmuring, [...] "Oh, what have I done! What does it mean! <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{of it was}} true!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall have plenty of time to think of better words".|$|E

60|$|I was desperate. Disaster stalked {{before me}} incarnate {{in the form}} of that gold-ear-ringed, weather-beaten son of the sea. Who was he? What was he? I must solve him ere he solved me.
