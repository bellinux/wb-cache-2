2500|$|Criminal law, {{also known}} as penal law, {{pertains}} to crimes and punishment. It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences {{found to have a}} sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevent people from committing a crime in the first place. Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of criminal procedure. The paradigm case of a crime lies in the proof, beyond reasonable doubt, that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or actus reus (guilty act). Second, the accused must have the requisite malicious intent to do a criminal act, or mens rea (guilty mind). However, for so called [...] "strict liability" [...] crimes, an actus reus is enough. Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (dolus directus and <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis),</b> and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.|$|E
50|$|The SCA, despite citing Van Wyk with approval, {{with regard}} to evidential matters, did not adopt the view set forth in that case that only {{foresight}} of a reasonable possibility of the harm occurring could constitute <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis.</b> Hoctor submits that this approach is correct, and that the foresight component of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> should not be subjected to any such qualification.|$|E
50|$|The first {{requirement}} {{deals with}} what the accused conceives to be the circumstances or possible consequences of his actions. There cannot be <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> {{if he does not}} envisage those circumstances or consequences. <b>Dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> differs from dolus indirectus in that the accused foresees the prohibited result not as one which necessarily will flow from his act, but only as a possibility.|$|E
50|$|Intention• There must be {{intention}} {{to commit the}} completed crime.• <b>Dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> is sufficient.• Remember: cannot negligently attempt to do something.|$|E
5000|$|S v Chitate is an {{important}} case in South African criminal law. As Loubser and Rabie point out in their review of the law on <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis,</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{view that}} {{foresight}} {{of only the}} possibility of the consequences resulting from an accused’s act is sufficient for <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> “can now be regarded as settled law.” ...|$|E
50|$|Subjective {{foresight}} of {{the possibility}} of the occurrence of a consequence, or the existence of circumstances, is apparently not in itself sufficient for <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis.</b> In addition, the accused’s state of mind in regard to that possibility, it has been held, must be one of “consenting” to the materialisation {{of the possibility}}, “reconciling” himself to it, “taking foreseen possibility into the bargain,” or “recklessness” in regard to that possibility. Jansen JA, in S v Ngubane, used all of these apparently interchangeable terms to describe the additional element of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Intention, {{and more}} {{particularly}} {{the intention to}} damage property by setting fire to it, thereby causing patrimonial harm to somebody, is also required. <b>Dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> {{in this regard is}} sufficient.|$|E
5000|$|... intention, {{and more}} {{particularly}} <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis,</b> cannot be established {{through the application}} of an objective criterion. It must be proved that the accused subjectively foresaw the possible occurrence of the consequence in question.|$|E
50|$|Criminal {{systems of}} the civil law {{tradition}} distinguish between intention in the broad sense (dolus directus and <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis),</b> and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.|$|E
50|$|In S v De Bruyn, Holmes JA stated obiter that <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> {{is present}} if the accused “foresees the possibility, however remote, of his act {{resulting}} in death to another.” Later in his judgment he added (also obiter), “If, under cross-examination, an accused were {{to admit that}} he foresaw the possibility of death, on the footing that anything is possible, that would contribute to a conviction of murder.” In S v Beukes, in contrast, Van Heerden JA accepted that <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> would normally be present only where the accused foresaw the occurrence of the unlawful consequence or the existence of the unlawful circumstance as a “reasonable” possibility.|$|E
50|$|The {{requirements}} of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> are substantially the same whether a consequence or circumstance is involved. However, since a causal sequence is never in {{issue in a}} circumstance crime, the rules about mistake regarding the causal sequence enunciated in Goosen obviously do not apply.|$|E
5000|$|In {{this case}} the court found {{subjective}} foresight to be present and stated that, in addition, {{it was necessary to}} show that the accused's attitude of mind was one of callous disregard for the consequences, so that possible death was regarded by him as irrelevant when weighed against the attainment of his immediate objective. The victim died while undergoing an abortion. Because it was not shown that the incidence of fatal abortions in like circumstances was high, the court found that <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> was not proved. [...] "However," [...] write Loubser and Rabie, [...] "it is arguable that a low incidence of fatalities in these circumstances could also justify the inference that the accused did not actually foresee death as a possible result, and lacked <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> for this reason." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} whether an accused person who {{foresees}} {{the possibility of a}} consequence, or the existence of a circumstance, may be said to consent or reconcile himself or herself to, or accept the consequence or circumstance into the bargain, {{is referred to as the}} “volitional” component of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The court {{overturned}} {{the verdict of}} the trial court on 3 December 2015, upgrading the conviction to murder, finding that the lower court did not correctly apply the rule of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis,</b> and also that Pistorius was not justified in claiming that he thought his own life was in danger.|$|E
5000|$|The {{courts have}} usually spoken simply of {{foresight}} of “possibility,” or of “risk,” unqualified by any adjective. Given that foresight of a possibility will constitute intention {{in the form}} of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis,</b> does it follow, then, that even the most remote and unlikely possibility, if foreseen, must be taken to have been intended? ...|$|E
50|$|In S v Beukes, Van Heerden JA {{acknowledged}} that no decision {{has in fact}} turned {{on the question of}} recklessness, and that normally recklessness would only be satisfied where the accused foresaw a consequence as a “reasonable” possibility. Nevertheless, Van Heerden JA noted that recklessness is of value as an additional element of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Having {{examined}} the evidence, and having {{concluded that the}} appellants acts caused the deceaseds death, the court assessed {{whether or not the}} appellant had acted intentionally. In doing so, it had regard to the test for <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis,</b> as authoritatively formulated by Holmes JA in S v Sigwahla Subjective foresight is established by a process of inferential reasoning.|$|E
50|$|On 11 January 2016, Pistorius {{applied for}} {{leave to appeal}} to South Africa’s {{constitutional}} court, his lawyers contended that the Supreme Court of Appeal had 'acted unlawfully and unconstitutionally' by rejecting factual findings of the original verdict, and made mistakes in its application {{of the principle of}} <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis.</b> On 3 March 2016 the Constitutional Court denied the application.|$|E
5000|$|Bertrand Cantat (born 5 March 1964) is a French {{musician}} and formerly the frontman of rock band Noir Désir. In 2003, {{he was convicted}} of involuntary manslaughter ("murder with indirect intent" [...] - <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis)</b> of French actress Marie Trintignant. He returned to Noir Désir after his release from prison in 2007, playing with the group until it disbanded in 2010.|$|E
5000|$|... {{although}} {{the element of}} recklessness and its variants have been emphasized frequently by our courts, it has very seldom, if ever, been of practical importance {{in the sense that}} <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> was explicitly found to be lacking on account of an absence of recklessness. It has been pointed out by certain commentators that Chitate appears to be the only such case.|$|E
50|$|In other words, for {{intention}} in {{the form}} of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> to exist, there not only has to be at least foresight of the possibility of the consequence occurring, and not only must the accused proceed with his conduct despite such foresight, {{but there has to be}} a substantial correlation between the foreseen way in which the consequence might have occurred and the actual way in which it did.|$|E
5000|$|... “In {{spite of}} an {{objective}} formulation of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> in some earlier cases relating principally to {{the doctrine of}} common purpose,” since the early 1950s the courts have favoured a subjective test for intention, which was ultimately adopted by the Appellate Division in R v Nsele. Since Nsele, the subjective test for criminal intention has been consistently applied by South African courts. It is now settled law that ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{facts of}} R v Jolly provide a clear {{illustration}} {{of the meaning of}} <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis.</b> The appellants had unlawfully and deliberately derailed a train. No-one was seriously injured. The appellants argued that there was no desire to injure anyone; they had chosen a spot where the train was moving slowly up a rising gradient with banks {{on either side of the}} line. Innes CJ held, despite this, that they had intended to kill: ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{principle}} {{it should}} not matter in respect of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> whether the agent foresees (subjectively) the possibility as strong or faint, as probable or improbable provided {{his state of mind}} in regard to that possibility is [...] "consenting," [...] "reconciling" [...] or [...] "taking foreseen possibility into the bargain." [...] However, the likelihood {{in the eyes of the}} agent of the possibility eventuating must obviously have a bearing on the question whether he did consent to that possibility.|$|E
50|$|As to {{the fifth}} count (attempted murder), {{the court held that}} the State had not proven beyond a {{reasonable}} doubt that Laubscher had the necessary intention, in the form of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis,</b> to kill his child—especially {{in view of the fact}} that the whole object of his visit to the farm that evening had been to collect his child. As regards sentence, the court held that the appellant had without doubt been suffering from severe stress, and so his sentence was mitigated.|$|E
50|$|In short, if {{the accused}} foresaw the {{consequences}} or circumstances in question {{not as a}} probable result of his act, but considered that {{there was even a}} possibility that they could result (and if he reconciled himself to this possibility), he will have had intention in the sense of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis.</b> On the other hand, if he did not actually foresee the possibility, but as a reasonable man ought to have foreseen it, he lacked intention; at most he was negligent.|$|E
5000|$|... “After some {{uncertainty}} in older cases,” this question was settled {{in part by}} the decision of the Appellate Division in R v Horn. Prior to this case, it was unclear whether <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> required foresight {{on the part of the}} accused that the consequences in question would probably result from his act, or whether it was sufficient if he foresaw that the consequences might possibly result. The Appellate Division decided that realisation of the possibility of the consequences is sufficient for criminal intention.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> exists {{where the}} accused {{does not mean}} {{to bring about the}} {{unlawful}} circumstance, or cause the unlawful consequence which follows from his conduct, but foresees the possibility of the circumstance’s existence or the consequence’s ensuing, and nonetheless proceeds with his conduct. In brief, the accused directs his will towards an event or result, but foresees that, in so doing, he may cause another event to ensue. Nevertheless he proceeds with his conduct. Intention in this sense is sometimes called “legal intention.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... “However,” observes Burchell, “if the {{difference}} between motive and intention is borne in mind, the purpose of abstention from making inquiries need not be to avoid having one’s suspicions confirmed. Thus X would have the <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> required for the common-law offence of receiving stolen property, knowing the goods to be stolen, if he actually foresees as a real possibility that the goods have been stolen and nevertheless receives them, whatever his motive for abstaining from making further inquiries may be.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{his book}} International Criminal Law (2003), he argued for {{expansion}} of criminal responsibility of an offender. He equalised <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> with recklessness, and expanded his term [...] "culpable negligence" [...] (culpa gravis) to unconscious negligence. By this, he {{got closer to}} the objective responsibility of an offender for a risk (strict liability). For this he was criticised, as this contradicted the general rule that objective responsibility in this case cannot {{be part of the}} criminal law of civilised countries.|$|E
50|$|In {{an appeal}} to the Supreme Court of Appeal, it was held that, {{accepting}} the evidence of the witness, the appellant (who was a very good marksman) must subjectively have foreseen, when he aimed the second shot at the same place as the first, the possibility that the bullet could ricochet after striking a stone or some other object and in the process strike the deceased. Regardless of that foreseeable possibility, he went on to shoot. He was therefore guilty of murder, the intention being <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{court was}} first tasked with {{determining}} {{whether or not}} Mshumpa should be convicted of the attempted murder of the mother. It found {{that the risk of}} death to the mother was eminently foreseeable in the act of shooting (it was established that she would have died had she not received medical treatment), and that <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> could not be excluded merely because the shooters intention was only to kill the foetus. As a result, Mshumpa was found guilty of the attempted murder of Shelver.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{regard to}} the [...] "sustained" [...] and [...] "vicious" [...] assault upon the {{deceased}} by the appellant, {{the court found that}} [...] "the appellant subjectively foresaw the possibility of his conduct causing the death of the deceased and was plainly reckless as to such result ensuing," [...] and that he was therefore guilty of murder on the basis of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis.</b> This finding rendered {{the question of whether or}} not the appellant owed a duty to the deceased of obtaining medical assistance for him (the basis for the conviction in the trial court and subsequent appeal) unnecessary.|$|E
5000|$|In {{criminal}} law, recklessness (also called reckless disregard, <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis</b> or unchariness) {{is one of}} {{the four}} possible classes of mental state constituting mens rea (the Latin for [...] "guilty mind"). To commit an offence of ordinary as opposed to strict liability, the prosecution must be able to prove both a mens rea and an actus reus; i.e., a person cannot be guilty of the offence for one's actions alone. There must also be an appropriate intention, knowledge, recklessness, or criminal negligence at the relevant time (see concurrence). Recklessness may constitute an offense against property or involve significant danger to another person.|$|E
5000|$|Van Heerden JA was of {{the view}} that, as an accused would seldom admit this element, the court had to draw an {{inference}} regarding an accused’s state of mind from facts indicating, objectively assessed, a reasonable possibility that the result would ensue. From {{the mere fact that}} he acted, it could be inferred that he had reconciled himself to the result.Van Heerden JA held that this second element of <b>dolus</b> <b>eventualis,</b> the volitional element, would normally only be satisfied where the perpetrator had foreseen the result as a reasonable possibility. The Judge of Appeal gave two circumstances in which the volitional element is useful: ...|$|E
