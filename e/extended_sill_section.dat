40|$|Almost ten year of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) {{observations}} {{collected at}} the westernmost sill (Espartel sill) of the Strait of Gibraltar by a monitoring station, first installed in year 2004, have been carefully processed to provide the most updated estimation of the outflow of Mediterranean water through the Strait. A comprehensive quality control of the factors affecting {{the uncertainty of the}} measurements has been carried out and a great care has been paid to infer the current at the bottom layer, where direct observations are lacking. The mean outflow in the southern channel of the <b>sill</b> <b>section,</b> where the monitoring station is installed, has been estimated as 0. 82 Sv (1 Sv = 1 x 10 ^ 6 m^ 3 /s), with an average contribution of the eddy fluxes of 0. 04 Sv. This figure is an overestimation, as the vertical profile at the mooring site was assumed valid for the whole section, thus ignoring the lateral friction. On the other hand, it only gives the flow through the south channel and disregards the fraction flowing through shallower north part. Both drawbacks have been addressed by investigating the crossstrait structure of the outflow from hindcasts produced by the MITgcm numerical model, which was run in a highresolution domain covering the Gulf of Cádiz and Alboran Sea basins. An overall rectifying factor of 1. 039 was found satisfactory to correct the first estimate, so that the final mean outflow computed from this dataset is 0. 85 Sv, which is complemented with an uncertainty of ± 0. 03 Sv based on the interannual variability of the series. The time analysis of the series shows an outflow seasonality of around the 8 % of the mean value, with maximum outflow in early spring. Universidad de Málaga.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the magmatic processes that operated in the plumbing system of the Franklin Large Igneous Province (LIP). The Franklin LIP (723 - 716 Ma) extends > 2500 km across northern Canada and is superbly exposed in the Minto Inlier of Victoria Island. The exposed plumbing system is dominated by sills, with subordinate fault-guided feeder dykes. Locally, sills are characterised by olivine-enriched bases, with overlying doleritic gabbros. One example is the Lower Pyramid Sill. This sill was investigated in detail using petrography, whole-rock chemistry and in-situ mineral chemistry. Petrological and geochemical observations, combined with inverse melt modelling show that the olivine-enriched layer formed by olivine slurry replenishment into a resident gabbroic mush. In contrast, the overlying gabbros formed by in-situ differentiation. Intervening clinopyroxene-rich cumulates formed by a metasomatic reaction between different pore melts. The study emphasises that both slurry emplacement and in-situ differentiation {{played a role in the}} formation of cumulate layering in this <b>sill.</b> <b>Sections</b> examined through the same sill along strike, collectively termed the Fort Collinson Sill Complex, reveal that the olivine slurry propagated > 50 km downstream. Radiogenic and stable isotope data support this interpretation. The geochemical consequences of cumulate remobilisation and mixing in the sill complex are demonstrated, as well as quantified, using Fe=Mg modelling. Additionally, the effects of dolostone assimilation are considered, which can potentially affect phase equilibria. This thesis also investigates the Ni-Cu-PGE potential of the Franklin LIP by studying the Southern Feeder Dyke Complex. This dyke complex was fault-guided and brecciated dykes contain microdoleritic microxenoliths that are impregnated by sulphides. Immiscible sulphide liquids formed when the magma became sulphur saturated due to the ingestion of local sulphur-rich wallrock.

40|$|Abstract: Distal Aptian-Albian {{deep water}} {{channelled}} massive sands of the Vocontian Basin (SE France) are {{often associated with}} sand injections. The Bevons and Rosans areas in the Vocontian domain present probably the most spectacular outcrops showing complex networks of clastic sills and dykes injected into a thick marly/limy succession. Most injections {{are found in the}} channel banks, fed laterally from sandy channels. The sills are up to 10 metres thick {{in the vicinity of the}} connection with the channel feeder; they thin out and die into marls 2 or 3 kilometres away from it. Most dykes are injected from the sills rather from the channel itself: a few small dykes can be found under the channel fill. They are most abundant within a few hundred metres of the channel. Today, injections <b>extending</b> downwards from <b>sills</b> have up to 275 metres vertical extent, whereas injections <b>extending</b> upwards from <b>sills</b> never each the contemporaneous palaeo-sea floor. Ptygmatic folding of the dykes by mechanical compaction i dicates the amount of local post-injection compaction of shale and clearly shows that sand injection occurred prior to burial. Outcrop mapping shows that channel bank fracturing is contemporaneous with channel infilling. This is evidence of early syn-depositional injection of the sandy material.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{results from a}} densely {{instrumented}} mooring array upstream of the Denmark Strait <b>sill,</b> <b>extending</b> from the Iceland shelfbreak to the Greenland shelf. The array was deployed from September 2011 to July 2012, and captured {{the vast majority of}} overflow water denser than 27. 8 kg m- 3 approaching the sill. The mean transport of overflow water over the length of the deployment was 3. 54 ± 0. 16 Sv. Of this, 0. 58 Sv originated from below sill depth, revealing that aspiration takes place in Denmark Strait. We confirm the presence of two main sources of overflow water: one approaching the sill in the East Greenland Current and the other via the North Icelandic Jet. Using an objective technique based on the hydrographic properties of the water, the transports of these two sources are found to be 2. 54 ± 0. 17 Sv and 1. 00 ± 0. 17 Sv, respectively. We further partition the East Greenland Current source into that carried by the shelfbreak jet (1. 50 ± 0. 16 Sv) versus that transported by a separated branch of the current on the Iceland slope (1. 04 ± 0. 15 Sv). Over {{the course of the year}} the total overflow transport is more consistent than the transport in either branch; compensation takes place among the pathways that maintains a stable total overflow transport. This is especially true for the two East Greenland Current branches whose transports vary out of phase with each other on weekly and longer time scales. We argue that wind forcing plays a role in this partitioning. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and composition of the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain (YSRP) volcanic system were analyzed using gravity data taken at over 30, 000 stations in the YSRP and surrounding region. Additional constraints were provided by tomographic seismic velocity models, new heat flow and temperature information, GPS derived strain rates, earthquake locations, and chemical analyses of volcanic rocks. P-wave velocity models and velocity-density regression based on petrologic information were used to constrain a three-dimensional density models. Rheology and strength properties were calculated at selected locations and compared to earthquake focal depths. Results {{of this study suggest}} that the lower crust of the Snake River Plain (SRP) has been thickened by the addition of an underplated layer composed primarily of clinopyroxene, and having a density of 3200 kg/m 3. A mid-crustal high-density sill is composed of a series of gabbroic lenses inter-fingering with the granitic upper crust. This geometry yields a bulk composition comparable to diorite and a density of 2900 kg/m 3. The mid-crustal sill varies from 4 to 11 km in thickness, resulting in a series of SE-NW trending gravity highs observed along the axis of the SRP. The mid-crustal <b>sill</b> <b>extends</b> up to 20 km southeast of the volcanic field and causes asymmetry of the gravity field southeast of the SRP.

40|$|We present {{here two}} methods to obtain {{reflection}} images of upper crust seismic reflectors. The techniques {{are based on}} migration and waveform coherence analysis of reflected seismic phases recorded in local earthquake seismograms and in active seismic data. The first method is a move-out and stack of reflected seismic phases in local earthquake recordings. The theoretical travel times of reflected/converted phases in a 1 D medium for a given interface depth and velocity model are used to align the recordings in time. The locations and origin times of events are initially estimated from the P and S arrival times. Different seismic gathers are obtained for each reflected/converted phase at the interface under consideration, and the best interface depth is chosen as that which maximizes {{the value of a}} semblance function computed on moved-out records. This method has been applied to seismic records of microearthquakes that have occurred at the Mt. Vesuvius volcano, and it confirms the reports of an 8 - to 10 -km-deep seismic discontinuity beneath the volcano that was previously identified as the roof of an <b>extended</b> magmatic <b>sill.</b> The second is a non-linear 2 D method for the inversion of reflection travel times aimed at the imaging of a target upper-crust reflector. This method is specifically designed for geophysical investigations in complex geological environments (oil investigations, retrieving of images of volcano structures) where the presence of complex structures makes the standard velocity analysis difficult and degrades the quality of migrated images. Our reflector is represented by nodes of a cubic-spline that are equally spaced at fixed horizontal locations. The method is based on a multiscale approach and uses a global optimization technique (genetic algorithm) that explores the whole of the parameter space, i. e. the interface position nodes. The forward problem (the modelling of reflection travel times) is solved using the finite-difference solver of Podvine & Lecomte (1991) and using an a priori known background velocity model. This non-linear method allows the automated determination of the global minimum (or maximum) without relying on estimates of the gradient of the objective function in the starting model and without making assumptions {{about the nature of the}} objective function itself. We have used two types of objective functions. The first is a least-squares L 2 norm, defined as the sum of the squared differences between the observed and the calculated travel times. The second is based on coherence measures (semblance). The main advantage of using coherence measures is that they do not require travel-time picking to assess the degree of fit to the data model. Thus, the time performance of the whole procedure is improved and the subjectivity of the human operators in the picking procedure is removed. The methods are tested on synthetic models and have been applied to a subset of data that was collected during the active seismic experiments performed in September 2001 in the gulfs of Naples and Pozzuoli in the framework of what is known as the SERAPIS project...|$|R

Thesis by: Ian KallioPresentation by: Ian Kallio and Kaleb Scarberry with {{contributions}} from: John Dilles, Nansen Olsen, Christopher Older, Thomas Horton, Stan Korzeb and Alan English. The Boulder Batholith and Elkhorn Mountains Volcanics (EMV) formed concurrently during shortening between ~ 85 - 76 Ma {{near the}} end of Mesozoic Cordillera arc magmatism. Together they represent an exceptionally well-preserved and voluminous record of continental arc magmatism. We report field and analytical results from studies of the EMV and Boulder Batholith over a distance of 50 km along their contact, from I- 90 near Pipestone, north to Boulder, Montana. At Pipestone the EMV are metamorphosed to biotite hornfels and have a sheared contact with the Boulder Batholith. To the north, ~ 25 km, batholith rocks intrude and cut the foliation of EMV. Outward from their contact with the Boulder Batholith, the EMV consist mainly of dacitic tuffs that correlate to the middle member of the formation. The EMV section is ~ 700 m thick and consists of three large-volume ignimbrite sheets capped by two thin and local ignimbrite units. Rheomorphic flow lineations show NNE-SSW and E-W bidirectional flow that both parallels and is oblique to their contact with the Boulder Batholith. The age of the section is constrained by a weighted mean U/Pb zircon age of 84. 9 +/- 2. 6 (2 standard error of mean) obtained from the basal ignimbrite. Diorite <b>sills</b> intrude the <b>section</b> and yield ages of 79 and 81 Ma (40 Ar/ 39 Ar from hornblende). These data suggest that the section formed between ~ 80 - 85 Ma. The EMV middle member ignimbrite sheets appear to correlate over the distance of our study. If the ignimbrite sheets correlate with units exposed farther to the north and west, then individual eruption volumes may rival the largest observed on Earth (> 1, 000 km 3) ...|$|R
40|$|The German Spacelab Mission D- 2 {{must be seen}} in {{the larger}} context of Germany's {{decision}} of the early seventies to endulge in the peaceful utilization of space on a broad level. In this sense D- 2 was a consequential continuation of a series of space missions and mission opportunities of various kinds. Most certainly, die D 1 Mission eight years earlier had been a first highlight within this sequence of events. While D 1 had been a dedicated microgravity mission, D- 2 spread its activities over a much wider range, in fact, encompassing eleven disciplines altogether. Due {{to the fact that there}} had been so much time for preparation, it was not surprising that almost each of these disciplines excelled in their performance. The general benefits obtained form this mission overall certainly more than compensate the cost of approximatley 740 million DM that it cost the German tax payer (spread over the span of nearly ten years). The Science Management Team ('Wissenschaftliche Projektfuehrung' WPF) is happy to present with this volume the scientific results of the mission as expressed by the individual principal investigators of the D- 2 experiments. The evaluation status of the experiments presented here is 4 "t"h quarter of 1994, in other words, more and <b>extended</b> results are <b>sill</b> to be expected in many cases. Besides by the introductory articles of these proceedings covering the broader aspects of the mission a general appreciation of the mission goals and the larger context of peaceful space utilization may also be consulted through a book edited upon the event of the concluding symposium of the D- 2 Mission (which took place last year from march 14 to 16, 1994 on the island of Norderney).
