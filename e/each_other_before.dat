5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the air with outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, strutting around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes {{a whole group of}} about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>before</b> they start.|$|E

5|$|The {{social life}} of a crocodilian begins while it {{is still in the}} egg, because the young start {{communicating}} with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>before</b> they are hatched. It has been shown that a light tapping noise near the nest will be repeated by the young, one after another. Such early communication may help them to hatch simultaneously. Once it has broken out of the egg, a juvenile produces yelps and grunts, either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli and even unrelated adults respond quickly to juvenile distress calls.|$|E
5|$|North of the station, tracks 7 and 6 {{merge into}} one track (with a switch from track 7 to track 8), tracks 5 through 2 merge into another track, and tracks 1 and 8 stay separate, {{so that there}} is a four-tracked {{structure}} when the BMT West End Line and BMT Sea Beach Line cross the Coney Island Creek. Before the structure crosses the creek, all four tracks have switches that connect the tracks to <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>before</b> the West End and Sea Beach Lines split. Tracks from these lines then lead into Coney Island Yard. South of the station, tracks 4, 5, and 6 stay separate from the other tracks (with a pair of switches between tracks 5 and 6) and tracks 1, 2, and 3 merge and have a diamond crossover with track 4.

5|$|On 8 January 1967, the VPAF High Command {{convened a}} meeting to examine what had gone wrong. The actions of 2 January had exposed the flawed tactics {{employed}} by MiG-21 pilots; they broke through the clouds too quickly, {{and they did not}} join up with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>before</b> they attacked the U.S. fighters waiting above them. The VPAF High Command then devised a new tactic which required the deployment of between two or four aircraft for each attack, with a maximum of ten aircraft for each mission to perform guerrilla-style attacks on U.S. bomber formations. Furthermore, after they had examined U.S. air tactics, North Vietnamese commanders decided that MiG-17 pilots should attack U.S. formations from either side, while MiG-21 pilots would strike from above. Before the North Vietnamese Air Force could implement their new tactics, however, the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment was withdrawn from combat for several months to recover from the bloody defeat it had suffered as a result of Operation Bolo.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March, news reached Hotham {{that the}} French fleet was at sea {{and heading for}} Corsica. He {{immediately}} set out to intercept them, and Nelson eagerly anticipated his first fleet action. The French were reluctant to engage and the two fleets shadowed each other throughout 12 March. The following day two of the French ships collided, allowing Nelson to engage the much larger 84-gun Ça Ira {{for two and a}} half hours until the arrival of two French ships forced Nelson to veer away, having inflicted heavy casualties and considerable damage. The fleets continued to shadow <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>before</b> making contact again, on 14 March, in the Battle of Genoa. Nelson joined the other British ships in attacking the battered Ça Ira, now under tow from Censeur. Heavily damaged, the two French ships were forced to surrender and Nelson took possession of Censeur. Defeated at sea, the French abandoned their plan to invade Corsica and returned to port.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of season two, Shannon loses Vincent in the jungle. While searching for him, she is shocked to find Walt {{standing}} before her, dripping wet. However, when Sayid finds her, Walt disappears. Over the next few days, Sayid builds Shannon a shelter on the beach. He brings her to it and they soon decide to sleep {{together for the first}} time. Sayid leaves to get a bottle of water for Shannon and in his absence, Shannon again sees a vision of Walt, standing in the shelter with her. Sayid brushes off her experience as a dream. She uses Vincent to try to find Walt, only for him to lead her to Boone's grave. After a while, she takes Vincent into the jungle again, with Sayid in pursuit. As it starts to rain, Sayid and Shannon admit their feelings for <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>before</b> both seeing Walt. Shannon runs after him, only to be accidentally shot by Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), who mistakes her for an Other. She dies moments later in Sayid's arms. Shannon's death not only left Sayid heartbroken, but also caused a rift between the survivors and the Tailies. Throughout the rest of the season, Ana Lucia is shown to be guilt-ridden over killing Shannon.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} match, Fuerza Guerrera was {{designated}} {{the captain of}} the rudo team while Heavy Metal served as {{the captain of the}} tecnico team. To win the match, a team would either pin or force the captain to submit, or pin both of the other team members. The two captains started off the match fighting <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>before</b> Rey Misterio Jr. and Psicosis quickly took over. Under the Lucha Libre rules, a tag team partner can enter the ring when the other wrestler tags out or leaves the ring, unlike normal tag team rules. At one point, Rey Misterio Jr. threw Psicosis to the outside; Psicosis then ran away from ringside to avoid falling victim to a diving attack from his opponent. Moments later, Madonna's Boyfriend entered the ring and used his superior size to throw Rey Misterio Jr. around before Latin Lover took over for him. After about 10 more minutes of wrestling, Heavy Metal missed a dive, which Fuerza Guerrera took advantage of by locking in an arm submission hold that quickly caused Heavy Metal to tap out. In Lucha Libre, submissions quickly end the first or second fall, but in this case, the end came off so quickly that the announcers questioned if this had turned into a best-of-three falls match. This was one clear example of how plans had changed from three falls to one right before the show.|$|E
5|$|In March 746 Ibn Surayj's army {{attacked}} Marv, but was repulsed {{with many}} casualties, and he then made common cause with al-Kirmani—of whose activities between his escape in 744 and this point nothing is known. With Marwan II {{still trying to}} consolidate his own position in Syria and Mesopotamia, Nasr was bereft of any hopes of reinforcement, and the allied armies of Ibn Surayj and al-Kirmani drove him out of Merv {{towards the end of}} 746. Nasr retreated to Nishapur, but within days al-Kirmani and Ibn Surayj fell out among themselves and clashed, resulting in the death of Ibn Surayj. Al-Kirmani then destroyed the Tamimi quarters in the city, a shocking act, as dwellings were traditionally considered exempt from warfare in Arab culture. As a result, the Mudari tribes, hitherto reserved towards Nasr, now came over to him. Backed by them, especially the Qaysis settled around Nishapur, Nasr now resolved to take back the capital. During summer 747, Nasr's and al-Kirmani's armies confronted <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>before</b> the walls of Marv, occupying two fortified camps and skirmishing with each other for several months. The fighting stopped only when news came of the start of the Hashimi uprising under Abu Muslim.|$|E
5|$|The first divine act is the {{creation}} of the cosmos, described in several creation myths. They focus on different gods, each of which may act as creator deities. The eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the chaos that precedes creation, give birth to the sun god, who establishes order in the newly formed world; Ptah, who embodies thought and creativity, gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them; Atum produces all things as emanations of himself; and Amun, according to the theology promoted by his priesthood, preceded and created the other creator gods. These and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory. Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos. The period following creation, in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society, is the setting for most myths. The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>before</b> withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} allowed Jani to {{move into}} the lead but di Grassi stopped at Farm Curve with a motor generator unit problem shortly afterwards. His team's mechanics were allowed to tend to the Audi after travelling via a course car, extending the full course yellow as it was tended to. Di Grassi's race ended prematurely and one of the mechanics used a fire extinguisher to extinguish smoke bellowing from his car. The race resumed after 23 minutes with Tréluyer attacking Lieb, and upon being delayed by the No. 13 Rebellion Racing car, passed him {{to move into}} the lead on the approach to Maggots corner and pulled away on the Hangar straight. Rast stopped at the entrance of Maggots corner with a fuel pump pressure failure, causing him to lose the LMP2 lead to Watts and rejoined the field in third place in class. Rast recovered and passed Senna for second in LMP2 by using the grass at Stowe corner. Tréluyer was blocked by slower traffic allowing Lieb to close up to him on the Wellington straight. Lieb could not overtake because he was delayed by a pack of LMP2 cars. Rast closed up to Watts and overtook him to retake the LMP2 lead. Tréluyer and Lieb ran closely between <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>before</b> the former pulled away from Lieb.|$|E
