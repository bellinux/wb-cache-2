25|$|The {{hemolymph}} toxins {{originate from}} autogenous de novo biosynthesis by the Chrysomelina beetle. Essential amino acids as valine serve as precursors {{for the production}} of the hemolymph toxins of Chrysomelina leaf beetles. The degradation of such essential amino acids provides propanoyl-CoA. This compound is further transformed into propanoic acid and β-alanine. The amino group in β-alanine is then oxidized to yield either an oxime or the nitro-toxin 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA). The oxime is cyclized to isoxazolin-5-one, which is transformed with α-UDP-glucose into the isoxazolin-5-one <b>glucoside.</b> In a final step, an ester is formed by transesterification of 3-nitropropanoyl-CoA to the 6´-position of isoxazolin-5-one <b>glucoside.</b> This biosynthetic route yields high millimolar concentrations of the secondary isoxazolin-5-one and 3-NPA derived metabolites. Free 3-NPA and glucosides that derive from 3-NPA and isoxazolin-5-one also occur in many genera of leguminous plants (Fabaceae).|$|E

25|$|The {{most heavily}} studied betalain is betanin, also called {{beetroot}} red {{after the fact}} that it may be extracted from red beet roots. Betanin is a <b>glucoside,</b> and hydrolyzes into the sugar glucose and betanidin. It is used as a food coloring agent, and the color is sensitive to pH. Other betalains known to occur in beets are isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin. The color and antioxidant capacity of betanin and indicaxanthin (betaxanthin derived of L-proline) are affected by dielectric microwave heating. Addition of TFE (2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) is reported to improve the hydrolytic stability of some betalains in aqueous solution. Furthermore, a betanin-europium(III) complex has been used to detect calcium dipicolinate in bacterial spores, including Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{has been involved}} in many scientific breakthroughs and inventions. From 1925 until 1948, Sir Norman Haworth was Professor and Director of the Department of Chemistry. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Science and acted as Vice-Principal from 1947 until 1948. His research focused predominantly on carbohydrate chemistry in which he confirmed a number of structures of optically active sugars. By 1928, he had deduced and confirmed the structures of maltose, cellobiose, lactose, gentiobiose, melibiose, gentianose, raffinose, as well as the <b>glucoside</b> ring tautomeric structure of aldose sugars. His research helped to define the basic features of the starch, cellulose, glycogen, inulin and xylan molecules. He also contributed towards solving the problems with bacterial polysaccharides. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937.|$|E

40|$|Attention {{is drawn}} to the {{necessity}} of taking {{the values of the}} critical increments into account when the velocity constants for reactions of any pair of <b>glucosides</b> are compared. The ratio of the velocity coefficients for the hydrolysis of any two <b>glucosides,</b> determined at the same temperature, varies with temperature except in the special case when both hydrolyses have the same critical increment. Different values given by various investigators for the same ratio are shown to be {{due to the fact that}} comparative experiments have been carried out at different temperatures with two <b>glucosides</b> possessing different critical increments of hydrolysis. In the light of these considerations it becomes necessary to revise certain deductions which have been drawn from the comparison of rates of hydrolysis of <b>glucosides</b> by acids (at fairly high temperatures) with the rates of hydrolysis of <b>glucosides</b> by enzymes (at relatively low temperatures) ...|$|R
40|$|Green vanilla beans were {{subjected}} to the traditional curing process in Mexico. Odor-active potential from beans including 23 compounds was monitored through the analysis of both free and glucosidically bound volatiles. 8 of them were aliphatic aldehydes, acids, alcohol and ketone. 15 molecules were shikimate derivatives in which 13 were detected in glucosylated form. Some <b>glucosides</b> were efficiently hydrolyzed while some others partly {{or not at all}} after 90 days of curing. Moreover kinetics of hydrolysis of <b>glucosides</b> were not the same. A major part of glucovanillin was hydrolyzed at the first stages of curing while some other <b>glucosides</b> at the advanced stages. Data support hypothesis that hydrolysis of <b>glucosides</b> during curing is rather enzymatic origin than chemical one.

2500|$|The bitter <b>glucoside</b> picrocrocin is {{responsible}} for saffron's flavour. Picrocrocin (chemical formula: systematic name: 4-(β-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an aldehyde sub-molecule known as safranal (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid zeaxanthin that is produced via oxidative cleavage, and is the glycoside of the terpene aldehyde safranal.|$|E
2500|$|Vanillin {{was first}} {{isolated}} {{as a relatively}} pure substance in 1858 by Nicolas-Theodore Gobley, who obtained it by evaporating a vanilla extract to dryness, and recrystallizing the resulting solids from hot water. In 1874, the German scientists Ferdinand Tiemann and Wilhelm Haarmann deduced its chemical structure, {{at the same time}} finding a synthesis for vanillin from coniferin, a <b>glucoside</b> of isoeugenol found in pine bark. Tiemann and Haarmann founded a company, Haarmann and Reimer (now part of Symrise) and started the first industrial production of vanillin using their process in Holzminden, Germany. In 1876, [...] synthesized vanillin (2) from guaiacol (1).|$|E
30|$|In Fig.  5, the {{yields of}} the {{fragmentation}} products are plotted against the pyrolysis temperature and compared between methyl <b>glucosides</b> and LG. Fragmentation reactions of LG started at 500 [*]°C, which {{is higher than}} the onset temperature (400 [*]°C) of methyl <b>glucosides.</b> Thus, LG is also more stable against fragmentation, and the methyl <b>glucosides</b> directly gave fragmentation products, not via LG, at 400 [*]°C. The major fragmentation products from methyl <b>glucosides</b> were MeGO, FA, GA, and GO. Noncondensable gases are also expected to form along with the condensable products by the fragmentation reactions, but any attempts to analyze the gaseous products with micro gas chromatography failed because of the low concentration by dilution with nitrogen.|$|R
30|$|Although {{monolignols}} {{are known}} to be direct precursors of lignin, whether monolignol <b>glucosides</b> are also involved in lignification is controversial. The biosynthesis and hydrolysis of monolignol <b>glucosides</b> have been investigated in several studies [30 – 35]. A single-gene knockout mutant defective in β-glucosidase, which is responsible for coniferin and syringin hydrolysis, did not show a lignification-deficient phenotype [36]. However, a recent study revealed that UDP-glycosyltransferase, which is involved in coniferin biosynthesis, is essential for normal lignification in Arabidopsis thaliana [37]. In the present study, coniferin and syringin contents in May and mid-June samples was higher at the upper internodes where vigorous lignification occurs (Fig.  5 d, f). The p-glucocoumaryl alcohol content showed a different pattern from those of coniferin or syringin; it peaked in late-June and then decreased as lignification gradually diminished (Fig.  5 b). These results suggest that monolignol <b>glucosides</b> are involved in the early stage of lignification in S. tootsik. There were much smaller amounts of monolignol <b>glucosides</b> than monolignols (Fig.  5), implying that there are lower biosynthesis or faster turnover rates of monolignol <b>glucosides.</b> Further research is required to determine the role of monolignol <b>glucosides</b> in bamboo lignification.|$|R
40|$|A chloroform-methanol-extracted lipid of Helicobacter pylori was studied. Three {{kinds of}} glycolipids, {{accounting}} for about 25 % (wt/wt) {{of the total}} lipid, were detected and identified to be cholesteryl <b>glucosides.</b> The structures of {{two of them were}} determined to be cholesteryl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside and cholesteryl- 6 -O-tetrade-canoyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, and the plausible structure of the third one was identified as cholesteryl- 6 -O-phosphatidyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. Cholesteryl <b>glucosides</b> are very rare in animals and bacteria. Furthermore, those in H. pylori had an alpha-glycosidic linkage, which is rather unusual for natural glycosides, and a phosphate-linked cholesteryl glycoside like the cholesteryl- 6 -O-phosphatidyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside has not been reported previously. As the cholesterol <b>glucosides</b> were detected in strains obtained from diverse geographical locations, the presence of cholesteryl <b>glucosides</b> in H. pylori is a very unique and a characteristic feature of the species. These findings add a new facet to the physiology and biochemistry, especially the cholesterol and glucose metabolism, of H. pylori. Furthermore, the cholesteryl <b>glucosides</b> of H. pylori showed hemolytic activities...|$|R
2500|$|While {{the exact}} route of {{vanillin}} biosynthesis in V. planifolia is currently unknown, several pathways are proposed for its biosynthesis. Vanillin biosynthesis is generally {{agreed to be}} part of the phenylpropanoid pathway starting with L-phenylalanine, which is deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to form t-cinnamic acid. The para position of the ring is then hydroxylated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H/P450) to create p-coumaric acid. Then, in the proposed ferulate pathway, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase (4CL) attaches p-coumaric acid to coenzyme A (CoA) to create p-coumaroyl CoA. Hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) then converts p-coumaroyl CoA to 4-coumaroyl shikimate/quinate. This subsequently undergoes oxidation by the P450 enzyme coumaroyl ester 3’-hydroxylase (C3’H/P450) to give caffeoyl shikimate/quinate. HCT then exchanges the shikimate/quinate for CoA to create caffeoyl CoA, and 4CL removes CoA to afford caffeic acid. Caffeic acid then undergoes methylation by caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) to give ferulic acid. Finally, vanillin synthase hydratase/lyase (vp/VAN) catalyzes hydration of the double bond in ferulic acid followed by a retro-aldol elimination to afford vanillin. Vanillin can also be produced from vanilla glycoside with the additional final step of deglycosylation. In the past p-hydroxybenzaldehyde was speculated to be a precursor for vanillin biosynthesis. However, recently it was demonstrated by radiolabelled precursor studies that [...] p-hydroxybenzaldehyde do not synthesis vanillin or vanillin <b>glucoside</b> in the vanilla orchids.|$|E
