5|$|The stomach in the {{cephalothorax}} {{acts as a}} pump {{that sends}} the food deeper into the <b>digestive</b> system. The mid gut bears many <b>digestive</b> ceca, compartments with no other exit, that extract nutrients from the food; most are in the abdomen, which {{is dominated by the}} <b>digestive</b> system, but a few are found in the cephalothorax.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptomatic}} (determinate) chronic stage {{affects the}} nervous system, <b>digestive</b> system and heart. About two-thirds {{of people with}} chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including dilated cardiomyopathy, which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop <b>digestive</b> system damage, resulting in dilation of the <b>digestive</b> tract (megacolon and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary achalasia) {{may be the first}} symptom of <b>digestive</b> disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E

5|$|Barium sulfate {{was first}} applied as a radiocontrast agent in X-ray imaging of the <b>digestive</b> system in 1908.|$|E
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple <b>digestive</b> system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short {{undifferentiated}} intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the <b>digestive</b> system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12â€“15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|<b>Digestive</b> tract telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and {{first part of}} the small intestine). This procedure will typically only be undertaken if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there is evidence of severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the small intestine may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of the <b>digestive</b> tract to a portable digital recorder.|$|E
5|$|In his 50s Rockefeller {{suffered}} from moderate depression and <b>digestive</b> troubles; during a stressful {{period in the}} 1890s he developed alopecia, the loss of some or all body hair.|$|E
5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete <b>digestive</b> enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the <b>digestive</b> tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E
5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The <b>digestive</b> system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other <b>digestive</b> enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the <b>digestive</b> cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the <b>digestive</b> cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the {{connecting}} tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} <b>digestive</b> cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this <b>digestive</b> {{mechanism}} pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile <b>digestive</b> glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas <b>digestive</b> glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E
5|$|The medulla, {{along with}} the spinal cord, {{contains}} many small nuclei involved {{in a wide variety}} of sensory and involuntary motor functions such as vomiting, heart rate and <b>digestive</b> processes.|$|E
5|$|The use of Borjomi {{water has}} been {{suggested}} by the Georgian and Russian researchers for complex treatment of several <b>digestive</b> diseases and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{respiratory}} organs, {{and both}} cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide {{into the surrounding}} water. When {{the water in the}} <b>digestive</b> cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the <b>digestive</b> cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.|$|E
5|$|About 20% are {{affected}} by symptomatic <b>digestive</b> tract lesions, although a higher percentage have lesions that do not cause symptoms. These lesions may bleed intermittently, which is rarely significant enough to be noticed (in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool), but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera {{juice is}} marketed {{to support the}} health of the <b>digestive</b> system, but there is neither {{scientific}} evidence nor regulatory approval to support this claim. The extracts and quantities typically used for such purposes appear to be dose-dependent for toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's <b>digestive</b> tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is valued}} for its peppery flavor and eaten after {{suitable}} preparation in Russia and Finland, {{the species is}} highly irritating to the <b>digestive</b> system when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking. Studies have identified several chemicals present in the mushrooms, including ergosterol and derivatives thereof, and the pungent-tasting velleral.|$|E
5|$|Although ten {{men died}} {{during the course of}} the hunger strike, {{thirteen}} others began refusing food but were taken off hunger strike, either due to medical reasons or after intervention by their families. Many of them still suffer from the effects of the strike, with problems including <b>digestive,</b> visual, physical and neurological disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one <b>digestive</b> enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no <b>digestive</b> enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} protocarnivorous pitfall trap is {{a species}} of teasel, Dipsacus fullonum, which has been only suggested as a possible carnivore. Only one major study has examined D. fullonum for carnivory and no evidence of <b>digestive</b> enzymes or foliar nutrient absorption was revealed.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{can also}} be used in the {{treatment}} of tumours of the brain, eye, head and neck region (lip, floor of mouth, tongue, nasopharynx and oropharynx), respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi), <b>digestive</b> tract (oesophagus, gall bladder, bile-ducts, rectum, anus), urinary tract (bladder, urethra, penis), female reproductive tract (uterus, vagina, vulva), and soft tissues.|$|E
5|$|In a {{small number}} of people, {{brachytherapy}} may cause long-term side effects due to damage or disruption of adjacent tissues or organs. Long-term side effects are usually mild or moderate in nature. For example, urinary and <b>digestive</b> problems may persist as a result of brachytherapy for cervical or prostate cancer, and may require ongoing management.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to epitheliomuscular, nerve and interstitial cells, the inward-facing gastroderm ("stomach skin") contains gland cells that secrete <b>digestive</b> enzymes. In some species it also contains low concentrations of cnidocytes, {{which are used}} to subdue prey that is still struggling.|$|E
5|$|Macromolecules such as starch, {{cellulose}} or proteins {{cannot be}} rapidly {{taken up by}} cells and must be broken into their smaller units {{before they can be}} used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These <b>digestive</b> enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with larger organisms. For example, the bacteria that {{live within the}} human <b>digestive</b> system contribute to human health through gut immunity, the synthesis of vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and the fermentation of complex indigestible carbohydrates.|$|E
5|$|Microbes simply secrete <b>digestive</b> enzymes {{into their}} surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from {{specialized}} cells in their guts, including {{the stomach and}} pancreas, and salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium {{does not}} have a {{biological}} role, as it has a short half-life and occurs only in small traces naturally. Animal tests showed that it is not absorbed via the <b>digestive</b> tract. When injected it concentrates in the bones, from which it is slowly released.|$|E
5|$|Numerous insects utilize {{defensive}} regurgitation. The eastern {{tent caterpillar}} regurgitates a droplet of <b>digestive</b> fluid to repel attacking ants. Similarly, larvae of the noctuid moth regurgitate when disturbed by ants. The vomit of noctuid moths has repellent and irritant properties {{that help to}} deter predator attacks.|$|E
5|$|Oats are {{the most}} popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower {{digestible}} energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine <b>digestive</b> system. They are also more palatable and digestible than other grains.|$|E
5|$|One type of inter-cellular {{communication}} by {{a molecular}} signal is called quorum sensing, which serves {{the purpose of}} determining {{whether there is a}} local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting <b>digestive</b> enzymes or emitting light.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses {{replicate}} {{mainly in}} the gut, and infect enterocytes of the villi of the small intestine, leading to structural and functional changes of the epithelium. The triple protein coats make them resistant to the acidic pH of the stomach and the <b>digestive</b> enzymes in the gut.|$|E
5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically harmless. However, ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and animal life. It can cause severe damage to the <b>digestive</b> system, and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood.|$|E
5|$|Sponges have unspecialized {{cells that}} can {{transform}} into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges {{do not have}} nervous, <b>digestive</b> or circulatory systems. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} {{at the base of}} the lophophore. Food passes through the mouth, muscular pharynx ("throat") and {{oesophagus}} ("gullet"), all of which are lined with cilia and cells that secrete mucus and <b>digestive</b> enzymes. The stomach wall has branched ceca ("pouches") where food is digested, mainly within the cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{next most}} common type, acinar cell {{carcinoma}} of the pancreas, arises in the clusters of cells that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine pancreas cancers. Like the 'functioning' endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause over-production of certain molecules, in this case <b>digestive</b> enzymes, which may cause symptoms such as skin rashes and joint pain.|$|E
