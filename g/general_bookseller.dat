6000|$|Suppose {{there is}} a thriving, {{expanding}} colonial town, and that, scattered among its artisans and labourers, {{there is a}} sprinkling of Methodists, or other such ultra-evangelical good people, doing their best, in a quiet way, to [...] "save souls." [...] Clearly, this is an outpost which it is desirable to capture. [...] "We," [...] therefore, take measures to get up a Salvation [...] "boom" [...] of the ordinary pattern. Enthusiasm is roused. A score or two of soldiers are enlisted {{into the ranks of}} the Salvation Army. [...] "We" [...] select the man who promises to serve our purposes best, make a [...] "captain" [...] of him, and put him in command of the [...] "corps." [...] He is very pleased and grateful; and indeed he ought to be. All he has done is that he has given up his trade; that he has promised to work at least nine hours a day in our service (none of your eight-hour nonsense for us) as collector, <b>bookseller,</b> <b>general</b> agent, and anything else we may order him to be. [...] "We," [...] on the other hand, guarantee him nothing whatever; to do so might weaken his faith and substitute worldly for spiritual ties between us. Knowing that, if he exerts himself in a right spirit, his labours will surely be blessed, we content ourselves with telling him that if, after all [271] expenses are paid and our demands are satisfied each week, 25s. remains, he may take it. And, if nothing remains, he may take that, and stay his stomach with what the faithful may give him. With a certain grim playfulness, we add that the value of these contributions will be reckoned as so much salary. So long as our [...] "captain" [...] is successful, therefore, a beneficent spring of cash trickles unseen into our treasury; when it begins to dry up we say, [...] "God bless you, dear boy," [...] turn him adrift (with or without 2s. 4d. in his pocket), and put some other willing horse in the shafts.|$|R
