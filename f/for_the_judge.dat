5|$|Peggy Robertson, Hitchcock's long-time assistant, read Anthony Boucher's {{positive}} {{review of}} the novel and decided to show the book to her employer, even though studio readers at Paramount Pictures had already rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500 and reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to preserve the novel's surprises. Hitchcock, {{who had come to}} face genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own, was seeking new material to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount, Flamingo Feather and No Bail <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judge.</b> He disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's Weta Digital {{created the}} visual effects, which {{included}} computer-generated imagery, {{as well as}} scale models (which were necessary to make Wellington look American), prosthetic makeup and practical effects with help from Weta Workshop. Visual effects supervisor Richard Taylor explained that effects work on The Frighteners was complex due to Weta's inexperience with computer technology in the mid-1990s. Prior to this film, Weta worked largely with physical effects. With so many ghosts among its main cast, The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time. For a special effects company {{that had been in}} existence less than three years, the eighteen-month period for completing The Frighteners was largely stressful. Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect, many of whose employees would eventually join Weta Digital. Rick Baker was hired to design the prosthetic makeup <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Judge,</b> portrayed by John Astin (the detachable jawbone was later added digitally). However, Baker was not able to apply Astin's five hours of makeup himself due to his commitment on The Nutty Professor. Makeup artist Brian Penikas (Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) fulfilled Baker's duties.|$|E

25|$|The Waite Court heard nine {{criminal}} appeals {{from the}} territorial courts, {{the majority of}} them arising from prosecutions of Mormon polygamists in the courts of the Utah Territory. Reynolds v. United States (1878) rejected six challenges to a polygamy conviction: that the territorial grand jury statute provided for fewer members that grand juries in the circuit courts; that it violated the Impartial Jury Clause to seat a juror opposed to polygamy; that for cause challenges were improperly granted to the prosecution; that testimony violated the Confrontation Clause; that polygamy was protected by the Free Exercise Clause; and that it was improper <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> to comment on the social ills of polygamy.|$|E
25|$|The USCA {{observed}} {{the following three}} causal factors for judicial delays: (1)lack of implementing legislation or procedures for Convention applications and many Mexican judges following inapposite procedures found in state civil codes in resolving such cases; (2) {{lack of understanding of}} the Convention by many Mexican judges, as evidenced by extensive requests for information, including letters under Article 15 of the Convention from the USCA to confirm that a particular case involved an international child abduction as defined by the Convention; and (3) TPs absconding with the children when summoned to a hearing because they were notified of the hearing but neither they nor the children were secured in any way. The USCA has observed that a tool for securing children in the Mexican system is <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> to place the child temporarily in a children’s protection service (Desarrollo Integral de la Familia, or DIF) shelter while the case is being processed, but judges are reluctant to place children in these shelters unless the TP is determined to be a clear danger to the child.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} the 1950s that the {{courthouse}} undertook major renovations. In 1955, the distillate stoves were replaced with butane heaters allowing the chimneys to be reduced to roof level while the roof was also replaced. In 1956, the roof would be replaced again for the fifth or sixth time since the building's completion in 1911. New flooring was installed in the courtroom and some offices, and the courtroom ceiling was lowered for acoustics and heating. In the courtroom, theater-style seating was installed while the upper gallery was removed. A new plywood bench <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> and a jury box with matching railing were built. The stained glass window behind the judge's bench was boarded and plastered. Downstairs, exterior steel doors were installed, and a counter shelf was built for the office of the sheriff and tax-assessor collector along with five fire extinguishers provided for the premises. In 1957, two gas heaters with electric blowers were installed in the space formerly occupied by the courtroom's upper gallery to heat the courtroom. The building's roof would require replacement in 1974 and again 1975.|$|E
25|$|Unanimous jury {{verdicts}} {{have been}} standard in US American law. This requirement was {{upheld by the}} Supreme Court in 1897, but the standard was relaxed in 1972 in two criminal cases. As of 1999 over thirty states had laws allowing less than unanimity in civil cases, but Oregon and Louisiana are the only states which have laws allowing less than unanimous jury verdicts for criminal cases. When the required number of jurors cannot agree on a verdict (a situation {{sometimes referred to as}} a hung jury), a mistrial is declared, and the case may be retried with a newly constituted jury. The practice generally was that the jury rules only on questions of fact and guilt; setting the penalty was reserved <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge.</b> This practice was confirmed by rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court such as in Ring v. Arizona, which found Arizona's practice of having the judge decide whether aggravating factors exist to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty, to be unconstitutional, and reserving the determination of whether the aggravating factors exist to be decided by the jury. However, in some states (such as Alabama and Florida), the ultimate decision on the punishment is made by the judge, and the jury gives only a non-binding recommendation. The judge can impose the death penalty even if the jury recommends life without parole.|$|E

Curiel's only comment was to write in a procedural ruling that Trump has [...] "placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue". Trump's references to Curiel's ethnicity, as well as his comments that [...] "someone ought to look into" [...] the judge, alarmed legal experts, who expressed concern about the effects of the comments on judicial independence.|$|E

500|$|Before Trump could {{venture out}} on the {{campaign}} trail, he had to tend to some personal matters. [...] In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Marla Maples, Trump's second ex-wife, threatened to reveal what Trump [...] "is really like" [...] if he chose to run for president in the general election. [...] In response, Trump withheld $1.5 million in alimony he owed Maples, claiming she was in violation of the confidentiality agreement in the couple's divorce decree. [...] After a Manhattan judge refused to hear the matter, a brief conference was held, wherein the judge's law secretary advised Trump to pay the alimony and advised Maples that further incidents would be cause <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> to reconsider hearing the matter. [...] Trump's attorneys were satisfied that the meeting would cause Maples to rethink making any public statements on her marriage to Trump.|$|E
500|$|Trinity Dam, an earth {{embankment}} structure [...] high, was {{the tallest}} embankment dam {{in the world}} at its completion in 1962 (it was surpassed by Oroville Dam, also in California, in 1968). Trinity Lake can store a maximum of , or about twice the Trinity River's flow at this point. Below Trinity Dam is the much smaller Lewiston Dam, the actual point at which the water is diverted. The [...] Clear Creek Tunnel conveys water under the Trinity Mountains to the Whiskeytown Lake reservoir, and from there it flows [...] through the Spring Creek Tunnel to join the Sacramento River at Keswick Dam. Along the way the water drops some [...] through three hydroelectric plants, generating nearly one billion kilowatt hours each year.

500|$|It {{requires}} that the defendant owed a duty of care to the victim (it is <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> to decide on which facts such a duty would be created). These rules are typically those of tort. For example, in R v Pittwood, the defendant was put under a duty to act on account of being contractually obliged to close the gates at a railway crossing. Similar duties include those of a doctor of his patients, an electrician over a householder he has done work for, parents over their children, and, developed more recently, a police officer over persons he arrests. Included, however, are those of a criminal enterprise, which would not attract tortious liability in the civil law. Where the defendant is liable through an omission and not an act, then a legal duty to act – rather than a duty of care – is needed. Andrew Ashworth has criticised {{the nature of the}} duty of care requirement as [...] "decision-making at its retrospective worst".|$|E

500|$|Before {{the first}} {{performance}} of Trial by Jury, some material was cut, including two songs and a recitative: {{a song for}} the foreman of the jury, [...] "Oh, do not blush to shed a tear", {{which was to be}} sung just after [...] "Oh, will you swear by yonder skies"; and a recitative <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judge</b> and song for the Usher, [...] "We do not deal with artificial crime" [...] and [...] "His lordship's always quits", which came just before [...] "A nice dilemma". The melody for [...] "His Lordship's always quits" [...] is known, and it was reused in [...] "I loved her fondly" [...] in The Zoo and later modified into the main tune from [...] "A wand'ring minstrel, I" [...] in The Mikado. [...] A few changes were made to the end of [...] "I love him, I love him!" [...] after the first night. [...] A third verse for [...] "Oh, gentlemen, listen I pray" [...] was sung, at least on the first night, and part was quoted in a review in the Pictorial World.|$|E
500|$|Turnage, who had {{previously}} composed one full-length opera, Greek, worked on the musical version of Twice between 1994 and 1996. It was commissioned by the John S. Cohen Foundation. He had learnt of Kay's original work after he was shown {{a copy of the}} BBC video by poet and artistic director Maura Dooley. It was a difficult development with Turnage at one point abandoning the work in favour of other pieces. Composer and librettist had started out with the intention of developing a full-length opera including both soprano and baritone narrators. (The original television script had included poems <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> {{as well as for the}} woman.) However, the creators felt that their attempts at redeveloping and expanding the original work [...] "water down its impact" [...] and they eventually cut everything apart from the woman's words. Both text and setting also underwent repeated changes in detail. Kay changed some of the wording to make it easier to sing. Similarly, Turnage revised the music after trying it out with Sally Burgess who was to give the first performance. He had become Composer in Association with English National Opera (ENO) in 1995 and was able to thoroughly workshop Twice and its companion piece with ENO's Contemporary Opera Studio before arriving at their respective final versions.|$|E
500|$|Paramount, whose {{contract}} guaranteed another film by Hitchcock, did {{not want}} Hitchcock to make Psycho. Paramount was expecting No Bail <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judge</b> starring Audrey Hepburn, who became pregnant and had to bow out, leading Hitchcock to scrap the production. Their official stance was that the book was [...] "too repulsive" [...] and [...] "impossible for films", and nothing but another of his star-studded mystery thrillers would suffice. They did not like [...] "anything about it at all" [...] and denied him his usual budget. In response Hitchcock financed the film's creation through his own Shamley Productions, shooting at Universal Studios under the Revue television unit. The original Bates Motel and Bates house set buildings, which were constructed on the same stage as Lon Chaney Sr.'s The Phantom of the Opera, are still standing at Universal Studios in Universal City near Hollywood and are a regular attraction on the studio's tour. As a further result of cost cutting, Hitchcock chose to film Psycho {{in black and white}}, keeping the budget under $1,000,000. Other reasons for shooting in black and white were his desire to prevent the shower scene from being too gory and his admiration for Les Diaboliquess use of black and white.|$|E
