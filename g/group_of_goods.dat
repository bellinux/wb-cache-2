The present study took advantage of a widespread linguistic phenomenon of sound change to systematically assess the relationships between speech processing and various components of attention and working memory in the auditory and visual modalities among typically developed Cantonese-speaking individuals. The individual variations in speech processing are captured in an ongoing sound change–tone merging in Hong Kong Cantonese, in which typically developed native speakers are reported to lose the distinctions between some tonal contrasts in perception and/or production.

Recent studies have suggested individual differences in cognitive abilities as important sources of variability in speech processing.

The present study aims to systematically assess the relationships between tone processing and various components of attention and working memory in the auditory and visual modalities among normal Cantonese-speaking individuals using a series of published tools.

30|$|Besides inflation, {{we focus}} on a battery of {{economic}} and labor variables, mostly by scrutinizing regional data, and conclude that they converge as well, mainly throughout our second period of analysis—with {{the exception of the}} real GVA per capita, which converges faster in the first period. These variables’ convergence at the geographic level is likely to have contributed to inflation’s convergence. Delving deeper into that analysis, our multivariate analysis highlights the role of unemployment, the costs of some non-wage input factors, the degree of competition and the services share in GVA. All the signs found on the coefficients are plausible, in terms of the Phillips curve, the non-wage price pressure, the disinflationary competition and sectoral specialization patterns—given the problems and rigidities <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> and labor markets in Spain. However, the negative sign of the coefficient on real GVA per capita growth does not support the validity of the Balassa–Samuelson effect. A fundamental additional assessment undertaken, only possible for the second period, as the necessary data start in 1992, centres on the weightings given to the CPI’s <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services across Spanish provinces. We arrive at a very robust outcome: those weightings clearly tend to converge. That is, the shopping basket in the Spanish provinces has become more homogenous over the second period of our analysis. Finally, when we disaggregate provincial CPI-based inflation rates into province-level inflation rates of the 12 COICOP <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services, we find that, with the exception <b>of</b> the Communications <b>group</b> involving mainly non-tradables, all the other <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services appear to exhibit a high degree of convergence among pairs of inflation rates across provinces. This indicates that convergence in provincial inflation rates is widespread across COICOP <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services, irrespective of the tradables/non-tradables distinction.|$|R

40|$|Growing {{wealth and}} {{globalization}} have lead to increasing consumption {{of clothes and}} shoes in Sweden.

We examine whether such a tax would achieve this purpose by studying consumer behavior in Sweden and by estimating the price elasticity of demand for clothes and shoes.

Our conclusion is that clothing and shoes are luxury goods in Sweden with our estimated income elasticity being 1. 26. Further, Swedish consumers are price sensitive with a price elasticity of demand of - 2. 80 which indicates that an excise tax would correct for the externality.

30|$|Yilmazkuday (2013) tackles a more {{disaggregated}} {{analysis of}} regional inflation, {{in the line}} of the works related to the Balassa–Samuelson literature. He works with ten main CPI groups for each region, distinguishing between groups concentrated on tradable and non-tradable components (period 1994 – 2004). In this study a break in Turkish inflation is captured in 2002, and in 2001 for the cross-sectional standard deviation of regional inflation rates. This author distinguishes between a pre-inflation targeting period and an inflation targeting period (which coincides with a flexible exchange rate) starting from January 2002. As in our study, Pesaran (2007 a)’s methodology is used, among other techniques—Arestis et al. (2014) also use that technique, but applied to countries’ inflation. As acknowledged by Yilmazkuday (2013), the results of this work require further study since during the inflation targeting period the CPI groups with relatively tradable components have diverged from each other, while the non-tradable groups have converged to each other. Caraballo and Usabiaga (2009 c) share some elements of the disaggregated study of Yilmazkuday (2013) in their analysis of Spanish and Andalusian inflation. Finally, in the present study we can state that when we disaggregate provincial CPI-based inflation rates into province-level inflation rates of the 12 COICOP <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services over the 1994 – 2015 period, we are able to uncover some interesting patterns.

40|$|One of the {{essential}} factors of minimalization of social costs of transport in socialist economy {{is the type of}} economic calculation applied in transport enterprises. In the existing system of planning transport there is domination of direct accounts carried out at central level. The basic item in construction of a central plan for goods transport is the balance method, which does not guarantee a correct channel of distribution nor facilitates a choice of the cheapest branches and means of transport for particular <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> Hence, it is not a basis for minimalization of social costs of transport. Shortcomings in the balance method promoted the introduction of economic mathematic methods in direct accounts at central level. However, in the present state of technical calculations and accuracy of the flow of planning information, the mathematical method in use does not also quarantee complex, macroeconomic rationalization of transport. Hence, irrespective {{of the degree to which}} this method is utilized in direct accounts at central level conditions do not exist for full rationalization of transport on a macroeconomic scale. Therefore, it would seem imperative to widen the range of utilizing indirect accounts based on market criteria and carried out by those directly concerned with transport processes.
