5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body <b>hair)</b> <b>had</b> largely been lost. Another possibility is that long head hair {{is a result of}} Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual. For some groups or individuals, however, short hair is the selected trait.|$|E
5|$|In July 1915, the Truxtun {{was on its}} way to Alaska when {{it broke}} down and was unable to {{continue}} its mission. Initially, the blame fell on Callaghan, who had apparently ordered incorrect parts for the condenser. He was suspended from duty and ordered to appear before a court-martial. Subsequent investigation, however, found that another man was responsible for the error and Callaghan received a full acquittal and was reinstated. A few months later, he was appointed as commanding officer of the Truxtun, but the stress of his trial appeared to have left its mark—at the age of 25 years, his <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> already turned gray.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{spent six}} weeks in the hospital, where he {{received}} marginal care. He had lost , was in a chest cast, and his gray <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> turned as white as snow. McCain {{was sent to a}} different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi. In December 1967, McCain was placed in a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live more than a week. In March 1968, McCain was placed into solitary confinement, where he would remain for two years.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E

25|$|By 1981, short <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> made a {{comeback}} for men, {{in reaction to}} the shag and mod haircuts of the mid to late 70s. The sideburns of the 1960s and 1970s saw a massive decline in fashion, and many guys wore regular haircuts and quiffs. Beards went out of style due to their association with hippies, but moustaches remained common among blue collar men.|$|E
25|$|The impasse {{continued}} {{late into}} the evening. Pakistan captain Inzamam ul-Haq claimed that Darrell Hair did not inform him or {{the rest of his}} side of the reasons why the ball was replaced, and that <b>Hair</b> <b>had</b> implied that Pakistan were cheating. At 19:50 UTC it was finally announced at a press conference that the Test was called off. The ECB's statement said that England were awarded the match by the umpires as Pakistan refused to take the field after being warned that under law 21.3, failure to do so would result in them forfeiting the game. This is the first time a Test match has been decided this way.|$|E
25|$|The {{skeletal}} remains of 28 people were unearthed at Masada. The {{remains of a}} male 20–22 years of age, a female 17–18, and a child about 12 years old {{were found in the}} palace. The remains of two men and a full head of hair with braids belonging to a woman were also found in the bath house. Forensic analysis showed the <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> been cut from the woman's head with a sharp instrument while she was still alive (an old practice for captured women) while the braids indicated that she was married. Based on the evidence, anthropologist Joe Zias believes the remains may have been Romans whom the rebels captured when they seized the garrison.|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{pubic hair}} that Christie {{collected}} from his victims, {{it has been}} speculated that {{he was responsible for}} more murders than those carried out at 10Rillington Place. Christie claimed that the four different clumps of hair in his collection came from his wife and the three bodies discovered in the kitchen alcove, but only one matched the hair type on those bodies, Ethel Christie's. Even if two of the others had come from the bodies of Fuerst and Eady, which had by then decomposed into skeletons, there was still one remaining clump of hair unaccounted for—it could not have come from Beryl Evans, as no pubic <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> been removed from her body.|$|E
25|$|She {{played a}} {{reckless}} socialite in Coquette (1929), {{a role for}} which her famous ringlets were cut into a 1920s' bob. Pickford had already cut her hair {{in the wake of}} her mother's death in 1928. Fans were shocked at the transformation. Pickford's <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> become a symbol of female virtue, and when she cut it, the act made front-page news in The New York Times and other papers. Coquette was a success and won her an Academy Award for Best Actress, although this was highly controversial. The public failed to respond to her in the more sophisticated roles. Like most movie stars of the silent era, Pickford found her career fading as talkies became more popular among audiences.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} defilement and cutting of <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> a {{stringency}} that {{products of the}} vine did not, as defilement and cutting of hair rendered void the previous period of nazirite observance, while consuming products of the vine did not. Products of the vine had a stringency that defilement or cutting of hair did not, as the prohibition of products of the vine had no exception, while the law allowed exceptions for where cutting of hair was a religious duty or where there was an abandoned corpse. Defilement also had a stringency that cutting of hair did not, as defilement rendered void {{the whole of the}} preceding period and entails the offering of a sacrifice, while cutting of hair renders voided only 30 days and did not entail a sacrifice.|$|E
50|$|Hair {{extensions}} made of true virgin, raw (cuticle <b>hair)</b> <b>have</b> {{the most}} durability {{and ease of}} use as the integrity of the <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> not been broken or altered by the method of collection.

5000|$|Other plants, such as opuntias, <b>have</b> <b>hairs</b> or spines {{that cause}} {{mechanical}} irritation, {{but do not}} inject chemicals. Stinging hairs occur particularly in the families Urticaceae, Loasaceae, Boraginaceae (subfamily Hydrophylloideae) and Euphorbiaceae. Such <b>hairs</b> <b>have</b> been shown to deter grazing mammals, but are no more effective against insect attack than non-stinging hairs. Many plants with stinging <b>hairs</b> <b>have</b> the word [...] "nettle" [...] in their English name, but may not be related to [...] "true nettles" [...] (the genus Urtica).|$|R

25|$|His {{government}} {{supervised the}} people's lives very closely. Early in his rule, Banda instituted a dress code rooted in his socially conservative predilections. Women {{were not allowed}} to wear see-through clothing, have visible cleavage, trousers, or wear skirts or dresses that went above the knee. The only exception to this was at vacation resorts and country clubs, where they could not be seen by the general public. Banda explained that these restrictions were not designed to oppress women, but instill respect and dignity for them. Men's <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> to be no longer than collar length, and foreign visitors at the airport were given mandatory haircuts if necessary. Any man who ventured into public with long hair could also be seized by police and subjected to an involuntary haircut.|$|E
25|$|When Blixen was {{diagnosed}} with syphilis, she was treated with mercury tablets. Some reports indicate that she took approximately 1 gram of mercury per day for almost a year, while others show she did so {{for only a few}} months. She then spent time in Denmark for treatment and was given arsenic, which she continued to take in drop form as a treatment for the syphilis that she thought was the cause of her continued pain. Blixen had reported severe bouts of abdominal pain as early as 1921, while she was still in Kenya. Several well-known physicians and specialists of both internal medicine and neurology diagnosed her with third-stage chronic syphilis. Mogens Fog, who was Blixen's neurologist, thought that her gastric problems were attributable to syphilis, {{in spite of the fact}} that blood and spinal fluid tests were negative. By the time she left Africa, Blixen was suffering from anemia, had jaundice and had overused arsenic. As clumps of her <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> begun to fall out, she took to wearing hats and turbans.|$|E
25|$|On arrival, Riis {{found that}} the rumor was true {{but that he had}} arrived too late. He pleaded with the French consul, who {{expelled}} him. He made various other attempts to enlist, none successful. As autumn began, Riis was destitute, without a job. He survived on scavenged food and handouts from Delmonico's Restaurant and slept in public areas or in a foul-smelling police lodging-house. At one time Riis's only companion was a stray dog. One morning he awoke in a lodging-house to find that his gold locket (with its strand of Elisabeth's <b>hair)</b> <b>had</b> been stolen. He complained to the sergeant, who became enraged and expelled him. Riis was devastated. The story became a favorite of Riis's. One of his personal victories, he later confessed, was not using his eventual fame to ruin the career of the offending officer. Disgusted, he left New York, buying a passage on a ferry with the silk handkerchief that was his last possession. By doing odd jobs and stowing away on freight trains, Riis eventually reached Philadelphia, where he appealed to the Danish Consul, Ferdinand Myhlertz, for help and was cared for two weeks by the Consul and his wife.|$|E
5000|$|Raw hair is <b>hair</b> {{that also}} <b>has</b> not been colored or {{processed}} in any way. This includes steam processes. Some consider {{this to be}} less evasive and not actually processed as the raw or virgin undergoes a multiple day steaming process to create long-lasting curls or wave patterns without the damage of chemicals. This process guarantees consistent curls and waves that has a uniform texture. Premium raw or virgin <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> had absolutely no processes of any sort including steam done on the hair. This is essential as true premium raw/virgin <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> a naturally occurring texture that when matched to {{the owner of the}} raw/virgin hair extensions creates a look that is unbeatable in look and feel.|$|R
