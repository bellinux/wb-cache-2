In the present study we investigated the blood leucocyte count in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in young adult men. Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted at Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, after the institutional ethical clearance and informed consent from all the participants. Under aseptic condition blood was collected for total leucocyte count and <b>differential</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> using automated haematology analyzer. Routine pulmonary function testing was done on them by using Patrick Morgan’s Benchmark computerized spirometry. Students’t’ test was used to find out the significance of difference using SPSS version 11. P values less than 0. 05 was considered the level of significance.    Result: The mean blood leucocyte count and <b>differential</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> among smokers with COPD and non-smokers were well within the normal limits. P value was above the level of significance.   Conclusion: This shows that smoking alone doesn’t invoke any rise in total leucocyte count in blood. </p...|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS In a {{study of}} a group of 325 blood donors between the ages of 18 and 65 years, the total {{leucocyte}} and polymorph counts of the females aged 50 to 65 years were found to be significantly lower than those of the corresponding group of male donors. In the whole series of female donors, there were significantly lower total leucocyte and lymphocyte counts with increasing age and a less significant (P 0. 1) fall in the polymorph count. No age variation in the male counts was found. Analysis of large numbers of leucocyte counts performed on hospital patients has confirmed the sex difference in the total leucocyte count found in the blood donors. The factors responsible for the differences are discussed.

Bond and Gilbert (1958) reported a mean packed cell volume of 3 & % with a mean erythrocyte count of 3. 4 mill. /mm 3. in a group of four quail. This report describes the packed cell vol-ume and <b>differential</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> of Bobwhite quail from 15 hours post-hatch-ing to 50 weeks of age. MATERIALS AND METHODS Except for data collected at 15 hours and at one week post-hatching, all measure-ments herein reported were made on 24 Bobwhite quail chicks (17 females and 7 males). The birds were reared in Jamesway chick starting batteries until they reached sexual maturity and were then transferred to small cages, 12. 7 cm. X 20. 3 cm., where they were individually maintained durin...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of aqueous EM supplementation to broilers on the performance, immunological and histological status of broilers. A total of 60 unsexed day old broilers (Ross 308) were assigned randomly in two equal groups (treated and control groups 30 birds 15 /each replicate) reared on controlled system for 5 weeks. Ten ml/ liter of EM solution was only added to drinking water of the treated group (T 2). Blood and performance parameters included body weight gain, feed consumption and feed conversion ratio. As well as estimation of <b>differential</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count.</b> Immunologic criteria involved measurement of relative weights of spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius of necropsied birds. The results showed a positive significant effect of EM on the body weight of the treated group which was clear during the 3 rd to the 5 th week of the trial. There was significant difference in feed consumption and feed conversion efficiency between the two groups. However, the latter parameter had the most notable significance. Increased lymphocyte percentage, increased jejunal villus height and crypt depth as well as increase in goblet cell count were observed in the treated group...|$|E
40|$|Dengue {{is one of}} the arthropod-borne (arbo) viral {{diseases}} {{transmitted by}} female mosquito Aedes aegypti. Dengue fever has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation ranging from flu-like illness to severe complicated stage of dengue hemorrhagic fever leading to mortality. This was a retrospective study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Coastal Karnataka, South India, to know the correlation between the clinical presentation and haematological parameters in the paediatric cases presented with dengue symptoms. A total of 163 paediatric cases who presented fever and dengue-like illness were included in the study. Of which, 69 were confirmed dengue patients. Critical analysis showed that {{there was a significant difference}} in the haematological parameters like total leucocyte count, percent <b>differential</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count,</b> and platelets count, in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P< 0. 05 to 0. 0001). Additionally, when compared to nondengue patients, even the liver function and renal function parameters were significantly deranged (P< 0. 05 to 0. 0001). Stratification based on NS 1, IgG, and IgM showed significant alterations in the haematological, hepatic, and renal parameters. With respect to the treatment a small percentage of patients, that is, 8 % (4 patients), required platelet transfusion as their counts went below 20, 000 /μL. Two patients succumbed to their illness while three required ICU stay...|$|E
40|$|This Study {{was carried}} out at the Salmoniculture Experimental Station "Dr. Ascanio de Faria", in Campos do Jordão, São Paulo. Brazil. The aim was to {{compared}} the hematology of triploid and diploid rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, 1792, by sex and gonadal maturation stages. Blood was obtained from 144 individuais for determinati-ons of: haemoglobin rate (Hb), haematocrit (Ht), erythrocyte count (Er), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MHC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and <b>differential</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>counts.</b> The ploid was determinated by measuring the erythrocyte major axis, in fresh and stainncd smears. Triploid rainbow trout had a large eiythrocyte diameter, mean erythrocyte volume and mean haemoglobin concentration, but lower erythrocyte count than diploid. Lymphocytes was the most frequent cell in peripherical blood. There was no dilTerence {{between males and females}} for ali parameters here analysed. The haematological analyses showcd signiffleant increase with the dcvelopment of gonadal maturation stages...|$|R
40|$|CD 4 + T-cell {{levels are}} an {{important}} criterion for categorizing HIV-related clinical conditions according to the CDC classification system and are therefore important {{in the management of}} HIV by initiating antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections due to HIV among HIV-infected individuals. However, it has been observed that the CD 4 counts are affected by the geographical location, race, ethnic origin, age, gender and changes in total and <b>differential</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>counts.</b> In the light of this knowledge, we classified 600 HIV seropositive antiretroviral treatment (ART) -naïve Indian individuals belonging to different CDC groups A, B and C on the basis of CDC criteria of both CD 4 % and CD 4 counts and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated. Importantly, CDC staging on the basis of CD 4 % indicated significant clinical implications, requiring an early implementation of effective antiretroviral treatment regimen in HIV-infected individuals deprived of treatment when classified on the basis of CD 4 counts...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} whether an abnormality in polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN) function and/or a deficiency in immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) and complement (C 4 and C 3) could be the underlying cause of chronicity in DCPA. Twenty adult males were studied. Penicillin resistant coagulase positive S. Aureus was isolated from the pus samples of all the patients. AU the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole anderythromycin. Patch and usage tests done with coconut and mustard oil were negative. The total and <b>differential</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>counts</b> in all the patients were within normal limits. In vitro PMN functions were estimated by measuring percentage phagocytosis and intra cellular killing capacity (ICK) using S. aureus as the test organism. Both these parameters were significantly raised before treatment (p. 001) and returned to normal after treatment. Immunolobulin levels did not rise above normal which may suggest a depressed response to bacterial infection. Complement (C 3) levels were significantly lower (p) than the controls...|$|R
