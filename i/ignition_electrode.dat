As of 2010, Fenwal Controls, a gas {{equipment}} manufacturer based in Boston, was the contractor responsible for maintaining the flame. The eternal flame's original, custom-manufactured ignition system was contained in a weather-proof box buried {{a few feet from}} the grave site. The system controlled the flow of gas and oxygen to the flame and kept it lit via a high-voltage cable and 20,000-volt spark <b>ignition</b> <b>electrode</b> near the gas burner. No longer constantly sparking to keep the flame lit, the system monitored the flame and activated the ignition system only when the flame was extinguished. The electrode was specially designed for outdoor use. Oversight of the flame's maintenance was provided by the Army Corps of Engineers, which contracted with Fenwal Controls to ensure the eternal flame was maintained and upgraded as needed. According to Arlington National Cemetery historian Tom Sherlock, when the gas burner required maintenance the flame was shut off. But maintenance needs were so minimal that no living Fenwal Controls employee had seen the interior of the ignition system. An on-site visit was planned by Fenwal Controls for early 2010 to inspect the eternal flame and conduct a review of the ignition and burner systems.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{electrical}} measurements {{have been investigated}} in order to perform diagnostics of the fire dynamics in the ISO 5660 cone calorimeter. The rationale {{of the study is}} {{to take advantage of the}} pilot <b>ignition</b> <b>electrodes</b> that are already in place and use these to collect additional information such as emission of pyrolysis gases and time to ignition. The first part of the project was a refinement of the method for measuring the so called ion current, which has already been investigated in a pilot study. It was found that thorough shielding and grounding gives an excellent signal to noise ratio. An expression for the correlation between measured current and conductivity was also developed and validated experimentally. The second part of the project consisted of measuring the breakdown voltage, that is the voltage when dielectric failure occurs. It was found that this method was more sensitive to the fire dynamics before ignition, such as pyrolysis, but that the response to ignition was more ambiguous for the breakdown voltage than for the ion current...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study proposes two {{different}} approaches to describe the dynamics of a transient gas-solid flow inside a modified Hartmann tube or a similar apparatus. An experimental analysis was performed to analyze the main influencing parameters during a typical characterization test of combustible solids. For this purpose, the development of dust clouds of different solid materials inside the tube has been evidenced by high-speed videos and particle-size measurements. The two-phase flow induces variations in particle size distributions and segregation levels that have been identified during the dispersion process. Furthermore, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, based on an Euler-Lagrange approach, has been developed with ANSYS FLUENT (TM), It was directed towards the assessment of flow conditions pertaining to the agglomeration and fragmentation of particles dispersed in the standard setup. The experimental data {{have been used to}} adjust a fragmentation model in the CFD simulation in order to describe the variations in particle size distributions accurately. These approaches have evidenced three different stages of solids dispersions, which can be classified according to variations in particle size distributions: a fragmentation phase, stabilization of the dust cloud and sedimentation phase. These facts suggest that, for the micrometric aluminum powders which have been tested, the minimum ignition delay must be 60 ms, after considering the distribution of the discrete phase inside the tube and the variations in size distribution at the elevation of <b>ignition</b> <b>electrodes.</b> This delay being greatly influenced by powders properties, this paper suggests combining both simulation and experimental approaches {{in order to determine the}} most relevant or the most conservative conditions for the determination of dust flammability...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThermal and {{chemical}} conversion processes that convert in energy the sewage sludge, pasty waste and other pre-processed waste are increasingly common, {{for economic and}} ecological reasons. Fluidized bed combustion is currently {{one of the most}} promising methods of energy conversion, since it burns biomass very efficiently, and produces only very small quantities of sulphur and nitrogen oxides. The hazards associated with biomass combustion processes are fire, explosion and poisoning from the combustion gases (CO, etc.). The risk analysis presented in this paper uses the MADSMOSAR methodology, applied to a semi-industrial pilot scheme comprising a fluidization column, a conventional cyclone, two natural gas burners and a continuous supply of biomass. The methodology uses a generic approach, with an initial macroscopic stage where hazard sources are identified, scenarios for undesired events are recognized and ranked using a grid of Severity × Probability and safety barriers suggested. A microscopic stage then analyzes in detail the major risks identified during the first stage. This analysis may use various different tools, such as HAZOP, FMEA, etc. : our analysis is based on FMEA. Using MOSAR, we were able to identify five subsystems: the reactor (fluidized bed and centrifuge), the fuel and biomass supply lines, the operator and the environment. When we drew up scenarios based on these subsystems, we found that malfunction of the gas supply burners was a common trigger in many scenarios. Our subsequent microscopic analysis, therefore, focused on the burners, looking at the ways they failed, and at the effects and criticality of those failures (FMEA). We were, thus, able to identify a number of critical factors such as the incoming gas lines and the <b>ignition</b> <b>electrode...</b>|$|E

Among various type of Electric propulsion system, the electromagnetic propulsion has added advantages for many space applications.

40|$|The inlet mass flow, fuel {{injection}} profile, igniter characteristics, ignition delay, and operational frequency all dictate {{the success of}} a Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE). An optical sensor was developed and utilized for the observation of ignition zone characteristics over varying refresh conditions that showed decreasing ignition delay times when approaching marginally fuelrich reactant mixtures. A wide range of equivalence ratios for ethylene/air mixtures were explored and a limited number of JP- 10 /air mixtures. The JP- 10 /air fuel mixtures were nearly impossible to ignite at characteristic velocities greater than 35 m/s until a porous ignition shield was installed. The porous shield, surrounding the Transient Plasma <b>Ignition</b> (TPI) <b>electrode,</b> demonstrated the successful ignition at characteristic velocities up to 100 m/s for C 2 H 4 /air and 55 m/s for JP- 10 /air mixtures. The ignition shield slowed down a portion of the fuel-air mixture to increase the local residence time, allowing for more reliable ignition. The resulting combustion products proceeded to ignite the remaining fuel-air mixture. The ignition shield design appears to locally prevent a complete purge of the previous cycle's products, and a transient plasma discharge was still required for subsequent ignition to occur. This effect further reduced the observed ignition delay time in ethylene/air and JP- 10 /air fuel mixtures. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper, we {{reported}} on a small grid-connected thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system consisting of an ytterbia mantle emitter and silicon solar cells with a 16 % efficiency (under solar irradiance at standard test conditions, STC). The emitter was heated using a butane burner with a rated thermal power of 1. 35 kW (referring to the lower heating value). This system produced an electrical output of 15 W, which corresponds to a thermal to electric (direct current) conversion efficiency of 1. 1 %. In the interim, further progress has been made, and significantly higher efficiencies have been achieved. The most important developments are:- (1) The infrared radiation-absorbing water filter between the emitter and silicon cells (to protect the cells against overheating) {{has been replaced by}} a suitable glass tube. By doing this, it has been possible to prevent losses of convertible radiation in the water, and to protect the cells against the flue gasses. (2) Cell cooling has been significantly improved, in order to reduce the cell temperature, and therefore increase the conversion efficiency. (3) The shape of the emitter has been changed from spherical to a quasi-cylindrical geometry, in order to obtain a more homogeneous irradiation of the cells. (4) The metallic burner-tube, on which the ytterbia emitter was fixed in the initial prototypes, {{has been replaced by a}} heat-resistant metallic rod, carrying ceramic discs as emitter holders. This has prevented the oxidation and clogging of the perforated burner tube. (5) Larger reflectors have been used to reduce losses of useful infrared radiation. (6) Smaller cells have been used, to reduce the electrical series-resistance losses. A system efficiency of 1. 5 % was attained by applying all these improvements to the basic 1. 35 kW prototype. By using preheated air for combustion (at approximately 370 Â Â°C), 1. 8 % was achieved. In a subsequent step, a photocell generator was constructed, consisting of high-efficiency silicon cells (21 % STC efficiency). In this generator, the spaces between the cells were minimized, in order to achieve as high an active cell area as possible, while simultaneously reducing radiation losses. This new system has produced an electrical output of 48 W, corresponding to a system efficiency of 2. 4 %. This is the highest-ever-reported value in a silicon-cell-based TPV system using ytterbia mantle emitters. An efficiency of 2. 8 % was achieved by using preheated air (at approximately 350 Â Â°C). An electronic control unit (fabricated of components with low power consumptions, and including a battery store) was developed, in order to make the TPV system self-powered. This unit controls the magnetic gas-supply valve between the gas-supply cylinder and burner as well as the high-voltage <b>ignition</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Both the control unit's own power consumption and the battery-charging power are supplied directly by the TPV generator. A small commercial inverter is used to transfer excess power to the 230 V grid. In future systems, the effect of preheating the combustion air will be studied in more detail. Finally, this system will be scaled up to provide self-powered domestic boilers.

40|$|Stringent {{regulations}} on the emission of pollutants, especially carbon dioxide (CO 2), necessitate {{the development of}} advanced combustion technologies. Gasoline direct injection (GDI) into the combustion chamber of a Spark Ignition (SI) engine is a combustion strategy that is widely recognized as having the potential to improve fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines for passenger cars. In particular, the CO 2 emissions of GDI engines could be 20 - 26 % {{lower than those of}} equivalent port-fuel injected (PFI) SI engines. Unfortunately, the development of combustion systems for GDI engines is very challenging because the creation of an appropriate combustion system is a major challenge because they require very precise formation of an ignitable fuel-air mixture with a steep stratification gradient right between the <b>ignition</b> <b>electrodes</b> to permit efficient operation under a wide range of operating conditions. CFD simulations are widely used to increase the efficiency of engine R&D. This thesis aimed at development of a tool for numerically modelling of working process in a GDI engine. The work had two main objectives. First, an available CFD code should be applied to multidimensional GDI engine simulations. Second, the code should be developed by implementing advanced models of stratified turbulent combustion, followed by validation against experimental data. As far as a code is concerned, although there are several mature commercial CFD packages on the market, there is also a need for less expensive software. Consequently, there is growing interests from both industry and academia in the OpenFOAM open source CFD code, whose source code is freely available so that users can implement and test new models without paying licence fees. However, it had not been used to simulate combustion in a GDI engine when the work reported herein was begun. This thesis presents an assessment of OpenFOAM as a tool for the numerically modelling of fuel injection, spray breakup, evaporation, mixture formation, and stratified turbulent burning in the combustion chamber of a GDI engine. OpenFOAM was used to simulate hollow-cone sprays of gasoline and ethanol discharged by a piezo-controlled pintle-type injector. The liquid properties of gasoline were implemented in the code to enable the simulation of gasoline sprays. In addition, the implementations of various spray breakup models such as LISA, TAB, Reitz-Diwakar, and KHRT into the standard OpenFOAM package were checked and modified in order to more closely reflect their descriptions in the original papers. Liquid penetration and SMD calculated by simulations using the revised model implementations were compared to experimental data provided by my colleagues. These comparisons showed that the best agreement between the experimental data and simulations was achieved when using a combination of the uniform droplet size and KHRT models. This model was therefore used in all subsequent engine simulations. As far as modelling is concerned, the code’s modelling capabilities were enhanced by implementing and developing models relevant to the turbulent burning of stratified gasoline-air mixtures at the elevated temperatures and pressures associated with combustion in a GDI engine. More specifically, two relevant issues were addressed. First, a semi-detailed chemical mechanism for the combustion of a gasoline surrogate in air was developed and validated. The gasoline surrogate consisted of iso-octane, toluene, and n-heptane in volumetric proportions of 55 %: 35 %: 10 %, respectively. The mechanism includes 120 species participating in 677 reactions. It was validated against experimental data on the ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds of different mixtures at a range of pressures and temperatures. The mechanism was then used to compute laminar flame speeds for gasoline-air mixtures at equivalence ratios of 0. 2 ≤ϕ≤ 2. 0, unburned gas temperatures of 298 ≤T_u≤ 800 K, and pressures of 1 ≤P≤ 30 atm. The results of these calculations were approximated and the approximations were implemented into OpenFOAM for subsequent CFD modelling of stratified turbulent combustion in a GDI engine. In order to study stratified burning in a GDI engine, the Flame Speed Closure (FSC) model of premixed turbulent combustion was combined with a so-called presumed Probability Density Function (PDF) method that made it possible to account for the influence of turbulent fluctuations in local mixture composition on the local burning rate. The combined model based on the FSC and presumed PDF approach was implemented into OpenFOAM and the roles played by its various submodels were investigated in a step-wise fashion. Finally, the so-extended code was used to simulate a GDI engine burning a globally lean mixture. Good agreement between results computed by me and experimental data provided by my colleagues was obtained. In addition, the model’s sensitivity was investigated...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental investigation into ignition systems, {{their effects on}} the combustion process, and how the discharge {{is affected by the}} prevailing pressure, temperature and flow. The work is divided into four main areas, a comprehensive literature review, engine testing for ignition system suitability, non-flow rig testing (including erosion) and flow rig testing. The literature review concluded that the most practical ignition system for lean burn gas engines will continue {{to be based on the}} spark plug, but in the medium to long term, laser ignition may become viable. The measurement of the HT voltage and current is not straightforward, and appropriate methods have been identified. Capacitive and inductive ignition system types were compared in lean and diluted conditions on a single cylinder research engine of modern design at different engine loads and speeds. It was found that the most beneficial ignition system was an inductive ignition system, although that for some conditions, capacitive systems induced better engine performance with a fraction of the stored energy of the inductive alternative. Non flow tests showed that the early part of the spark discharge is sensitive to pressure and temperature effects, and as a consequence, the latter stages of the discharge are also affected. A correlation has been developed, for use with conventional nickel electrode spark plugs, to predict breakdown voltage as a function of pressure, temperature and gap. Experiments were carried out at elevated pressures in a stream of flowing air with capacitive and inductive <b>ignition</b> systems. Different <b>electrode</b> designs and orientations were also compared. It was shown that when exposed to a flow field, the discharge can be stretched which results in a shortened spark duration; in some cases the electrode can shield the discharge from flow field effects. This work showed that flow through the spark gap is a hindrance to the spark process, especially for longer duration systems. However for flame kernel growth, the literature review identified that flow is beneficial, serving to convect the kernel away from the electrodes, reducing the heat transfer from the flame. Analysis of the glow voltage history in the pressurised flow rig has been used to develop a correlation relating the voltage, current, flow velocity, pressure and time. This correlation was used to analyse the velocity records from the spark plug in a firing engine. The predicted velocities and turbulence intensity were in agreement with independent measurements.
