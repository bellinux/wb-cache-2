40|$|State {{sovereignty}} {{is the basic}} underlying principle of international law. Like all branches of <b>international</b> <b>law,</b> <b>air</b> <b>law</b> has developed under this principle of sovereignty, leaving the final decision to the consents and political wills of the governments for both their internal and external affairs. In the same vein, the international system {{is based on the}} juridical equality of all nations, which are free to participate in all forms of regional and international organizations. However, due to economic and political globalization and the demand for a more efficient international cooperation as well as the market forces and technical and economical constraints, the traditional concept of sovereignty has undergone transformation. Resulting from their inherently technical, economic and international characteristics, civil aviation and air transport are the leading fields of international affairs affected by these developments. This thesis first analyses the evolution of the principle of sovereignty in general international law and then traces the transformation of sovereignty in <b>air</b> <b>law</b> by examining the issue through the approach found in the Chicago Convention as well as the recent concepts and technologies in civil aviation from the sovereignty point of view. **The opinions expressed in this thesis are strictly those of the author...|$|R

40|$|Current {{issues in}} {{regulation}} of <b>international</b> carriage by <b>air</b> - Summary The purpose of my thesis is {{to analyze the}} basic questions relating to <b>international</b> carriage by <b>air.</b> This term provides {{a wide range of}} situations and possible scenarios but I have primarily focused on the liability of carriers and liability limits. Thanks to the quick progression and technological improvements to which the transportation by air of past years had to face, this issue gained very fast an <b>international</b> character. The <b>air</b> <b>law</b> community was forced to handle the newly born task of coming issues as soon as possible. Warsaw Convention 1929 was the first uniform instrument which offered an acceptable body of rules governing the liability of carriers in <b>international</b> carriage by <b>air</b> and became a guarantee for passengers. But because its provisions regarding the liability quit promptly did not meet the practical needs of the modern air world, additional protocols and conventions started to operate in this field as the result of those old-fashioned provisions and sometimes too much extended requirements on transport documents. The main problems of the frontier Convention were too much protective provisions of airlines.

40|$|Just like in surface {{vehicular}} travel, {{the inevitability}} of collisions between aircraft, {{and the growth of}} the incidence thereof, is equally accepted in air transportation. The necessity of regulating the legal obligations resulting from such incidents, in a convention level, in order to obviate the application of the various domestic laws on the matter which do not contain standard liability provisions, among other things, was long felt. Such need stems from the economic policy obtaining in <b>international</b> <b>air</b> <b>law</b> to define, regulate and limit an aircraft operator's liability from catastrophic losses that usually results from a single aviation accident, and extend reasonable protection to the rights of end-users, including innocent third parties, who may have suffered injury or sustained damage as a result of aircraft operations...|$|E
40|$|Over {{than sixty}} years ago was {{concluded}} the Warsaw Convention {{in order to provide}} a basis for the unification of the <b>international</b> private <b>air</b> <b>law.</b> The treaty, not only eliminated the problems of conflicts of laws and jurisdictions, but also set a regime of liability based on presumed fault which is still applied, today, in most <b>international</b> <b>air</b> transportations. But since the late sixties, the system has been more and more criticized and is now in crisis. The present situation has arisen because the treaty, drawn up during the infancy of the aviation industry, has, thus, afforded the carriers a certain level of protection in by setting maxima to the amount of compensation which consumers can recover in case of damage during the air transportation. These limits are now insufficient with regard to the average standard of living, especially in the Western countries. Five texts have amended the 1929 Convention so as to adapt the limits to the socio-economic requirements. The last ones, known as Montreal Protocols, have been signed in 1975 and, besides the raising of the maxima, have set a new regime of strict liability. But they have not been yet brought into force. The question of their ratification is in several countries related to the acceptance of a limited liability in case of injuries to passengers. This paper will first expose the respective mechanisms of application of the current liability system for air transport of passengers and air transport of cargo; then it will analyze the debate concerning the Montreal Protocols Nos 3 & 4 and the future prospects for the "Warsaw Regime"...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the modern influence of maritime <b>law</b> on <b>air</b> <b>law.</b> In order {{to demonstrate that}} the influence still exists, at least in respect of conflicts of jurisdiction, a comparative analysis of the responsibility of the carriers of goods will be carried out in the light of international conventions. The thesis will consider the new evolution of maritime law, which today, in many aspects, follows <b>air</b> <b>law.</b> It will become clear that both systems face the same difficulties. In particular, the multiplication of international conventions has weakened the aim of uniformity by admitting different regimes of the carriers' liability. Once the causes of conflicts of jurisdiction have been identified, the thesis will analyze how the conventions attempt to solve those conflicts. The use of forum shopping by the parties and the use of forum non conveniens by the courts, reveals that present international solutions are not satisfactory. The practice in maritime law is to consider a conflict prior to its existence and to permit jurisdiction as well as arbitration clauses. While the former clauses are forbidden in <b>air</b> <b>law,</b> arbitration clauses, although accepted in various <b>international</b> <b>air</b> conventions, have never been used until recently in <b>air</b> <b>law,</b> and only in respect of the financing of major projects. It is therefore possible to believe today, that the maritime approach can and will be followed in respect of conflicts of carriage of goods by air, thus proving that maritime law does still influence the evolution of <b>air</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R
