40|$|Since {{crosswalk}} {{width and}} pedestrian green time directly affect {{the safety of}} signalized crosswalks, modeling an exact total crossing time model to estimate those two variables is imperative. The total crossing time needed {{by a group of}} pedestrians to cross a signalized crosswalk contains the <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> and the crossing <b>time.</b> The <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> depends primarily on the maximum queue length, which is determined by pedestrian arrival rate, red interval, waiting position distribution, and the crosswalk width. Crossing time increases when interactions between bidirectional pedestrian flows become more serious. Thus, quantifying the impacts of the start-up process on the <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> and the effects of the interactions on the crossing time is a prerequisite for optimizing the design of signalized crosswalks. This paper establishes a modified total crossing time model consisting of modified pedestrian <b>discharge</b> and crossing <b>time.</b> <b>Discharge</b> <b>time</b> is modeled by applying traffic wave theory, and crossing time is modeled based on drag force theory.

40|$|Abstract ⎯ In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of maximizing the battery life (or duration of service) in battery-powered CMOS circuits. We first show that the battery efficiency (or utilization factor) decreases as the average discharge current from the battery increases. The implication is that the battery life is a super-linear function of the average discharge current. Next we show {{that even if the}} average discharge current remains the same, different discharge current profiles (distributions) may result in very different battery lifetimes. In particular, the maximum battery life is achieved when the variance of the discharge current distribution is minimized. Analytical derivations and experimental results underline importance of the correct modeling of the battery-hardware system as a whole and provide a more accurate basis (i. e., the battery <b>discharge</b> <b>times</b> delay product) for comparing various low power optimization methodologies and techniques targeted toward battery-powered electronics. Finally, we calculate the optimal value of Vdd for a battery-powered VLSI circuit so as minimize the product of the battery <b>discharge</b> <b>times</b> circuit delay. I...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of plasma treatment on changes of surface wettability of wood flooring from two Brazilian tropical species, Hymenaea spp. (rode locus) and Tabebuia spp. (lapacho). Wood flooring samples were plasma treated at low pressure in a helium atmosphere. Energy level was set at 100 W and four glow <b>discharge</b> <b>times</b> (5, 15, 30 and 45 s) were tested. Changes in wettability were investigated by measuring apparent contact angle, droplet volume and spreading contact area.

Plasma treatment is feasible to improve wettability of tropical woods. Nevertheless, these findings should be investigated further due to the intrinsic characteristics of woods from tropical species. 201...|$|E

Randomization procedure {{was based on}} a computer-generated list. The primary outcome was the <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> comparison. The secondary outcomes were operating time, blood loss, paralytic ileus time, intraoperative complications, postoperative pain, and early postoperative complications. The mean <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> was shorter after VH than after LAVH and TLH (P = 0. 001). Operating time significantly influenced the <b>discharge</b> <b>time,</b> considered as a dependent variable in general linear model analysis (P = 0. 006). In contrast, blood loss did not influence the <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> (P = 0. 55). The mean operating time was significantly shorter in VH than in TLH and LAVH groups (P = 0. 000). The intraoperative blood loss was greater during LAVH than during TLH and VH (P = 0. 000). Paralytic ileus time was shorter after VH than after TLH and LAVH (P = 0. 000). No intraoperative complications or conversion to laparotomy occurred. VH was the faster operative technique with smaller blood loss and shorter <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> compared with the others two techniques.

We focused {{on the use of}} LPFGs as level sensors and the wavelength shifts were not used to quantify the viscosity values of asphalt binders. When the LPFG sensor was immersed in the constant volume (100 mL) AC- 20 asphalt binder, a wavelength shift was observed and acquired using LabVIEW software and GPIB controller.

However, retrieving the embedded neural code from a surface EMG signal is extremely challenging. Most studies use indirect approaches in which selected features of the signal are interpreted as indicating certain characteristics of the neural code. These indirect associations are constrained by limitations that have been detailed previously (Farina D, Merletti R, Enoka RM.

In an update on these issues, the current review extends the discussion to EMG-based coherence methods for assessing neural connectivity. We focus first on EMG amplitude cancellation, which intrinsically limits the association between EMG amplitude and the intensity of the neural activation and then discuss the limitations of coherence methods (EEG-EMG, EMG-EMG) as a way to assess the strength of the transmission of synaptic inputs into trains of motor unit action potentials.
