5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a <b>handrail</b> that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The <b>handrail</b> had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the <b>handrail,</b> so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the <b>handrail</b> with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the <b>handrail</b> after removal.|$|E
5|$|Both of the mansion's {{two floors}} consist of four large rooms with high ceilings, {{and each of}} these rooms {{is exactly the same}} size and shape. A grand {{stairway}} is located {{at the end of the}} mansion's central hall, extending from the first floor to the attic. The stairway's <b>handrail</b> is crafted of walnut, and it is connected to the stairway's shallow steps by a balustrade consisting of three small balusters per step.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{a number}} of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations {{including}} the entrance hall, which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and cornices, a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze. The stairwell is lit from above with a roof light and features a cantilevered stair with iron balusters from the 1825 adaptation with a later brass <b>handrail.</b>|$|E
50|$|Class 34-900 {{locomotives}} {{which are}} {{allocated to the}} Sishen-Saldanha Orex line are usually further modified by having removable running board-mounted <b>handrails</b> installed. All South African diesel-electric locomotives have their side <b>handrails</b> mounted along the upper edges of their long hoods. The ex Iscor Class 34-500s, however, came equipped with additional removable running board-mounted <b>handrails.</b> Since these <b>handrails</b> are slide-fit into brackets welded onto the running board, they are easily removed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Handrails</b> may be {{continuous}} (sometimes called over-the-post) or post-to-post (or {{more accurately}} [...] "newel-to-newel"). For continuous <b>handrails</b> on long balconies, {{there may be}} multiple newels and tandem caps to cover the newels. At corners, there are quarter-turn caps. For post-to-post systems, the newels project above the <b>handrails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Class 34-000 {{locomotives}} {{that were}} {{allocated to the}} Sishen-Saldanha Orex line were often modified by having removable running board-mounted <b>handrails</b> installed. All pre-2000 South African diesel-electric locomotives had their side <b>handrails</b> mounted along the upper edges of their long hoods. The ex Iscor Class 34-500s, however, came equipped with additional removable running board-mounted <b>handrails.</b> Since these <b>handrails</b> are slide-fit into brackets which are welded onto the running board, they are easily removed.|$|R
5|$|A narrow quay passes {{under the}} old swivel section of the bridge from Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn <b>handrail</b> offers the {{pedestrian}} some protection against a slip into the river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was {{known for some time}} after as the Duke of York's Route.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps <b>handrail</b> in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light to a quick group flashing dioptric light. Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers. In 1932 the original gallery handrails, also supplied by H Wilkins & Co., were replaced with steel gas pipe and mild steel rods.|$|E
5|$|Once the <b>handrail</b> was removed, Massimino {{went to work}} {{attaching}} the capture plate, but ran into additional problems when the battery {{in one of his}} power tools failed. Massimino was instructed to return to the orbiter's airlock to retrieve a spare tool and to recharge his suit's oxygen reserves, to allow for completion of the STIS repair. The rest of the STIS repair work was completed without any problems, but the spacewalkers were nearly two hours behind the scheduled timeline, so managers on the ground decided to postpone the task of installing a New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) onto the telescope's outer shell. The spacewalk, originally scheduled to last six hours and thirty minutes, ended at 21:02 UTC, for a time of eight hours and two minutes. At the time, it became the sixth longest spacewalk in history. It was the twenty-second spacewalk devoted to servicing the Hubble telescope, and Massimino's fourth spacewalk, bringing his total EVA time to thirty hours, forty-four minutes.|$|E
50|$|As built, the GE Classes 34-000, 34-400 and 34-900 {{locomotives}} were visually {{indistinguishable from}} each other. Many of the Class 34-500 locomotives could {{be distinguished from}} the others by the air conditioning units mounted on their cab roofs, {{but not all of}} them were so equipped. When it was still a feature unique to them, they could also be distinguished by their running board-mounted <b>handrails.</b> All South African diesel-electric locomotives have their side <b>handrails</b> mounted along the upper edges of their long hoods. The ex Iscor Class 34-500s, however, were equipped with additional removable running board-mounted <b>handrails.</b> Since these <b>handrails</b> are slide-fit into brackets welded onto the running boards, they are easily removed.|$|R

50|$|When {{children}} are the principal users in a building or facility (e.g., elementary schools), {{a second set of}} <b>handrails</b> at an appropriate height can assist them and aid in preventing accidents. A maximum height of 28 inches (710 mm) measured {{to the top of the}} gripping surface from the ramp surface or stair nosing is recommended for <b>handrails</b> designed for children. Sufficient vertical clearance between upper and lower <b>handrails,</b> 9 inches (230 mm) minimum, should be provided to help prevent entrapment.|$|R

50|$|In some cases, {{such as the}} Capilano Suspension Bridge, {{the primary}} {{supports}} form the <b>handrails</b> with the deck suspended below them. This makes for more motion side-to-side in the deck than when the primary supports are at deck level, but less motion in the <b>handrails.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Public safety {{workers have}} called the walkway safety <b>handrails</b> in the Big Dig tunnels [...] "ginsu guardrails", because the squared-off edges of the support posts have caused mutilations and deaths of {{passengers}} ejected from crashed vehicles. After an eighth reported death involving the safety <b>handrails,</b> MassDOT officials announced plans to cover or remove the allegedly dangerous fixtures, but only near curves or exit ramps. This partial removal of hazards has been criticized by a safety specialist, who suggests that the <b>handrails</b> are just as dangerous in straight sections of the tunnel.|$|R

25|$|On June 6, 2007, Bork {{filed suit}} {{in federal court in}} New York City against the Yale Club over an {{incident}} that had occurred a year earlier. Bork alleged that, while trying to reach the dais to speak at an event, he fell, because of the Yale Club's failure to provide any steps or <b>handrail</b> between the floor and the dais. (After his fall, he successfully climbed to the dais and delivered his speech.) According to the complaint, Bork's injuries required surgery, immobilized him for months, forced him to use a cane, and left him with a limp. In May 2008, Bork and the Yale Club reached a confidential, out-of-court settlement.|$|E
