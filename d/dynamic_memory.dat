5|$|Working {{memory is}} the ability of the brain to {{maintain}} a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in.

5|$|In C++ {{computer}} programming, allocators are {{an important}} component of the C++ Standard Library. The standard library provides several data structures, such as list and set, commonly referred to as containers. A common trait among these containers is their ability to change size during the execution of the program. To achieve this, some form of <b>dynamic</b> <b>memory</b> allocation is usually required. Allocators handle all the requests for allocation and deallocation of memory for a given container. The C++ Standard Library provides general-purpose allocators that are used by default, however, custom allocators may also be supplied by the programmer.|$|E

25|$|Dynamic {{random access}} memory {{is a type of}} {{random access memory}} that stores each bit of data in a {{separate}} capacitor within an integrated circuit. Since real capacitors leak charge, the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh requirement, it is a <b>dynamic</b> <b>memory</b> as opposed to static random access memory and other static memory. In 1966 DRAM was invented by Robert Dennard at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center.|$|E
25|$|In his 1971 paper, Chua {{extrapolated}} {{a conceptual}} symmetry between the non-linear resistor (voltage vs. current), non-linear capacitor (voltage vs. charge) and non-linear inductor (magnetic flux linkage vs. current).

In contrast to a linear (or non-linear) resistor the memristor has a dynamic relationship between current and voltage including a memory of past voltages or currents. Other scientists had proposed <b>dynamic</b> <b>memory</b> resistors such as the memistor of Bernard Widrow, but Chua attempted to introduce mathematical generality.|$|E

25|$|REM {{sleep is}} known for its vivid creations and {{similarity}} to the bioelectric outputs of a waking person. This stage of sleep is characterized by muscle atonia, fast but low voltage EEG and, as the name suggests, rapid eye movement. It is difficult to attribute memory gains to a single stage of sleep when it may be the entire sleep cycle that is responsible for memory consolidation. Recent research conducted by Datta et al. used an avoidance task followed by a post-training REM sleep period to examine changes in P waves affecting reprocessing of recently acquired stimuli. It was found that not only were the P waves increased during post-training sleep but also the density of the waves. These findings may imply that P waves during REM sleep may help to activate critical forebrain and cortical structures dealing with memory consolidation. In a Hennevin et al. study, 1989, the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) was given light electrical stimulation, during REM sleep, which is known to have an advantageous effect for learning when applied after training. The rats in the experiment were trained to run a maze in search of a food reward. One group of rats was given non-awakening MRF electrical stimulations after each of their maze trials compared to a control group which did not receive any electrical stimulation. It was noticed that the stimulated rats performed significantly better in respect to error reduction. These findings imply that <b>dynamic</b> <b>memory</b> processes occur both during training as well as during post-training sleep. Another study by Hennevin et al. (1998) conditioned rats to fear a noise that is associated with a subsequent foot shock. The interesting part of the experiment is that fear responding to the noise (measured in the amygdala) was observed when the noise was presented during REM sleep. This was compared to a group of pseudo-conditioned rats who did not display the same amygdalar activation during post-training sleep. This would suggest that neural responding to previously salient stimuli is maintained even during REM sleep. There is no shortage of research conducted on the effects that REM sleep has on the working brain but consistency in the findings is what plagues recent research. There is no guarantee as to what functions REM sleep may perform for our bodies and brains but modern research is always expanding and assimilating new ideas to further our understanding of such processes.|$|E
2500|$|A buffer {{overflow}} {{occurring in the}} heap data area {{is referred to as}} a heap overflow and is exploitable in a manner different from that of stack-based overflows. [...] Memory on the heap is dynamically allocated by the application at run-time and typically contains program data. [...] Exploitation is performed by corrupting this data in specific ways to cause the application to overwrite internal structures such as linked list pointers.
