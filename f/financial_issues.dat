5|$|Common public {{explanations}} for the college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and <b>financial</b> <b>issues.</b> The Nations Eliseo Vivas blamed its lack of grades as detrimental to student incentive, and judged the effort to create self-motivated students through freedom to be a failure.

Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, and blamed educational stagnation on the existing order.

This thesis {{presents the results}} of a study conducted to determine the resource impact of raising the delinquent debt threshold used to expand background investigations on security clearances from $ 500 to $ 2000. Statistical analysis was used to investigate the effects of this change in policy on the frequency of <b>financial</b> <b>issue</b> case security clearance investigations. The results of the analysis indicate that a reduction did occur in the number of <b>financial</b> related <b>issue</b> cases {{as a percentage of the}} total number of issue cases after the threshold change had taken place. As a result, resources are saved as case controllers, investigators, adjudicators, administrators, and secretarial staff spend less time, effort, and related travel on <b>financial</b> related <b>issue</b> cases. Additional savings are realized as defense contractor employees spend less time on menial tasks waiting for security clearances to be approved. Lieutenant, United States Naval Reserv...|$|R

In January 1998, KKR and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst agreed to the $1.5 billion buyout of Regal Entertainment Group.

Shortly after agreeing to the Regal takeover, the deal with United Artists fell apart, destroying the strategy to eliminate costs by building a larger combined company. Two years later, in 2000, Regal encountered significant <b>financial</b> <b>issues</b> and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection; the company passed to billionaire investor Philip Anschutz.|$|E

Subsequent leader René Kennel, a former Mennonite farmer who became pastor of the churches in Saint-Dizier and in Joinville after discovering Pentecostalism through an evangelical Roma mission, has directed the church since 1977. Its main beliefs (expressed in a creed of eight articles of faith) and practices are nearly identical with those of most Evangelical and Pentecostal groups, with a special focus on miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit and proselytism. In the late 1990s the church was embroiled in many trials (often {{on the grounds of}} defamation or for <b>financial</b> <b>issues),</b> losing most of them.
