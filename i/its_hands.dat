40|$|Iriki et al. {{reported}} interesting results {{regarding the}} visual receptive field of {{two kinds of}} neurons in the parietal cortex of a monkey.

They discussed those results in relation to high-order cognitive functions such as body image and symbolization[1]-[3]...|$|R

5|$|Waite {{threatened}} to declare martial law, but the mine owners refused to disband their deputy force. Gen. Brooks then {{threatened to}} keep his troops in the region for another 30 days. Faced {{with the prospect of}} paying for a paramilitary force which could only sit on <b>its</b> <b>hands,</b> the owners agreed to disband it. The deputies, which Gen. Brooks had dispatched via rail to Colorado Springs, began dispersing on June 11. The Waite agreement became operative the same day, and the miners returned to work.|$|E
5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, {{they can move}} into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with <b>its</b> <b>hands</b> and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E
5|$|Burial 48 is {{generally}} accepted as {{the tomb of}} Siyaj Chan K'awil. It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis. The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained {{the remains of the}} king himself together with those of two adolescents who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler. The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457, probably the date of either the death or interment of the king. The king's skeleton was missing its skull, its femurs and one of <b>its</b> <b>hands</b> while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact.|$|E

5|$|Embarrassing or {{tying the}} hands of the executive. The court should abstain from interfering where a {{judicial}} pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie <b>its</b> <b>hands</b> in the conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview. In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Divisional Court of England and Wales held that the applicant's true purpose for seeking the court's interpretation of a United Nations Security Council resolution was to limit the government's freedom in relation to {{the use of military force}} and to exercise diplomatic pressure in advance. Thus, the matter should be regarded as non-justiciable.|$|E
5|$|The bipedal-quadrupedal {{consensus}} was changed by a {{detailed study of}} the forelimbs of Plateosaurus by Bonnan and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that Plateosaurus was incapable of pronating <b>its</b> <b>hands.</b> The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of radius and ulna in the elbow. The lack of forelimb pronation meant that Plateosaurus was an obligate (i.e. unable to walk in any other way) biped. Further indicators for a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the hind limb is roughly {{twice as long as}} the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, {{and the fact that the}} centre of mass rests squarely over the hind limbs.|$|E
5|$|During {{the hunting}} trip, Jimbo proclaims Kenny his honorary nephew, {{upsetting}} Stan. When night falls, Cartman {{tells the story}} of Scuzzlebutt, a creature that has a piece of celery in place of one of <b>its</b> <b>hands</b> and Patrick Duffy for a leg. The boys are skeptical, so Cartman decides to dress up as the creature the next morning in order to convince and scare them. When he disappears the next morning, the others set out to find him. They then see Cartman disguised as Scuzzlebutt and start shooting at him. When they catch up with Cartman {{at the base of the}} mountain, Stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle's eyes. However, he is unable to do so and the delay gives Cartman time to remove the costume. At a lower elevation, Randy orders the South Park residents to dig a trench to divert the lava away from the town.|$|E

5|$|Sinosauropteryx was anatomically {{similar to}} Compsognathus, differing from its European {{relatives}} in its proportions. The skull of Sinosauropteryx was 15% longer than its thigh bones, unlike in Compsognathus, where {{the skull and}} thigh bones are approximately equivalent in length. The arms of Sinosauropteryx (humerus and radius) were only 30% the length of its legs (thigh bone and shin), compared to 40% in Compsognathus. Additionally, Sinosauropteryx had several features unique among all other theropods. It had 64 vertebrae in its tail. This high number made its tail the longest relative to body length of any theropod. <b>Its</b> <b>hands</b> were long compared to its arms, about 84% to 91% {{of the length of}} the rest of the arm (humerus and radius), and half the length of the foot. The first and second digits were about the same length, with a large claw on the first digit. The first fingers were large, being both longer and thicker than either of the bones of the forearm. The teeth differed slightly (they were heterodont) based on position: those near the tips of the upper jaws (on the premaxillae) were slender and lacked serrations, while those behind them (on the maxillae) were serrated and laterally compressed. The teeth of the lower jaws were similarly differentiated.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{a dispute}} must be justiciable before the High Court {{will hear the}} case. A decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non-justiciable if the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, and judges are ill-equipped to decide the case because of their limited training, experience and access to materials; if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie <b>its</b> <b>hands</b> {{in the conduct of}} affairs traditionally falling within its purview; or if the decision involves the exercise of a prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of. Nonetheless, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but the courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it, or the courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. Because of the principle that all powers have legal limits, the Attorney-General's exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by the President on the Cabinet's advice are both justiciable in exceptional cases, for instance, where the powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in bad faith.|$|E
