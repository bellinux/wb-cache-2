40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{systematic}} review of the history of music therapy research and treatment of children with autism. Understanding such history is impor tant in order to improve clinical efficacy and inform future research. This paper includes a history of autism diagnosis, reviews strengths and limitations of music therapy practice with children with autism from 1940 - 2009, and suggests direction for future music therapy research and clinical practice with this population. Literature was limited to the English language and obtained with the following search terms: autism, autistic, (early) infantile autism, child, thera peutic music, musical therapy, and music therapy. Table of contents from music therapy journals were searched, and reference lists from obtained articles were perused for additional articles. This historical review focused primarily on journal articles, however, books and book chapters that appeared to hold particular historical significance were also included. Autistic disorder is currently one of the most prevalent exceptionalities of childhood in the United States. From 1997 to 2007, the number of children ages 6 through 21 with autism who received services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (<b>IDEA)</b> <b>rose</b> from 42, 517 to 258, 305 - a five-fold increase in 10 years (Data Accountability Center, 2009).

This analytical research paper examines the novel The Blind Owl (Bofe Kor) by Sadeq Hedayat with the aim of helping to read and understand the novel approach according to narrative discourse. The results show that the time in this novel does not follow the chronographic rules; in other words, the time fluctuates under the influence of the retrospective and prospective time disorder and thus, the time disorders and other factors such as repetition, redundancy and etc. cause the slow acceleration in narrative that led to more prolong the narrative text than the story...|$|R

He suggests that lower-track classes create a self-fulfilling prophesy for most students who might, if challenged to succeed, do well in advanced classes. Among the issues Rose discusses are the problems encountered by students whose improvised backgrounds provide little context for the ideas and language they encounter in the academy. By explaining his personal challenges and his experiences with various mentors, Rose illustrates how he worked to master academic language and <b>ideas.</b> <b>Rose</b> uses his experiences as a student and a teacher as evidence for a critique of conceptions of literacy used in contemporary education. He suggests that students labeled [...] "underprepared" [...] are inexperienced with the expectations of the academy, that literacy crises running through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were manufactured and deflect other concerns, and that schools must work with students differently.” http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_res.html#111 ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIndoor {{positioning}} {{appears to}} be a challenging topic and many techniques have been proposed these last ten years, ranging from High-Sensitivity GNSS to sensor networks, through Assisted-GNSS or WLAN based approaches. No ultimate solution seems yet to provide the answer to the problem, probably crucial of Location Based Services continuity from outdoor (where GNSS are such good candidates) to indoor positioning. Current works are mainly oriented towards hybridisation techniques. Recently, a new <b>idea</b> <b>rose</b> up consisting in the introduction of repealites (a shortcut between repeater and pseudolite). In such approach, an identical signal is transmitted from all the so-called repealites (as for repeaters), but with slight controlled delays for each transmitter. As a result, the correlation function, at the receiver end, is to exhibit N primary peaks in the case of N transmitting repealites. Interference problems and near-far effects have been addressed in previous papers and we are now interested in the most simple way to generate these N signals. The multipath problem is dealt with through the use of the SMICL (Short Multipath Insensitive Code Loop) design. Many different architectures are possible for the N delayed signals generation. Our approach consists of implementing a radio over fibre system: at the output of a one satellite signal generator a coupler is used to divide the signal in two parts. One part is assigned as the reference signal while the second part is converted in the optical domain, split and delayed. To this end, cascaded 1 X 2 optical spliters are used in order to define the (N- 1) required outputs. The desired delays are obtained using optical fibres of various lengths. In order to provide RF outputs, fibre to radio converters are used. The system that we have designed is presented the present article together with experimental results. In particular, a simple calibration method of the system is proposed to evaluate the accuracy of the delays and to define the best experimental settings to be used...|$|E

In February 2006 Oregon State University hosted a workshop – Transportation and the Environment: Linking Researchers, Transportation Providers and Industry – attended by nearly 50 participants representing transportation providers, industry leaders, and academic researchers for the specific purpose of creating a transportation and the environment research agenda. The participants discussed needs and opportunities in the areas of ecology and natural systems, land-use, planning and performance measures, emerging technologies, and environmental and socioeconomic relationships. Key needs and opportunities were identified, and an attempt was made to categorize the needed research. Among the needs and opportunities for transportation and the environment research, the following <b>ideas</b> <b>rose</b> to the top during the workshop: [...] Developing integrated decision-support systems; [...] Identifying, developing, and testing opportunities in green infrastructure (including the localization of industries, such as clustering transportation industries, construction material use, and use of recycled materials); [...] Developing a process for systematically repairing or replacing culverts within watersheds or ecoregions; and [...] Identifying opportunities to study the relationships between transportation and the environment {{within the context of the}} development of new cities and community developments in Central and Northern Oregon.
