50|$|Start {{by tying}} a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> around the spar or pole. Then make an {{additional}} turn {{around with the}} working end, {{in the same direction}} as the turns forming the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch.</b> Now, tuck the working end under the standing part of the original <b>clove</b> <b>hitch.</b> Pull up tight to complete the hitch.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> {{is a type}} of knot. Along {{with the}} bowline and the sheet bend, it is often {{considered}} one of the most important knots and is commonly referred to as a Double <b>Hitch.</b> A <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> is two successive half-hitches around an object. It is most effectively used as a crossing knot. It can be used as a binding knot, but is not particularly secure in that role. [...] A <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> made around the rope's own standing part is known as either two half-hitches or buntline hitch, depending on whether the turns of the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> progress away from or towards the hitched object.|$|R

50|$|Although {{similar in}} {{finished}} appearance to the double bowline, the water bowline is formed with a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> as the loop in the standing {{part of the}} rope. This {{is similar to the}} double bowline, which puts the running end through a round turn. The additional friction from the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> increases the security of this knot.|$|R

50|$|This knot is also {{sometimes}} referred to as a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> over itself, or double half-hitch.|$|R
50|$|The {{slippery}} hitch {{is effectively}} a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> {{finished with a}} slipped loop. To tie one, begin as for a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch,</b> but instead of passing {{the end of the}} line through the loop in the final step, pass a bight instead, leaving the end on the original side. Pulling on this end will release the hitch. If tied in a gasket, this will quickly release the sail.|$|R

5000|$|As {{long as the}} <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> {{can feed}} over the drum, the rope will feed through the device. In a fall, the drum is back driven by the rope as the device slides down the rope; when the drum {{rotation}} exceeds a certain angular velocity, it locks off to the frame {{and the increase in}} friction induced between the stationary drum and the rope causes the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> to rapidly tighten around the locked drum to arrest the fall.|$|R

50|$|The {{buntline}} hitch is a knot {{used for}} attaching a rope to an object. It is formed by passing the working end around an object, then making a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> around the rope's standing part, taking care that the turns of the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> progress towards the object rather than away from it. Secure and easily tied, the buntline hitch will jam when subjected to extreme loads. Given the knot's propensity to jam, {{it is often}} made in slipped form.|$|R
50|$|The lobster buoy hitch {{is similar}} to the {{buntline}} hitch, but made with a cow hitch around the standing part rather than a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch.</b>|$|R

50|$|This knot is {{particularly}} useful where {{the length of}} the running end needs to be adjustable, since feeding in rope from either direction will loosen the knot to be tightened at a new position. With certain types of cord, the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> can slip when loaded. In modern climbing rope, the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> will slip to a point, and then stop slipping. With smaller diameter cords, after being heavily weighted it may become difficult to untie. It is also unreliable when used on a square or rectangular post, rather than round.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{description}} {{is not entirely}} without ambiguity, the constrictor knot {{is thought to have}} appeared under the name [...] "gunner's knot" [...] in the 1866 work The Book of Knots, written under the pseudonym Tom Bowling. in relation to the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch,</b> which he illustrated and called the [...] "builder's knot". He wrote, [...] "The Gunner's knot (of which we do not give a diagram) only differs from the builder's knot, by the ends of the cords being simply knotted before being brought from under the loop which crosses them." [...] Oddly, when J. T. Burgess copied from Bowling, he changed this text to merely state [...] "when the ends are knotted, the builder's knot becomes the gunner's Knot." [...] Although this <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> with knotted ends is a workable binding knot, Burgess was not actually describing the constrictor knot. In 1917, A. Hyatt Verrill illustrated Burgess' <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> variation in Knots, Splices and Rope Work.|$|R

50|$|Knots, {{such as the}} <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> {{and half}} hitch, are used for rope line terminations. For example, hitches are used to {{terminate}} hemp lift lines at battens and operating lines at counterweight arbors.|$|R
50|$|The round lashing is most {{frequently}} used to join two poles together to extend their length. In the simple version, a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> is tied around both poles {{and there are no}} frapping turns.|$|R

5000|$|If at {{the last}} step one chooses not to cross the immobilized other end and tuck only inwards under the part between the two turns, the knot will be an ABoK #11 or <b>Clove</b> <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The end {{goes around}} the main part and then gets stuck under the first turn of the main part; preferably under the point where main part and {{the bridge of the}} <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> cross each other.|$|R
