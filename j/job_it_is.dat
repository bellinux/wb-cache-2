However, proponents of bathhouses point out that closing these facilities does not prevent people from engaging in unsafe sex.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{following}} his parents wishes {{and looking for}} a <b>job,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said that Ramprasad devoted most of his time to sadhana. Ramram died before he could make provisions to support the family. Forced finally by poverty, Ramprasad moved to Kolkata and worked as an accountant in the household of Durga Charan Mitra for a monthly salary of thirty rupees. According to traditional accounts, during his employment Ramprasad would write devotional songs to Kali. His fellow employees were appalled to see Ramprasad write poems in his account book, and reported him to their employer. Durga Charan Mitra, upon reading Ramprasad's work, was moved by his piety and literary skill. Instead of dismissing Ramprasad from work, he asked him to return to his village and compose songs to Kali, while continuing to pay his salary.|$|E

Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even know there were such awards. I have people around me whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to not tell me about such things. They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives you more longevity as a performer." [...] He later insisted that he still felt [...] "really good about it. Here I was taking big chances, breaking a new genre." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{possibility}} {{to eradicate the}} HSV-1 variant is being pursued by a team at Duke University. By {{figuring out how to}} switch all copies of the virus in the host from latency to their active stage at the same time, rather than the way the virus copies normally stagger their activity stage, leaving some dormant somewhere at all times, [...] conventional antiviral drugs might kill the entire virus population, since they can no longer hide in the nerve cells. One class of drugs called antagomir could serve this purpose. These are chemically engineered oligonucleotides or short segments of RNA that can be made to mirror their target genetic material, namely herpes microRNAs. They could be engineered to attach and thus 'silence' the microRNA, thus rendering the virus incapable of remaining latent in its host. Professor Cullen believes a drug could be developed to block the microRNA whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to suppress HSV-1 into latency.|$|E
500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give him credit because he did a very good <b>job.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} there was {{lobbying}} against gay bathhouses blaming {{them for the}} spread of STIs, in particular HIV, and this forced their closure in some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States. Sociologist Stephen O. Murray, writes that, [...] "there was never any evidence presented that going to bathhouses was a risk-factor for contracting AIDS." [...] In other countries, fears about the spread of STIs have prompted the closing of bathhouses—with their private rooms—in favour of sex clubs, in which all sexual activity {{takes place in the}} open, and can be observed by monitors whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to enforce safer sex practices.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the rule}} to allow QBs to simply kneel didn't take effect until 1987, Pisarcik took the snap on first down [...] and rolled {{on the ground}} (a common play for QBs in the pre-kneel era). Eagles middle linebacker Bill Bergey charged into Giants' center Jim Clack, {{knocking}} him backward into Pisarcik {{in a desperate attempt}} to force a fumble. Since defensive players usually are not blocked in this situation, they usually in turn do not rush. Offensive players consider any breach of this tacit agreement as a provocation, particularly linemen whose <b>job</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to protect the quarterback, and fights between angry linemen and the opposition were not uncommon.|$|E

The success or failure of a team depends on {{the success or failure of}} each of its team members. If any one of the team members has poor SA, it can lead to a critical error in performance that can undermine the success of the entire team. By this definition, each team member needs to have a high level of SA on those factors that are relevant for his or her <b>job.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not sufficient for one member of the team to be aware of critical information if the team member who needs that information is not aware.|$|E
