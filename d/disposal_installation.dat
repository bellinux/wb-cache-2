Benthos macroinvertebrates can {{describe}} the stream water quality so that very well be used as bioindicators, due to each species has a different tolerance to interference organic pollutants in waters. This study aimed to assess the water quality of Nimbai stream using benthos macroinvertebrates tolerance level and several water quality parameters. Data retrieval was conducted in JuneJuly and SeptemberOctober 2012 in seven stations (L 1 L 7) from Nimbai upstream to downstream that connected to Prafi river. The water macroinvertebrates were taken using surber with mesh size 200 μm and then was identified at the family level. At L 5 station near the oil palm waste <b>disposal</b> <b>installations</b> was contains oil and fat (< 1 - 3 mg/l), which resulted in dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH is lower than the other stations. Similarly the value of H' is low (0. 83), however, the value of C (0. 79) was high that dominated by Oligochaeta. Famili biotic index (FBI) value obtained showed that water quality in the L 1 L 4 stations was in good to excellent condition, but the quality at L 5 station is classified as very poor. As the distance far away from the sources of pollution in the L 5 station, water quality tends to improve as shown in the L 6 and L 7 stations. The result of this study shows the important benefits of benthos macroinvertebrates as bioindicators for assessing the quality of stream waters, and can be described aquatic environments disturbance to the benthos macroinvertebrates habitats in Nimbai stream...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCompacted {{expansive}} clays {{are often}} {{considered as a}} possible buffer material in high-level deep radioactive waste <b>disposals.</b> After the <b>installation</b> of waste canisters, the engineered clay barriers are subjected to thermo-hydro-mechanical actions {{in the form of}} water infiltration from the geological barrier, heat dissipation from the radioactive waste canisters, and stresses generated by clay swelling under almost confined conditions. The aim of the present work is to develop a constitutive model that is able to describe the behaviour of compacted expansive clays under these coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical actions. The proposed model is based on two existing models: one for the hydro-mechanical behaviour of compacted expansive clays and another for the thermo-mechanical behaviour of saturated clays. The elaborated model has been validated using the thermo-hydro-mechanical test results on the compacted MX 80 bentonite. Comparison between the model prediction and the experimental data show that this model is able to reproduce the main features of volume changes: heating at constant suction and pressure induces either expansion or contraction; the mean yield stress changes with variations of suction or temperature...|$|R
40|$|In {{most of the}} European Union's 27 member states, {{nuclear power}} is {{considered}} to be a risk rather than an advantage. The positive aspects of nuclear power, such as greater energy security and lower greenhouse gas emissions, are cancelled out by fears of terrorist attacks against nuclear facilities, the potential misuse of nuclear material and concerns about the safety of nuclear waste <b>disposal</b> and nuclear <b>installations.</b> To achieve effective synergy between breeding and minor actinide (MA) waste burning in a fuel cycle, fast reactors should be designed to recycle MAs from several (2 - 3) LWRs/CANDUs. For homogeneous recycling this in turn means that the MA fraction in the fuel should be about 5 %, which, in comparison to MA-free cores, nearly halves the negative Doppler reactivity feedback, however, and increases the positive coolant temperature reactivity coefficient. In the present study, we compare the effectiveness of different moderating materials to improve Doppler fuel temperature reactivity feedback and the coolant temperature reactivity coefficient in lead-cooled and sodium-cooled fast reactors (LFRs and SFRs) homogeneously recycling MAs. The materials investigated were hydrides (CaH_ 2), metallic beryllium, and enriched boron carbide (11 ^B_ 4 C). The calculations showed that, in homogeneous mode, both LFR and SFR systems could burn about 80 kg of MAs per year, with the burn-up reactivity swing remaining below 2. 5 $/yr. Hydride moderating pins appeared to be the most effective in improving reactivity coefficients and a Doppler coefficient twice as large as coolant temperature reactivity feedback was obtained in both an LFR and SFR when ~ 5 % of the fuel pins in each sub-assembly were replaced with CaH_ 2 moderating pins. The hydrides also proved to have the least influence on core breeding performance, but susceptibility to decomposition at relatively low temperatures (~ 1100 K) might pose safety problems. The moderating power of beryllium and 11 ^B_ 4 C is significantly smaller than that of hydrides, which means that the number of moderating pins in a sub-assembly has to be higher. This, however, has a negative influence on breeding and further exacerbates the burn-up reactivity swing. The LFR self-breeder shows a number of advantages over an SFR counterpart regarding its behaviour in unprotected loss-of-flow and unprotected loss-of-heat sink accidents due to superior natural coolant circulation and the larger heat capacity of lead.
