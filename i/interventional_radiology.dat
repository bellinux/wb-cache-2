25|$|The work of Di Chiro, Doppman and Ommaya was {{critical}} {{to the development of}} spinal angiography. The visualization of arteries and veins allowed for understanding of the pathophysiology of spinal AVMs in addition to classification of lesions. Di Chiro, Ommaya and Doppman also reported one of the earliest <b>interventional</b> <b>radiology</b> approaches using stainless steel pellets to treat a spinal cord AVM. This percutaneous embolization approach was noted as less traumatic than surgical treatment by the authors and represented another step forward in pecutaneous vascular embolization as an addition the surgical armamentarium for treating certain vascular disorders of the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic concept}} behind <b>interventional</b> <b>radiology</b> is to {{diagnose}} or treat pathologies, {{with the most}} minimally invasive technique possible. Minimally invasive procedures are currently performed more than ever before. These procedures are often performed with the patient fully awake, {{with little or no}} sedation required. Interventional Radiologists and Interventional Radiographers diagnose and treat several disorders, including peripheral vascular disease, renal artery stenosis, inferior vena cava filter placement, gastrostomy tube placements, biliary stents and hepatic interventions. Images are used for guidance, and the primary instruments used during the procedure are needles and catheters. The images provide maps that allow the Clinician to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing disease. By minimizing the physical trauma to the patient, peripheral interventions can reduce infection rates and recovery times, as well as hospital stays. To be a trained interventionalist in the United States, an individual completes a five-year residency in radiology and a one- or two-year fellowship in IR.|$|E
25|$|There is as of 2012 {{insufficient}} evidence to determine effectiveness or safety. Further trials {{are required to}} determine if the benefits, if any, of the procedure outweigh its risks. Most experts, and medical and patients organizations, including the National Multiple Sclerosis Society of the USA or the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE), recommend not using the proposed treatment outside clinical trials until its effectiveness is confirmed by controlled studies. Moreover, the CIRSE has stated that treatment research should begin by a small, placebo-controlled, prospective randomised trial which should be monitored by an independent organization. An exception has been the Society of <b>Interventional</b> <b>Radiology</b> in the USA and Canada. Its members consider published literature on the effectiveness of CCSVI intervention to be inconclusive but supports decisions made by patients, families and physicians to perform angioplasty. In March 2013 a press release indicated that the first prospective, placebo-controlled study of ballon angioplasty for MS had not shown any benefit of the therapy. The study, a phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment, enrolled initially 10 patients that received the treatment and 20 more afterwards that were either allocated to receive angioplasty or a placebo intervention.|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{incidence}} and outcome of iatrogenic vascular complications needing surgery {{in a single}} vascular unit serving <b>interventional</b> vascular <b>radiology</b> and <b>interventional</b> cardiology. Evolution of diagnostic and <b>interventional</b> cardiovascular <b>radiology,</b> along {{with the introduction of}} non-surgical therapies for such complications, may have influenced the number of vascular complications requiring emergency surgery. Vascular surgical data were collected from information prospectively entered on computerised database and case note review. Radiology data were collated from prospective entries in logbooks and computerised database. In all 24, 033 cardiovascular radiological procedures were performed between 1984 and 1996 (61 % cardiac), numbers increasing annually. During this period, 62 patients (40 peripheral; 22 cardiac) required emergency surgical intervention after radiological procedures. Mean age was 61. 9 years (range 1 - 92 years), male to female ratio was 1 : 1. The absolute number of cases requiring surgical intervention peaked in 1989, subsequently reducing annually. Sites of vascular injury included common femoral artery (40), brachial artery (6), iliac artery (6), popliteal artery (5), other (5). A total of 87 vascular surgical operations was performed (range 1 - 6 operations per patient). Interventions included thrombectomy/embolectomy (29), bypass grafting (16), direct repair (27). Seven major amputations were performed (two bilateral). Mortality after surgery was 9. 7 %. Mean inpatient hospital stay was 11. 3 days (range 0 - 75 days). A Poisson regression model indicates a 5 % reduction in risk for each successive year of observation; however, this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0. 16, 95 % CI 12 % decreased risk to 2 % increased risk).

40|$|Interventional medical {{practitioners}} are specialists who do minimally invasive procedures instead of surgery or other treatment. Most often, these procedures utilize various imaging and catheterization techniques {{in order to}} diagnose and treat vascular issues in the body. Interventionalist techniques, including injecting arteries with dye, visualizing these via x-ray, and opening up blockages, developed from early pioneers' bold and sometimes controversial experiments which aimed to find safer and better ways to treat coronary artery and other atherosclerotic vascular disease. Currently, the major interventional specialties are <b>interventional</b> (or vascular) <b>radiology,</b> <b>interventional</b> cardiology, and endovascular surgical (interventional) neuroradiology.

30|$|The {{potential}} for marked changes in diagnostic practice is demonstrated in Fig.  2.

Continuing medical education plays a crucial role in ensuring radiologists keep apace with this, both through formal learning or teaching but also via self-directed learning.

2500|$|Fluoroscopy (...) is an imaging {{technique}} that uses X-rays to obtain real-time moving {{images of the}} interior of an object.

In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, since the 1950s most fluoroscopes have included X-ray image intensifiers and cameras as well, to improve the image's visibility and make it available on a remote display screen.
