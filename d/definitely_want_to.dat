25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be able to sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I {{have to be able to}} sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E

According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E

Wright described Ant-Man as a stand-alone film but said it would fit into to the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, [...] "I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think Iron Man really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it." [...] Wright also stated that pre-production for Ant-Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014. The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} support Cyrus' then newly launched, joint apparel line with Max Azria, sold {{exclusively}} by Walmart stores, an EP was chosen for release. [...] "I feel it goes perfect {{for that kind of}} look", she commented. For Cyrus, The Time of Our Lives was a transitional EP and a method of re-introducing herself to new audiences. Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what I usually do, which is kind of a pop rock sound — I don’t even like using the word 'rock,' because I feel like it’s an honor to be put in that title. This is kind of my transition. The next record, I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be able to step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for The Time of Our Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music that inspires her. Cyrus' next album, Can't Be Tamed was released approximately ten months later, on June 18, 2010.|$|E
500|$|... 2001 {{proved to}} be a {{difficult}} year for Gugelmin. During the practice session for the race at Texas Motor Speedway, he crashed after he lost control in the second turn and hit the wall with a force of 66.2g, before a second impact with the wall which exerted a force of 113.1g. The event was eventually called off after drivers complained of dizziness, nausea and blurred vision, which were caused by the high g-forces experienced when driving at speed on the track. During the week before the race at Nazareth Speedway, Gugelmin's son, Giuliano, died from respiratory complications. Giuliano was quadriplegic and a lifelong sufferer from cerebral palsy owing to complications at birth. The PacWest team announced that Gugelmin would not be taking part in the race. Gugelmin's team mate at PacWest, Scott Dixon, won the race beating Kenny Bräck into second place. At the end of 2001, Gugelmin decided to retire from the sport, stating [...] "I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> spend more time with my family.

Smith also {{took part in a}} photoshoot for publicity and cover photos. According to writers for the Daily Mail, the cover photo was modified to give Smith [...] "a smile worthy of a model from a Colgate advert", due to her [...] "gappy teeth". Though generally critical of the move, the report conceded that it was better for Smith's teeth to be digitally straightened, rather than forcing her [...] "to endure a battery of dental surgery". A television advert and music video for [...] "River of Light" [...] were recorded to further publicise the release, and Smith also appeared on the cover of April's Classic FM Magazine. Further promotion in {{the weeks leading up to}} the release of Faryl included Smith appearing on Loose Women, The Paul O'Grady Show, BBC Radio 4, Radio Five Live and BBC Breakfast.

In 2011, another Filipino artist, Gary Valenciano during his visit in Malaysia has expressed her admiration of Siti's vocal ability. He commented, [...] "Based on what I've been told by the local media, I believe the best Malay song and the best vocal I've ever heard has to be Siti Nurhaliza's. If {{it was possible for}} me to meet her, I would <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do a duet with her.

I think I want 'Teenage dreams, so hard to beat' on my gravestone and every night at dusk the trumpeters of the 5th Battalion King's Shropshire Light Infantry to play Misty in Roots' 'Mankind' over the grave. Lovely." ...|$|E
50|$|From March until August 1945, Vietnam enjoyed {{what was}} called a “fake independence”.

5000|$|I <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{get better}} at writing, and those things {{happened}} simultaneously with trying to read better.

To fight that, I started writing words on paper and making up melodies to go with them. By writing things down, and putting more words into my head, it put more words in my mouth when I turned on the tape recorder to sing.|$|R
5000|$|Hazard and Dragonetti used a {{much more}} {{collaborative}} approach to writing and recording Love Notes/Letter Bombs than they have used for past albums. In an interview with The Vinyl District, Dragonetti notes: [...] "The first thing we really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do when working on this record is involve other people more. We <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make {{something a little more}} aggressive sounding, something we enjoyed playing live a little more. We had this guy John O’Mahony mix it, and he did the Metric record Fantasies, and sonically that really impressed us. We recorded it out in Los Angeles at The Sound Factory." ...|$|R
2500|$|Man Chong {{gathered}} his subordinates and told them, [...] "Sun Quan knows that I have moved the {{troops out of}} Hefei.

Although he doesn't have the courage to push further in and attack Xincheng, he'll definitely send his troops ashore just to show off how big his army is." [...] He then ordered 6,000 troops to lie in ambush in Hefei and wait for the Wu soldiers to come ashore. As Man Chong predicted, Sun Quan did order his troops to go ashore and put on a show of might. When that happened, the 6,000 troops in Hefei launched a sudden and fierce attack on them. Hundreds of Wu soldiers were killed while some drowned as they tried to flee back to their ships.|$|E

Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He's just playing games, and I'm fed up with it, {{to be honest with}} you. I don't sing, so I can't do much about it", adding, [...] "I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play live. Because, you know, I've still got a twinkle in my eye. I can still play. So, yeah, I'll just get myself into musical shape, just concentrating on the guitar." ...|$|E
2500|$|As with Settlers III, the {{buildings}} in the game were created using 3D Studio Max, with Adobe Photoshop used to create the textures. Each race was assigned their own specific artist, who worked on nothing except {{the buildings}} for that particular race. According to lead artist/co-designer/co-writer Torsten Hess, this was done [...] "so that {{the style of the}} buildings within a people is uniform." [...] However, there were certain overriding rules to which the individual artists had to adhere. One of the most important was a technique Hess had employed on Settlers III; after the textures were applied, they were [...] "dirtied" [...] so as to create a lived-in, real-world sense. Hess explains, [...] "rigid and straight edges should be avoided. Beautiful curves and moving lines are instead used to suggest life in the settlers world. For the textures, this means stronger colours, a slightly higher contrast than the figures, as well as a lot of detail and the use of many different colour families. We <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> avoid a sterile look. We also draw all the textures by hand." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Mina Hochberg at AMCTV.com, Brent Sexton spoke about the difficulty in portraying Stan Larsen: [...] "Stan's {{the kind of guy}} that, once he knows it's his daughter and he has his breakdown and rage at the site where they found her, from that point on he's decided to put his family first. He's decided to be the rock for his family and essentially suppresses his own grief. So during the morgue scene, yes, emotion <b>definitely</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> come out. However, he won't let it happen." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chloe and I {{have been}} DJing {{a lot of}} the past 3 years, and...we have big record {{collections}} to take influence from, lots of different types of music, but we <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> push it more electronic, big influence from bands like Depeche Mode, 80s era Fleetwood Mac, {{a lot of the}} newer stuff coming out of Paris. The harmonies of Pure Reason Revolution are ever present but we always said from the beginning that anything goes really, if we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use any kind of instrumentation, song length, basically use anything for instrumental textures, there are no boundaries or rules. It's how we create music.|$|R
2500|$|Allen's November 2013 {{video for}} [...] "Hard out Here" [...] {{was accused of}} being racist for its use of mostly black dancers in an {{allegedly}} [...] "disapproving" [...] manner. Allen responded that ethnicity was not a factor in hiring the dancers, and the video was a lighthearted satirical look at objectification of women in modern pop music. In November 2016, Allen apologised for the video {{in an interview with}} Annie Mac, stating [...] "I <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a feminist statement. But I was guilty of assuming that there was a one-size-fits-all where feminism is concerned." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} during their appearance at Rock in Rio in September 2017, Noodles and Holland {{talked about the}} new Offspring album, with the former commenting, [...] "We've got a few songs already done. We wanna do a couple more, and we <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get something out soon. Our fans have waited long enough, I think, so we wanna get something in their hands that they can listen to and hold, and put in their ears." [...] Holland added that the album will [...] "for sure" [...] be released in 2018. In an October 2017 interview, however, Holland said, [...] "I think I want to do like an EP. It's kind of what people are doing these days and it makes for less time in between stuff. It has been five years for us {{so we have a}} few songs together and I'm hoping to get something out by early next year." [...] In the same month, bassist Greg K. mentioned a possible 2018 release date for the new Offspring album, and revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for the album's slow progress is because they have been working on songs here and there. He also stated that the band is no hurry to finish the album.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2009, Epic {{ended their}} {{contract}} with Norwood following {{the appointment of}} Amanda Ghost, making Human her only album with the label. A Los Angeles Times article later revealed Norwood's discontent {{with the success of}} the project the following year when asked about the commercial failure of Human: [...] "It was lacking my belief in it. It lacked my vision. Pretty much bottom line, if you don't believe in something it's not going to go," [...] she said. [...] "So do I believe that Human was as creative as Never Say Never and Full Moon? No, I do not. You <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> put something out that's like that. I felt at the same time I could have had much better songs and a much better set-up." [...] A statement she made during a 2010 interview with Out magazine turned out more harsh: [...] "To hell with that album! [...] Where I felt creatively it could've gone and the space I was in creatively, I needed everybody around me to be in that same space. It would've been a different album, but with the same inspiration and same blessing for other people. It would've been hotter music and a hotter look." ...|$|E
2500|$|EGMNow {{praised the}} Xbox 360 version and stated it {{features}} impressive visuals, brutal and satisfying combat, fluid animations and advanced enemy AI, numerous entertaining side-missions, and an addictive multiplayer component. The one complaint they had with Rage {{was that the}} final boss fight was unsatisfying compared {{to the rest of}} the game's impressive combat scenarios. GameZone gave the same console version 8.5 out of 10 and called it [...] "a great experience that’s coupled with some intensely fun gunplay and some incredibly impressive graphics. It's not quite the Borderlands meets Fallout experience that gamers were expecting. It isn't very long, and it does skimp out on character development, but it focuses more on what id knows best--shooting things in the face. This is one post-apocalyptic wasteland that you’ll <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> venture into." [...] Ars Technica gave a more negative review of the Xbox 360 version, criticizing lack of story, undeveloped characters, uninteresting quests and a [...] "broken save system" [...] (autosave checkpoints being too far apart, forcing frequent manual saves which are slow on the Xbox 360), while acknowledging the quality of the visuals. Edge gave it seven out of ten and called it [...] "a stunningly rendered FPS, but one that seems caught between a desire to innovate and the desire to be true to the template its creators defined." ...|$|E
