40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} {{clinical}} manifestations of allergic rhinitis mice and the expression {{changes of the}} eosinophils CCR 3 and the granule protein mRNA in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and nasal lavage fluid. MethodsTwenty-four BALB/c mice were randomly divided into the control <b>group,</b> PBS <b>therapy</b> <b>group,</b> siRNA <b>therapy</b> <b>group</b> and the CCR 3 siRNA <b>therapy</b> <b>group</b> (n= 6). Allergic rhinitis model were sensitized and stimulated by ovalbunfin, and CCR 3 siRNA <b>therapy</b> <b>group</b> were administered with CCR 3 transnasally before stimulated. The levels of the eosinophils CCR 3, MBP, ECP and EPO in bone marrow, peripheral blood and nasal lavage fluid were detected by RT-PCR. ResultsCompared to the control group and CCR 3 siRNA <b>therapy</b> <b>group,</b> the nasal mucosa of the PBS <b>therapy</b> <b>group</b> and siRNA <b>therapy</b> <b>group</b> developed epithalaxy, goblet cells hyperplasia, squamous epithelium metaplasia, epithelium necrosis, lamina propria and submucosa gland hyperplasia, vasodilatation, tissue edema, and the characterized eosinophil infiltration. RT-PCR indicated that the CCR 3 mRNA, MBP, ECP and EPO expression in bone marrow, peripheral blood and nasal lavage fluid of the CCR 3 siRNA <b>therapy</b> <b>group</b> was lower than the PBS <b>therapy</b> <b>group</b> and siRNA <b>therapy</b> <b>group</b> (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsThe RNA interference therapy to CCR 3 by local administration pernasal can suppress {{the process of the}} development, migration and invasion of the allergic rhinitis eosinophil, thus can reduce the effect of eosinophils and then reduce the inflammation effect of the allergic rhinitis. It may be a new treatment for respiratory tract allergic inflammation...|$|R

5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating and limiting {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as <b>group</b> <b>therapy</b> or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, disulfiram, or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.|$|E

Method: Participants (n D 27) with ICD- 10 diagnoses of F 20 (schizophrenia), F 25 (schizoaffective disorders), F 31 (bipolar affective disorder), F 32 (depressive episode), and F 60 (specific personality disorders) were randomized to receive <b>group</b> music <b>therapy</b> plus standard care (48 weekly sessions of 2 h) or standard care only. The clinical measures included dosages of neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants. Results: The participants who received <b>group</b> music <b>therapy</b> demonstrated greater improvement in drug dosage with respect to neuroleptics than those who did not receive <b>group</b> music <b>therapy.</b> Antidepressants had an increment for both groups that was significant only for the control group. Benzodiazepines and mood stabilizers did not show any significant change in either group. Conclusion: <b>Group</b> music <b>therapy</b> combined with standard drug care was effective for controlling neuroleptic drug dosages in adult psychiatric outpatients who received <b>group</b> music <b>therapy.</b> We discussed the likely applications of <b>group</b> music <b>therapy</b> in psychiatry and the possible contribution of music therapy in improving the psychopathological condition of adult outpatients.

25|$|In the United Kingdom group {{psychotherapy}} initially developed independently, with pioneers S. H.

Foulkes and Bion were psychoanalysts and incorporated psychoanalysis into <b>group</b> <b>therapy</b> by recognising that transference can arise not only between group members and the therapist but also among group members. Furthermore, the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious was extended with a recognition of a group unconscious, in which the unconscious processes of group members could be acted out {{in the form of}} irrational processes in group sessions. Foulkes developed the model known as group analysis and the Institute of Group Analysis, while Bion was influential in the development of <b>group</b> <b>therapy</b> at the Tavistock Clinic.|$|E

A second purpose was that of determining the efficacy of child-centered <b>group</b> play <b>therapy</b> in improving self-esteem, positive social interaction, and in decreasing anxiety and withdrawal behaviors among pre-kindergarten and kindergarten children with speech difficulties. The experimental group consisted of 11 children who received 25 <b>group</b> play <b>therapy</b> sessions one time a week in addition to their directive speech therapy sessions. The comparison group consisted of 10 children who received only their directive speech therapy sessions. The Goldman Fristoe Test of Articulation, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test - Revised, and the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals - 3 were used to measure receptive and expressive language skills. The Burks' Behavior Rating Scale was used to measure symptoms of anxiety, withdrawal, poor self-esteem, and poor social skills as observed by parents and teachers. Twelve hypotheses were tested using ANCOVA and Eta Squared. Child-centered <b>group</b> play <b>therapy</b> was shown to have a large practical significance in helping children improve their expressive language skills. Child-centered <b>group</b> play <b>therapy</b> was shown to have a medium practical significance in increasing children's receptive language skills. Small sample size {{may have contributed to the}} lack of statistical significance as calculated by the analysis of covariance. Child-centered <b>group</b> play <b>therapy</b> was shown to have a small yet positive impact upon children's articulation skills and anxiety.

There were 12 one-hour weekly group sessions in each arm. Main outcome measuresParticipants were assessed at baseline, 1 month (after 4 sessions), 3 months (end of interventions), and 6 months. Primary outcomes were depressive scores measured by Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Thai version. Secondary outcomes were self-rated depression score and quality of life. ResultsAt 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, both <b>therapy</b> <b>groups</b> showed statistically non-significant reduction in MADRS Thai scores when compared with the control group (group counseling). The reduction was slightly greater in the active group than the receptive group. Although there were trend toward better outcomes on self-report depression and quality of life, the differences were not statistically significant.

Method: The study had a prospective, parallel-group design with permuted-block randomization. Older persons with dementia (N = 104) were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. The experimental group received 12 sessions of <b>group</b> music <b>therapy</b> (two 30 -min sessions per week for 6 weeks), and the control group received usual care.

Results: <b>Group</b> music <b>therapy</b> reduced depression in persons with dementia. Improvements in depression occurred immediately after music therapy and were apparent throughout the course of therapy. The cortisol level did not significantly decrease after the <b>group</b> music <b>therapy.</b> Cognitive function significantly improved slightly at the 6 th session, the 12 th session, and 1 month after the sessions ended; in particular, short-term recall function improved.
