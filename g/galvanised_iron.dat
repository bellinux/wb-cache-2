25|$|The initial design {{called for}} a <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> roof; this was changed to {{terracotta}} roof tiles in 1907. The resolution of unfinished design elements continues to pose challenges.|$|E
25|$|A tall metal {{flagstaff}} {{is located}} {{directly behind the}} memorial, within the enclosure. A perimeter fence of extruded <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> pipe has replaced an earlier timber fence and is not of cultural heritage significance. Mount Maroon towers in {{the distance to the}} southeast and forms a dramatic visual background to the memorial.|$|E
25|$|The station {{includes}} two cottages, constructed in 1960, timber framed, fibro clad, with <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> roofs. One of the cottages has two storeys and a closed verandah, {{while the other}} is single leveled with an open verandah. The station also comprises a winch house, stores shed, engine room and combined workshop/radio room.|$|E

50|$|This single-skin timber {{church is}} a one storey {{building}} on low concrete stumps with steeply pitched <b>galvanised</b> corrugated <b>iron</b> gable roofs. It is now prominently located facing Main Street in the Beenleigh Historical Village.|$|R
50|$|Fittings {{used for}} strong {{structures}} are <b>galvanised</b> malleable <b>iron</b> castings, {{and come in}} many styles such as elbows, tees, crosses,reducers and flanges. The fittings are not threaded; they simply lock onto the pipe with the supplied hex set screws.|$|R
25|$|The town of Smoky Bay was {{surveyed}} in 1913 {{under the name}} of Wallanippie, along with the aforementioned jetty and a Harbour's Board reserve. A large <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> goods shed and a railway line extending {{to the far end of}} the jetty were established, allowing the town to operate as a port.|$|E
25|$|Other {{structures}} in the complex include small concrete block storage sheds, adjacent {{to each of the}} houses, block work sheds around the tower, and some <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> sheds including a powerhouse, a maintenance workshop and a store. At the northern boundary of the complex lies a bore and mill, and an abandoned garden next to it. The original raised water tank {{is at the center of}} the complex.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Cape Town, the {{locomotive}} {{had to be}} dismantled {{before it could be}} landed off the brig Charles by means of lighters. The locomotive was accompanied by its engineer-driver, a Scot named William Dabbs. It was partially re-assembled on the jetty and then moved to Alfred's Square, now part of the Parade in Cape Town. There, a <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> shed was built over it and the re-assembly was completed by Dabbs.|$|E
50|$|A {{less obvious}} {{example of this}} type of {{protection}} is the process of <b>galvanising</b> <b>iron.</b> This process coats iron structures (such as fencing) with a coating of zinc metal. As long as the zinc remains intact, the iron is protected from the effects of corrosion. Inevitably, the zinc coating becomes breached, either by cracking or physical damage. Once this occurs, corrosive elements act as an electrolyte and the zinc/iron combination as electrodes. The resultant current ensures that the zinc coating is sacrificed but that the base iron does not corrode. Such a coating can protect an iron structure for a few decades, but once the protecting coating is consumed, the iron rapidly corrodes.|$|R
50|$|This {{single storey}} church is {{constructed}} of hand-made bricks, rendered internally and externally and has steep gable roofs sheeted with <b>galvanised</b> corrugated <b>iron.</b> The brick walls are strengthened with engaged brick piers visible externally. The exterior plaster is raked to suggest stone construction.|$|R
50|$|Work on the Cape York Peninsula {{section was}} {{completed}} in 1886, except for 90 km between Moreton Telegraph Station and Mein where telegrams were carried by horse and rider until the line was completed. The line consisted of <b>galvanised</b> cast <b>iron</b> poles designed to support a single wire.|$|R
25|$|The roofs are massively {{constructed}} in hardwood and bamboo, highly decorated at the eaves, and are constructed traditionally {{without the use}} of nails. They are open at the eaves to provide a ventilated storage area. They were traditionally finished with timber shingles weighted down with stones; but in almost all cases this has now been replaced with corrugated <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> roofing. The roof of Tongsa Dzong, illustrated, {{is one of the few}} shingle roofs to survive and was being restored in 2006/7.|$|E
25|$|Accommodations at {{the site}} consist of three {{lighthouse}} keeper's cottages, constructed from concrete blocks, set on high blocks with reinforced concrete beams. The cottages have timber floors and wide timber verandahs, enclosed with pivoting storm screens. The original roofing was corrugated <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron,</b> replaced by corrugated asbestos cement roofing {{in one of the}} houses. Originally, a breezeway divided the houses into two sections, one comprising three rooms and one comprising two larger rooms, with a corridor between them leading to the double doors to the verandah. The building has been altered, and the original breezeway has been converted to a living area.|$|E
25|$|The old World War II {{power house}} is a bunker-like structure, built of {{reinforced}} concrete with a small extension to the east, which was at some point used as a henhouse. The main section roof is covered with asphalt, and the extension has a pitched <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> gable roof. One rectangular opening is in the main section {{and one in the}} extension. The garage and the workshop are timber framed and fibro clad, with a gable roofs of corrugated fibro cement with metal gutters and downpipes. They have timber doors, timber floors and timber-framed louvre windows.|$|E
50|$|Kremikovtzi AD {{acquired}} 70% of the LEMIND-FPL polyester-covered {{sheet iron}} factory in Leskovac, Serbia in January 2005, for €1.4 million. The company also made another acquisition in April 2005, purchasing the Llamkos <b>galvanised</b> sheet <b>iron</b> factory in Vucitrn, Kosovo for €4.15 million. Both plants were disposed of upon Kremikovtzi's takeover by GSHL.|$|R
50|$|This {{centrally}} planned {{church is}} a cement rendered brick building with parapet walls that conceal a <b>galvanised</b> corrugated <b>iron</b> roof. It is situated on a sloping site {{on the corner of}} Upper Edward Street and Wickham Terrace, overlooking the central business district, with the main entrance on the higher Wickham Terrace side.|$|R
50|$|This {{single-storey}} timber-framed {{building is}} set on low timber and concrete stumps and clad in chamferboards. It has steeply pitched gable roofs sheeted with <b>galvanised</b> corrugated <b>iron.</b> The church is located in an established streetscape of mature trees, between two similarly scaled buildings, the Sunday School hall (1919) and the Youth Centre (1958).|$|R
25|$|During {{this period}} an RAAF unit known as No. 1 Fighter Sector RAAF {{took control of}} the Capital Hall in Bankstown. This unit was formed in Bankstown, on 25 February 1942. Their living {{quarters}} were located next door and down the road from the hall & the staff were housed in <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> barracks. Operations were handed over to the United States Army Air Corps on 10 April 1942 before they were transferred to a disused railway tunnel at St James railway station in Sydney. The unit was renamed, Air Defence Headquarters Sydney (ADHQ) on 21 January 1945 and moved into a three-storey semi-underground purpose built operations and plotting facility at Bankstown, known as the Bankstown Bunker.|$|E
25|$|In October 1942, Manuel Richard Hornibrook was {{commissioned}} by the US Army to erect four large stores at Eagle Farm, most likely hangars 4,5,6 and 7 of an igloo design. The igloo {{is a form of}} light nailed timber arch construction. These hangars were built fronting the straight six section, as a ready made apron, with hangar 7 built for the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit (ATAIU) located separately {{at the end of the}} straight. These hangars were based on the US Army 104ft span timber box frame design and were clad with <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron,</b> but when that material was restricted, terne-coated iron was used, a lead-tin coating usually used for fuel tank manufacture. There were various igloo designs, but the AWC designs were considered to be far more rugged than US designs, and were designed to have a reasonably long life under winds of up to 65 miles per hour, and used standard grade Group C hardwood timber.|$|E
25|$|For {{the third}} {{lighthouse}} {{built by the}} Queensland colonial government (Lady Elliot Island Light erected on Lady Elliott's Island in 1872/73), Colonial Architect FDG Stanley designed a structure which utilised readily available local timber, specifying a hardwood frame clad with plated iron sheeting. This reduced the cost of construction, and despite problems of termite infestation and rusting, this type of construction, or its derivative, a wooden frame with corrugated <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> sheeting, became the standard for subsequent nineteenth century Queensland lighthouses. Between 1873 and 1901, 14 lighthouses were constructed in Queensland using hardwood framing and plated iron sheeting, and another 7 were constructed with hardwood frames and corrugated iron cladding. The latter were associated mostly with harbour entrances and included: Little Sea Hill Light (1876 – relocated); Grassy Hill Light (1886 – active); Goods Island Light (1886 – active); Bay Rock Light (1886 – inactive – relocated); Caloundra Head Light (1896 – inactive); North Point Hummock Light (1899 – demolished); Gatcombe Head Light (1900 – demolished). An eighth lighthouse of this type, Bulwer Island Light, was constructed at Bulwer Island in the Brisbane River in 1912, but is now inactive has been relocated.|$|E
50|$|In 1987-88 the Brisbane City Council {{undertook}} restorative and {{renovation work}} which included {{interior and exterior}} painting in heritage colours, repair and repointing of the exterior brickwork, re-roofing and recladding of the hall walls with <b>galvanised</b> corrugated <b>iron,</b> replacement of timbers in the pediment, and opening up of the northern verandah, which had been enclosed by this date.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} has timber French doors and sash windows. The balcony has a {{cast-iron}} balustrade, and <b>galvanised</b> sheet <b>iron</b> columns with cast zinc bases and capitals, and a convex corrugated iron awning. The parapet above the awning has a cornice with dentil blocks, a pediment over the corner, and three shaped gables embellished with spheres.|$|R
50|$|The Main Building, which housed {{most of the}} exhibits, {{occupied}} an area of Kelvingrove Park {{between the}} River Kelvin and Sandyford Street which {{is now on the}} route of Sauchiehall Street. It featured a 170 ft high Dome erected on an iron framework covered in <b>galvanised</b> sheet <b>iron.</b> Four octagonal supporting towers around the Dome were made of brick, with minarets on top.|$|R
500|$|Sharan {{tested a}} wide range of {{materials}} and got good results from <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> and aluminium sheets, but found that sheets of the special plastic developed by the OPUR just [...] thick generally worked even better than the metal sheets and were less expensive. The plastic film, known as OPUR foil, is hydrophilic and is made from polyethylene mixed with titanium dioxide and barium sulphate.|$|E
2500|$|... two sitting rooms, two kitchens, and a store room. They are {{constructed}} of a timber frame with <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> roof. The external walls {{are covered with}} corrugated <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> sheets.|$|E
2500|$|The church {{originally}} had a tower with a spire above it, probably {{built in the}} 15th century, but this spire fell down in 1803, damaging the church and destroying a peal of bells. A new stone spire was built, octagonal in shape, and described in 1862 as covered with <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron.</b> [...] In 1907/08 a new tower and spire were built from the foundations, designed by John Oldrid Scott.|$|E
5000|$|The {{single storey}} western {{extension}} {{at the rear}} is rectangular, with a corrugated iron stove recess at the north end, with an iron stove chimney. There is a door in the north elevation and a timber-framed window in the west side elevation. It is clad with 8" [...] deep chamferboards and has a <b>galvanised</b> corrugated <b>iron</b> hipped roof. It appears to be of an early date.|$|R
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the lighthouse}} base {{is made of}} bolted cast iron segments, [...] in diameter and [...] high. The tower is [...] from the base to the lantern, conical in shape, with four intermediate floor levels. It is built of an internal timber frame, clad with <b>galvanised</b> wrought <b>iron</b> plates, painted white. On {{top of the tower}} is a Chance Brothers [...] diameter lantern, housing the VRB-25 beacon. The dome of the lantern is painted red.|$|R
50|$|A {{single-storeyed}} timber building set on low timber stumps with a pitched <b>galvanised</b> corrugated <b>iron</b> roof the Cactoblastis Hall {{is situated}} on the southwestern side of the Warrego Highway 12 kilometres southeast of Chinchilla. Set back about 35 m from the highway the building, approximately square in plan, consists of a central dance room with adjoining aisles on the southeastern and northwestern sides. The dance room has a simple gable roof which changes pitch to form shallower skillion roofs over the aisles.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} across your milking-stool, I estimate, some {{thirteen}} times," [...] I told her. I fetched it from where I had left it, {{and gave it}} to her; and we filed out in procession; Veronica with a <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> bucket bringing up the rear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said he, [...] "a 'Man About Town' {{something}} between a 'rounder' and a 'clubman.' He isn't exactly--well, he fits in between Mrs. Fish's receptions and private boxing bouts. He doesn't--well, he doesn't belong {{either to the}} Lotos Club or to the Jerry McGeogheghan <b>Galvanised</b> <b>Iron</b> Workers' Apprentices' Left Hook Chowder Association. I don't exactly know how to describe him to you. You'll see him everywhere there's anything doing. Yes, I suppose he's a type. Dress clothes every evening; knows the ropes; calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first names. No; he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives. You generally see him alone or with another man." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{it is with}} {{everything}} at Blossholme, a place that Time has touched but lightly. The fields, or many of them, bear the same names and remain identical in their shape and outline. The old farmsteads and the few halls in which reside the gentry of the district, stand where they always stood. The glorious tower of the Abbey still points upwards to the sky, although bells and roof are gone, while half-a-mile away the parish church that was there before it--having been rebuilt indeed upon Saxon foundations {{in the days of}} William Rufus--yet lies among its ancient elms. Farther on, situate upon the slope of a vale down which runs a brook through meadows, is the stark ruin of the old Nunnery that was subservient to the proud Abbey on the hill, some of it now roofed in with <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> sheets and used as cow-sheds.|$|E
50|$|A <b>galvanised</b> {{corrugated}} <b>iron,</b> elongated {{maize elevator}} tower straddles {{the roofs of}} the four silos. The tower is accessed through a passageway under the silos which is still present, and {{this leads to a}} ladder attached to the exterior wall. This passageway also houses the elevators for carrying the maize to the top of silos. The entrance to this passageway is located inside the maize receiving shed and is accessed via a wooden ladder. The subsurface areas and passageway were not accessed.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the lighthouse}} base {{is made of}} bolted cast iron segments, 13 m in diameter and 4.6 m high. The tower is 18 m from the base to the lantern, conical in shape, with four intermediate floor levels. It is built of an internal timber frame, clad with <b>galvanised</b> wrought <b>iron</b> plates, painted white. On {{top of the tower}} is a Chance Brothers 10 ft diameter lantern, housing the VRB-25 beacon. The dome of the lantern is painted red.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{extension}} on {{the east}} side is elongated with two windows in the east side elevation. It is clad with fibrous-cement sheeting, with a <b>galvanised</b> corrugated <b>iron</b> mono-pitch roof running down to form a valley gutter with the extension on the west side. There is a small lean-to extension at the northern end of this extension, also clad in fibrous-cement sheeting, with a window in the western side wall. There are two lean-to corrugated iron roofs running off these two single-storey extensions at the rear.|$|R
