40|$|The cork {{industry}} {{presents itself}} {{as one of}} the most entrepreneurial in the Portuguese industrial sector, contributing significantly to the increase of exports. However, it’s an industry in which the use of raw materials is maximised leaving a large volume of waste. The cork industry has tried to take advantage of these residues, mainly through direct energy recovery, despite the technical and safety difficulties presented by the use of such low density material, which complicates and hinders its transportation for industrial uses outside the area in which it is produced. The densification process opens new doors for such use and also for its storage, because it produces better results when compared with other more common products, such as wood sawdust or even forest and agricultural waste. Thus, cork pellets emerge as a safer and more easily transportable alternative for energy recovery from cork dust and other <b>granulated</b> types of <b>cork</b> waste, which offer the prospects for wider use. The results demonstrate that cork pellets have higher calorific value when compared with other biomass pellets; typically, approximately 20 MJ/kg with 3 % volume of ashes, which is equivalent to that obtained from the combustion of pellets produced from combined forest and agricultural waste with a bulk density of 750 kg/m 3, which offers real advantages in terms of logistics...|$|R

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study on}} the {{viability}} of the use and on the performance of thermal insulating solutions of buildings based on loose-fill lightweight granular materials. Selected products included expanded polystyrene, clay and vermiculite granules, and also others which use represents a way of recycling and adding value to waste and byproducts of several industries, such as <b>granulated</b> and regranulated <b>cork</b> and polystyrene, and autoclave cellular concrete granules. This experimental research had two components: one developed in the testing laboratory and the other on site. Laboratory testing was concerned with the fundamental properties to the viability of selected materials, namely, thermal conductivity, water and fire behaviour, settling under vibration, corrosiveness and fungal attack resistance. On site evaluation of the performance of real solutions was centered on three test cells that have been built and monitored, in order to enable the study of the application conditions, thermal resistance, hygrothermal behaviour and displacements suffered by granular thermal insulting layers aspects of the test cells performance related with the presence of the insulting materials have also been studied, such as heating energy consumption, thermal inertia and hygrothermal conditions of constructions solutions and ambiences.

40|$|The use of soil {{construction}} {{dates back}} to the beginning of our civilization. In the South of Portugal there is still a large number of buildings with rammed earth walls, but this technology has been falling into disuse since the middle of last century. The earth construction is highly sustainable since earth is a local material and is 100 % reusable. The buildings with rammed earth walls have a high thermal inertia which, given the climate characteristics Portugal, enjoys its thermal behavior. However, it is desirable that the thermal conductivity of the rammed earth were lower. Environmental concerns related to energy consumption associated with comfort in housing and construction, transportation and application of materials used in construction, has led us to seek new solutions in building typologies on earth. Considering these aspects and aiming to improve the energy efficiency in buildings with rammed earth walls, this paper presents the results of tests performed in laboratory to characterize phisical properties of several compositions containing soil and expanded <b>granulated</b> <b>cork.</b> Compositions were considered soil and expanded <b>granulated</b> <b>cork</b> having the following percentages of expanded <b>granulated</b> <b>cork,</b> 0 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 %. In order to characterize the different compositions from the point of view of mechanical and thermal performance, cubes were produced with 10 centimeters edge and assayed in order to calculate its compression resistance and its thermal conductivity. The results showed that the use of this type of building typologies on earth with the incorporation of expanded <b>granulated</b> <b>cork</b> allows to increase your performance by making it possible to adapt this typology needs of today, including the demands of the Portuguese legislation.

40|$|Biosorbents {{have been}} {{recently}} gaining importance, with {{an increasing number}} of publications on their environmental applications, especially for removal of organic pollutants from aqueous media. The aim of this work was to evaluate the sorption capacity of a biosorbent, namely <b>granulated</b> <b>cork,</b> to remove mixtures of ibuprofen (IB), carbamazepine (CB) and clofibric acid (CA) from water and wastewater. High removal efficiencies were attained for IB and CB while a less satisfactory performance was observed for CA. Simultaneous removal of the three compounds mixed in the same aqueous solution showed no significant differences in comparison to the removal of the isolated compounds in separate solutions, which indicates that no competitive sorption effects occurred at the highest concentrations tested. On the other hand, in wastewater medium the mixture of pharmaceuticals underwent a decrease in the sorbed amounts of all the three substances, probably due to the presence of dissolved organic matter which increases their solubilities. These compounds were removed in the following order of efficiencies in all the tested conditions: IB 4 CB 4 CA. The sorption kinetics were characterised by an initial fast step within the first 6 h, during which most of the removed pharmaceuticals amounts were sorbed. After the first 6 h, CA attained equilibrium concentrations whereas the sorption kinetics for IB and CB were characterised by two pseudo-second order stages, the first one up to 48 h and a slower one beyond 48 h. Shorter equilibration times and larger removed amounts of pharmaceuticals per unit weight of sorbent were observed in this study for <b>granulated</b> <b>cork</b> in comparison with a previously studied clay material (LECA).

40|$|Most {{construction}} materials require {{large amounts of}} energy for production and transportation purposes and are also asso- ciated {{with high levels of}} greenhouse gas emissions. One such material, rammed earth, has the advantage of being reusable and extremely durable, while it can also be locally sourced. However, rammed earth walls have a low thermal resistance. The aim {{of this study is to}} improve the thermal performance of rammed earth walls by increasing their thermal resistance. To this end, a range of different percentages and particle sizes of expanded <b>granulated</b> <b>cork</b> were added to rammed earth samples. The thermal conductivity of the samples was then determined in the laboratory and the data obtained were used to calculate heat transfer coefficients for a model rammed earth wall. Finally, the samples were subjected to uniaxial compression tests to determine whether the added cork led to a reduction in compressive strength. It was found that adding 10 % <b>granulated</b> <b>cork</b> produced a reduction of about 12 % in the heat transfer coefficient of a rammed earth wall with a thickness of 0. 60 m, while the 28 % reduction in compressive strength recorded is within the limits set out in the relevant standards...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the need}} for using more {{sustainable}} constructive solutions, an innovative composite material based {{on a combination of}} distinct industrial by-products is proposed aiming to reduce waste and energy consumption in the production of construction materials.

The adsorption {{studies were carried out}} using a batch equilibrium technique. A gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) was used to analyze α-cypermethrin after solid phase extraction with C 18 disks. Physical properties including real density, pore volume, surface area and pore diameter of cork were evaluated by mercury porosimetry. Characterization of cork particles showed variations thereby indicating the highly heterogeneous structure of the material. The average surface area of cork particles was lower than that of GAC. Kinetics adsorption studies allowed the determination of the equilibrium time— 24 hours for both cork (1 – 2 mm and 3 – 4 mm) and GAC. For the studied α-cypermethrin concentration range, GAC revealed to be a better sorbent. However, adsorption parameters for equilibrium concentrations, obtained through the Langmuir and Freundlich models, showed that <b>granulated</b> <b>cork</b> 1 – 2 mm have the maximum amount of adsorbed α-cypermethrin (qm) (303 μg/g); followed by GAC (186 μg/g) and cork 3 - 4 mm (136 μg/g). The standard deviation (SD) values, demonstrate that Freundlich model better describes the α-cypermethrin adsorption phenomena on GAC, while α-cypermethrin adsorption on cork (1 - 2 mm and 3 - 4 mm) is better described by the Langmuir. In view of the adsorption results obtained in this study it appears that <b>granulated</b> <b>cork</b> may be a better and a cheaper alternative to GAC for removing α-cypermethrin from water...|$|E

40|$|Cork is {{the bark}} of Quercus suber tree. This bark has an amazing number of {{possible}} uses, particularly {{for the production of}} cork stoppers. Metals in cork can come from different sources; it could be from the field or the different industrial process that the cork suffers before the transformation to the final product [1]. There are different types of corks such as natural cork that is a 100 % natural product, agglomerated stoppers which can be manufactured by individual moulding or extrusion, and in both methods, the agglutinated substance used to connect the cork granules is approved for the use in food contact materials. These stoppers are entirely made from <b>granulated</b> <b>cork</b> from sub-products from the production of natural cork. In the present work, cork samples from different steps of the industry process were analysed. The following chemical elements were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) : Vanadium (V), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Selenium (Se), Lead (Pb), Cobalt (Co), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Manganese (Mn) and Strontium (Sr). The method for sample preparation of cork stoppers consisted on grinding and homogenizing samples, followed by an acid-assisted microwave digestion to destroy the organic matrix. For quality control purposes parameters such as repeatability, linearity of the calibration curve, blanks or recovery of spiked samples were monitored and complied with the acceptance criteria established by the laboratory. Several elements were present in the samples in amounts above the quantification limits (ppb or ppt level). However, and according to European legislation [2], the total amount of the elements found was always below the maximum limit. We may conclude that there’s no contamination of the chemical elements during the manufacturing process of agglomerated cork stoppers...|$|E
