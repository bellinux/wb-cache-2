50|$|Alloying of {{the solid}} metal alters its LME. Some {{alloying}} elements may increase the severity while others may prevent LME. The action of the alloying element {{is known to be}} segregation to grain boundaries {{of the solid}} metal and alteration of the grain boundary properties. Accordingly, maximum LME is seen in cases where alloy additions elements have saturated the grain boundaries of the solid metal. The hardness and deformation behaviour of the solid metal affect its susceptibility to LME. Generally, harder metals are more severely embrittled. Grain size greatly influences LME. Solids with larger grains are more severely embrittled and the fracture stress varies inversely with the square root of grain diameter. Also the brittle to <b>ductile</b> <b>transition</b> temperature is increased by increasing grain size.|$|E
50|$|By {{weakening}} the crust in a localized area, a preferential region of strain can develop concentrating {{the flow of}} material. Ductile rocks deeper in the crust {{will be able to}} move towards the potential gradient, whereas brittle rocks near the surface will fracture when subject to increased strain. The transition between brittle deformation and ductile deformation is determined by the temperature which is generally controlled by depth as well as rheology. Weak hot minerals, below the <b>ductile</b> <b>transition,</b> with significant partial melt move into the area underlying the thinned crust {{as a result of the}} pressure gradient being decreased in the thin area. At a certain point, the pressure will decrease substantially moving from convergent basement rock into thinned crust. This causes rapid decompression at relatively stable and raised isotherms. Decompression melting occurs, which increases the proportion of partial melt within the material and causes rapid heat advection towards the surface. Continued convergent plate movement focuses the flow of material into the syntaxial areas with the localized weakness permitting upward escape as an accommodation mechanism. This process solves the fundamental problem of material being forced into a confined space by creating an outlet. The result of which creates a positive feedback with erosion focusing uplift which transports more weak rock vertically enhancing erosive capabilities. Areas of consistent elevation in river valleys and mountains with relief can be maintained by high exhumation rates of relatively young weak rocks. The ages of minerals in the area will be younger than the surrounding crust due to cooling occurring in an area with a steeper thermal gradient at shallower depths. Mature tectonic aneurysm systems, such as the Nanga Parbat, can have very high local reliefs of young rocks due to consistent erosion maintaining the elevation in the erosive area and vertical strain forcing material up along the proximal edges.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe brittle versus <b>ductile</b> <b>transition</b> for {{conventional}} metals is {{dictated by the}} competition between dislocation emission and cleavage. For nanocrystalline metals with grain size below 25 nm, however, dislocation activities are suppressed and the classic theory fails to apply. In this paper, one of the competing mechanisms that control the brittle versus <b>ductile</b> <b>transition</b> of nanocrystalline metals {{is found to be}} the grain boundary dominated creep deformation versus the grain boundary decohesion. A model is proposed to quantify the crack propagation in nanocrystalline metals. The effects of material properties, initial configuration and applied loads on the property of crack propagation are addressed. It is concluded that either the increases in the initial crack length, the applied load and the grain boundary damage, or the deterrence in creep deformation, accelerate the crack propagation, and vice versa...|$|E

40|$|The Fatigue Ductile–Brittle Transition (FDBT) is a {{phenomenon}} similar to the fracture <b>ductile</b> to brittle <b>transition,</b> in which the fracture mode of the fatigue cracks changes from ductile transgranular to cleavage and/or grain boundary separation.

On the basis of extensive numerical simulations of the response to pulling the material boundaries at a constant speed we offer an explanation of the onset of ductility via the increase in the density of plastic modes as a function of the potential cutoff length. Finally we can resolve an old riddle: in experiments brittle materials can be strained under grip boundary conditions, and exhibit a dynamic crack when cut with a sufficiently long initial slot. Mysteriously, in molecular dynamics simulations it appeared that cracks refused to propagate dynamically under grip boundary conditions, and continuous pulling was necessary to achieve fracture. We argue that this mystery is removed when one understands the distinction between brittle and ductile athermal amorphous materials. Comment: 5 pages 7 figure...|$|E
