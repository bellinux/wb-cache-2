40|$|<b>Feed</b> forward <b>control</b> {{is widely}} used to reduce {{disturbances}} effects on the controlled variables but in some processes {{it may be difficult}} to measure disturbances. This situation will prevent the utilization of <b>feed</b> forward <b>control</b> scheme. To overcome this problem, multi-variable inferential <b>feed</b> forward <b>control</b> strategy is proposed. This is partucylarly useful when disturbances cannot easily or economically be measured. In this strategy, the effects of disturbances on controlled process variables are inferred from the uncontrolled process variables (direct measurements of disturbances are not needed). Theoretically, it will improve control performance over conventional feedback PID control.

40|$|Since 1954, many {{laboratories}} {{have used}} intracranial microinjection techniques to acutely <b>control</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior in experimental animals. Few, however, have documented {{the locations of}} their effective and ineffective injection sites within the brain, and even fewer have plotted the locations of these sites within a neuroanatomical reference atlas space. Without such an anatomical framework, it is a formidable challenge to be certain about the neuroanatomical substrates affected by experimentally delivered chemicals to <b>control</b> <b>feeding.</b> A lack of anatomical resolution in such experiments has limited their utility. However, publishing maps from legacy datasets of previously unreported histology could help the scientific community extract meaningful data from otherwise hard-to-interpret studies. In this review, {{a brief history of}} central microinjection studies examining acute <b>feeding</b> <b>control</b> is first presented. In particular, studies that include published histology of injection sites mapped to a reference atlas are highlighted, and the lasting value of these older studies is emphasized. I then discuss how using a few simple procedures, behavioral neuroscientists studying <b>feeding</b> <b>control</b> can use atlas-based mapping techniques to bring their microinjection studies into anatomical registration with those of other laboratories. To illustrate this concept, I show how mapping injection sites within the Swanson rat brain atlas will allow scientists to understand the architecture of the affected regions situated beneath their injections. This is because a richly annotated and curated dataset of rat brain connections within the Swanson atlas reference space is available online, which can be placed in direct register with any <b>feeding</b> <b>control</b> sites mapped within this atlas. Finally, similar mapping strategies can be employed for studies using recently developed optogenetic and chemicogenetic methods, particularly within the context of activated neuron populations in the mouse brain. It is anticipated that atlas-based mapping will be a critical step towards community-based sharing of data on <b>feeding</b> <b>control</b> circuits, and will accelerate our understanding of structure-function relationships in the brain for mammalian models of obesity and metabolic disorders...|$|R

25|$|Taurine is an {{essential}} dietary requirement for feline health, since house cats (and {{all members of the}} cat family) cannot synthesize the compound. The absence of taurine causes a cat's retina to slowly degenerate, causing eye problems and (eventually) irreversible blindnessâ€“ a condition known as central retinal degeneration (CRD), as well as hair loss and tooth decay. Decreased plasma taurine concentration has been demonstrated to be associated with feline dilated cardiomyopathy. Unlike CRD, the condition is reversible with supplementation. Taurine is now a requirement of the Association of American <b>Feed</b> <b>Control</b> Officials (AAFCO) and any dry or wet food product labeled approved by the AAFCO should have a minimum of 0.1% taurine in dry food and 0.2% in wet food.|$|E

Study design: A prospective study of early oral feeding after laryngectomy, compared with retrospective, historical delayed <b>feeding</b> <b>controls.</b> Method: Forty patients underwent total laryngectomy for advanced {{carcinoma of the}} larynx with or without hypopharyngeal involvement, not requiring tongue base resection or myocutaneous flaps, and were commenced on oral feeding on the second post-operative day. Thirty-nine laryngectomy patients previously managed in the same unit who had received conventional, delayed oral <b>feeding</b> served as <b>controls.</b> Results: Pharyngocutaneous fistulae developed in 20 per cent of the early feeding patients, compared with 15. 4 per cent of the delayed oral <b>feeding</b> <b>controls</b> (p 0. 592).

Analysis of variance and Duncanâ€™s multiple range test were used to analyze data. The research results revealed that using Pomacea canaliculata snails in duck feed had a significant effect (P< 0. 05) towards the physical characteristics (water holding capacity, cooking loss, and tenderness), and chemical characteristics of Alabio duck meat (water, protein, collagen, fat, and cholesterol content). However, there was no significant effect towards meat pH.

40|$|Intracranial {{chemical}} injection (ICI) {{methods have been}} used to identify the locations in the brain where feeding behavior can be controlled acutely. Scientists conducting ICI studies often document their injection site locations, thereby leaving kernels of valuable location data for others to use to further characterize <b>feeding</b> <b>control</b> circuits. Unfortunately, this rich dataset has not yet been formally contextualized with other published neuroanatomical data. In particular, axonal tracing studies have delineated several neural circuits originating in the same areas where ICI injection feeding-control sites have been documented, but it remains unclear whether these circuits participate in <b>feeding</b> <b>control.</b> However, comparing injection sites with other types of location data requires careful anatomical registration between the datasets. Here, a conceptual framework is presented for how such anatomical registration efforts can be performed. For example, by using a simple atlas alignment tool, a hypothalamic locus sensitive to the orexigenic effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) can be aligned accurately with the locations of neurons labeled by anterograde tracers or those known to express NPY receptors or feeding-related peptides. This approach can also be applied to those intracranial gene-directed injection (IGI) methods (e. g., site-specific recombinase methods, RNA expression or interference, optogenetics and pharmacosynthetics) that involve viral injections to targeted neuronal populations. Spatial alignment efforts can be accelerated if location data from ICI/IGI methods are mapped to stereotaxic brain atlases to allow powerful neuroinformatics tools to overlay different types of data in the same reference space. Atlas-based mapping will be critical for community-based sharing of location data for <b>feeding</b> <b>control</b> circuits, and will accelerate our understanding of structure-function relationships in the brain for mammalian models of obesity and metabolic disorders...|$|R
