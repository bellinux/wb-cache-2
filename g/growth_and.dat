40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between <b>growth</b> opportunities <b>and</b> debt of quoted Portuguese companies using various panel estimators. The results show a cubic relationship between <b>growth</b> opportunities <b>and</b> debt. When companies' growth opportunities are low and high, {{the relationship between}} <b>growth</b> opportunities <b>and</b> debt is positive. For intermediate levels of growth opportunities, the results show {{the existence of a}} negative relationship between <b>growth</b> opportunities <b>and</b> debt. These results suggest that the relationship between companies' <b>growth</b> opportunities <b>and</b> debt is influenced by complex aspects in companies' capital structure decisions. The empirical results suggest that creditors recognize high growth opportunities when such opportunities exist, and debt is a way to discipline managers' actions in the presence of low investment opportunities. For intermediate levels of growth opportunities, the subinvestment problems seem to be relevant in explaining the relationship between <b>growth</b> opportunities <b>and</b> debt.

Two out of 46 samples showed a significant negative correlation between <b>growth</b> rate <b>and</b> multi-locus heterozygosity; none showed a significant positive correlation. There was no overall tendency to negative or positive correlations. The largest sample (N= 689) showed no relationship between multi-locus heterozygosity <b>and</b> <b>growth</b> rate, although one of the five loci, Gpdh- 1, showed a significant positive correlation. The only significant correlation in the next largest sample (N= 248) was between multi-locus heterozygosity <b>and</b> <b>growth</b> rate, <b>and</b> that was negative. Fish of intermediate growth rate were not significantly different in heterozygosity from faster or slower growing fish. There was no relationship between variability in <b>growth</b> rate <b>and</b> multi-locus heterozygosity. These findings are discussed in the context of similar surveys from other species, and the conclusion drawn that the universality of a positive relationship between <b>growth</b> rate <b>and</b> multi-locus heterozygosity remains to be established...|$|R
