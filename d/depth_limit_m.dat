The dataset (comma-delimited ascii file) comprises the following fields: 1. 	record number 2. 	date-time (GMT) 3. 	date-time (AEST) 4. 	latitude (signed decimal degrees) 5. 	longitude (decimal degrees) 6. 	speed over ground (knots) 7. 	depth (m) 8. 	seabed roughness (v) 9. 	hardness (v) Indices of roughness and hardness (from the first and second echoes respectively) were obtained using a SeaScan™ 100 system (un-referenced) on board the Research Vessel Tom Marshall, with the ship’s Furuno FCV 1100 echo sounder and 1 kW, 50 kHz transducer. Generally vessel speed was kept below about 14 kt (typically 12 kt), and the echo-sounder range set to 80 m. The data were filtered to remove errors due to data drop-out, straying beyond system <b>depth</b> <b>limits</b> (min. 10 <b>m),</b> or transducer interference...|$|R

The new sphere was designed, and then forged, from solid titanium ingots, in two equal halves, at Ladish Forge, Cudahy, Wisconsin, and then the 15.5 tonnes of titanium was machined and assembled, utilizing five view ports (instead of the current three) and is designed for depths of over 6000 m, where Alvins constructed <b>depth</b> <b>limit</b> was 4500 <b>m.</b> This, along with a general upgrade of support systems, instruments and materials, will allow Alvin to reach 98% of the ocean floor. After one last dive to assess damage to the Gulf of Mexico's seafloor after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, Alvin will be refitted starting January 2011, with an expected return to the ocean in 2012 and full depth potential achieved in 2015.|$|R
40|$|Shallow water zooxanthellate {{coral reefs}} grade into ecologically {{distinct}} mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) {{deeper in the}} euphotic zone. MCEs are widely considered to start at an absolute <b>depth</b> <b>limit</b> of 30 <b>m</b> deep, possibly failing to recognise that these are distinct ecological communities that may shift shallower or deeper depending on local environmental conditions. This study aimed to explore whether MCEs represent distinct biological communities, the upper boundary {{of which can be}} defined and whether the depth at which they occur may vary above or below 30 m. Mixed-gas diving and closed-circuit rebreathers were used to quantitatively survey benthic communities across shallow to mesophotic reef gradients around the island of Utila, Honduras. Depths of up to 85 m were sampled, covering the vertical range of the zooxanthellate corals around Utila. We investigate vertical reef zonation using a variety of ecological metrics to identify community shifts with depth, and the appropriateness of different metrics to define the upper MCE boundary. Patterns observed in scleractinian community composition varied between ordination analyses and approaches utilising biodiversity indices. Indices and richness approaches revealed vertical community transition was a gradation. Ordination approaches suggest the possibility of recognising two scleractinian assemblages. We could detect a mesophotic and shallow community while illustrating that belief in a static <b>depth</b> <b>limit</b> is biologically unjustified. The switch between these two communities occurred across bathymetric gradients as small as 10 m and as large as 50 m in depth. The difference between communities appears to be a loss of shallow specialists and increase in depth-generalist taxa. Therefore, {{it may be possible to}} define MCEs by a loss of shallow specialist species. To support a biological definition of mesophotic reefs, we advocate this analytical framework should be applied around the Caribbean and extended into other ocean basins where MCEs are present...|$|R

40|$|Optical imaging, {{providing}} physiologically specific optical absorption, scattering, polarization, {{and molecular}} contrasts with nonionizing radiation, is a promising tool for medical diagnosis. Moreover, it complements the established nonoptical clinical modalities (e. g., magnetic resonance imaging, x-ray computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and ultrasound imaging) by providing insights at the cell and organelle levels (Figure 11. 1). However, in vivo optical imaging is challenging due to strong tissue scattering and absorption. There are two fundamental <b>depth</b> <b>limits</b> for pure optical imaging. The first is near one transport {{mean free path}} (TMFP), the depth dimension of the quasiballistic regime in biological tissues (1 mm; yellow dashed line in Figure 11. 1). To reach the depth of one TMFP, incident photons may undergo as many as tens of scattering events, which disable effective optical focusing. Thus, TMPF presents as the soft <b>depth</b> <b>limit</b> (also called the diffusion limit) for all ballistic optical microscopy (e. g., confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy [TPM], and optical coherence tomography [OCT]). The second <b>depth</b> <b>limit</b> is around 5 - 7 cm (red dashed line in Figure 11. 1), which corresponds to a 43 dB one-way decay in light intensity. Beyond this limit, {{referred to as the}} hard <b>depth</b> <b>limit</b> for all optical imaging modalities, there are simply not enough photons to provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{programming}} has {{highlighted the}} problem of bloat, the uncontrolled growth of the average size of an individual in the population. The most common {{approach to dealing with}} bloat in tree-based genetic programming individuals is to limit their max-imal allowed depth. An alternative to <b>depth</b> <b>limiting</b> is to punish individuals in some way based on excess size, and our experiments have shown that the combination of <b>depth</b> <b>limiting</b> with such a punitive method is generally more effective than either alone. Which such combinations are most effective at reducing bloat? In this article we augment <b>depth</b> <b>limiting</b> with nine bloat control methods and compare them with one another. These methods are chosen from past literature and from techniques of our own devising. esting with four genetic programming problems, we identify where each bloat control method performs well on a per-problem basis, and under what set-tings various methods are effective independent of problem. We report on the results of these tests, and discover an unexpected winner in the cross-platform category. ...|$|R

50|$|For {{applications}} of DFS {{in relation to}} specific domains, such as searching for solutions in artificial intelligence or web-crawling, the graph to be traversed is often either too large to visit in its entirety or infinite (DFS may suffer from non-termination). In such cases, search is only performed to a limited depth; due to limited resources, such as memory or disk space, one typically does not use data structures {{to keep track of}} the set of all previously visited vertices. When search is performed to a <b>limited</b> <b>depth,</b> the time is still linear in terms of the number of expanded vertices and edges (although this number is not the same as the size of the entire graph because some vertices may be searched more than once and others not at all) but the space complexity of this variant of DFS is only proportional to the <b>depth</b> <b>limit,</b> and as a result, is much smaller than the space needed for searching to the same depth using breadth-first search. For such applications, DFS also lends itself much better to heuristic methods for choosing a likely-looking branch. When an appropriate <b>depth</b> <b>limit</b> is not known a priori, iterative deepening depth-first search applies DFS repeatedly with a sequence of increasing limits. In the artificial intelligence mode of analysis, with a branching factor greater than one, iterative deepening increases the running time by only a constant factor over the case in which the correct <b>depth</b> <b>limit</b> is known due to the geometric growth of the number of nodes per level.|$|R
