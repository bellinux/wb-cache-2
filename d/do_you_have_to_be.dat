500|$|According to Diefenbaker biographer Smith, the Conservative MP quietly admired Mackenzie King for his {{political}} skills. However, Diefenbaker proved a gadfly and an annoyance to Mackenzie King. Angered by the words of Diefenbaker and fellow Conservative MP Howard Green in seeking to censure the government, the Prime Minister referred to Conservative MPs as [...] "a mob". When Diefenbaker accompanied two other Conservative leaders to a briefing by Mackenzie King on the war, the Prime Minister exploded at Diefenbaker (a constituent of his), [...] "What business <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here? You strike me to the heart every time you speak." ...|$|E
500|$|Indiana Congressman Charles Halleck {{gave the}} nominating speech for Willkie {{on the evening}} of June 26, arguing that Willkie's recent {{conversion}} to the Republican Party was no reason not to nominate him, [...] "is the Republican Party a closed corporation? [...] <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> born into it?" [...] When Halleck mentioned Willkie's name, there were initially boos from some delegates, but they were quickly drowned out by those in the public balconies, who thunderously chanted, [...] "We want Willkie!". Pryor had cut ticket allocations to delegations that were not for Willkie, and distributed thousands of standing room passes to Willkie partisans. The vocal support for Willkie among spectators led to complaints that other campaigns had been shorted in the distribution of tickets, but provided one of the convention's most dramatic moments.|$|E
2500|$|Both [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice" [...] {{and second}} single [...] "Everybody Knows" [...] were largely ignored by U.S. country radio {{and failed to}} {{penetrate}} the top 35 of the Hot Country Songs chart. [...] In June 2006, Emily Robison noted {{the lack of support}} from other country music performers: [...] "A lot of artists cashed in on being against what we said or what we stood for because that was promoting their career, which was a horrible thing to do. ... A lot of pandering started going on, and you'd see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism." [...] Maines commented, [...] "The entire country may disagree with me, but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country ... I don't see why people care about patriotism." [...] In Europe, however, the two singles were well received by country radio, peaking at Nos. 13 and 11 respectively and remaining on the European Country Charts for more than 20 weeks each.|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Warwick {{recorded}} the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) benefit single [...] "That's What Friends Are For" [...] alongside Gladys Knight, Elton John and Stevie Wonder. The single, credited to [...] "Dionne and Friends", {{was released in}} October and eventually raised over three million dollars for that cause. The tune was a triple #1 — R, Adult Contemporary, and four weeks at the summit on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1986 — selling close to two million 45s in the United States alone. [...] "Working against AIDS, especially after years of raising money for work on many blood-related diseases such as sickle-cell anemia, seemed {{the right thing to}} <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> granite not to want to help people with AIDS, because the devastation that it causes is so painful to see. I was so hurt to see my friend die with such agony," [...] Warwick told the Washington Post in 1988. [...] "I am tired of hurting and it does hurt." [...] The single won the performers the NARAS Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, as well as Song of the Year for its writers, Bacharach and Bayer Sager. It also was ranked by Billboard magazine as the most popular song of 1986. With this single Warwick also released her most successful album of the 1980s, titled Friends, which reached #12 on Billboard's album chart.|$|E

I know you had hard luck, suddenly finding yourself without money and all that, but, good heavens, everybody else in the world who has ever done anything has been broke at one time or another. It's part of the fun. You'll never get anywhere by letting yourself be picked up by the family like... like a floppy Newfoundland puppy and dumped down in any old place that happens to suit them. A job's a thing you've got to choose for yourself and get for yourself. Think what you can do--there must be something--and then go at it with a snort and grab it and hold it down and teach it to take a joke. You've managed to collect some money. It will give you time to look round. And, when you've had a look round, do something! Try to realize you're alive, and try to imagine the family isn't!" ...|$|E

Without pausing for an ethical second, the bold justice from West Virginia said, “Money, my man, money. ” This is the realist backdrop or subtext for much of the discussion about Caperton and also White.
