500|$|A {{sequel to}} her first {{greatest}} hits album, The Immaculate Collection (1990), GHV2 included fifteen singles released during Madonna's second decade in the recording industry, starting from [...] "Erotica" [...] (1992) to [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] (2001). Unlike the former release, GHV2 did not feature any new material. In an interview with BBC's Jo Whiley, Madonna spoke about {{the selection of the}} tracks, [...] "I only wanted songs that I could listen to five times in a row." [...] She also added that [...] "If you listen to the record, you can really see my evolution as a singer, songwriter, and, more important, a human being." [...] Madonna felt that because it was a [...] "greatest hits", it should only contain previously released hit songs. Several of her popular singles of that period were excluded from the album. Despite being a worldwide number-one hit in 2000, [...] "American Pie" [...] was not included because Madonna had regretted putting it on her eighth studio album, Music (2000). [...] "It was something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing, but it didn't belong on the album so now it's being punished... My gut told me not to , but I did it and then I regretted it so <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> reason it didn't deserve a place on GHV2." [...] she said. Other notable exclusions were [...] "This Used to Be My Playground", [...] "Rain", [...] "I'll Remember" [...] and [...] "You'll See"—all of which had been included on her ballads compilation Something to Remember (1995).|$|E

500|$|The novel {{begins with}} the fourteen-year-old Norman McGregor {{packaging}} {{a loaf of bread}} for his uncle, the [...] "village wit", – who ironically nicknames him [...] "Beaut" [...] because of his off-putting appearance – in his mother Nance's Coal Creek bakery (bought with the savings of her late husband/Beaut's father [...] "Cracked" [...] McGregor). [...] Not long after, frustrated by the local miners expecting bread on credit without first settling their debts, Beaut closes the bakery during a miner's strike. That evening, as the now-drunk miners move to ransack the bakery (and assault Beaut), he is saved by a troupe of soldiers marching in formation. After the episode, the bakery remains closed and Nance goes to work at the mining office while Beaut idles about. When Beaut is 18 years old, his mother becomes too ill to work and the young man gets a job as a stableboy. One day, as a prank, his fellow stableboys get Beaut (a teetotaler up to that point) blind drunk with a [...] "horrible mess" [...] made <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> purpose. Having reached a breaking point, Beaut takes the rest of his father's savings and leaves Coal Creek for Chicago on the same evening. He arrives in the City just after the 1893 World's Fair. Despite a shortage of jobs, McGregor easily finds a warehouse job and settles into a routine of work during the day and night school/independent reading at night. One day, in a break from the ordinary, the usually unsocial McGregor gives in to the urging of his neighbor Frank Turner, a barber and amateur violin-maker, and goes to a dance. Despite his aloofness, McGregor meets Edith Carson, a frail, mousy, and somewhat homely milliner/shop owner, with whom he develops a platonic relationship.|$|E

2500|$|Referring to the song's segment in {{the concert}} film, Justin Gerber of Consequence of Sound praises Preston's {{showmanship}} {{and suggests that}} this [...] "powerful" [...] live version [...] "could cause pause for a non-believer" [...] as the singer undertakes [...] "a full-on dance {{of someone who has}} seen the light". Similarly impressed, Nigel Williamson of Uncut writes of Preston [...] "giving the performance of his life" [...] on the song. In his book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon opines that the triple live album [...] "is worth the retail price <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> track", which he describes as [...] "pure bolts of energy, live on stage".|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, South African budget airline Kulula ran an {{advertisement}} that played upon {{the fact that}} they were not an official sponsor of the tournament: it described themselves as [...] "Unofficial National Carrier of the You-Know-What," [...] and contained images of stadiums, balls, vuvuzelas and national flags. The ad was pulled following a complaint by FIFA, who claimed that the ads contained symbols that constituted an unauthorized association with the event when used together. Kulula mocked FIFA's objections in subsequent advertising: a follow-up ad deliberately replaced the items from the first ad with similarly-shaped items (such as disco balls and golf tees), and explained that there were other reasons to travel South Africa [...] "than <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> thing we wouldn't dare mention." [...] The airline also announced that it would give away free flights to anyone who shared their name with FIFA president Sepp Blatter; the offer was redeemed for a dog named [...] "Sepp Blatter".|$|E

Joe Falls quipped that Boros [...] "has learned that hitting the books is one thing; hitting an inside fastball is another." [...] The Associated Press also published a feature story about Boros' studious nature in March 1962. The article noted that Boros was studying contemporary literature in {{the off-season}} and hoped to become a professor of literature. The article added: [...] "Hardly {{a day goes by}} when Boros isn't carrying two or three books under his arms. He reads in hotel rooms, on planes and on trains."

2500|$|Total war demanded total {{mobilization}} {{of all the}} nation's resources for a common goal. Manpower had to be channeled into the front lines (all the powers except the United States and Britain had large trained reserves designed <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>that).</b> Behind the lines labor power had to be redirected away from less necessary activities that were luxuries during a total war. In particular, vast munitions industries had to be built up to provide shells, guns, warships, uniforms, airplanes, and a hundred other weapons both old and new. Agriculture had to be mobilized as well, to provide food for both civilians and for soldiers (many {{of whom had been}} farmers and needed to be replaced by old men, boys and women) and for horses to move supplies. Transportation in general was a challenge, especially when Britain and Germany each tried to intercept merchant ships headed for the enemy. Finance was a special challenge. Germany financed the Central Powers. Britain financed the Allies until 1916, when it ran out of money and had to borrow from the United States. [...] The U.S. took over the financing of the Allies in 1917 with loans that it insisted be repaid after the war. The victorious Allies looked to defeated Germany in 1919 to pay reparations that would cover some of their costs. Above all, it was essential to conduct the mobilization {{in such a way that}} the short term confidence of the people was maintained, the long-term power of the political establishment was upheld, and the long-term economic health of the nation was preserved.|$|E
