5|$|Also in 1956 he was {{selected}} at the Staff School run by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). His first trip outside Nigeria {{was an opportunity to}} advance his technical production skills, and to solicit feedback on his novel (which was later split into two books). In London, he met a novelist named Gilbert Phelps, to whom he offered the manuscript. Phelps responded with great enthusiasm, asking Achebe if he could show it to <b>his</b> <b>editor</b> and publishers. Achebe declined, insisting that it needed more work.|$|E
5|$|Baker's last {{published}} work, Right Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels Testosterone and Anarchy, {{represent a}} stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, {{and in the case of}} Anarchy, partially rewritten by <b>his</b> <b>editor,</b> Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Slump {{is mainly}} a comedy series, filled with puns, toilet humor and sexual innuendos. But it also {{contained}} many science fiction elements; aliens, anthropomorphic characters, time travel, and parodies of {{works such as}} Godzilla, Star Wars and Star Trek. Toriyama also included many real-life people in the series, such as his assistants, wife and colleagues (such as Masakazu Katsura), but most notably <b>his</b> <b>editor</b> Kazuhiko Torishima as the series' main antagonist, Dr. Mashirito.|$|E
50|$|Kumeta's self insert. He is {{tormented by}} <b>his</b> <b>editors,</b> <b>his</b> manga doesn't sell, {{and he is}} very bitter. He {{becomes more and more}} broken as the series goes on.|$|R

5|$|Sasuke was not {{included}} in Kishimoto's original concept of the Naruto manga. While discussing the future of the series, <b>his</b> <b>editor</b> advised him to add a rival character for the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, so he created Sasuke. Kishimoto read a variety of manga to gather ideas for creating an effective rivalry between the characters, and he incorporated these elements into Naruto and Sasuke's relationship. Kishimoto also drew inspiration from his own relationship with his twin brother, Seishi. Since childhood, Masashi had worried about Seishi when he faced failures, such as in high school or college, and tried to help him.|$|E
5|$|Terry Brooks {{has said}} that Tolkien's works were a major {{influence}} in his writing, though he has also said that Tolkien was not his only influence. Other influences included <b>his</b> <b>editor</b> Lester del Rey, {{as well as the}} many different books which he had read over his life. Also, mythology and ancient civilizations that he had learned about in school gave him a wealth of knowledge from which he drew. Many of these influences are reflected in Brooks' works.|$|E
5|$|Turner Catledge, the top {{editor at}} The New York Times from 1952 to 1968, wanted {{to hide the}} {{ownership}} influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to <b>his</b> <b>editor,</b> each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from the memos it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.|$|E
5|$|During {{the process}} of shaping the film for its {{theatrical}} release, Lucas and <b>his</b> <b>editors</b> dropped many scenes, and even an entire subplot, from the completed film.|$|R
50|$|In his autobiography, Hillerman {{explained}} that McKee {{was the main}} character, and initially Leaphorn had a minor role. However, at the advice of <b>his</b> <b>editors,</b> he expanded Leaphorn's role.|$|R
50|$|Marić {{made his}} name by {{interviews}} with Yugoslav dissidents, like Franjo Tuđman, who he interviewed in 1981. His articles often led to sackings of <b>his</b> <b>editors</b> in the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|Balzac's usual mode of {{revision}} involved vast, complicated edits made to galley proofs {{he received}} from the printer. When creating La Cousine Bette, however, he submitted the work to <b>his</b> <b>editor</b> piece by piece, without viewing a single proof. The book was serialized in Le Constitutionnel from 8October to 3December, and Balzac rushed {{to keep up with}} the newspaper's rapid printing schedule. He produced an average of eight pages each day, but was struck by the unexpected enormity of the story as it evolved. Balzac was paid 12,836 francs for the series, which was later published with Le Cousin Pons as a twelve-volume book by Chiendowski and Pétion. The first collected edition of La Cousine Bette was organized into 132 chapters, but these divisions were removed when Balzac added it to his massive collection La Comédie humaine in 1848.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Akira Toriyama {{had created}} the popular manga Dr. Slump; within roughly six months, he wanted to end the series but his {{publisher}} Shueisha would only allow {{him to do so}} if he agreed to start another serial for them shortly after. He worked with <b>his</b> <b>editor,</b> Kazuhiko Torishima, on several one-shots but none were successful. Torishima then suggested that as Toriyama enjoyed kung fu films, he should create a kung fu shōnen manga. This led to the two-part , published in the August and October 1983 issues of Fresh Jump. It follows a boy, adept at martial arts, who escorts a princess on a journey back to her home country. Dragon Boy was very well-received and evolved to become Dragon Ball.|$|E
5|$|Krohn's {{research}} {{also notes that}} Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a BNC Mitchell, the other a handheld French Éclair camera which Orson Welles had used in Touch of Evil (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a Moviola on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which <b>his</b> <b>editor</b> George Tomasini worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi {{made his}} debut {{as an author}} with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, {{he set out to}} write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was not one of the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to <b>his</b> <b>editor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soraya {{is a young}} Afghan {{woman whom}} Amir meets and marries in the United States. Hosseini {{originally}} scripted the character as an American woman, but he later agreed to rewrite her as an Afghan immigrant after <b>his</b> <b>editor</b> did not find her background believable {{for her role in}} the story. The change contributed towards an extensive revision of Part III. In the final draft, Soraya lives with her parents, Afghan general Taheri and his wife, and wants to become an English teacher. Before meeting Amir, she ran away with an Afghan boyfriend in Virginia, which, according to Afghan tradition, made her unsuitable for marriage. Because Amir also had his own regrets, he loves and marries her anyway.|$|E
5|$|After {{reviewing}} the drawings made by Yuu Kamiya's wife, Mashiro Hiiragi, in second light novel volume, <b>his</b> <b>editor</b> suggested the two collaborate on a manga adaptation of No Game No Life for Monthly Comic Alive. Due to Kamiya's {{work on the}} third light novel volume, the manga serialization was delayed by a volume; the volume {{it was supposed to}} premiere in contained an apology page illustrated by Hiiragi. The series premiered in the March 2013 volume of Monthly Comic Alive and since then, is published irregularly in the magazine. Media Factory collected the individual chapters for the tankōbon release; there is currently a single volume which was released on November 22, 2013. In March 2014, Seven Seas Entertainment announced its licensing of the manga series and released the first tankōbon volume in October 2014; the title is stylized as No Game, No Life. The series has also been localized in Brazil, Taiwan and Russia.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Thrill {{and his son}} Kenta are mystery aficionados {{who work}} as amateur detectives. Tezuka started writing stand alone {{chapters}} but, {{at the request of}} <b>his</b> <b>editors,</b> he later transformed Dr. Trill into a serial mystery.|$|R

5|$|In Season 4, Kurt joins Rachel in New York {{after she}} reveals {{that she is}} unhappy with her roommate and life at that point. After the {{encouragement}} of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and <b>his</b> <b>editor,</b> Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she leans on his support, and then quickly returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.|$|E
5|$|Stiefel showed Heidemann {{the diary}} in Stuttgart in January 1980, telling {{him it was}} from a plane crash in East Germany, {{although}} he refused to tell the journalist {{the name of his}} source. The collector spoke to Kujau to see if he would meet Heidemann, but the forger repeatedly refused Heidemann's requests for nearly a year. Heidemann returned to the Stern offices and spoke to <b>his</b> <b>editor,</b> but both Koch and Nannen refused to discuss the potential story with him, telling him to work on other features. The only person who was interested was Walde, who worked with Heidemann to find the source of the diaries. Their searches for Kujau proved fruitless, so they looked into the crash. Heidemann, who had read Baur's autobiography, knew of Gundlfinger's flight, and made a connection between Operation Seraglio and the diary; in November 1980 the two journalists travelled to Dresden and located the graves of the flight's crew.|$|E

25|$|Yuya Aoki {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} GetBackers two years before it started serialization. By that time he had few notes about it. Aoki remembers giving many troubles to <b>his</b> <b>editor</b> when he started writing it, but was glad he could finish it. The character of Ban Mido was originally meant to appear in another series from Aoki, but <b>his</b> <b>editor</b> liked it and {{wanted it to be}} one of the manga's protagonists. Ginji was meant to appear in the series, but his original personality was first meant to belong to Ban.|$|E
