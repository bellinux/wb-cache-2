Considering {{the complexity of the}} phenomena and the difficulties related to the analysis of the main compounds involved (colloids, tannins, proteins), only a few authors cited proposed theories that explain these mechanisms. The main goal is the clarification and decrease of phenolic compounds, regarding in particular the excess of astringency in wines. Protein <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> used in Enology present a varied physico-chemical composition subsequently, the distribution of molecular weight and charge density influence their properties. Meanwhile, the incresing problems during the 90 s (last century) with the BSE desease, led the oenological industry, to a certain deal of concern, regarding the products used, particularly in <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> used in wines. As a result, the subject of plant proteins for collage in wines followed the phases imposed by the OIV, Portuguese and European regulations. The present work studied the effect of <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> from vegetable and microbiological proteins on the physico-chemichal composition in wines, in particular anthocyanins. The results were compared with the ones obtained by using bentonite and egg albumin. In the laboratory the following analyses had been made: measurements on the physico-chemical parameters of color, using Somers method, and assays of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), to verify the effect of the finning treatment on total amount of anthocyanins.

40|$|Mestrado Vinifera EuroMaster - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{treatment}} of wine with <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> {{is a common}} practice in the wine industry which aims to achieve wine’s clarity and improves its stability along the time. The objective of this work {{was to examine the}} influence of various animal proteins used as <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> on the anthocyanins’ profile. For this experiment, two Portuguese varieties, Touriga Nacional and Trincadeira have been used in which two different concentrations have been applied for each fining product. The <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> are commercial <b>fining</b> products widely used in the wine industry such as Egg Albumin, Isinglass, PVPP, Gelatin, Casesol. These proteins were added in the wines in order to perceive the effect of the adding protein and other <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> on the wine’s anthocyanidins final composition, since that these monomeric anthocyanins have an important function on the sensory characteristics of wines, such as colour. The clarification process lasted 7 days for each fining product. At the end of each clarification period, monomeric anthocyanin analysis was carried out by HPLC. By the analysis in the HPLC, we perceived that in general the biggest impact from all the <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> is displayed to the acylated and coumarylated derivatives of the monomeric anthocyanins rather than the 3 -glucoside antocyanidins. Having this as a fact and learning through the initial analysis that Touriga Nacional is richer in these two groups rather than in glucoside derivatives we are able to explain why Touriga Nacional was more affected in all the fining treatments compared to Trincadeira that is poorer in acylated derivatives and in general it was less influenced by the <b>fining</b> <b>agents.</b> Moreover, further analysis have been carried out in order to examine the influence of the <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> on the concentration of pigments, the quantity of condensed tannins {{as well as on the}} chromatic characteristics of the wine after fining. For the quantity of condensed tannins after fining, the results have shown that all the <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> promoted a reduction on the final quantity of tannins after the treatments whereas for the pigments and colour intensity the impact was notably lower compared with the tannins. Regarding the impact on the colour anthocyanins, Casesol promoted the greatest influence on their quantity. In addition, the general tendency indicates that the fining products in high concentrations provoke a bigger decrease on the amount of total anthocyanins compared with the small concentration...|$|R

2500|$|In winemaking, fining is {{the process}} where a {{substance}} (<b>fining</b> <b>agent)</b> {{is added to the}} wine to create an adsorbent, enzymatic or ionic bond with the suspended particles, producing larger molecules and larger particles that will precipitate out of the wine more readily and rapidly. Unlike filtration, which can only remove particulates (such as dead yeast cells and grape fragments), fining can remove soluble substances such as polymerized tannins, coloring phenols and proteins; some of these proteins can cause haziness in wines exposed to high temperatures after bottling. The reduction of tannin can reduce astringency in red wines intended for early drinking. Many substances have historically been used as fining agents, including dried blood powder, but today there are two general types of fining agents [...] organic compounds and solid/mineral materials.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fermentation of smoke-affected grapes {{can lead}} to wines that exhibit {{objectionable}} smoke-related sensory attributes, i. e. smoke taint. Fining agents are routinely used {{at different stages of}} the winemaking process to address constituents that are considered to adversely affect juice or wine quality. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of commercial <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> in reducing the concentration of volatile phenols and the intensity of sensory attributes associated with smoke-tainted wine. METHODS AND RESULTS: Smoke-affected wines were treated with a range of <b>fining</b> <b>agents,</b> two of which, an activated carbon and a synthetic mineral, were found to appreciably ameliorate the taint. Treated wines contained a significantly lower level of smoke-derived volatile phenols and exhibited less intense ‘smoke’ and ‘cold ash’ aromas, ‘smoky’ flavour and ‘ashy’ aftertaste, compared with that of untreated (control) wines; with little or no impact on wine colour. CONCLUSIONS: Selected <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> can ameliorate smoke taint in wine. Whereas most <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> showed poor specificity towards the wine components responsible for smoke taint, some, an activated carbon in particular, were highly effective.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to study the effect of grape pomace {{enrichment}} in solid phase (stems and seeds) on phenolic compounds and colour stability of obtained red wines, before and after use of different <b>fining</b> <b>agents.</b> Results have shown increase in total phenols and flavan- 3 -ols content after grape solid phase addition. On the other hand, decrease in anthocyanins content has generally been recorded in all wine samples except in wines obtained with addition of 40 g/l of seeds during maceration. Stems addition caused decrease in colour intensity while addition of seeds has increased this colour parameter. The use of four <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> (albumin, gelatine, bentonite and PVPP) has been investigated and compared, {{especially in terms of}} their influence on potential stabilization effect of grape solid phase on wine colour.

In the case of chromatic parameters, used <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> caused colour intensity decrease but it is important to emphasize that their values, after fining, are still as high as expected from red wine. This can be explained by the stabilization effect of increased flavan- 3 -ols content...|$|R

500|$|The tannic {{nature of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is an {{important}} winemaking consideration. As the must is exposed to prolonged periods of maceration, more tannins are extracted from the skin and will {{be present in the}} resulting wine. If winemakers choose not to shorten the period of maceration, in favor of maximizing color and flavor concentrations, there are some methods that they can use to soften tannin levels. A common method is oak aging, which exposes the wine to gradual levels of oxidation that can mellow the harsh grape tannins as well as introduce softer [...] "wood tannins". The choice of <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> can also reduce tannins with gelatin and egg whites being positively-charged proteins that are naturally attracted to the negatively charged tannin molecules. These <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> will bond with some of the tannins and be removed from the wine during filtration. One additional method is micro-oxygenation which mimics some of the gradual aeration that occurs with barrel aging, with the limited exposure to oxygen aiding in the polymerization of the tannins into larger molecules, which are perceived on the palate as being softer.|$|R
