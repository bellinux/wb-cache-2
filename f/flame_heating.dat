50|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>heating</b> in {{a normal}} {{atmosphere}} causes oxidation, scaling and carbon build up on the parts. To clean the parts, applications of joint-weakening flux and expensive acid cleaning baths have traditionally been required. Batch vacuum furnaces solve these problems, but have significant limitations of their own because of their large size, poor efficiency and lack of quality control. Brazing with induction reduces both oxidation and costly cleaning requirements, especially when a rapid cool-down cycle is used.|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{existing}} understanding of flame spread dynamics is enhanced through an extensive {{study of the}} <b>heat</b> transfer from <b>flames</b> spreading vertically upwards across 5 cm wide, 20 cm tall samples of extruded Poly (Methyl Methacrylate) (PMMA). These experiments have provided highly spatially resolved measurements of <b>flame</b> to surface <b>heat</b> flux and material burning rate at the critical length scale of interest, {{with a level of}} accuracy and detail unmatched by previous empirical or computational studies. Using these measurements, a wall flame model was developed that describes a <b>flame’s</b> <b>heat</b> feedback profile (both in the continuous flame region and the thermal plume above) solely as a function of material burning rate. 	Additional experiments were conducted to measure <b>flame</b> <b>heat</b> flux and sample mass loss rate as flames spread vertically upwards over the surface of seven other commonly used polymers, two of which are glass reinforced composite materials. Using these measurements, our wall flame model has been generalized such that it can predict <b>heat</b> feedback from <b>flames</b> supported by a wide range of materials. For the seven materials tested here – which present a varied range of burning behaviors including dripping, polymer melt flow, sample burnout, and heavy soot formation – model-predicted <b>flame</b> <b>heat</b> flux has been shown to match experimental measurements (taken across the full length of the flame) with an average accuracy of 3. 9 kW m- 2 (approximately 10 – 15 % of peak measured <b>flame</b> <b>heat</b> flux). 	This <b>flame</b> model has since been coupled with a powerful solid phase pyrolysis solver, ThermaKin 2 D, which computes the transient rate of gaseous fuel production of constituents of a pyrolyzing solid in response to an external heat flux, based on fundamental physical and chemical properties. Together, this unified model captures the two fundamental controlling mechanisms of upward flame spread – gas phase <b>flame</b> <b>heat</b> transfer and solid phase material degradation. This has enabled simulations of flame spread dynamics with a reasonable computational cost and accuracy beyond that of current models. This unified model of material degradation provides the framework to quantitatively study material burning behavior in response {{to a wide range of}} common fire scenarios...|$|R

These traditional methods suffer from long heating times and uneven heating, therefore a new model using circular fluid flow to control roll temperature has been designed. This method heats and cools the roll using two tanks. The roll temperature can be controlled by adjusting the velocity and temperature of the fluid. A high precision heat transfer model (between the magnesium alloy sheet and roll) has been built, and the regulation strategy of roll temperature is given, meaning the roll temperature can be controlled within a reasonable range at any time. Therefore, this study can solve the existing problems of large crown, serious wave-shapes, and stuck rolls caused by inaccurate roll temperature control.

40|$|Abstract — Welding is a joining {{process that}} has {{enormous}} applications in manufacturing and construction industry. One of the challenges faced during welding is distortion of joined metals. Since construction of some structures require welded sub-assemblies, the distortion leads to geometric inaccuracies making sub-assembly difficult and limiting automation. It also increases the cost of production due to rework involved in straightening. Researchers have proposed various mitigating factors for control of weld distortions. This paper compares two welding distortion control methods for a simplified butt weld. Distortion of the plates when the two techniques are employed is compared with normal (straight single continuous line) welding technique. Welding and distortion correction (straightening) time is taken and compared for the three procedures. The straightening method used is <b>flame</b> <b>heating</b> for a standard time for both cases. From the experiments it was seen that the procedure used {{can have an impact}} on the quality of the weld.

40|$|Existing {{designs of}} {{small-scale}} burners and domestic cookers {{have relied on}} open flame, where {{a large amount of}} heat is lost with flue gas. Flue Gas Recirculation (FGR) has been an effective technique for energy saving for large-scale industrial furnaces. Against this background, an experimental study was conducted to investigate the thermal, emission and heating performance of CH 4 -H 2 /air flames in terms of their dependence on both dilution effect (CO 2 and N 2) and preheat effect (initial reactant temperature from 20  °C to 100  °C). Testing of flame stability showed detrimental and favorable effects of dilution and preheat, respectively. Examination of flame height showed that under constant Re and Ф, the reaction cone is shorter at higher initial reactant temperature, indicative of enhanced burning velocity caused by preheat. Emission of CO and NOx was monotonically increased as the result of higher flame temperature due to preheat. The key question whether <b>flame</b> <b>heating</b> performance can be promoted or not is answered by detailed analysis of the radial heat flux configurations. The data reveals that the combined effects of dilution and preheat indeed induce higher heat transfer rate, thus theoretical evidence is provided for feasibility of adoption of FGR in domestic cookers.

We model the system in a 2 D CFD code, considering a linear array of multiple Bunsen-type <b>flames</b> with <b>heat</b> exchanger tubes downstream the flames. Thermoacoustic instability {{is one of the main}} issues in lean premixed combustion systems, especially domestic boilers. In com-pact condensing boilers the close distance between the burner surface and the heat exchanger has increased the importance of studying the interactions between the <b>flames</b> and the <b>heat</b> exchanger.
