25|$|Another {{important}} {{impact of}} Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his {{exposure to the}} opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in The Old Curiosity Shop), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in Oliver Twist. Dickens <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>thought</b> of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the Middle Ages, manuals of {{confession}} {{emerged as}} a literary genre. These manuals were guidebooks on how to obtain the maximum benefits from the sacrament. There were two kinds of manuals: those addressed to the faithful, {{so that they could}} prepare a good confession, and those addressed to the priests, who had to make sure that no sins were left unmentioned and the confession was as thorough as possible. The priest had to ask questions, while being careful not to suggest sins that perhaps the faithful <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>thought</b> of and give them ideas. Manuals were written in Latin and in the vernacular.|$|E
25|$|Fulci and screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti {{share many}} screen credits from 1977 to 1983. Indeed, most of Fulci's most celebrated horror films {{were written by}} Sacchetti. After collaborating with Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct Conquest in Mexico, failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film was {{supposed}} to be a high budget production, and Sacchetti allegedly resented the fact that Fulci <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>thought</b> to involve him in the project. The film actually wound up doing quite poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by this time had gone his own way.|$|E
25|$|By {{this point}} in the {{conflict}} the U.S. Navy was doing things the Japanese high command <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>thought</b> possible. The Fast Carrier Task Force was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in. Moreover, the Navy's ability to establish forward operating ports as they did at Majuro, Enewetak and Ulithi, and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western Pacific. The Japanese Navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy. The U.S. Navy remained at sea and on station, dominating whatever region it entered. The size of the Pacific Ocean, which Japanese planners had thought would limit the U.S. Navy's ability to operate in the western Pacific, would not be adequate to protect Japan.|$|E

25|$|In {{the morning}} of only the second day, a {{rebellion}} broke out among the volunteer prisoners. They ripped off their uniforms and locked themselves in their cells by pushing their beds up against the door. In response to this, the guards became very angry and called for backup. This surprised Zimbardo {{as well as the}} rest of the psychologists because they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>thought</b> it would be taken this far. Guards who were not on duty were called in and the guards who were assigned to only the night shift stayed with the guards who came in all the way through their shift the next morning. The tactic the guards came up with was to fight back in order to discipline the unruly prisoners and make them obey. In response to the prisoners barricading themselves in their cells, the guards used fire extinguishers on them to get them away from the entrances.|$|E
25|$|Thābit ibn Qurra (known as Thebit in Latin) (born 836) {{contributed to}} a number of areas in mathematics, where he played an {{important}} role in preparing the way for such important mathematical discoveries as the extension of the concept of number to (positive) real numbers, integral calculus, theorems in spherical trigonometry, analytic geometry, and non-Euclidean geometry. In astronomy Thabit was one of the first reformers of the Ptolemaic system, and in mechanics he was a founder of statics. An important geometrical aspect of Thabit's work was his book on the composition of ratios. In this book, Thabit deals with arithmetical operations applied to ratios of geometrical quantities. The Greeks had dealt with geometric quantities but <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>thought</b> of them in the same way as numbers to which the usual rules of arithmetic could be applied. By introducing arithmetical operations on quantities previously regarded as geometric and non-numerical, Thabit started a trend which led eventually to the generalisation of the number concept.|$|E

One evening in 1933, while traveling in Munich, Hitler became aware of an unknown car following his own. He told his driver Erich Kempka to accelerate the supercharged Mercedes-Benz, so the following car could not keep up. It {{turned out that the}} car pursuing Hitler was full of RSD bodyguards, who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>thought</b> to inform the Führer or any of his immediate entourage beforehand. This incident illustrates the [...] "sometimes farcical nature of Hitler's security" [...] during the early years. It further {{is an example of the}} duplication of departments and units with overlapping responsibilities, which was common in Nazi Germany. This policy was used in the [...] "hierarchy" [...] of the SS and Nazi Party to prevent one person or one group from accumulating too much power.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} Constable West spoke to Bamber {{again on the}} telephone; Bamber {{apparently}} complained {{about the time the}} police were taking, saying: [...] "When my father rang he sounded terrified." [...] He was told to go to the farm and wait for the police. Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Bamber told police on the night that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>thought</b> it would make a difference to how soon they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to come quickly, he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse. He acknowledged that he could have called one of the farm workers, but had not considered it. In his early witness statements, Bamber said he had telephoned the police immediately after receiving his father's call, then telephoned Mugford. During later police interviews, he said he had called Mugford first. He said he was confused about the sequence of events.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{release of}} The Little Mermaid in 1989, Disney was {{unprepared}} for the success that would be achieved by both the film's soundtrack and its songs, particularly that of [...] "Part of Your World", which became an instant hit. The studio <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>thought</b> to prepare a single version of the song at the time {{because they did not}} expect that it would soon be demanded by local radio stations, at which it was heavily rotated. The success of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] has been overshadowed by [...] "Under the Sea" [...] and [...] "Kiss the Girl", two other popular songs from the film. While both [...] "Under the Sea" [...] and [...] "Kiss the Girl" [...] were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 62nd Academy Awards, which [...] "Under the Sea" [...] ultimately won, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] did not receive a nomination, which some critics have viewed as a snub. Benson believes that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not recognize [...] "Part of Your World" [...] because [...] "a story song at the time was probably not recognised really as much". However, when the film was released to VHS in 1998, Disney included a music video for [...] "Part of Your World" [...] starring Benson that appears towards the end of its closing credits. When The Little Mermaid was re-released to theaters in 1997, The Boston Phoenixs Jeffrey Gantz wrote that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] remains [...] "as poignant as ever". Tracy Dye of Bustle identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as her [...] "favorite Disney song of all time." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Esther Zuckerman described [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as [...] "a perfect 'I Want' song," [...] comparing it positively to “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly” from the stage musical My Fair Lady (1956).|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 52, {{he began}} to revive his career and started taking acting classes, {{something}} he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>thought</b> about after being cast in Neighbours. He described his age, unknown status and willingness {{to work for a}} relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that you might want to play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class said I was a bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that went into my head. I thought if I go for roles those guys would go for I'm more likely to get them." [...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called Sign of Life, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series Once Upon a Time, and Emmett in Hot in Cleveland, before joining the main cast of Dominion in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.|$|E
