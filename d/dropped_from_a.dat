Troops at gun batteries and barracks immediately turned out in case the city was under attack, but within an hour switched from defence to rescue roles as the cause and location of the explosion were determined. All available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the North End to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city's hospitals, including the two army hospitals in the city.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to the Moors in 1946, following his military service. Over the 1946 and 1947 seasons, Wilhelm earned 41 wins with Mooresville. He later recalled being <b>dropped</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Class D minor league team and having the manager tell him {{to forget about the}} knuckleball, but he persisted with it. The Boston Braves purchased Wilhelm from Mooresville in 1947. On November 20, 1947, Wilhelm was drafted by the New York Giants from the Braves in the 1947 minor league draft.|$|E
5|$|Music with a fast {{rhythm of}} 120 bpm {{was used in}} an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was {{reinforced}} by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes were inside the stadium, 7 billion small pieces of paper were <b>dropped</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Westland helicopter, each piece representing one person on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth for}} many towns was only temporary. Growth in some {{communities}} was often driven by exploitation of limited oil resources, so once wells ran dry or demand slowed, their populations rapidly declined. When Wortham's boom ended, the population crashed from its 1927 peak of 30,000 to 2,000 people in 1929. The population of Breckenridge <b>dropped</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> similar high to 7,569 in 1930.|$|E

5|$|The brand <b>dropped</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{net worth}} of A$18million in 2009 to A$9.7million in 2010. In June 2012 it was {{announced}} that the Nine Network, after their financial difficulties, had sold the Hi-5 brand to Asian equity group, Asiasons. The Malaysian-based company’s managing director Datuk Jared Lim revealed that they planned to expand the brand throughout South East Asia, but expressed that Hi-5's presence in Australia would remain intact. Former series producer Julie Greene took on the role as executive creative director and Lim became the brand's chairman. The Hi-5 brand was consolidated under new platform Tremendous Entertainment Group (TEG) in 2014, following Asiasons privatising and rebranding as Tremendous Asia Partners (TAP).|$|E
5|$|The year 1917 was uneventful for U-17. The {{submarine}} resumed patrols off Albania in January. In May, the U-boat had {{to crash}} dive near Valona when a bomber appeared overhead and dropped its payload. A foray to Bari in July provided {{another opportunity to}} attack a steamer, but the torpedoes missed their mark. On 16 August, U-17, by now {{under the command of}} Linienschiffsleutnant Hermann Rigele, attempted a torpedo attack on a cargo ship off Saseno. At the end of October, U-17 escaped damage from a torpedo attack by an enemy submarine near Cape Menders, Albania. A month later, the submarine was once again attacked by air, surviving two bombs <b>dropped</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single airplane.|$|E
5|$|Although the two clubs {{claimed to}} have sold most of the 42,000 tickets {{allocated}} to them, only about 25,000 fans {{were said to have}} travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom, with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game. According {{to the head of the}} Russian national tourist office, Mikhail Ignatiev, many fans were put off by the cost of travel and accommodation. Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were full on the night of the game. As some fans looked to offload tickets to the match, The Moscow Times reported that the black-market price <b>dropped</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> high of €2,000 (£1,600) to around €500 (£400), while Russian TV channel Sport-1 was reporting prices as low as £300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow. Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan and Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, American News Company, by far {{the largest}} {{magazine}} distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science-fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science-fiction magazines being published <b>dropped</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen {{by the end of the}} decade. For a while If was hard to find on the news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try the slick format (using glossy paper, unlike the cheaper paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, Space Age, which he launched in November 1958; the experiment was unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve Ifs circulation, Quinn hired writer Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958. Circulation failed to increase, though this was at least partly due to the problems with distribution, and by early 1959, Quinn decided to sell the magazine. Knight's last issue was his third, dated February 1959.|$|E
5|$|Minority {{ethnic groups}} include white Zimbabweans, {{who make up}} less than 1% of the total {{population}}. White Zimbabweans are mostly of British origin, {{but there are also}} Afrikaner, Greek, Portuguese, French and Dutch communities. The white population <b>dropped</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> peak of around 278,000 or 4.3% of the population in 1975 to possibly 120,000 in 1999, and was estimated to be no more than 50,000 in 2002, and possibly much less. The 2012 census lists the total white population at 28,782 (roughly 0.22% of the population), one-tenth of its 1975 estimated size. Most emigration has been to the United Kingdom (between 200,000 and 500,000 Britons are of Rhodesian or Zimbabwean origin), South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Coloureds form 0.5% of the population, and various Asian ethnic groups, mostly of Indian and Chinese origin, are also 0.5%.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} Tkach’s tenure {{as the head}} of the WCG was notable. Church income <b>dropped</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> high of over $200 million in 1990 to $50 million by 1996. By then the church could only count 49,000 as members, less than half from its peak. The {{circulation}} of The Plain Truth, distributed free by subscription and via newsstand distribution around the globe, fell from a peak of 8,000,000 to less than 100,000 before it switched to a paid subscription status. Eventually the magazine was spun off into a separate, independent, evangelical ministry. The number of employees at the church headquarters fell from 1,000 to about 50. Ambassador University, as the college had become after earning regional accreditation in Texas, ceased operations in 1997 as the church could no longer provide its annual operating subsidy. The Pasadena campus was finally sold in 2004.|$|E

5|$|The {{workforce}} at Y-12 <b>dropped</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> wartime peak of 22,482 on 21 August 1945 to {{less than}} 1,700 in 1949. All the calutrons were removed and dismantled, except for the XAX and XBX training tracks in Building 9731, and the Beta 3 racetracks in Building 9204–3. In 1947, Eugene Wigner, {{the director of the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), asked the Atomic Energy Commission for permission to use the Beta calutrons to produce isotopes for physics experiments. Permission was granted, and a wide range of isotopes was produced. Lithium-6 from the Beta calutrons was used for research into thermonuclear weapons. Many other isotopes were used for peaceful scientific and medical purposes. The Beta 3 racetracks were transferred to the ORNL in March 1950. By the mid-1950s, the Beta calutrons had produced quantities of all the naturally occurring stable isotopes except those of osmium, which had to wait until April 1960. The calutrons continued to produce isotopes until 1998. , they are still on standby.|$|E
