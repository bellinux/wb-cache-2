Wenbo <b>et</b> <b>al.’s</b> protocol needs eighteen hash function computations and seven elliptic curve point multiply computations. Our proposed protocol needs eighteen hash function computations, four elliptic curve point multiply computations, eleven AES computations and six pairing computations. Although our protocol needs more computations than their protocols, their protocols suffer from security issues or need complicated biometric equipments. Our protocol addressed {{these issues and}} provides better security and more security services than the other related protocols.|$|R

We seasoned diverse bit planes and block division size from 256 × 256 to 2 × 2. For instance, we reconnoiter higher to lower bit planes with unlike block division {{to evaluate the}} EC and PSNR of image. On larger bit planes, embedding capacity is very high {{but in this case}} image quality was debauched and extra bit also increased in higher bit planes from two to six, while five to eight bit planes have high image quality but low extra bits and embedding capacity. Three to seven and three to eight have high embedding capacity and image quality. We have gained high embedding capacity and image quality on 16 × 16 and three to seven and three to eight bit planes. Likewise, control of the growth proportion of extra bits to expand more EC besides high PSNR value equate with Ni <b>et</b> <b>a.l’s,</b> Luo <b>et</b> <b>al.’s,</b> Kim <b>et</b> <b>al’s,</b> Lin <b>et</b> <b>al.’s,</b> Liu <b>et</b> <b>al.’s</b> and He <b>et</b> <b>al’s</b> methods as in Table  3.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.’s</b> {{protocol}} (Zhang and Zhou 2015) is vulnerable to lost/stolen smartcard disguised attack and off-line password guessing attack. And then we propose an improved protocol using biometric keys (fingerprint, face and palm-print, etc.) to resolve the security problems. Furthermore, we provide the simulation results of our scheme for the formal security verification, using applied pi calculus based formal verification tool ProVerif. Our protocol overcomes the weaknesses of Islam <b>et</b> <b>al.’s</b> scheme and Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.’s</b> scheme, and has the similar efficiency in comparison with their schemes.|$|R

Fernández <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (1992) also suggested that Tarebia granifera density was positively correlated with Ca2+ concentrations and negatively with NH4 concentrations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Confidentiality and {{authenticity}} are two fundamental security requirement of Public key Cryptography. These are achieved by encryption scheme and digital signatures respectively. Here {{we present a}} provably secure signcryption scheme in random oracle model by modifying Libert <b>et</b> <b>al’s</b> scheme [2]. Our scheme is more efficient and secure than Libert <b>et</b> <b>al’s</b> scheme. Tan [1] proved that this scheme is not secure against nonadaptive chosen cipher text attacks. It has been also proved that the semantically secure symmetric encryption scheme proposed in the Libert <b>et</b> <b>al’s</b> scheme {{is not sufficient to}} guarantee to be secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks. Here we proposed a modified version of Libert <b>et</b> <b>al’s</b> scheme. The security of which is proven using two assumptions, namely the Strong Diffie-Hellman (SDH) and Diffie-Hellman Inversion (DHI) in the random oracle model...|$|R

30|$|Because {{the effects}} of {{diffusion}} through pit or ray openings were neglected in Siau’s model, his model cannot describe tangential diffusion and radial diffusion separately—this may be a significant problem when the wood has many pit and ray cells. Both tangential and radial transverse diffusion coefficients, determined by Siau’s model, decreased steadily and continuously as moisture content decreased. Meanwhile, Stamm’s model and Kang <b>et</b> <b>al.’s</b> model describe the effect of pits or rays on diffusion. Transverse diffusion coefficients determined by Stamm’s model and Kang <b>et</b> <b>al.’s</b> model decreased as the moisture content decreased from 30 to 10  %, {{in a similar way}} to that shown by Siau’s model. However, below 10  % MC, the diffusion coefficients did not decrease, and even increased from 10 to 5  %. This result of Stamm’s and Kang <b>et</b> <b>al.’s</b> models may be because these models consider the fast diffusion of water vapor passing through pits or rays at lower MC. In particular, in Kang <b>et</b> <b>al.’s</b> model, radial diffusion coefficients were much higher than tangential diffusion coefficient below 10  % MC, so that Kang <b>et</b> <b>al.’s</b> model could reflect the effect of rays on water vapor diffusion.|$|R
