During the investigation theory of random processes, numerical methods and programming optimization have been used. As a result the probabilistic analysis of some models of the storage control has been held, properties of model characteristics have been investigated. All results are the new ones. Programs, {{making it possible to}} minimize effectively the stationary rates of expenses in storage control models have been developed.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{economical}} and energy requirements evaluation of hay production {{are presented in}} the paper. A model of a cheap, fitted to natural land profile ramp for delivery of hay to a place <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> was proposed. We determined that maximum angle of the ramp, at average density of hay - approximately 78 kg/m³ was - 18 ° using pick-up trailer T 084. It was estimated that direct <b>expenses,</b> <b>for</b> pickup of hay in windrows and for unloading in a storage using the ramp, were 1, 25 times less than using a pneumatic loader, 1, 35 times less than for pressing in bales and for a belt conveyor, and 2 times less than using a round bale press and a self-loading trailer Dromader...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to estimate the direct maternity-care <b>expense</b> <b>for</b> women who recently delivered in South Delhi and to explore its sociodemographic associations. A survey was conducted using the two-stage cluster-randomized sampling technique. Two colonies each from high-, middle- and low-income areas were selected by simple random sampling, followed by a house-to-house survey in each selected colony. Information was collected by recall of healthcare <b>expenses</b> <b>for</b> mother and child. In total, 249 subjects (of 282 eligible) were recruited. The mean <b>expense</b> <b>for</b> a normal vaginal delivery (n= 182) was US$ 370. 7, being much higher in a private hospital (US$ 1, 035) compared to a government hospital (US$ 61. 1) or a delivery in the home (US$ 55. 3). <b>Expenses</b> <b>for</b> a caesarean delivery (n= 67) were higher (US$ 1, 331. 1). <b>Expenses</b> <b>for</b> the lowest-income groups were ∼ 10 % of their annual family income at government facilities and ∼ 26 % at private hospitals.

50|$|Fort Gomer was {{constructed}} between 1853 and 1858 {{and as such}} {{it was the first}} of the Polygonal land forts based on the Prussian System of mutual defence. It was unique and an example of early attempts to break away from the old bastioned system of fortification. Fort Gomer had a wet moat surrounding it and provision was made to further hinder the enemy by flooding the ground in front of the rampart. It was nearly 500 feet wide and 800 feet long, its rear faced east and consisted of a defensible barracks, built in the shape of a shallow V. Two spiral staircases gave access to the roof of the barrack block. There is a possibility that the intention was to mount guns on the roof of the barrack, using it as a cavalier, but this was never done. Mortars were to be mounted on the central parade. on the ramparts between the gun emplacements were ten <b>expense</b> magazines <b>for</b> the <b>storage</b> of ready use ammunition for the guns. A main magazine were situated at each end of the barrack block. Two bastionettes at the northwest and southwest corners of the west ditch provided musketry fire along the north and south branches of the ditch. Two tunnels led from the parade through the thickness of the west rampart to the west ditch in order to provide flanking fire across the faces of the rampart.|$|R
