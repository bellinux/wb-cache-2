40|$|For {{the past}} decades, {{insightful}} memoirs {{have been published}} by collaborative pianists, providing an insider’s perspective {{on the art of}} piano accompaniment. This paper draws on my doctoral thesis that used an autoethnographic narrative to explore the <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> collaborative <b>music</b> performance {{from the perspective of a}} piano accompanist. The narrative incorporated creative writing elements such as direct speech and descriptive scene setting to recreate the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> collaborative <b>music</b> performance, allowing the reader to gain some insight into its creative process, and thus understand elements of musical taste and how this impacts on the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> collaborative <b>music</b> performance. The paper argues that this methodology provides an appropriate way to examine such subjective experiences and that the use of autoethnographic narrative, incorporating creative writing techniques, can be a useful addition to music research methodologies, particularly in the field <b>of</b> <b>music</b> performance research...|$|R

40|$|In Music Teachers' Values and Beliefs, Dwyer {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between teachers, learners and music in music classrooms. Using Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and doxa as an interpretive lens, the book explores the values and beliefs <b>of</b> four <b>music</b> teachers, depicted in richly detailed narratives. The narratives are contextualised through the examination <b>of</b> traditions <b>of</b> <b>music</b> and contemporary approaches. In the past, music education has been shaped by elitist tendencies regarding the types <b>of</b> <b>music</b> worthy <b>of</b> study, {{the ways in which}} music should be learnt, and the purpose of such learning. Contemporary approaches to music education have enacted significant change in some regions and systems, while others have been slower to leave behind deeply entrenched values, beliefs and practices. These approaches have been blamed for low rates of participation and engagement in school music education, {{despite the fact that the}} majority of young people listen to and enjoy <b>music</b> outside <b>of</b> school. This innovative book provides music education researchers and practitioners with a new understanding of the impact of teachers' personal values, beliefs and <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> and music education on classroom practice, and the impact this has on students' <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> education.

40|$|Patients {{perceive}} {{the intensive care}} unit (ICU) as being a stressful and anxiety-provoking environment. The physiological effects of stress and anxiety are found to be harmful and therefore should be avoided in cardiac surgery patients. The aim of the study on which this article is based was to describe cardiac surgery patients’ <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> as a therapeutic intervention in the ICU of a public hospital. The objectives of this article were to introduce and then expose the cardiac patients to <b>music</b> as part <b>of</b> their routine postoperative care and to explore and describe their <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> the <b>music</b> intervention. The findings of the research are to be the basis for making recommendations for the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>music</b> as part <b>of</b> the routine postoperative care received by cardiac surgery patients in the ICU. A qualitative research methodology, using a contextual, explorative and descriptive research design, was adopted. The population of the study was cardiac surgery patients admitted to the ICU of a public hospital. An unstructured interview was conducted with each participant and content analysis and coding procedures were used to analyse the data. Four main themes were identified in the results, namely practical and operational aspects <b>of</b> the <b>music</b> sessions; participants’ experiences; discomfort due to therapeutic apparatus and the ICU environment; and the role <b>of</b> <b>music</b> and recommendations for music as a therapeutic intervention. Participants’ experiences were mainly positive.

50|$|Leonard Meyer's Emotion and Meaning in Music is {{the classic}} text in music expectation. Meyer's {{starting}} point {{is the belief that}} the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> (as a listener) is derived from one's emotions and feelings about the music, which themselves are a function of relationships within the music itself. Meyer writes that listeners bring with them a vast body of musical experiences that, as one listens to a piece, conditions one's response to that piece as it unfolds. Meyer argued that music's evocative power derives from its capacity to generate, suspend, prolongate, or violate these expectations.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the importance, uses and effects <b>of</b> <b>music</b> in everyday life. The first {{study investigated the}} importance <b>of</b> <b>music</b> for 1000 Pakistani students. Results indicated that the great majority enjoyed listening to music, which was preferred {{to most of the}} other indoor and outdoor activities considered, and listening to and playing music had different perceived benefits. The second study used a variant <b>of</b> the <b>experience</b> sampling method to investigate the uses and <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> in the course of everyday life among 200 Pakistanis. Results indicate that the importance of several functions <b>of</b> <b>music</b> depends particularly upon with whom the participant was with and the place where the music was heard. The third study investigated the relationship between listening to music, health and happiness among 301 British and 594 Pakistani students. Results indicated that there were significant positive relationships between time spent listening to <b>music</b> and each <b>of</b> health and happiness. The fourth study investigated the effect <b>of</b> religious <b>music</b> on mental health among 175 Pakistanis hospitalized with psychotic depression. The results indicated that, relative to other types of psychosocial support materials, religious music led to the greatest decrease in depression levels. A fifth study used qualitative methods to investigate the musical peak <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> six white British and six Pakistani participants. Several similarities were noted in the musical peak <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> these two groups, suggesting that musical peak experiences may be a universal phenomenon. The sixth study investigated the relationship between musical peak experiences and the general health and level of happiness among 105 British and 115 Pakistani students. Results indicate that peak <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> were related positively to health and happiness and that these effects were not mediated by ethnicity...|$|R
40|$|The individual's proper <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> blues <b>music</b> {{and other}} 'African American' music {{according}} {{to his or her}} race {{has been the subject of}} a controversial 20 th century debate.

40|$|It {{has been}} my {{experience}} that parents are willing and open to express their voices to promote and advocate for music therapy services for their terminally ill children. By listening to parents' voices when providing care for terminally ill children, much {{can be done to}} ease the suffering of children and families {{at the end of life}} (Widger & Wilkins, 2004). My music therapy masters research at the University of Melbourne with Dr. Katrina McFerran will investigate bereaved parents' <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> therapy with their terminally ill child. This inquiry unfolded through my music therapy work with several children and families within hospice and palliative care. Parents have reflected that music therapy was a vital component in their child's care at the end of life. As one mom commented, "I don't care what anyone says, it has made a world of a difference. " In order to further explore parents' <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> therapy, in-depth interviews will be conducted and transcripts will be analyzed using phenomenological strategies. It has been reported that parents find the interview process helpful in working through grief. They have also reported feeling an overall eagerness to share their child's story in order to provide input that might assist other families in the future (Widger & Wilkins, 2004). This article will describe pediatric palliative and hospice care, discuss parents as advocates for their terminally ill children, portray the use <b>of</b> <b>music</b> therapy within pediatrics, and share an example <b>of</b> <b>music</b> therapy with Jack...|$|R
