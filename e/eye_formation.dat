40|$|AbstractThe {{definitive}} retinal progenitors {{of the eye}} {{field are}} specified by transcription factors that both promote a retinal fate and control cell movements that are critical for <b>eye</b> field <b>formation.</b> However, the molecular signaling pathways that regulate these movements are largely undefined. We demonstrate that both the FGF and ephrin pathways impact <b>eye</b> field <b>formation.</b> Activating the FGF pathway before gastrulation represses cellular movements in the presumptive anterior neural plate and prevents cells from expressing a retinal fate, independent of mesoderm induction or anterior-posterior patterning. Inhibiting the FGF pathway promotes cell dispersal and significantly increases eye field contribution. ephrinB 1 reverse signaling is required to promote cellular movements into the eye field, and can rescue the FGF receptor-induced repression of retinal fate. These results indicate that FGF modulation of ephrin signaling regulates the positioning of retinal progenitor cells within the definitive eye field...|$|R

50|$|Defects in the PAX6 gene cause aniridia-like ocular {{defects in}} mice (as well as Drosophila).

50|$|Retinal {{development}} {{begins with}} the establishment of the eye fields mediated by Shh and Six3 with subsequent development of the optic vesicles via Pax6 and Lhx2. The role of Pax6 in eye development was elegantly demonstrated by Walter Gehring and colleagues, who showed that ectopic expression of Pax6 can lead to <b>eye</b> <b>formation</b> on Drosophila antennae, wings, and legs. The optic vesicle gives rise to three structures: the neural retina, the retinal pigmented epithelium, and the optic stalk. The neural retina contains the retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that give rise to the seven cell types of the retina. Differentiation {{begins with the}} retinal ganglion cells and concludes with production of the Muller glia. Although each cell type differentiates from the RPCs in a sequential order, there is considerable overlap in the timing of when individual cell types differentiate. The cues that determine a RPC daughter cell fate are coded by multiple transcription factor families including the bHLH and homeodomain factors.|$|E
50|$|Eye {{development}} is {{initiated by the}} master control gene Pax-6, a homeobox gene with known homologues in humans (aniridia), mice (small eye), and Drosophila (eyeless). The Pax-6 gene locus is a transcription factor for the various genes and growth factors involved in <b>eye</b> <b>formation.</b> Eye morphogenesis begins with the evagination, or outgrowth, of the optic grooves or sulci. These two grooves in the neural folds transform into optic vesicles with {{the closure of the}} neural tube. The optic vesicles then develop into the optic cup with the inner layer forming the retina and the outer portion forming the retinal pigment epithelium. The middle portion of the optic cup develops into the ciliary body and iris. During the invagination of the optic cup, the ectoderm begins to thicken and form the lens placode, which eventually separates from the ectoderm to form the lens vesicle at the open end of the optic cup. Further differentiation and mechanical rearrangement of cells in and around the optic cup gives rise to the fully developed eye.|$|E

50|$|Differences in {{deployment}} of toolkit genes affect the body {{plan and the}} number, identity, and pattern of body parts. The majority of toolkit genes are components of signaling pathways, and encode {{for the production of}} transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins (and signalling ligands that bind to them), and secreted morphogens, all of these participate in defining the fate of undifferentiated cells, generating spatial and temporal patterns, which in turn form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important of the toolkit genes are those of the Hox gene cluster, or complex. Hox genes, transcription factors containing the more broadly distributed homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, function in patterning the body axis. Thus, by combinatorial specifying the identity of particular body regions, Hox genes determine where limbs and other body segments will grow in a developing embryo or larva. A atic toolkit gene is Pax6/eyeless, which controls <b>eye</b> <b>formation</b> in all animals. It has been found to produce eyes in mice and Drosophila, even if mouse Pax6/eyeless was expressed in Drosophila.|$|E

During the next four days, the depression crossed Cuba and later made landfall near Cross City, Florida. After striking Florida, the system curved northeastward and soon dissipated over southeastern Georgia on July 2. The depression spawned two tornadoes, one of which destroyed two aircraft at Palm Beach International Airport; the other touched down in Vero Beach and caused minimal effects.

40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila eye disc is a sac {{of single}} layer {{epithelium}} with two opposing sides, the peripodial membrane (PM) and the disc proper (DP).

40|$|AbstractThe {{initiation}} of <b>eye</b> <b>formation</b> in all seeing animals {{is controlled by}} a group of selector genes that together forms the retinal determination cascade. In Drosophila, mice and humans, loss-of-function mutations lead to defects in eye and/or head development. While ectopic expression of these genes is sufficient to direct non-retinal tissues towards an eye fate, the ability of each gene to initiate <b>eye</b> <b>formation</b> is neither unlimited nor equal. A particularly enigmatic observation has been that one member of the cascade, sine oculis (so), which {{is a member of the}} SIX family of homeobox transcription factors, is unable to initiate eye development in non-retinal tissues. It is in contrast to every other retinal determination gene including optix, another Six family member, which can induce <b>eye</b> <b>formation</b> when expressed on its own. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast to published reports, expression of so on its own is sufficient to induce eye development within non-retinal tissues. We have extended results from prior reports on binding partner selectivity and DNA binding sites by conducting a structure/function analysis of the SO and OPTIX proteins. Here we demonstrate that the SIX domains and C-terminal portions of the SO and OPTIX proteins are required for functional specificity of SIX class transcription factors while the homeodomain of these proteins are interchangeable.

40|$|Eyes absent (Eya) is {{a highly}} conserved {{transcription}} cofactor and protein phosphatase that plays {{an essential role in}} eye development and survival in Drosophila.

In the current study, we generated a series of genomic rescue transgenes to investigate how loss- and gain-of-function mutations at these two MAPK target sites within Eya affect Drosophila survival and normal eye formation: eya(+) GR, the wild-type control; eya(SA) GR, which lacks phosphorylation at the two target residues; and eya(SDE) GR, which contains phosphomimetic amino acids at the same two residues. Contrary to the previous studies in ectopic eye development, all eya genomic transgenes tested rescue both <b>eye</b> <b>formation</b> and survival equally effectively.
