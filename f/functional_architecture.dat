5|$|Considering mental {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism {{makes it possible}} to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of <b>functional</b> <b>architecture.</b> These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of <b>functional</b> <b>architecture</b> with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E

50|$|Having {{read the}} {{definition}} of a <b>functional</b> software <b>architecture</b> {{at the beginning of this}} entry we can see a <b>functional</b> software <b>architecture</b> as a type of enterprise architecture that can be used as a rich reference for the development of an integrated information system. Naming it a <b>functional</b> software <b>architecture</b> encourages practitioners to use it as a strategic input for a technical architecture. A formal mapping between a <b>functional</b> software <b>architecture</b> and a type of ADL is therefore needed. In this way the formal use and reuse of enterprise architectures as strategic input for software architectures can be realized.|$|R

The primarily reason to imply SOA {{is its ability to}} standardize way for formulating separation of concerns and combining them to meet the requirements of business processes (BPs). Many accredited research efforts have proven the advantages to separate the concerns in the aspects of one or more <b>functional</b> <b>architectures</b> such as application, data, platform, and infrastructure. However, there is not much attention to streamline the approach when differentiating composite services derived utilizing granular services identified for <b>functional</b> <b>architectures.</b> The purpose of this effort is to provide an empirical method to rationalize differentiated services (DSs) in principles and categories of DS compositions. Furthermore, the paper represents an approach to evaluate velocity of an enterprise and corresponding index formulation to continuously monitor the maintainability of DSs...|$|R

2500|$|From {{the early}} 1950s he {{increasingly}} focused on architecture, advocating more just human and environmental friendly buildings. This began with manifestos, essays and demonstrations.

He rejected the straight line and the <b>functional</b> <b>architecture.</b> In Munich in 1967 he gave a lecture called [...] "Speech in Nude for the Right to a Third Skin".

So that it will be visible from afar to everyone in the street that someone lives there who is different from the imprisoned, enslaved, standardised man who lives next door."

40|$|Goal-directed human {{behaviors}} {{are driven by}} motives. Motives are, however, purely mental constructs that are not directly observable. Here, we show that the brain's <b>functional</b> network <b>architecture</b> captures information that predicts different motives behind the same altruistic act with high accuracy. In contrast, mere activity in these regions contains no information about motives. Empathy-based altruism is primarily characterized by a positive connectivity from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to the anterior insula (AI), whereas reciprocity-based altruism additionally invokes strong positive connectivity from the AI to the ACC and even stronger positive connectivity from the AI to the ventral striatum. Moreover, predominantly selfish individuals show distinct <b>functional</b> <b>architectures</b> compared to altruists, and they only increase altruistic behavior in response to empathy inductions, but not reciprocity inductions...|$|R

40|$|The {{representation}} of navigational optic flow across the inferior parietal lobule {{was assessed using}} optical imaging of intrinsic signals in behaving monkeys. The exposed cortex, corresponding to the dorsal-most portion of areas 7 a and dorsal prelunate (DP), was imaged in two hemispheres of two rhesus monkeys. The monkeys actively attended to changes in motion stimuli while fixating. Radial expansion and contraction, and rotation clockwise and counter-clockwise optic flow stimuli were presented concentric to the fixation point at two angles of gaze to assess the interrelationship between the eye position and optic flow signal. The cortical response depended upon the type of flow and was modulated by eye position. The optic flow selectivity was embedded in a patchy architecture within the gain field architecture. All four optic flow stimuli tested were represented in areas 7 a and DP. The location of the patches varied across days. However the spatial periodicity of the patches remained constant across days at ∼ 950 and 1100 µm for the two animals examined. These optical recordings agree with previous electrophysiological studies of area 7 a, and provide new evidence for flow selectivity in DP and a fine scale description of its cortical topography. That the <b>functional</b> <b>architectures</b> for optic flow can change over time was unexpected. These and earlier results also from inferior parietal lobule support the inclusion of both static and dynamic <b>functional</b> <b>architectures</b> that define association cortical areas and ultimately support complex cognitive function...|$|R
