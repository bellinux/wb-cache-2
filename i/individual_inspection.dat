40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} whether inflation persists in energy prices of OECD countries. The method of choice for this purpose appears naturally to be panel unit root tests. Using three unit root tests we investigate the unit root hypothesis for an energy price on an unbalanced panel of all 34 OECD countries for the period from the first quarter of 1979 to the first quarter of 2012. The main findings of this paper indicate that; inflation is not uniformly persistent for all OECD countries. However <b>individual</b> <b>inspections</b> support the fact that Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Korea, Poland, Slovak Republic, Turkey and United Kingdom exhibit a persistent inflation in energy commodities.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} state judiciary presence on rent extraction in Brazilian local governments. We measure rents as irregularities related to waste or corruption uncovered by auditors. Our unique dataset {{at the level of}} <b>individual</b> <b>inspections</b> allows us to separately examine extensive and intensive margins of rent extraction. The identification strategy is based on an institutional rule of state judiciary branches according to which prosecutors and judges tend to be assigned to the most populous among contiguous counties forming a judiciary district. Our research design exploits this rule by comparing counties that are largest in their district to counties with identical population size from other districts in the same state, where they are not the most populous. IV estimates suggest that state judiciary presence reduces the share of inspections with irregularities related to waste or corruption by about 10 percent or 0. 3 standard deviations. In contrast, we find no effect on the intensive margin of rent extraction. Finally, our estimates suggest that judicial presence reduces rent extraction only for first-term mayors.

40|$|For {{more than}} twenty-five years {{software}} inspections have been considered an effective method for defect detection. Inspections have been investigated through controlled experiments in university environment and industry case studies. However, in most cases software inspections {{have been used for}} defect detection in documents of conventional structured development process. Therefore, there is a significant lack of information about how inspections should be applied to Object-Oriented artifacts, such as Object-Oriented code and design diagrams. In addition, extensive work is needed to determine whether some inspection techniques can be more beneficial than others. Most inspection experiments include inspection meetings after <b>individual</b> <b>inspection</b> is completed. However, several researchers suggested that inspection meetings may not be necessary since an insignificant number of new defects are found as a result of inspection meeting. Moreover, inspection meetings have been found to suffer from process loss. This paper presents the findings of a controlled experiment that was conducted to investigate the performance of individual inspectors as well as 3 -person teams in Object-Oriented design document inspection. Documents were written using the notation of Unified Modelling Language. Two reading techniques, namely Checklist-based reading (CBR) and Perspective-based reading (PBR), were used during experiment. We found that both techniques are similar with respect to defect detection effectiveness during <b>individual</b> <b>inspection</b> as well as during inspection meetings. Investigating the usefulness of inspection meetings, we found out that the teams that used CBR technique exhibited significantly smaller meeting gains (number of new defect first found during team meeting) than meeting losses (number of defects first identified by an individual but never included into defect list by a team); meanwhile the meeting gains were similar to meeting losses of the teams that used PBR technique.

40|$|Introduction It {{is largely}} {{accepted}} that formal inspection {{is the most}} effective means of finding defects, so that it {{plays an important role in}} the software development process. Preparation for the inspection (<b>individual</b> <b>inspection)</b> and the logging meeting form the major phases in the conventional inspection process. Face-to-face meetings typically provide a natural way of negotiating and collecting opinions. The problem is that these meetings also cause resource problems, i. e. they waste time and are difficult to arrange. A shift to more flexible implementation of meetings is thus an understandable alternative. Flexibility is thus the motivation for finding new types of inspection meetings, such as the virtual logging meeting, limited logging meeting, pair inspection and no-logging meeting inspection. The virtual logging meeting is the most interesting of these, because it provides at the same time both a disciplined and a flexible way of inspecting a document. Logging ma...|$|E
