This conversion of fatty acids was also induced by 4 -chlorophenol in nongrowing cells in which the de novo synthesis of lipids had stopped, as shown by incorporation experiments with labeled acetate. The isomerization of the double bond in the presence of chloramphenicol indicates a constitutively operating enzyme system.

40|$|Guava {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{complete}} and balanced fruits in in terms of s nutritional value. Highly perishable, due to its intense metabolism during ripening, its shelf life can reach 3 to 5 days under room temperature.

The loss of firmness during the guava ripening is due to hydrolytic enzyme activity, which promotes intense solubilization of the cell wall pectins. Given the above, with the purpose of trying to explain the rapid firmness decrease, the centesimal composition and sugar fraction of the guava fruit were determined during ripening at room temperature.

In spite of the resistance of alkanolamines to chemical breakdown, plant and laboratory reports indicate that, on prolonged use, alkanolamines may be transformed into undesirable products from which the amines are not easily recovered. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as 'amine degradation', not only leads to amine losses, but may also contribute to operational problems such as foaming, corrosion, high solution viscosity and fouling as a result of decreasing the plant life. Amine based gas purification plants having absorption and stripping system, solvents are degraded at these two units mainly by oxidative degradation at absorber condition and thermal degradation at stripper condition.

The aim of this study was to quantify the NH 3, N 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4 emissions from two pig solid manure heaps, turned and not turned, in order to examine the effect of turning on gaseous emissions and to obtain additional information about emissions during composting in commercial conditions. The manure produced from the fattening of 72 pigs on straw bedding was divided between two identical heaps and stored outside on a concrete area for three months during autumn 2004. One heap was turned at day 0, 11 and 27. Gaseous emissions (NH 3, N 2 O, CH 4, CO 2, H 2 O) of both heaps, covered for the purpose by ventilated greenhouses, were continuously measured over four periods (57 days in total). The tracer method, using SF 6, was used to measure the ventilation rate in the greenhouses. Concentrations inside and outside the greenhouses (to have a differential) were measured by photoacoustic <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> with a gas analyser coupled to a multipoint sampler and closer. Emissions were calculated by combining various flows and differential concentrations and interpolated between the different measuring periods. Results show that emission kinetics were very similar for the two heaps, except after turning, when emissions are given a new impetus.

The second group of fiber optic sensors uses sol-gel derived porous silica materials doped with nanometer particles of noble metals in the form of fiber or coating for sensing trace H{sub 2 }, NH{sub 3 } and HCl in gas samples at for applications ambient temperature. The third classes of fiber optic sensors use sol-gel derived semiconductor metal oxide coating on the surface of silica optical fiber as transducers for selectively sensing H{sub 2 }, CH{sub 4 } and CO at high temperature. In addition, optical fiber temperature sensors use the fluorescence signal of rare-earth metal ions doped porous silica optical fiber or the optical absorption signal of thermochromic metal oxide materials coated on the surface of silica optical fibers have also been developed for monitoring gas temperature of corrosive gas. Based on the results obtained from this project, the principle of fiber optic sensor techniques for monitoring matrix gas components as well as trace components of coal gasification derived syngas has been established. Prototype sensors for sensing trace ammonia and hydrogen sulfide in gasification derived syngas have been built up in our laboratory and have been tested using gas samples with matrix gas composition similar to that of gasification derived fuel gas. Test results illustrated the feasibility of these sensors for applications in IGCC processes...|$|E

This sensitive method of detecting <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> was demonstrated for a single bovine serum albumin (BSA) molecule labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 by determining the vibrational <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> spectrum of the backbone vibrations of the α-helical structure in the wavelength region around 6 μm (1650 cm - 1). In addition to measuring the vibrational <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> spectrum, the visible fluorescence can be simultaneously used for imaging of the same dye-labeled single protein molecules...|$|R
