5|$|Roddy Piper was Special Guest Referee for a bout between Jeff Hardy and Scott Hall, {{which was}} the {{following}} contest. After the two fought for a few minutes, Hardy gained the pinfall victory after he jumped off the top rope and performed a Swanton Bomb, a high-angle front flip from the top rope, onto Hall who was laying <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mat. Abyss attacked Hardy after the match finished, and lifted Hardy up onto his shoulders and then dropped to a seated position, a move which Abyss dubbed the Shock Treatment.|$|E
25|$|Each cup's underwire at {{the front}} should lie <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sternum (not the breast), along the inframammary fold, and should not dig into the chest or the breasts, rub or poke out {{at the front}}.|$|E
25|$|It {{is located}} at the {{northern}} most edge of the sunken patio-altar complex. It consists of two concentric stone circles, the outer circle measuring about 20 meters (65ft.) in diameter, with no other visible structural remains. The circle is not complete, its south side, facing the altar is <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> altar structure.|$|E

25|$|African Americans have {{developed}} a large variety of ways to wear dreadlocked hair. Specific elements of these styles include the flat-twist, in which a section of locks are rolled together <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> scalp to create an effect similar to the cornrows, and braided dreadlocks. Examples include flat-twisted half-back styles, flat-twisted mohawk styles, braided buns and braid-outs (or lock crinkles).|$|E
25|$|All Folds {{are born}} with straight, {{unfolded}} ears, and those with the Fold gene will begin to show the fold usually within about 21 days. The kittens that do not develop folded ears are known as Straights. The original cats only had one fold in their ears, but due to selective breeding, breeders have increased the fold to a double or triple crease that causes the ear to lie totally <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> head.|$|E
25|$|While {{initially}} {{only the}} players on the field could see the extent of the damage to Theismann's leg, the reverse-angle instant replay (shown multiple times) provided a clearer view of what had actually happened—Theismann's lower leg bones were broken midway between his knee and his ankle, such that his leg from his foot to his mid-shin was lying <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ground while the upper part of his shin up to his knee was at a 45-degree angle to the lower part of his leg.|$|E

50|$|The pier table {{may often}} be semicircular, <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> edge <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall. Pier tables from later periods are often large and quite ornate. Well-known {{designers}} such as Duncan Phyfe, Robert Adam, George Hepplewhite, and Thomas Sheraton all designed and manufactured notable examples of pier tables.|$|R
25|$|At 15.00 on 16 September 2009 a Red Line Luas tram and a {{double-decker}} number 16 Dublin Bus collided at {{the crossroads}} of Abbey Street and O'Connell Street in Dublin city centre. The front section of the tram was derailed in the incident and the driver's cabin was crushed <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> left hand side of the bus. At least 21 people were injured and three were seriously hurt, including the driver of the tram who had to be cut out from the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means {{you have to have the}} coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} by their name, their coats occur in light golden to dark golden colours. The topcoat is water-resistant and slightly wavy, and sheds {{in small amounts}} throughout the year. The undercoat is soft and keeps the retriever cool in summer and warm in winter; it sheds {{in the spring and}} fall. It usually lies <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> belly. The Golden's coat should never be too long, as this may prove to be a disservice to it in the field, especially when retrieving game. Golden Retrievers have mild feathering on the backs of their fore legs and heavier feathering on the fronts of their necks, backs of their thighs and the bottoms of their tails.|$|E
50|$|Birds lacking {{binocular}} vision have poor depth perception, {{and can find}} a bird bath off-putting if they're unable to judge the water's depth. Leaning a stick or <b>flat</b> rock <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bird bath rim as a ramp to allow them gradual access into the water may allay their fear.|$|R
5000|$|In linguistics, a denti-alveolar {{consonant}} or dento-alveolar consonant is a consonant that is articulated with a <b>flat</b> tongue <b>against</b> <b>the</b> alveolar {{ridge and}} upper teeth, such as [...] and [...] in languages such as Spanish and French. That is, a denti-alveolar consonant {{is one that}} is alveolar and laminal.|$|R
50|$|On 11 July 2014, the Almaty inter-district {{administrative}} court sentenced correspondent Andrei Tsukanov to 15 days of arrest for covering the protest action of <b>flat</b> letters <b>against</b> <b>the</b> arbitrariness of police officers. Tsukanov was detained {{when he was}} making video recording. During the arrest, the police officers beat Andrei and confiscated his press ID.|$|R
25|$|The {{minimum height}} {{requirement}} for Mission: Space is 44inches (112cm). Spiels and warnings throughout the attraction caution {{that people who}} do not like enclosed dark spaces, simulators, spinning, or are prone to motion sickness should not ride. Signs also warn that the ride may cause nausea, headache, dizziness, or disorientation, and that people prone to motion sickness, or who have a headache or an inner ear problem, or who have a history of migraines, vertigo, or elevated anxiety also should not ride. These signs are similar to those present at considerably less-intense rides in the same park, such as Soarin'. There are also signs which instruct the rider to keep their head <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> headrest, stating that if one ignores this, the centrifugal motion acting on one's head can cause undesirable effects such as dizziness and/or headaches, or possibly even more serious effects.|$|E
25|$|Dholes produce {{whistles}} {{resembling the}} calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as coo-coo. How this sound is produced is unknown, {{though it is}} thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and yapping cries. In contrast to wolves, dholes do not howl or bark. Dholes have a complex body language. Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful dholes open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening dholes pucker their lips forward in a snarl and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical. When afraid, they pull their lips back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> skull.|$|E
25|$|Domes {{built with}} steel and {{concrete}} {{were able to}} achieve very large spans. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Guastavino family, {{a father and son}} team who worked on the eastern seaboard of the United States, further developed the masonry dome, using tiles set <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> surface of the curve and fast-setting Portland cement, which allowed mild steel bar to be used to counteract tension forces. The thin domical shell was further developed with the construction by Walther Bauersfeld of two planetarium domes in Jena, Germany in the early 1920s. They consisting of a triangulated frame of light steel bars and mesh covered by a thin layer of concrete. These are generally taken to be the first modern architectural thin shells. These are also considered the first geodesic domes. Geodesic domes have been used for radar enclosures, greenhouses, housing, and weather stations. Architectural shells had their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, peaking in popularity shortly before the widespread adoption of computers and the finite element method of structural analysis.|$|E

25|$|The {{glycoprotein}} {{shell of}} the mature DENV virion consists of 180 copies each of the E protein and M protein. The immature virion starts out with the E and prM proteins forming 90 heterodimers that give a spiky exterior to the viral particle. This immature viral particle buds into the endoplasmic reticulum and eventually travels via the secretory pathway to the Golgi apparatus. As the virion passes through the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) it is exposed to low pH. This acidic environment causes a conformational change in the E protein which disassociates it from the prM protein and causes it to form E homodimers. These homodimers lie <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> viral surface giving the maturing virion a smooth appearance. During this maturation pr peptide is cleaved from the M peptide by the host protease, furin. The M protein then acts as a transmembrane protein under the E-protein {{shell of the}} mature virion. The pr peptide stays associated with the E protein until the viral particle is released into the extracellular environment. This pr peptide acts like a cap, covering the hydrophobic fusion loop of the E protein until the viral particle has exited the cell.|$|E
25|$|If {{the straps}} {{dig into the}} {{shoulder}}, leaving red marks or causing shoulder or neck pain, the bra band is not offering enough support. If breast tissue overflows {{the bottom of the}} bra, under the armpit, or over the top edge of the bra cup, the cup size is too small. Loose fabric in the bra cup indicates the cup size is too big. If the underwires poke the breast under the armpit or if the bra's center panel does not lie <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sternum, the cup size is too small. If the band rides up the torso at the back, the band size is too big. If it digs into the flesh, causing the flesh to spill over the edges of the band, the band is too small. If the band feels tight, {{this may be due to}} the cups being too small; instead of going up in band size a person should try going up in cup size. Similarly a band might feel too loose if the cup is too big. It is possible to test whether a bra band is too tight or too loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that the cups are at the back and then check for fit and comfort. Generally, if the wearer must continually adjust the bra or experiences general discomfort, the bra is a poor fit and she should get a new fitting.|$|E
500|$|The shoots have {{at least}} three {{consecutive}} tendrils. Young shoots are fully open and have very dense hairs of medium anthocyanin coloration that lie <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tip. [...] The internode of the young shoot is green with red stripes on the front (dorsal) side and solid green on the back (ventral) side.|$|E
5000|$|The Western riding disciplines, {{including}} the western performance disciplines such as reining and western pleasure, generally cut a bridle path {{that is as}} long as the length of the horse's ear when laid <b>flat</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mane, generally no more than 6 to 8 inches. Stock horse breeds, including Quarter Horses, American Paint Horses, and Appaloosas, use this style of cut.|$|R
5000|$|Making custom wigs {{starts with}} {{measuring}} the subject's head. The natural hair is arranged in <b>flat</b> curls <b>against</b> <b>the</b> head as the various measurements are taken. It is often helpful {{to make a}} pattern from layers of transparent adhesive tape applied over a piece of plastic wrap, on which the natural hairline can be traced accurately. These measurements are then transferred to the [...] "block", a wooden or cork-stuffed canvas form {{the same size and}} shape as the client's head.|$|R
50|$|Uglow's {{paintings}} made whilst {{he was an}} artist-in-residence at the Cyprus College of Art in 1980 {{and again}} in 1983 are almost wholly landscapes, and he used the clear summer skies of Cyprus as a stark contrast of <b>flat</b> colour <b>against</b> <b>the</b> geometrical and sculptural forms he painted at ground level. But Uglow was also well travelled to other countries, spending six months in Italy on a Prix de Rome scholarship in 1953, and later making work in France, Spain, Morocco, Turkey, India and China.|$|R
500|$|The mature {{leaves on}} the vine have three lobes with open upper lateral sinuses (spaces between the lobes) of medium depth. [...] The main vein is {{slightly}} longer than the petiole (stalk attaching the leaf blade to the stem), and the petiole sinus opens widely. [...] Between the veins {{on the underside of}} both the mature and young leaf there are dense hairs that lie <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> surface. [...] The teeth {{on the edge of the}} leaf blade are convex on both sides, medium in size, and short relative to their width. [...] Young leaf blades are dark copper red on the upper surface.|$|E
500|$|... "Return the Favor" [...] is {{described}} as an electro-dance-pop record, with a future-like sound, including euro-style synths. Dan Nishimoto of Prefix Magazine noted that the song includes Timbaland's [...] "signature dizzying 22nd-century flair that he's been employing ever since 2006." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic noted the song as a standout track from In a Perfect World.... According to J.K. Glei of Cincinnati Metromix said the song has [...] "cascading synths," [...] and a [...] "classic pop structure." [...] However Glei said that Hilson's vocals [...] "feel <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> driving beat" [...] and that Timbaland [...] "fully phones it in." [...] While noting the song [...] "follows the same blueprint" [...] of Nelly Furtado's [...] "Promiscuous", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{said it was a}} [...] "satisfying pop romp" [...] and said even though Hilson lacked Furtado's distinctiveness, that it [...] "shouldn't have a problem striking a chord at radio." ...|$|E
500|$|The underwire bra design {{emerged and}} took {{hold in the}} United States {{starting}} in the 1930s. Helene Pons received a patent in 1931 for a brassiere design that incorporated an [...] "open-ended wire loop" [...] that laid <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> chest, encircling the {{bottom and sides of}} each breast. A 1932 patent describes a U-shaped piece of wire used between the cups to keep the breasts separated. A patent issued in 1938 to Pauline Boris describes a [...] "breast support" [...] which used pieces of wire to entirely encircle each breast. In 1940, Walter Emmett Williams was issued a patent which described a wire framework, shaped like a spiderweb, that encircles and covers each breast to provide support. Although development of the underwire bra started in the 1930s, it did not gain widespread popularity until the 1950s, when the end of World War II freed metal for domestic use.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{it struck}} me, {{when we began}} to visit {{individuals}} in their cells, and to traverse the passages in which those cells were, {{and to have the}} manner of the going to chapel and so forth, explained to us, that there was a strong probability of the prisoners knowing a good deal about each other, and of their carrying on a pretty complete system of intercourse. This, at the time I write, has been proved, I believe, to be the case; but, as it would have been <b>flat</b> blasphemy <b>against</b> <b>the</b> system to have hinted such a doubt then, I looked out for the penitence as diligently as I could.|$|R
5000|$|Westminster council {{argued that}} the term [...] "working class" [...] was now {{meaningless}} and that the stipulation should be overturned, allowing them to sell the leaseholds of <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> to anyone, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> present duke's wishes. The Duke maintained that the properties should remain available as low-rent accommodation for {{those who could not}} afford to purchase leaseholds.

25|$|They usually roost {{with their}} ventral side <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> a surface. <b>The</b> Mauritian tomb bat is nocturnal and rests during the day; however, {{it does not}} sleep much and remains watchful while {{roosting}}. If disturbed, they will fly off to another site or move quickly up under the eaves of the building. Very rarely do they travel far from their day roosting site, and roosts are often recolonized. Over time these sites become stained with gular sack secretions and urine. The stains are typically a rectangular brown shape roughly 150mm long and 100mm wide.|$|R
