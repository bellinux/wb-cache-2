5000|$|Objection: [...] "If {{extension}} and figure exist only <b>in</b> the <b>mind,</b> {{it follows that}} the mind is extended and figured…." [...] Extension would be an attribute that is predicated of the subject, the <b>mind,</b> <b>in</b> which it exists. Answer: Extension and figure are <b>in</b> the <b>mind</b> because they are ideas that are perceived by the mind. They are not <b>in</b> the <b>mind</b> as attributes that are predicated of the mind, which is the subject. The color red may be an idea <b>in</b> the <b>mind,</b> but that doesn't mean that the mind is red.|$|R
5|$|The Portland {{class were}} also {{designed}} with more advanced armament <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Their main guns {{were the first}} to be specially designed to fire long-point projectiles with a streamlined shape, which increased the guns' range when compared with older cruiser guns. Such projectiles were in use by ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, which until that point out-ranged U.S. cruisers with their firepower. The New Orleans class was designed with these lessons <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> intended to create a better balance between protection, armament and speed.|$|E

5|$|After his {{accession}} {{to the throne}} in 1820, King GeorgeIV continued the renovation with the idea <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace {{with the help of}} his architect John Nash. The external façade was designed keeping <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the French neo-classical influence preferred by GeorgeIV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of GeorgeIV in 1830, his younger brother King WilliamIV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. After the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{surprised}} jazz listeners upon its release in 1977, Goin' Home was praised by music critics for its reverent tone and stylistic deviation from Shepp's previous free jazz works.

Goin' Home was reissued on CD by SteepleChase Records on May 3, 1994.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reference}} to major morphological {{categories such as}} root, stem, leaf, and trichome are useful, one has to keep <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that these categories are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results.

40|$|<b>In</b> the <b>minds</b> of the antiglobalization {{movement}} and the anti-American left, and perhaps <b>in</b> the <b>minds</b> of Islamic terrorists themselves, {{the growth of the}} American Empire has caused the growth of Islamic terrorism. But <b>in</b> the <b>minds</b> of the American political and economic elite, and certainly <b>in</b> the <b>minds</b> of the officials of the Bush administration, the growth of Islamic terrorism has become the cause of the growth of the American Empire. As it happens, both causal theories are probably correct...|$|R

5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback to keep <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> is that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E
