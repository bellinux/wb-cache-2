25|$|Yusuf Ziya Özcan, {{president}} of YÖK, announced in March 2008 military service duration would be equal for everyone, holding or not holding a degree would not matter. İlker Başbuğ, then {{president of}} Turkish Armed Forces, said that short term military service and reserve officers system would be abandoned. In this system he proposed, <b>everybody</b> <b>would</b> spend 12 or 15 months in conscription. Instead of reserve officers, officers would be contracted. In October 2010, instead of the system proposed before, shortening the duration of military service is proposed. In this proposition, short-term privates would spend 4 months and other people would spend 9 months in conscription. Conscripted 250000 people would be released early. TSK, refused this system claiming it would create a shortage of soldiers. However, some people argue conscripts are forced to work for officers' private needs. This includes driving, cooking, hairdressing and serving meals in officers' clubs, teaching to officers' children. Some of the conscripts are made officers' personal assistants. Number of these conscripts {{are estimated to be}} 231,000.|$|E

500|$|Gregor hypothesizes that Sandwich {{included}} a cryptic repeating segment in the prophecy to drum {{the meaning of}} these lines into the heads of his readers, or to emphasize their importance. The prophecy's other stanzas describe the plague and who it affects, call for the warrior's return, explain {{how to find the}} cure and win allies amongst the nonhuman species, and warn strongly against allowing a war to start in the Underland. Gregor refers to this final point as [...] "Sandwich's usual prediction that if things didn't work out, there would be total destruction and <b>everybody</b> <b>would</b> end up dead." [...] As with other prophecies in The Underland Chronicles, its meaning [...] "only becomes clear in the later stages of the book".|$|E

500|$|As the song's {{popularity}} {{continued to}} rise, it caused {{the share price}} of the song's music label YG Entertainment to gain as much as 50% on the Korea Exchange. DI Corporation, whose executive Chairman Park Won-Ho is Psy's father, saw its share price increase by 568.8% {{within a few months}} of the song's release despite making a year-over-year loss. Soon, [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] began {{to attract the attention of}} several business and political leaders, including UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who recognized the song as a [...] "force for world peace". During his meeting with Psy at the United Nations Headquarters, he commented, [...] "We have tough negotiations in the United Nations. In such a case I was also thinking of playing Gangnam Style-dance so that <b>everybody</b> <b>would</b> stop and dance. Maybe you can bring UN style." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a recent}} book about the Bomb project, Graham Farmelo wrote that [...] "Chadwick did {{more than any other}} {{scientist}} to give Churchill the Bomb.... Chadwick was tested almost to the breaking point." [...] So worried that he could not sleep, Chadwick resorted to sleeping pills, which he continued to take for most of his remaining years. Chadwick later said that he realised that [...] "a nuclear bomb was not only possible—it was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us. <b>Everybody</b> <b>would</b> think about them before long, and some country would put them into action". Sir Hermann Bondi suggested that it was fortunate that Chadwick, not Rutherford, was the doyen of UK physics at the time, as the latter's prestige might otherwise have overpowered Chadwick's interest in [...] "looking forward" [...] to the Bomb's prospects.|$|E
500|$|Muriel Latow {{was then}} an {{aspiring}} interior decorator, {{and owner of}} the Latow Art Gallery in the East 60s in Manhattan. She told Warhol that he should paint [...] "Something you see every day and something that <b>everybody</b> <b>would</b> recognize. Something like a can of Campbell's Soup." [...] Ted Carey, who was there at the time, said that Warhol responded by exclaiming: [...] "Oh that sounds fabulous." [...] According to Carey, Warhol went to a supermarket the following day and bought a case of [...] "all the soups", which Carey said he saw when he stopped by Warhol's apartment the next day. When the art critic G. R. Swenson asked Warhol in 1963 why he painted soup cans, the artist replied, [...] "I used to drink it, I used to have the same lunch every day, for twenty years." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Drake going up an {{elevator}} while Songz sings shirtless {{on the edge}} of a bed with Drake laying naked on the other side looking on. Drake then ends up on a balcony singing in front of the Toronto skyline. Both are shown in scenes contemplating intermixed with Songz joining Drake on the balcony. Subsequently scenes are shown of Drake and Songz riding through Toronto nightlife, along with the contemplative scenes, such as a young boy playing basketball in which Songz has an illusion that it is him, and little girl blowing a dandelion. The video ends with the skyline and a quote stating, [...] "Making your mark on the world is hard. If it were easy, <b>everybody</b> <b>would</b> do it. But it's not. It takes patience, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way. The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won't. It's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere."- Barack Obama ...|$|E
500|$|As a result, Chamberlain {{was less}} dominant, taking only 14% of the team's shots (in his 50.4 ppg season, it was 35.3%), but {{extremely}} efficient: he averaged a career-low 24.1 points, but {{he led the}} league in rebounds (24.2), ended third in assists (7.8), had a record breaking [...]683 field goal accuracy, and played strong defense. For these feats, Chamberlain earned his third MVP award. The Sixers charged their way to a then-record 68–13 season, including a record 46–4 start. In addition, the formerly egotistical Chamberlain began to praise his teammates, lauding hardworking Luke Jackson as the [...] "ultimate power forward", calling Hal Greer a deadly jumpshooter, and point guard Wali Jones an excellent defender and outsider scorer. Off the court, the center invited the team to restaurants and paid the entire bill, knowing he earned 10 times more than all the others. Greer, who was considered a consummate professional and often clashed with the center because of his attitude, spoke positively of the new Chamberlain: [...] "You knew in a minute the Big Fella [...] was ready to go... and <b>everybody</b> <b>would</b> follow." ...|$|E
500|$|Academic {{papers at}} ISMB were {{traditionally}} {{presented in a}} single track. Presentations at ISMB 1994 were split further into three themed days, focusing on protein secondary structure prediction, sequence analysis and AI techniques and biochemical applications, respectively. As attendance at ISMB increased, the single track approach became increasingly unsustainable and two parallel tracks were introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2004. Further expansion meant that, by ISMB 2012, over 200 talks were presented in nine parallel tracks including multiple proceedings tracks, a highlights track and a technology track. The introduction of parallel tracks to ISMB was controversial. Christopher Rawlings (head of Computational and Systems Biology at Rothamsted Research and organiser of ISMB 1995) has said: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} people who wanted to keep it more strongly in the AI intelligent systems model and have a meeting where <b>everybody</b> <b>would</b> go to everything. But it just grew too big. We just couldn’t." [...] As the number of submitted proceedings papers has increased, the acceptance rate has decreased dramatically, from 75% in 1994 to 13% in 2012. ISMB proceedings from 1993-2000 were published by AAAI Press. Since ISMB 2001, proceedings have been published in the journal Bioinformatics. The number of posters presented at ISMB has also increased dramatically. 25 posters were presented at ISMB 1994; at recent ISMB meetings, 500-1,000 posters have been presented in multiple poster sessions.|$|E

We also see a grown up version of him on the laptop. In another episode, titled [...] "Stop and Smell Up the Flowers", Pepé Le Pew is shown to be good friends with a baby Gossamer, and seemed slightly older than his previous appearance.|$|E

[...] "I love that book. I mean, it's basically [...] a kid born in the same city as me — it almost felt predestined", Shyamalan said. [...] "But I was hesitant because the book has kind of a twist ending. And I was concerned that as soon as you put my name on it, <b>everybody</b> <b>would</b> have a different experience. Whereas if someone else did it, it would be much more satisfying, I think. Expectations, you've got to be aware of them. I'm wishing them all great luck. I hope they make a beautiful movie".|$|E
2500|$|On March 20, 2009, {{the town}} of Esparto, California was shaken and windows were {{shattered}} by a blast created by [...] of ANFO during filming of the myth [...] "Knock Your Socks Off". Some residents were upset that the blast took place without [...] "telling anyone". Chief Barry Burns, of Esparto Fire Department, had several firefighters {{on hand for the}} explosion. He said he made the decision not to notify anyone in town for safety's sake. [...] "MythBusters {{is supposed to be a}} really popular show. <b>Everybody</b> <b>would</b> have been out there. We would have had to cancel it because it would have been too dangerous." [...] Representatives from the show replaced some of the windows that same day. The experiment did air, but the hosts recounted in a 2011 special episode ("Location, Location, Location") that they have never returned to the Esparto quarry as a result of the mishap.|$|E
2500|$|... "She was {{the ideal}} mother", Billingsley {{said of her}} {{character}} in 1997 in TV Guide. [...] "Some people think she was weakish, but I don't. She was the love in that family. She {{set a good example}} for what a wife could be. I had two boys at home when I did the show. I think the character became kind of like me and vice versa. I've never known where one started and where one stopped." [...] As for the idealized TV family on Leave It to Beaver, which continues in reruns on cable {{more than half a century}} after its debut, Billingsley had her own explanation for the Cleavers' enduring appeal. [...] "Good grief," [...] she told TV Guide, [...] "I think <b>everybody</b> <b>would</b> like a family like that. Wouldn't it be nice if you came home from school and there was Mom standing there with her little apron and cookies waiting?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Photographers find perp walks {{their second}} most-dreaded {{assignment}} after {{going to the}} home of someone who has recently died to ask for a picture. They must wait a long time for a period of a few seconds in which they will be competing with a potentially large group of other photographers and television crews. This presents the possibility that they can be trampled beneath the group, as depicted in the 1994 film The Paper, and the difficulty of photographing a defendant who may be looking downward to keep his face from view. Marty Lederhandler, an Associated Press photographer who worked for {{the last half of the}} 20th century and shot the perp walks of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, as well as David Berkowitz, describes the perp walk as [...] "it's, 'He'll be out in 10 minutes.' You line up. He comes out and into the car, and you've got your picture. Nice." [...] When he began in the years after World War II, Lederhandler says, the media was more polite during perp walks than they are now. [...] "We all had the same lenses those days, and <b>everybody</b> <b>would</b> stand 8 or 10 feet back, and nobody was pushing or shoving." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Bianca Jackson has received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike. EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer has described Bianca as [...] "one {{of the most}} popular characters EastEnders has ever had", while James Rampton, journalist for The Independent, has commented that she is [...] "adored". Palmer has suggested that viewers [...] "rooted" [...] for Bianca because [...] "people love a stroppy girl". In 2000, she commented, [...] " [...] makes them laugh. A character like that is about living out your fantasies. <b>Everybody</b> <b>would</b> love to be like Bianca and really say what they think." [...] Following her exit from the serial in September 1999, Palmer said that members of the public would approach her to plead with her to return to EastEnders, as they missed her character and relationship with Ricky. She commented in 2000, [...] "It makes me feel bad. I sometimes think I should go back [...] for everyone else's sake." [...] When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the Birmingham Evening Post said [...] "Good riddance!" [...] She described Bianca as a [...] "king-sized pain in the backside [...] A screeching and screaming virago with a big mouth and pea-sized brain" [...] and a [...] "prize slapper [...] tormented all those whose paths [...] crossed." ...|$|E
