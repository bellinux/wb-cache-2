5|$|Hurricane Fran rapidly tracked {{towards the}} {{northeast}} {{in response to}} an area of low pressure within the westerlies. By October11, the hurricane attained its peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) and its lowest barometric pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg) after bypassing the Azores islands. Situated over exceedingly cold waters, Fran transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on October12 as it neared the French coastline. Shortly before reaching land, the system was absorbed by a cold front. Throughout its existence, Fran <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> land.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all members}} of the genus Collybia, C.cookei grows on the well-rotted, {{blackened}} remains of mushrooms, such as species of Russula, Meripilus giganteus, and Inonotus hispidus. Fruit bodies occasionally grow on well-decayed wood or rich humus. The fruit bodies grow scattered, clustered, or in groups. A field study conducted near a Brass mill in Sweden revealed that heavy metal contamination <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the appearance of the mushroom, possibly because its substrate of partially decomposed fruit bodies has a lower metal concentration that the underlying topsoil.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Albuera <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> {{the overall}} {{course of the}} war, but it had shown that British and Spanish troops could work together. On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle. Wellington placed most {{of the blame for}} the losses on Blake, while a dispatch read in the Spanish cortes implied that the British had played only a minor role in the battle, despite their much higher losses.|$|E

With its defences weakened, subsequent Commonwealth attacks on the ridge were successful; Operation Totalize finally managed to wrest the position from its SS defenders on 8 August.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{additional}} critiques as well. One is that NIRA's industry codes interfered with capital markets, inhibiting economic recovery. But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> capital markets one way or the other. Another is that political uncertainty created by the NRA caused a drop in business confidence, inhibiting recovery. But at least one study has shown no effect whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Although {{assault by}} the heavily armed sloop HMS Dart proved successful, the fireships {{achieved}} little {{and various other}} British craft involved in the operation <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the eventual outcome. The French response was disorganised and ineffectual, losing one frigate captured. Three others were almost destroyed, only escaping by cutting their anchor cables and fleeing into the coastal shoals where they ran aground. Although all three frigates were refloated and returned to service, the operation had cost the French heavy casualties. The British force suffered minimal losses, although the exact totals are uncertain. Many of the British officers involved were highly praised and rewarded with promotions and prize money.|$|E

The death of his mother when he {{was three years old}} seemed to have <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> young Edward, as he {{mentioned}} in his letters that he had no recollection of her. His stepmother, Rebecca Biddle, filled the maternal role; Cope referred to her warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James Biddle Cope. Alfred, an orthodox member of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope, in 1821. He was a philanthropist who gave money to the Society of Friends, the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, and the Institute for Colored Youth.|$|E
5|$|Fausto {{steadily}} weakened {{throughout the}} following two days as it moved over progressively cooler waters. By July21, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm and a tropical depression the next day. Early on July23, the depression lacked deep convection and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The low persisted for another day before dissipating over open waters. Hurricane Fausto <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> land, despite passing close to the islands of Clarion and Socorro where high winds, reaching hurricane-force on Socorro, were recorded. Moderate rainfall from the outer bands of the storm amounted to 1.9in (50mm) in the Mexican state of Sinaloa.|$|E
5|$|For his {{performance}} in the 1924 Rose Bowl, Navy quarterback Ira McKee was awarded Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors. McKee completed 16 of 20 passes {{for a total of}} 175 yards, including one pass for a touchdown. McKee also had 85rushing yards on twelve attempts. Washington running back Elmer Tesreau was given the game's Ironman Award, though he <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the game. Against the urging of his coaches, Tesreau had played with boils completely covering one knee.

5|$|For {{six days}} prior to the {{beginning}} of the American offensive, Allied heavy artillery targeted German defenses around Aachen. Although the heavy bombardment forced the German LXXXI Corps to halt all daylight personnel and supply movements, it <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the pillboxes and strongpoints. The opening aerial bombardment on 2 October also caused little damage to German defensive positions; the 450 aircraft which took part in the first wave failed to register a single direct hit on any German pillbox. Their targets had been largely obscured by thick smoke from the Allied artillery barrage. As the aircraft finished their assault, the artillery resumed bombarding the front lines, firing 18,696 shells from 372 gun tubes within a couple of hours.|$|E
5|$|It {{continued}} to organize {{throughout the day}} on June21, developing banding features and increased convection. Several hours after being classified a depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Andres. Upon being named, Andres marked latest date that the first named storm of a season developed since 1969 when Tropical Storm Ava developed on July1 of that year. By the morning of June22, very deep thunderstorm activity existed near the center, and the overall convective pattern had become more symmetric in nature. Favorable conditions, warm sea surface temperatures, allowed Andres to gradually intensify as it tracked near the Mexican coastline. However, strong wind shear, a factor that generally weakens tropical cyclones, <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the developing storm.|$|E
5|$|Princess Charlotte was a {{difficult}} child and indifferent student, with a nervous disposition. Her relationship with her demanding mother was strained. As she grew older, Charlotte developed a penchant for spreading gossip and causing trouble. Eager to escape from parental control, at age sixteen, she married Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Meiningen in 1878. Her husband's weak-willed personality <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> her. Known for spreading gossip and her eccentric personality, Princess Charlotte enjoyed Berlin society while frequently leaving her only child, Princess Feodora, {{in the care of}} family members.

5|$|The {{first major}} British {{deployment}} into the Adriatic came in May 1808, when the frigate HMS Unite under Captain Patrick Campbell arrived off Venice. During May, Campbell severely disrupted French and Italian shipping off the busiest Adriatic seaport and captured three ships sent against {{him by the}} Italian Navy. The French response to these depredations was to despatch the small frigate Var to Venice, an action which <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> British operations. British activity in the Adriatic was however curtailed during {{the year by the}} British war with the Ottoman Empire, which absorbed the scant British naval resources in the Eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} also been {{identified}} in living sapwood, though it is latent at this time, and {{it is probable that}} it waits until the wood begins to die (when it is drier, but contains more oxygen) before the mycelia begin to grow. When the species was inoculated into living wood, it did grow, but only around the inoculation wound; the species did not spread as it would have done on dead wood. Another study found that the species actively colonised partially living branches, causing white rot. However, the species <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the cambium, and was mostly limited to the ends of branches.|$|E
