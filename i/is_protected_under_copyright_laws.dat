40|$|Modern International {{copyright}} law {{is based on}} the Berne Convention which was signed over a century ago in 1886. Software and digital information did not exist when the laws were created, the language of the law is very weak when applied to software. Some enhancements have been made to the law in recent years (DMCA, WIPO), but the language is too vague and allows certain opponents of open source to pervert the spirit of the laws to suite their own needs. The most famous law suite concerning software copyright is that of SCO vs IBM (Linux). SCO’s suite hinges upon Linux using source code from UNIX, this claim is unfounded due to the known and documented evolution of Linux since 1991. Current {{copyright law}} permits companies to assert claims to intellectual property at the source code level. We contend that source code is the implementation of an idea.
