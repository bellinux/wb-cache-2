5|$|The {{island was}} rediscovered and named Ducie Island on 16 March 1791 by Captain Edward Edwards, of , {{who had been}} {{despatched}} from Britain in 1790 to arrest the Bounty mutineers.

If HMS Pandora had maintained its course, it would <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> reached Pitcairn Island and found the Bounty mutineers.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{theory is that}} Leonidas chose to form a rearguard so that the other Greek contingents could get away.

If they had all {{remained}} at the pass, {{they would have been}} encircled and would <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> all been killed. By covering the retreat and continuing to block the pass, Leonidas could save more than 3,000 men, who would be able to fight again.|$|E

5|$|Yet it {{also seems}} to many that science will <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> to explain such experiences. This follows from an {{assumption}} {{about the possibility of}} reductive explanations. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency). In the case of mental states, this means {{that there needs to be}} an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E
