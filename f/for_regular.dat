5|$|The {{school was}} still {{operating}} in 1937, though a public request {{had been made}} <b>for</b> <b>regular</b> transport to take children to the Hagley District School, in consequence of the Hadspen school's impending closure.

5|$|Conversely {{almost any}} UAV could be piloted to crash onto a target in a suicide attack and most could be fitted with an improvised {{explosive}} warhead. However the primary {{use of a}} UAV or UCAV would be for recoverable flight operations carrying reconnaissance equipment and/or munitions. While many UAV designs are explicitly designed with loitering in mind, they are not optimized for a diving attack often lacking forward facing cameras, lacking in control response-speed which is unneeded in regular UAV flight, and are noisy when diving at the target potentially providing warning to the target. UAV's, being designed as multi-use platforms, often have a unit cost that is not appropriate <b>for</b> <b>regular</b> one-time expandable mission use.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s various {{internal}} {{changes and}} improvements {{were made to}} the mechanics.

Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model was added to the range.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Tasmania, Whitemore no longer has {{passenger}} rail transport; the last Tasmanian passenger rail service stopped in 1978 and the service to Whitemore prior to that. Rail transport for Whitemore opened in the late 1870s. The first passenger train was on 27 April 1870 and the rail line opened <b>for</b> <b>regular</b> traffic in February 1871. This transport was from a siding rather than a station. The Whitemore siding did not have a full-time station master and was not a regular stop; passengers had to request the train stop or flag the train for a pickup. The town’s only regular transport services as of 2014 are Redline Coaches' private school-bus services.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The tight {{upper bound}} on the state {{complexity}} of the reverse of R-trivial and J-trivial regular languages of the state complexity n is 2 n− 1. The witness is ternary <b>for</b> R-trivial <b>regular</b> languages and (n − 1) -ary <b>for</b> J-trivial <b>regular</b> languages. In this paper, we prove that the bound can be met neither by a binary R-trivial regular language nor by a J-trivial regular language over an (n − 2) -element alphabet. We provide a characterization of tight bounds <b>for</b> R-trivial <b>regular</b> languages depending on the state complexity of the language {{and the size of}} its alphabet. We show the tight bound <b>for</b> J-trivial <b>regular</b> languages over an (n − 2) -element alphabet and a few tight bounds <b>for</b> binary J-trivial <b>regular</b> languages. The case of J-trivial regular languages over an (n−k) -element alphabet, for 2 ≤ k ≤ n − 3, is open. ...|$|R
