50|$|In the {{mechanical}} example, {{to declare that}} dx is not a geometric displacement because it ignores the dynamic relationship between <b>displacement,</b> <b>force,</b> and energy is not correct. Displacement, as a concept in geometry, {{does not require the}} concepts of energy and force for its definition, and so one might expect that entropy may not require the concepts of energy and temperature for its definition. The situation is not that simple, however. In classical thermodynamics, which is the study of thermodynamics from a purely empirical, or measurement point of view, thermodynamic entropy can only be measured by considering energy and temperature. Clausius' statement dS= Î´Q/T, or, equivalently, when all other effective displacements are zero, dS=dU/T, {{is the only way to}} actually measure thermodynamic entropy. It is only with the introduction of statistical mechanics, the viewpoint that a thermodynamic system consists of a collection of particles and which explains classical thermodynamics in terms of probability distributions, that the entropy can be considered separately from temperature and energy. This is expressed in Boltzmann's famous entropy formula S=kB ln(W). Here kB is Boltzmann's constant, and W is the number of equally probable microstates which yield a particular thermodynamic state, or macrostate.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveEndograft {{migration}} is usually {{described as a}} downward displacement of the endograft {{with respect to the}} renal arteries. However, change in endograft position is actually a complex process in three-dimensional (3 D) space. Currently, there are no established techniques to define such positional changes over time. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether the direction of aortic endograft movement as observed in follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans is related to the directional <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> acting on the endograft. MethodsWe quantitated the 3 D positional change over time of five abdominal endografts by determining the endograft centroid at baseline (postoperative scan) and on follow-up CT scans. The time interval between CT scans for the 5 patients ranged from 8 months to 8 years. We then used 3 D image segmentation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to quantitate the pulsatile <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> (in Newtons [N]) acting on the endografts in the postoperative configurations. Finally, we calculated a correlation metric between the direction of the <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> vector and the endograft movement by computing the cosine of the angle of these two vectors. ResultsThe average 3 D movement of the endograft centroid was 18 mm (range, 9 - 29 mm) with greater movement in patients with longer follow-up times. In all cases, the movement of the endograft had significant components in all three spatial directions: Two of the endografts had the largest component of movement in the transverse direction, whereas three endografts had the largest component of movement in the axial direction. The magnitude and orientation of the endograft <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> varied depending on aortic angulation and hemodynamic conditions. The average magnitude of <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> for all endografts was 5. 8 N (range, 3. 7 - 9. 5 N). The orientation of <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> was in general perpendicular to the greatest curvature of the endograft. The average correlation metric, defined as the cosine of the angle between the <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> and the endograft centroid movement, was 0. 38 (range, 0. 08 - 0. 66). ConclusionsComputational methods applied to patient-specific postoperative image data can be used to quantitate 3 D <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> and movement of endografts over time. It appears that endograft movement is related to the magnitude and direction of the <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> acting on aortic endografts. These methods can be used to increase our understanding of clinical endograft migration. Clinical RelevanceThe study presented here shows the potential of using computer simulations to predict the in vivo behavior of endovascular stent grafts for AAA repair. Computer methods, combined with clinical validation studies, may provide physicians with a powerful diagnostic tool for endovascular device performance that goes beyond the current capabilities of medical image data...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Long-term {{durability}} after endovascular aortic repair {{is influenced}} by stent graft migration causing types I and III endoleaks. Flow induced <b>displacement</b> <b>forces</b> {{have been shown to}} have the potential to cause migration. In this study, the influence of the distal diameter of iliac limb stent grafts and the shape of graft curvature on flow induced <b>displacement</b> <b>forces,</b> were investigated. Methods: In an experimental pulsatile flow model mimicking aortic conditions in vivo, flow induced <b>displacement</b> <b>forces</b> at the proximal and distal ends of iliac limb stent grafts were studied at different angles (0 - 90 degrees) and perfusion pressures (145 / 80, 170 / 90, 195 / 100 mmHg). Bell-bottomed, tapered, and non-tapered stent grafts and also asymmetric stent graft curvatures at 90 bend were studied. Measurements of graft movement were performed at all studied angulations and graft shapes. Results: For all stent graft diameters, flow induced <b>displacement</b> <b>forces</b> increased with higher pressure and increased stent graft angulation. Forces in the bell-bottom graft were considerably higher than in tapered and non-tapered grafts, with a markedly elevated peak force at the distal end (proximal end, 2. 3 +/- 0. 06 N and distal end, 6. 9 +/- 0. 05 N compared with 1. 7 +/- 0. 08 N and 1. 6 +/- 0. 08 N in non-tapered grafts; p <. 001 both). Peak forces in tapered and non-tapered grafts were not significantly different between the proximal and distal end. In asymmetric stent graft curvatures, a significant increase in <b>displacement</b> <b>forces</b> was observed in the attachment zone that was closest to the stent graft bend. Graft movement increased with greater <b>displacement</b> <b>forces.</b> Conclusion: Flow induced <b>displacement</b> <b>forces</b> in iliac limb stent grafts are significant and are influenced by distal stent graft diameter and the shape of the graft curvature. The <b>displacement</b> <b>forces</b> are particularly high at the large distal end of bell-bottom grafts. Wide iliac arteries treated with bell-bottom stent grafts may require more vigilant surveillance and improved stent graft fixation...|$|R

Methods: As part of an experimental study, an iliac limb stent graft was inserted in a pulsatile flow model similar to aortic inÂ vivo conditions, and fixed-mounted at its proximal and distal ends to strain gauge load cells.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} if stents with {{hooks and}} barbs will improve stent-graft fixation in the abdominal aorta. METHODS: Sixteen- to 24 -mm-diameter Dacron grafts were deployed inside cadaveric aortas. The grafts were anchored by stents as in endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. One hundred thirty-seven stent-graft deployments {{were carried out}} with modified self-expanding Z-stents with (A) no hooks and barbs (n = 75), (B) 4 5 -mm-long hooks and barbs (n = 39), (C) 8 10 -mm-long, strengthened hooks and barbs (n = 19), or (D) hooks only (n = 4). Increasing longitudinal traction was applied to determine the <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> needed to extract the stent-grafts. The radial force of the stents was measured and correlated to the <b>displacement</b> <b>force.</b> RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> needed to extract grafts anchored by stent A was 2. 5 N (2. 0 to 3. 4), stent B 7. 8 N (7. 4 to 10. 8), and stent C 22. 5 N (17. 1 to 27. 9), p < 0. 001. Both hooks and barbs added anchoring strength. During traction, the weaker barbs were distorted or caused intimal tears. The stronger barbs engaged the entire aortic wall. The radial force of the stents had no impact on fixation, while aortic calcification and graft oversizing had marginal effects. CONCLUSIONS: Stent barbs and hooks increased the fixation of stent-grafts tenfold, while the radial force of stents had no impact.

40|$|Abdominal aortic aneurysm(AAA) is {{a common}} problem {{encountered}} which leads to dilation of the abdominal aorta.

In this thesis, the aim is to correlate experimental results with a developed computational model which is used to evaluate forces acting on the ends of an iliac limb stent graft. Chosen liquid for the experiment was water as pressure {{is said to be the}} main driving force and viscous effects are negligible. <b>Displacement</b> <b>forces</b> are numerically evaluated using a finite volume approach for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) with the open source tool OpenFOAM for different pressures (145 / 80, 170 / 90, 195 / 100 mm.

Methods: Demographic, anatomical, and graft-related features from 2862 patients were analyzed in a regression model to identify variables associated with stent-graft migration, which was defined as device movement > 5 mm or considered significant by the investigator. Using the principles of continuity and momentum, a mathematical model of blood flow was created. The pulse pressure, proximal aortic and distal iliac diameters, {{and the degree of}} iliac angulation were varied in the calculations, and the distal <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> exerted at the proximal fixation site was calculated. Results: Ninety-nine patients developed stent-graft migration, which was clinically relevant in 85 (3. 0 %). Hypertension (p= 0. 015), smoking (p= 0. 009), maximal aortic diameter (p= 0. 004), and distal transverse aortic diameter (p= 0. 03) correlated with migration in the univariate analysis, but iliac angulation did not quite achieve significance (p= 0. 06). On multivariate analysis, current smoking, hypertension, distal transverse aortic diameter, maximum common iliac diameter, and increasing proximal graft size were significantly associated with stent-graft migration. The mathematical model calculated the distal <b>displacement</b> <b>force</b> exerted on the proximal fixation site of the stent-graft and validated the clinical findings. The ratio of graft-diameter change from proximal aorta to distal iliac influenced the greatest increase in the <b>displacement</b> <b>force.</b> Conclusions: The mathematical model validated hypertension, aneurysm morphology, and endograft size as clinical factors significantly associated with stent-graft migration.

The rate-and-state friction parameters used by QDYN are fitted to the experimental data and the effect of changing these parameters on the <b>displacement,</b> <b>force</b> drop and maximum velocity is investigated. Using spherical glass beads as a friction volume the following trends where observed: An increase in the normal load results in a linear increase of the <b>displacement,</b> <b>force</b> drop and maximum velocity; An increase of the spring stiffness results in a negative power law relation with the measured variables and an increase of the load point velocity results in the increase of the measured variables according to a negative logarithmic law.

The spherical glass beads were substituted with angular quartz sand to determine what the effect of a different material is on rate-and-state parameters.

We observed dependencies of dx, dF and Vmax on (a-b) and Dc using QDYN. Due to the quasi-dynamic nature of QDYN, the model is not capable of a precise prediction of the maximum size of an earthquake event, but can provide an approximation.

5000|$|<b>Forced</b> <b>displacement</b> or <b>forced</b> {{immigration}} is the coerced movement {{of a person}} or persons away from their home or home region and it often connotes violent coercion. Someone who has experienced <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> is a [...] "forced immigrant", a [...] "displaced person" [...] (DP), rarely also a [...] "displacee", {{or if it is}} within the same country, an internally displaced person (IDP). In some cases the forced immigrant can also become a refugee, as that term has a specific legal definition. A specific form of <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> is population transfer, which is a coherent policy to move unwanted persons, for example, as an attempt at ethnic cleansing. Another form is deportation.|$|R
