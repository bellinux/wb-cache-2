30|$|The results {{indicated}} that the reinforcing coefficients of bolting in roof and sides, on floor, two sides and roof, reached 2.18, 3.56, and 1.81 respectively. The reinforcing coefficient of floor bolting, on floor, two sides and roof reached 3.06, 2.34, and 1.39 respectively. The data show that roof and sides bolting had the biggest <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> reinforcing two sides, bigger <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> floor strengthening, and big <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> roof controlling. Although no bolting was used in floor, the reinforcing coefficient on floor reached 2.18, showing a greater effect than on roof. Based on bolting in roof and two sides, floor bolting had the biggest <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> floor reinforcing, bigger <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> two sides strengthening, and big <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> roof controlling, which indicated that the effect of floor bolting decreased as distance to floor increased.|$|R
