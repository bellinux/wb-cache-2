5|$|In {{an attempt}} to <b>drain</b> Holland Fen, and prevent {{flooding}} from the River Witham, an adventurer called Earl Fitzwilliam constructed a <b>drain</b> in 1720, which runs broadly parallel to the River Witham, and terminated at Lodewick's Gowt, a sluice which he constructed on the Witham close {{to the location of}} the present Grand Sluice. The <b>drain</b> was for many years called Earl Fitzwilliam's <b>drain,</b> but is now called the North Forty-Foot <b>Drain.</b> The scheme was not entirely successful.|$|E
5|$|With the {{improvements}} to the River Witham, the final section of Earl Fitzwilliam's <b>drain</b> to Lodewick Gowt was filled in, and the channel was diverted to join the South Forty-Foot <b>Drain.</b> Renamed the North Forty-Foot <b>Drain,</b> it now supplies Cook's Lock and Holland Fen pumping stations.|$|E
5|$|Chatteris is {{situated}} between Huntingdon, St Ives, Peterborough, March and Ely, {{in the middle}} of The Fens—the lowest-lying area in the United Kingdom—with most of the land surrounding the town being below sea level, although the highest point in the Fens (36 feet above sea level) is within Chatteris's parish boundaries. The peaty land surrounding the town is largely used for agriculture, drained by numerous ditches and dykes, and there are two large drainage rivers near the town – the Forty Foot <b>Drain,</b> also known as Vermuyden's <b>Drain,</b> and the Sixteen Foot <b>Drain.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Drained</b> {{water is}} {{collected}} through 16000 km of open <b>drains</b> {{spread all over}} Egypt. Therefore, <b>drains</b> hydraulic problems lead to reduce their efficiency and ability to the free drainage of cultivated land. The work of the present investigation is based mainly on field data measurements along a group of selected <b>drains.</b> The derived relations were developed taking into consideration the degree of the <b>drains.</b> The main objective {{of this study is}} to carry out a research program include a group of Egyptian open <b>drains.</b> The developed new relations help in giving a set of rules that control the cross – section and gradient of regime alluvial <b>drains</b> in Egypt to improve its efficiency, achieve the highest operating efficiency of open <b>drains,</b> increase the ability of open <b>drains</b> cross sections for conveyance and identify scientifically study about the maintenance program of open <b>drains...</b>|$|R

5|$|The South Forty-Foot <b>Drain</b> and the Black Sluice pumping station, {{together}} {{with most of}} the side channels which run into the <b>drain</b> are the responsibility of the Environment Agency. Management of the drainage ditches which <b>drain</b> the Fens are the responsibility of the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board, who maintain 34 pumping stations and three gravity stations in the region. Of these, 21 are situated {{on the banks of the}} <b>Drain,</b> and pump directly into it, while one, the Black Hole Drove pumping station, is constructed over the channel, and acts as a boundary between the part of the <b>Drain</b> managed by the Environment Agency, and that managed by the Drainage Board.|$|E
5|$|The South Forty-Foot <b>Drain</b> {{serves as}} a {{district}} boundary over the length where it runs roughly south to north. South of Donington High Bridge, the <b>Drain</b> separates South Kesteven to the west from South Holland to the east. The boundary then continues southwards along the River Glen. North of Donington, {{the boundary between the}} borough of Boston to the east and North Kesteven to the west follows the line of the <b>Drain.</b> As the <b>Drain</b> crosses the line of the Midfen Dyke, just before the Nottingham to Boston railway joins it at Great Hale pumping station, the boundary turns northwards, following its medieval course.|$|E

5|$|The {{upper limit}} of {{navigation}} was initially Donington High Bridge, where the Swaton Eau joins the South Forty-Foot <b>Drain</b> {{and provides a}} wider section where boats can be turned. Beyond the bridge, the <b>drain</b> was officially only suitable for canoes and kayaks.|$|E
5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the <b>drain,</b> cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the <b>drain</b> flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the <b>drain</b> while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{assessment}} process for the ten routes, two remained. One was route 1, the original suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty-Foot <b>Drain</b> for most of its length, while the second was a new route, designated as route 11. Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014. It involves widening the South Forty-Foot <b>Drain</b> from Donington to Surfleet, to a point near to the Black Hole Drove pumping station. A new lock would be needed at this location, but would connect to a new channel, rather than {{to the rest of the}} <b>drain.</b> It would pass under a new bridge on the A151, and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock. An environmental survey of other watercourses near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{numerical}} analysis method {{was developed to}} predict the consolidation behavior of very soft soil with horizontal <b>drains</b> under {{the action of the}} gravity pressure. Especially, seepage pressure produced at installed horizontal <b>drains</b> was considered in the analysis by developing a new boundary condition for <b>drains</b> in arbitrary arrangement. The {{numerical analysis}} for soil with horizontal <b>drains</b> was compared with the case of self-weight consolidation. The influence of design factors, such as a lateral spacing and a depth of installation of <b>drains,</b> on consolidation process was studied. As a result of analysis, it is found that the time to reach the degree of consolidation of 95 % using horizontal <b>drains</b> takes 9 times less than that of self-weight consolida-tion and the whole settlement of clay with <b>drains</b> was occurred more than three times compared with the case without <b>drains.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} <b>drain</b> fuel from the cross-feed <b>drain</b> cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing. Moments after this procedure commenced, the staff member was advised of {{a telephone call from}} his wife and he went to answer the telephone. With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when the <b>drain</b> cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member nor anyone else noticed the <b>drain</b> cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers as it began to taxi prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was blown over and rolled some distance along the apron where it was found the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the course}} of the {{enlarged}} South <b>Drain,</b> a lock raised the level of the canal at Shapwick, while the <b>Drain</b> turned off to run parallel to the canal but to its north. The railway ran between the two waterways, crossing to {{the south side of the}} canal immediately after the single arched aqueduct and syphon over the South <b>Drain.</b> The remains of the three-arched aqueduct and syphon over the River Brue are still visible, near the old railway bridge, and from there the canal headed towards Glastonbury, passing the Ham Wall and Street Heath nature reserves and making a sharp right-hand turn just before its terminal basin, which was located near the old Glastonbury and Street railway station.|$|E
