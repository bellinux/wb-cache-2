25|$|Ribavirin {{should not}} be given with {{zidovudine}} because of the increased risk of anemia; concurrent use with <b>didanosine</b> should likewise be avoided because of {{an increased risk of}} mitochondrial toxicity.|$|E
25|$|When {{antiretroviral}} {{drugs are}} used improperly, multi-drug resistant strains {{can become the}} dominant genotypes very rapidly. In the era before multiple drug classes were available (pre-1997), the reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine, <b>didanosine,</b> zalcitabine, stavudine, and lamivudine were used serially or in combination leading {{to the development of}} multi-drug resistant mutations.|$|E
25|$|Some {{medications}} {{are commonly}} associated with pancreatitis, most commonly corticosteroids such as prednisolone, but also including the HIV medications <b>didanosine</b> and pentamidine, diuretics, the anticonvulsant valproic acid, the chemotherapeutic agents L-asparaginase and azathioprine, estrogen by way of increased blood triglycerides, and antihyperglycemic agents like metformin, vildagliptin, and sitagliptin. It may be noted here that the drugs used to treat conditions that are themselves associated with increased events of pancreatitis may also be incidentally linked to pancreatitis. Examples include statins in dyslipidemia and DPP-4 inhibitors in diabetes. According to the Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch Surveillance System and Published Reports Atypical, atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine can also cause pancreatitis.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 and 2002, {{the number}} of {{patients}} living with HIV/AIDS being identified through treatment services began to increase. As many as 69,000 of these people were the rural poor who had been infected when they sold their blood and plasma in the mid-1990s and who were unable to access or afford much-needed antiretroviral treatment. On the basis of the successes of programmes in other nations, such as Brazil, a free antiretroviral therapy programme was piloted in late 2002 in Shangcai county, Henan province, one of the most severely affected areas. Patients were provided with a combination of zidovudine or <b>didanosine</b> plus lamivudine and nevirapine. On the basis of the improved health status and survival of the initial cohort, the programme was scaled up in early 2003, mainly through the China CARES programme.|$|E
2500|$|... {{clinically}} significant pancreatitis {{occurred in a}} patient who was receiving <b>didanosine.</b> In the last study, {{about the same number}} of patients dropped out of the study due to lab abnormalities, but the patients who dropped out from adverse reactions varied. Overall, most patients withdrew from the interferon plus ribavirin arm and the least from the peginterferon plus ribavirin arm.|$|E
50|$|When {{tenofovir}} is coadministered with <b>didanosine,</b> {{the concentration}} of <b>didanosine</b> increases, and may lead to <b>didanosine</b> toxicity which may result in complications such as pancreatitis and neuropathy. If authorised, the dose of <b>didanosine</b> may be reduced or discontinued completely.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} adverse events with <b>didanosine</b> are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, fever, headache and rash. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 21-26% {{of participants in}} key <b>didanosine</b> trials.|$|E
5000|$|... 2´,3´-dideoxyinosine or <b>didanosine</b> is {{converted}} into dideoxyadenosine in vivo. Its development {{has a long}} history. In 1964 dideoxyadenosine, the corresponding adenosine analogue of zalcitabine was synthesised. Dideoxyadenosine caused kidney damage so <b>didanosine</b> was prepared from dideoxyadenosine by enzymatic oxidation (see table 1). It {{was found to be}} active against HIV without causing kidney damage. <b>Didanosine</b> was approved by the FDA for the treatmentof HIV-1 in October 1991.Zalcitabine and <b>didanosine</b> are both obligate chain terminators, that have been developed for anti-HIV treatment. Unfortunately, both drugs lack selectivity and therefore cause side-effects.|$|E
50|$|Oral {{absorption}} of <b>didanosine</b> is fairly low (42%) but rapid. Food substantially reduces <b>didanosine</b> bioavailability, {{and the drug}} should be administered on an empty stomach. The half-life in plasma is only 1.5 hours, but in the intracellular environment more than 12 hours. An enteric-coated formulation is now marketed as well. Elimination is predominantly renal; the kidneys actively secrete <b>didanosine,</b> the amount being 20% of the oral dose.|$|E
50|$|The mutant genes were {{inserted}} into Escherichia coli bacteria {{and used to}} produce (now-mutant) enzymes. The enzymes were then mixed with the precursor and the mutant enzymes that produced {{the greatest amount of}} <b>didanosine</b> were retained and replicated. One mutant stimulated a 50x increase in <b>didanosine</b> production.|$|E

5000|$|Lamivudine has reverse {{chirality}} {{compared to}} <b>didanosine,</b> stavudine, zidovudine, and natural nucleosides. Mitochondrial DNA polymerase may not {{recognize it as}} a substrate. Lamivudine is not toxic to mitochondria in vivo. [...] Individuals who had been taking <b>didanosine</b> combined with stavudine exhibited improved mitochondrial function when they switched to lamivudine combined with tenofovir.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 the {{technique}} {{was used to}} produce the HIV drug <b>didanosine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tenofovir {{interacts with}} <b>didanosine</b> and HIV-1 {{protease}} inhibitors. Tenofovir increases <b>didanosine</b> concentrations and {{can result in}} adverse effects such as pancreatitis and neuropathy. Tenofovir also interacts with HIV-1 protease inhibitors such as atazanavir, by decreasing atazanavir concentrations while increasing tenofovir concentrations. In addition, since tenofovir is excreted by the kidney, medications that impair renal function can also cause problems.|$|E
50|$|Alcohol can {{exacerbate}} didanosine's toxicity, {{and avoiding}} drinking alcohol while taking <b>didanosine</b> is recommended.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Didanosine,</b> {{also called}} ddI, with the trade names Videx and Videx EC, {{was the second}} FDA-approved {{antiretroviral}} drug. It is an analog of adenosine.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} its ten-year license, BMS re-formulated Videx as Videx EC and {{patented}} that, which reformulation the FDA {{approved in}} 2000. The new formulation is a smaller capsule containing coated microspheres instead of using a buffering compound. It is approved by the FDA for once-a-day dosing. Also {{at the end of that}} ten-year period, the NIH licensed <b>didanosine</b> to Barr Laboratories under a non-exclusive license, and <b>didanosine</b> became the first generic anti-HIV drug marketed in the United States.|$|E
50|$|A simpler {{molecule}} {{was identified}} {{that can be}} converted into <b>didanosine</b> when subjected to a specific chemical transformation {{in the presence of}} a specific enzyme.|$|E
50|$|In early studies, no {{mutations}} causing {{drug resistance}} were observed. Newer trials showed that apricitabine may induce K65R mutations, resulting in resistance against <b>didanosine</b> and tenofovir.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{scientists}} in the NCI {{played an important role}} in the discovery and development of important AIDS drugs including zidovudine (AZT), <b>didanosine</b> (ddI), and zalcitabine (ddC).|$|E

50|$|Ribavirin {{should not}} be given with {{zidovudine}} because of the increased risk of anemia; concurrent use with <b>didanosine</b> should likewise be avoided because of {{an increased risk of}} mitochondrial toxicity.|$|E
50|$|In February 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration {{issued a}} {{statement}} that patients using <b>Didanosine</b> (Videx) {{are at risk for}} a rarebut potentially fatal liver disorder, non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.|$|E
50|$|Hiroaki Mitsuya (extra=born 1950) is a Japanese {{virologist}} {{famous for}} his role in discovery of the anti-HIV drug zidovudine (AZT) as well as other anti-AIDS drugs including <b>didanosine</b> (ddI) and zalcitabine (ddC).|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} was repeated, using the first {{precursor}} in place of <b>didanosine,</b> finding a yet simpler precursor and an enzyme to produce it. One mutated enzyme produced a 9,500x increase in nucleoside production.|$|E
5000|$|Drug {{resistance}} to <b>didanosine</b> does develop, though slower than to zidovudine (AZT). The most common mutation observed in vivo is L74V in the viral pol gene, which confers cross-{{resistance to}} zalcitabine; other mutations observed include K65R and M184V [...]|$|E

50|$|<b>Didanosine</b> (ddI, DDI), marketed {{under the}} trade names Videx, is an {{medication}} {{used to treat}} HIV/AIDS. It is used {{in combination with other}} medications as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). It is of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor class.|$|E
50|$|<b>Didanosine</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1975 and approved {{for use in}} the United States in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.|$|E
50|$|Resistance to {{abacavir}} {{has developed}} in laboratory versions of HIV {{which are also}} resistant to other HIV-specific antiretrovirals such as lamivudine, <b>didanosine</b> and zalcitabine.
