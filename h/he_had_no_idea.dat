5|$|Curtis {{admitted}} in a 2004 documentary that just before recording began, producer John Lloyd {{came up to}} him with Atkinson and asked what Edmund's character was. Curtis then realised that, despite writing some funny lines, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his part. On the 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added that as the cameras were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn't even sure what voice to use for the character.|$|E
5|$|With all the walkers subdued from Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson)'s barn, Hershel demands Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and {{his group}} leave the farm. Rick confronts Shane (Jon Bernthal) {{regarding}} his actions leading to this, but Shane considers Rick as delusional as Hershel. The group decides to bury the walker bodies of Hershel's wife and stepson as well as Carol (Melissa McBride)'s daughter Sophia, while burning {{the rest of the}} walkers. They hold a makeshift memorial service for Sophia, but Carol refuses to attend. She falls into a deep depression, going off into the woods to pull up flowers, including a Cherokee Rose that has been a sign of hope for her. Shane finds her and helps return her to the camp, apologizing to her that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> Sophia was in the barn.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{knew that}} Ott {{had no way}} out from Alessandria, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of Melas's position. Following his meeting with the spy and fearing that the Austrian general might try to escape, Bonaparte spread his army out in a wide net by sending Louis Desaix with Divisional General Jean Boudet's {{division}} (6,000 men) south to Novi Ligure and Divisional General Jean François Cornu de La Poype (3,500 men) north on the other bank of the Po. Further north, from Vercelli to Lake Maggiore, were stationed the divisions of Antoine de Béthencourt and Joseph Chabran and, further to the rear, north of Piacenza, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge's division. Bonaparte's view was confirmed when General Claude Victor-Perrin, supported by Divisional General Joachim Murat’s cavalry, swiftly evicted FML Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough’s Austrian brigade from Marengo village that afternoon. Victor then deployed divisional generals Gaspard Amédée Gardanne and Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin's divisions along the Fontanone stream. Austrian headquarters debated building a bridge to the north to outflank the French, {{but the lack of}} pontoons and time forced the Austrians to cross the river Bormida and then launch a single, direct assault across the Fontanone bridge.|$|E

In a 2015 interview, Suehiro {{said that he was}} still considering a sequel, but that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what form it would take, who he would be collaborating with or how it would be presented.|$|E
25|$|Peled reiterated, however, {{that he had}} {{conceived}} {{of this as a}} purely military operation to counter a military threat, and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that Israel would maintain occupation of the territories captured for decades afterwards, or establish settlements designed to effect their annexation and permanently change their demographic character. He had opposed these tendencies as soon as they appeared after the war.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{the name}} Tech Valley was derided as over-enthusiastic self-boosterism, but SEMATECH's {{decision}} in 2002 to relocate its headquarters to the University at Albany, SUNY began Tech Valley's {{rise in the}} public's perception. In 2004, however, when Bill Gates was asked by an Albany Times Union reporter {{what he thought about}} Tech Valley, he responded that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> where that was; two years later though, $400,000 from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was used to fund the Tech Valley High School.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Blue Star, Parmar {{visited the}} auto {{mechanic}} and electrician Inderjit Singh Reyat, {{who lived in}} Duncan, British Columbia, a small community north of Victoria on Vancouver Island. He asked him to construct a bomb; Reyat later claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{what it would be}} used for. Reyat asked various people in the community about dynamite, saying he wanted to remove tree stumps on his property. Reyat also discussed explosives with a co-worker, while expressing anger at the Indian government and Indira Gandhi in particular.|$|E
25|$|A nation-wide manhunt ensued. Sherman {{was found}} {{four days later}} in Toledo, Ohio. He {{explained}} under interrogation that he had eloped with his girlfriend and denied that the handkerchief was his. He was administered a polygraph test, which he passed, and was later cleared. The handkerchief's real owner, Airman Seymour Sherman of New York City, was eventually found. He {{had been out of}} the country when Suzanne Degnan was murdered. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how it could possibly have ended up in Chicago and the presence of the handkerchief was determined to be a coincidence.|$|E

25|$|One of the Breton lais {{recorded}} in Old French by Marie de France in the 12th century concerns {{a young man}} named Guigemar. Injured in a hunting accident, after making his way to a harbour that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> existed, he climbs aboard a boat on which there is a bed, lies on this bed and soon the boat is underway, although there is nobody on board but himself. Burning at the boat's prow are lighted candles and, like King Arthur, this vessel takes him to a place where he will be healed of his wound.|$|E
25|$|Burns said in {{his speech}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{that he would be}} a {{candidate}} for the electorate, and therefore did not have enough time to prepare a speech, so he made it up along the way. He stated that if he became a Member of Parliament for Bruce, he would endeavour to act in a straightforward manner. In response to questions, Burns stated that he was an advocate for free trade. He also stated that he was against separationism, the act of dividing the North and South Islands, and that although he supported the use of income tax, he was against a stamp act or newspaper postage.|$|E
25|$|Stockholm and Andrea Doria were {{experiencing}} different weather conditions {{immediately prior to}} the collision. The collision occurred {{in an area of}} the northern Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Massachusetts, where heavy and intermittent fog is common. Although Andrea Doria had been engulfed in the fog for several hours, Stockholm had only recently entered the bank and was still acclimating to atmospheric conditions. The officer in charge of Stockholm incorrectly assumed that his inability to see the other vessel was due to conditions other than fog, such as the other ship being a very small fishing vessel or a 'blacked-out' warship on maneuvers. He testified that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> it was another passenger liner speeding through fog.|$|E

25|$|Mulder had {{a rather}} {{strained}} relationship with his parents Bill and Teena Mulder, not least thanks to the X-Files. Initially, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> his father {{was involved in the}} conspiracy and Samantha's disappearance. Bill, who became disenchanted with the shadow government and his own role in the conspiracy, eventually approached Fox about his past deeds, but was shot and killed by Alex Krycek – working as an assassin for the Syndicate – before he could reveal any great amount of information. Over the next few years, Mulder got into several conflicts with his mother while trying to discover the extent of her own knowledge of his father's precise involvement. Teena dies of an apparent suicide, when the stress of Samantha's abduction finally becomes too painful.|$|E
25|$|Soult marched {{south on}} 30 January 1809, aiming for Portugal. After being {{repelled}} in his initial attempt {{to cross the}} Minho River in mid-February, his forces marched to Ourense and crossed the bridge there. Soult's cavalry crushed a Spanish brigade at La Trepa on 6 March and the II Corps entered Portugal on the 9th. At the Battle of Braga on 20 March, the French routed a Portuguese army consisting of a few regulars and 22,000 militia. The First Battle of Porto on the 29th was another lopsided French victory marked by terrible Portuguese loss of life. But despite being established in Porto, Soult found his communications cut by regular and irregular Portuguese forces under General Francisco Silveira and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of the whereabouts of Lapisse.|$|E
25|$|Asimov unsuccessfully {{tried to}} end the series with Second Foundation. However, because of the {{predicted}} thousand years until {{the rise of the}} next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a sense of closure. For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, Asimov gave in after a 30-year hiatus, and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: Foundation's Edge. This was followed shortly thereafter by Foundation and Earth. The story of this volume (which takes place some 500 years after Seldon) ties up all the loose ends and brings together all of his Robot, Empire and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding Galaxia, a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. However, this concept was never explored further. According to his widow Janet Asimov (in her biography of Isaac, It's Been a Good Life), <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how to continue after Foundation and Earth, so he started writing the prequels.|$|E

25|$|The {{expanded}} 30th anniversary {{edition of}} the 1965 official book, The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation, was notable for its exclusion {{of most of the}} evidence against the map's authenticity, concentrating instead on vindications by George Painter, and Thomas Cahill with colleague Bruce Kusko (in which they claimed specifically that they had not analyzed the loose particles they took from the map {{at the time of their}} PIXE research), but it did reprint a remarkable essay written in 1989 by the original book dealer Laurence Witten. He stated that, when the McCrone investigation concluded the map to be a forgery in 1974, he was asked by Yale to reveal its provenance as a matter of urgency, and to discuss the possible return of Mr Mellon's money. He replied that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> where the map came from, beyond Ferrajoli (who was convicted of theft shortly after the sale, and died shortly after release from prison). On the subject of the money, he said he could not pay it all back because he had paid agreed shares of his profit to Ferrajoli and to another dealer who had introduced him. For his part, Mellon did not ask for the return of any money. The essay also revealed that Witten had, on Ferrajoli's recommendation, met with Irving Davis after buying the map volume in 1957.|$|E
