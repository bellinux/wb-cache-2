5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results <b>in</b> <b>pale</b> blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E
