25|$|On 27 July 2006 the Phonak team {{announced}} that Floyd Landis, {{winner of the}} 2006 Tour, tested positive after stage 17 for an abnormally high ratio of the hormone testosterone to <b>epitestosterone.</b> On the day the allegations were made public, Landis denied doping. Landis' personal doctor later revealed the test had found a ratio of 11:1 in Landis' blood; the permitted ratio is 4:1. On 31 July 2006 The New York Times reported that tests on Landis' sample revealed some synthetic testosterone. He was later stripped of his title and banned from cycling for two years.|$|E

25|$|On July 27, 2006, the Phonak Cycling Team {{announced}} a urine sample submitted by Floyd Landis {{tested positive for}} an unusually high ratio of the hormone testosterone to the hormone <b>epitestosterone</b> (T/E ratio) after his performance in stage 17 of the 2006 Tour de France. Landis denied doping and placed faith in a test using his backup sample. Phonak stated {{that he would be}} dismissed should the backup sample also test positive.

Landis's personal physician later disclosed that the test had found a T/E ratio of 11:1 in Landis, far above the maximum allowable ratio of 4:1.|$|E
500|$|Conte {{claimed that}} rival coach Trevor Graham had {{revealed}} {{the drug to}} US testers, acting [...] "purely out of competitive jealousy" [...] as Chambers was challenging Graham's trainees; Montgomery and Greene. Chambers denied that he had any knowledge that the substance he was taking was banned and claimed he was deceived by Conte over its true use. However, he contradicted his statement in a later interview, {{saying that he had}} major suspicions that he was using banned substances but was too naïve and lacking in self-respect to act otherwise. By Chambers' own admission in 2008, in a letter by his supplier Conte to British anti-doping chief John Scott, THG was not the only substance he had used during his career. In his confession he admitted to the use of <b>epitestosterone</b> cream, EPO, HGH, insulin lispro, modafinil and liothyronine.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{completion}} of the 2006 Tour, winner Floyd Landis was found to have an elevated testosterone to <b>epitestosterone</b> ratio on a sample taken following Stage 17 of the race, and {{at the time of the}} 2007 Tour prologue.

2500|$|A {{member of}} the IOC Medical Commission, Manfred Donike, privately ran {{additional}} tests with a new technique for identifying abnormal levels of testosterone by measuring its ratio to <b>epitestosterone</b> in urine. Twenty percent of the specimens he tested, including those from sixteen gold medalists {{would have resulted in}} disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official. The results of Donike's unofficial tests later convinced the IOC to add his new technique to their testing protocols.

2500|$|As is {{the case}} with all stage winners, Landis was tested as part of the Tour's {{standard}} doping precautions. [...] On 27 July 2006, one week after the stage finished, the [...] announced that the [...] "A" [...] test on Landis's urine sample had come back [...] "positive" [...] for banned synthetic testosterone as well as a ratio of testosterone to <b>epitestosterone</b> nearly three times the limit allowed by World Anti-Doping Agency rules. On 5 August 2006, the [...] "B" [...] test confirmed the initial findings and Landis was immediately dismissed by the Phonak team. In June 2008, the International Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed Landis's appeal, disqualifying him from the 2006 Tour de France, and so stripping him of his win and suspending him from the sport for two years.|$|E
5000|$|Structurally, <b>epi{{testosterone}}</b> {{differs from}} testosterone {{only in the}} configuration at the hydroxy-bearing carbon, [...] <b>Epitestosterone</b> is believed to form {{in a similar way}} to testosterone; a 1993 study found that around 50% of <b>epitestosterone</b> production in human males can be ascribed to the testis, although the exact pathway of its formation is still the subject of research. It has been shown to accumulate in mammary cyst fluid and in the prostate. <b>Epitestosterone</b> levels are typically highest in young males; however, by adulthood, most healthy males exhibit a testosterone to <b>epitestosterone</b> ratio (T/E ratio) of about 1:1.|$|E

5000|$|An {{affidavit}} {{from the}} United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) reveals that [...] "the cream" [...] was a composition of testosterone and <b>epitestosterone</b> {{designed to increase}} the natural level of the steroid testosterone while not disrupting the ratio of testosterone to <b>epitestosterone,</b> a common metric used in traditional drug tests.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{exogenous}} administration of testosterone does not affect levels of <b>epitestosterone</b> in the body. As a result, tests to determine the ratio of testosterone to <b>epitestosterone</b> in urine are used to find athletes who are doping. A study of Australian athletes found that the mean T/E ratio in the study was 1.15:1. Another study found that the max T/E ratio for the 95th percentile of athletes was 3.71:1, and the max T/E ratio for the 99th percentile was 5.25:1 ...|$|E
50|$|In 1998, an out-of-competition {{drug test}} found Pippig had an {{elevated}} ratio of testosterone to <b>epitestosterone,</b> and the German Athletics Federation attempted to ban her for two years. Pippig contested the finding {{on the grounds}} that her testosterone levels were normal, and that the elevated ratio was due to a low level of <b>epitestosterone</b> from a long battle with chronic bowel disease and other factors. This claim was supported by a variety of independent medical experts, and a German arbitration court ultimately dismissed the case.|$|E

50|$|Together with UGT2B4, UGT2B7 {{is capable}} of glucosidation of hyodesoxycholic acid in the liver, but, unlike the 2B4 isoform, 2B7 is also able to glucuronidate various steroid hormones (androsterone, <b>epitestosterone)</b> and fatty acids. It is also able to {{conjugate}} major classes of drugs such as analgesics (morphine), carboxylic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketoprofen), and anticarcinogens (all-trans retinoic acid). UGT2B7 is the major enzyme isoform for the metabolism of morphine to the main metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) which has no analgesic effect and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), which has analgesic effects more potent than morphine. As a consequence, altered UGT2B7 activity can significantly affect both the effectiveness and side-effects of morphine, {{as well as some}} related opiate drugs.|$|E

5000|$|While {{in vitro}} and animal studies have {{suggested}} potential uses for 7-keto-DHEA in humans, there is currently limited scientific evidence to support its use as a weight-loss aid, muscle-builder, immune stimulant, or for any other clinical use.

When used in a topical (skin lotion) product 7-keto-DHEA caused long-lasting changes in the body's levels of testosterone, <b>epitestosterone,</b> estradiol, and other steroid hormones.

50|$|Research {{indicates}} that the initial programming of pilosebaceous units of hair follicles begins in utero.

Although hair follicles were previously thought to be permanently gone in areas of complete hair loss, {{they are more likely}} dormant, as recent studies have shown the scalp contains the stem cell progenitor cells from which the follicles arose. This however, only applies to non scarring hair loss, which preserves the hair follicles, unlike scarring hair loss, which completely destroys the hair follicles.|$|E
