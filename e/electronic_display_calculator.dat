In 1972, Monroe {{announced}} a pocket-sized <b>electronic</b> <b>display</b> <b>calculator</b> at $269. [...] As low cost electronic calculators from Japan became readily available through retail distribution, the mechanical calculator companies like Monroe, Friden, and Marchant declined even as they introduced programmable calculators.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adding machine}} range {{began with the}} basic, hand-cranked P100 which was only capable of adding. The design {{included}} some revolutionary features, foremost {{of which was the}} dashpot. The P200 offered a subtraction capability and the P300 provided a means of keeping 2 separate totals. The P400 provided a moveable carriage, and the P600 and top-of-the-range P612 offered some limited programmability based upon the position of the carriage. The range was further extended by the inclusion of the [...] "J" [...] series which provided a single finger calculation facility, and the [...] "c" [...] series of both manual and electrical assisted comptometers. In the late 1960s, the Burroughs sponsored [...] "nixi-tube" [...] provided an <b>electronic</b> <b>display</b> <b>calculator.</b> Burroughs developed a range of adding machines with different capabilities, gradually increasing in their capabilities. A revolutionary adding machine was the Sensimatic, which was able to perform many business functions semi-automatically. It had a moving programmable carriage to maintain ledgers. It could store 9, 18 or 27 balances during the ledger posting operations and worked with a mechanical adder named a Crossfooter. The Sensimatic developed into the Sensitronic which could store balances on a magnetic stripe which was part of the ledger card. This balance was read into the accumulator when the card was inserted into the carriage. The Sensitronic was followed by the E1000, E2000, E3000, E4000, E6000 and the E8000, which were computer systems supporting card reader/punches and a line printer.|$|E
