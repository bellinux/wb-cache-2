500|$|... "Missing You" [...] {{received}} generally {{negative comments}} from the critics, who criticised the use of Auto-Tuned vocals and said that [...] "the production was lacking, making the choice to release it is a single confusing. with] some terrible autotone ... and a trance-y backdrop that never quite reaches the places it promises." [...] Tony Falls of Virgin Media was also {{highly critical of the}} song awarding it zero out of ten. [...] "Never have a group got by with so little a contribution to music, but so big a contribution to rolling back feminist progress. 'Missing You' sounds like an album track.
