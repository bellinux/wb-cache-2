The Netherlands which requires issuing states to return both Dutch nationals and permanent residents, also requires issuing states to agree that any sentences imposed will be converted into those applicable under Dutch law using the 1995 Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This has the effect of re-introducing the double-criminality requirement for Dutch nationals and permanent residents, as the conversion of a sentence imposed in an <b>issuing</b> <b>state</b> could not be converted into a comparable sentence by a Dutch court if the conduct constituting the criminal offence in the <b>issuing</b> <b>state</b> does not constitute a criminal offence in the Netherlands.|$|E
