5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E

Although there is no free of charge smoking cessation quitline that callers could phone and discuss their problems, most health-care facilities offer support in cessation, including cessation programs and nicotine replacement therapy. Costs are covered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> partially or in full by the state. In addition to regular health-care clinics, there are 11 specialized anti-smoking centers in the country where consultation is free, but medicine is not.

5|$|Social Worker: Every {{patient is}} {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> to receive hospice care.|$|E

5|$|As Emma, Mary Margaret, and Graham {{search the}} wooded area for John Doe, they {{are joined by}} Henry. Henry {{believes}} that the patient is looking for Mary Margaret. They soon discover the patient lying near the bridge seen in the fairytale flashback, and Mary Margaret revives him. As they take {{him back to the}} hospital, Regina shows up with a woman named Kathryn (Griffith), and states that she is his wife and that the patient's name is David Nolan. This devastates Mary Margaret, as she had begun to develop feelings <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> Emma becomes suspicious of Regina's ability to find Nolan's wife and questions why Kathryn never bothered to search for him before. Although Regina claims that past hospital surveillance tapes had David mentioning Kathryn's name in his sleep, Emma still believes that Regina is lying. Later that evening, Emma arrives at Mary Margaret's place and agrees to take up the offer of staying with the teacher.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E

40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{was made by}} computer on 511 cases of testicular tumor experienced at 14 facilities in Japan between 1970 and 1979. The age distribution of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> had two peaks, one under 3 years (15 %) and the other between 25 and 34 years (32 %). Forty percent of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> were office workers and 76 % were college graduates. Fifty percent of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> had 0 to 1 sibs. The blood type distribution {{was similar to that}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole Japanese population. Six percent of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> had a past history of trauma, and no relation with cell type was detected. Sixty nine percent of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> were married and 31 % were not married. Sixty seven percent of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> over 30 had seminoma, and 78 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> under 29 years old had non-seminoma. Seminoma was rare in patients under 9 years old. Histologically, 75 % were simple type, and 25 % were mixed type. Forty three percent of the cases were seminoma and 57 % were non-seminoma. Of the stage I cases, 78 % and 57 %, and of the stage III cases 7 and 28 %, respectively, were seminoma and non-seminoma, many of the non-seminoma being at high stage. The 5 -year survival rate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 75 <b>patients</b> under 9 years old was 96 %, and that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 341 <b>patients</b> over 15 years was 70 %, <b>the</b> survival rate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> under 9 years being significantly higher. The 5 -year survival rate for stage I, II and III seminoma was 100, 65 and 0 %, respectively, while that for non-seminoma was 93, 56 and 8 %, respectively. <b>The</b> survival rate <b>for</b> stage I was higher for seminoma cases than for non-seminoma cases. No difference was detected between survival rate for stage II or III between seminoma and non-seminoma. <b>The</b> survival rate <b>for</b> seminoma did not differ with the time when the surgery was performed, but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with non-seminomatous tumors, the survival rate was higher <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> operated within one month than those operated later. The survival rate was not related to the weight of the extracted testicle. The 5 -year survival rate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with normal body temperature was 78 % whereas that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> who had fevers was 32 %. The 5 -year survival rate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> not accompanied by abdominal tumors was about 80 %, whereas that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with palpated abdominal tumors was 42 %.
