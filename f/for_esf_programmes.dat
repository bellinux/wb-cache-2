30|$|The {{threshold}} PRE <b>for</b> <b>ESF</b> occurrence {{is based}} on measurements of the Jicamarca incoherence scatter radar (Fejer et al. 1999; Smith et al. (2016)). The ESF occurrence probability {{as a function of}} the PRE {{is based on}} satellite measurements (Su et al. 2008; Kil et al. 2009; Huang and Hairston 2015). When the radar data are compared with the satellite data <b>for</b> <b>ESF</b> occurrence, it should be mentioned that the measurements were made at different altitudes. In the radar measurements, weak spread F irregularities are those below the F peak, often below 400  km, and strong spread F irregularities are those in the topside F region. In the satellite measurements, the altitudes were ~[*] 600  km for ROCSAT- 1 and 400 – 800  km for C/NOFS, implying that ESF irregularities already reached the topside F region. Therefore, the ESF events based on the satellite measurements mostly correspond to the strong spread F events based on the radar measurements. Another difference in the measurements is longitude. The radar data were obtained at a fixed longitude (Jicamarca). In contrast, the satellite data were obtained over all longitudes, and the dependence of the ESF occurrence probability on the PRE at some specific longitudes (e.g., Jicamarca) has not been determined from satellite data.|$|R

However, the decay dynamics of the open systems appear {{very different from the}} continuum case, their properties being dominated by the states in the band center. We identify a class of states ('lattice scars') that survive for infinite times in dissipative systems and that are degenerate {{at the center of the}} band. We provide analytical arguments for their existence in any bipartite lattice, and give a formula to determine their number. These states should be relevant to quantum transport in discrete systems, and we discuss how to observe them using photonic waveguides, cold atoms in optical lattices, and quantum circuits.

30|$|The {{threshold}} PRE <b>for</b> <b>ESF</b> occurrence {{could be}} related to the occurrence probability of ESF in the following ways. If we {{take a closer look at}} the data in Fig.  2, dots (no spread F), plus signs (weak spread F), and circles (strong spread F) all exist within some small range of the PRE and solar flux (e.g., 10  m/s in the PRE drift and 50  units in the solar flux). In other words, ESF might occur or not occur in this range of the PRE and solar flux. In Fig.  3, especially the top row with more events, there is a trend that the cases with larger ESF occurrence index occur at higher PRE peak drift, implying that the PRE peak drifts (or the threshold drifts) are not exactly the same for the cases at different levels of the ESF occurrence index. The threshold PRE can be explained as that ESF almost certainly occurs if the PRE reaches the threshold. This is, in fact, equivalent to the statement that the occurrence probability of ESF is almost 100 % for this PRE value. The occurrence probability of ESF is nearly 100 % when the PRE peak drift is larger than 60  m/s in Fig.  7 b. These PRE values for near 100 % occurrence probability in Huang and Hairston (2015) are close to the threshold PRE (50 – 60  m/s) <b>for</b> <b>ESF</b> occurrence at high solar flux (Fejer et al. 1999).|$|R

We have identified a class of states (lattice scars) at the band center of bipartite lattices-such as the square or honeycomb lattices-which are resilient to local dissipative processes [1]. When such bipartite lattice systems are coupled to leads, lattice scarred states may remain bound within the system even when the energy-band center {{is embedded in the}} continuum spectrum of lead states-they become bound states in the continuum (BICs) [2, 3]. We have shown how these states can have a dramatic impact on the transport properties through the system, enabling one to design the system-lead coupling so as to block all transmission in an energy range around the band center, introduce a Fano antiresonance, or a broad transmission peak, cf. Fig. 1 and Ref. [3]. Intriguing open questions remain as to the transport at energies where lattice symmetries imply a large density of states (van Hove singularities) [4].

The methodological approach consists of document analysis, participant observation and qualitative interviews.

Through interviews with one project worker and two participants, different perspectives on the practices and ideas are given voice.

40|$|The {{debate about}} the funding and support of civil society by {{government}} bodies has become a central and politicized issue in many countries. European states in particular have sought {{to make use of}} civil society to deliver key supra-national policy aims of addressing economic and social disadvantage, as well as delivering national and territorial outcomes. To this end European structural funding has been used at a regional level to develop and engage organizations and their beneficiaries. One of the key considerations in such activity is the ability of civil society organizations to engage with the funding available, and whether structural barriers exist that potentially prevent organizations with relevant expertise participating. In order to illustrate this, this article investigates how civil society organizations fared in gaining funds from the 2007 – 2013 European Social Fund (<b>ESF)</b> <b>programmes</b> in Wales, what, if any, barriers were found to exist in acquiring those funds and what this means for the sector in Wales in the context of future funding.

Thus, this article concludes that it is organizations that are structurally embedded that will be most successful in gaining ESF funds, due to their organizational characteristics and their institutionalized relationships with, and receipts from, the state.

Evaluating the degree of lithification and the slope stability against erosion represents an important task within the <b>ESF</b> <b>programme</b> MOUNDFORCE {{under the umbrella of}} EUROMARGINS. Sampling of hardgrounds during RV Meteor cruises M 61 - 1 and - 3 in 2004 by means of the IFM-GEOMAR TV-grab and the Bremen ROV QUEST focused on carbonate mounds of the Porcupine Seabight and northwestern Rockall Bank off Ireland. Lithified carbonates of mid-Pleistocene age were exhumed during the Holocene and are now exposed on the top and flanks of numerous carbonate mounds showing a patchy to dense colonisation by living corals and associated invertebrates. The sediments, composed of foraminiferal–nannoplankton oozes and admixed mound-derived invertebrate skeletons, range from partly lithified chalks to dense micritic limestones. These wackestones to packstones clearly differ from bacterially induced authigenic carbonate crusts typical of hydrocarbon seep settings by showing current-induced sedimentary structures, a non-luminescing matrix indicating oxic pore fluids, and a marine isotopic signature lacking any depleted carbon regime which is typical of anaerobic methane oxidation. The carbonate lithification is driven by carbonate ion diffusion from supersaturated seawater into the pore fluids in the studied areas. Vigorous bottom currents were the ultimate control not only of carbonate cementation by enhancing the diffusion process and supporting a pumping mechanism, but also of hardground formation and mound shaping by exhuming lithified carbonates and preventing fine-grained sediment accumulation at the downslope mound flanks...|$|R
