5|$|In {{order to}} tackle {{financial}} burdens {{resulting from the}} Hussite wars and military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire, Sigismund of Luxemburg put lower value silver coins into circulation in 1432. The new pennies were known as quarting because they contained {{only a quarter of}} the silver content of the old currency. Bishop Lépes, who knew that pennies of higher value would again be minted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> suspended the collection of the tithe in 1434.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{translated}} into all major languages, and in the United States it became the second best-selling book after the Bible. A number of the early editions carried an introduction by Rev James Sherman, a Congregational minister in London noted for his abolitionist views. Uncle Tom's Cabin sold equally well in Britain, with the first London edition appearing in May 1852 and selling 200,000 copies. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> over 1.5 million copies of the book were in circulation in Britain, although most of these were infringing copies (a similar situation occurred in the United States).|$|E

5|$|The {{proposal}} was strongly opposed by both environmentalists {{as well as}} local residents. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is strongly dependent on tourism, with the Columbia River, including Columbia Lake and Windermere Lake, being very popular for summer swimming and boating activities. Diversion of the glacier-fed Kootenay River would have resulted in the Columbia River becoming much deeper and colder, flooding riverside communities and damaging tourism. At {{the opposite end of the}} scale, it would dry the bed of the Kootenay River downstream of Canal Flats, cutting off water supply to residents of the upper Kootenay Valley and invalidating the effectiveness of Libby Dam, whose construction was to begin <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> As a result, this proposed river diversion was never undertaken.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in the Mojave Desert which supply power to the {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Thom {{held his}} {{job with the}} Bureau of Chemistry until 1927, when the {{position}} was abolished. He was then appointed Principal Mycologist of the Division of Soil Microbiology for the newly created Bureau of Chemistry and Soils. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> Thom became known as an authority on soil microbiology, and was often invited to present papers at national and international meetings. In one of Thom's important contributions to the field, he led the research group responsible for advances that enabled the control of cotton root rot, {{which at the time}} was a major problem in the southwestern United States. In collaboration with his protégé Kenneth Raper, they published the Manual of Penicillin in 1940. Thom formally retired in 1942, although he remained active as a consultant and guest speaker until shortly before his death.|$|E

5|$|Combined {{with the}} Domesday Survey, the Pipe rolls {{contributed to the}} {{centralisation}} of financial records by the Norman kings (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, {{did not have an}} equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s. The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England, although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear. A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> for the reigns of Kings Henry II (reigned 1154–1189) and Richard I (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the Duchy of Normandy in France. It is believed that the Norman rolls were started {{about the same time as}} the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly when they did start. An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.|$|E
5|$|Helen Beatrix Potter {{was born}} in Kensington, London on 28 July 1866 to wealthy parents, and educated at home {{by a series of}} governesses and tutors. She {{displayed}} artistic talent early, drawing and sketching mammals, insects, reptiles and amphibians, flowers and plants. In the early 1890s, she enjoyed her first professional artistic success when she sold six designs to a greeting card publisher. On 16 December 1901, she privately issued The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and, on 2 October 1902, a trade edition of the tale was released by Frederick Warne & Co. to great success. She published tales similar in content, style, and format for Warnes in the years to follow, and, in 1904, The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, a sequel to Peter Rabbit. In July 1905, Potter bought Hill Top, a working farm in the Lake District with the profits from her books and a small legacy left her by an aunt; the farm became her home away from London and her artistic retreat. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> Potter had established her own career, income, and home.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{fleet and}} army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp {{out the last}} embers of the revolt. They {{attacked}} and captured the islands of Chios, Lesbos and Tenedos. On each, they made a 'human-net' of troops and swept across the whole island to flush out any hiding rebels. They then moved over to the mainland and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia, similarly seeking out any remaining rebels. Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus. Herodotus says that the Persians chose the most handsome boys from each city and castrated them, and chose the most beautiful girls and sent them away to the king's harem, and then burnt the temples of the cities. While this is possibly true, Herodotus also probably exaggerates the scale of devastation. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> the cities had more-or-less returned to normal {{and they were able}} to equip a large fleet for the second Persian invasion of Greece, just 13 years later.|$|E

5|$|A factory was {{established}} {{soon after the}} fort was constructed and it minted coins that bore the initials TB or DB, indicating Dansborg. The fort acted as the important gateway in the trade route from Europe to Coramandel. Protestant missionaries were sent from Denmark by king Fredric IV, who was also the head of Lutheran Church of Denmark. Two of them, namely, Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Plutschua came to Tranquebar on 9 July 1706, established the Tranquebar Mission, learnt Tamil <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> and {{were the first to}} translate and print The New Testament of the Bible in Tamil in the printing press inside the fort. The Danish mission was the first Protestant mission in India and from its inception, was staffed by German missionaries trained at Pietist schools and seminary founded by Francke at the end of 17th century. A Tamil-Latin dictionary containing 9000 words was compiled there by a medical missionary named Friedrich Koenig in 1778, whose source letters are stored in the royal archives. The fort is featured in a large number of videos, films and commercials. After India's independence in 1947, the fort was used as an inspection bungalow by the state government till 1978 when the State Department of Archaeology of the Government of Tamil Nadu took over the control of the fort. The fort is now used as a museum, housing a collection of major artifacts of the fort and the Danish empire. The fort {{is one of the most}} visited tourist landmarks in the region.|$|E
