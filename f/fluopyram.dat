Dr. George Sundin, a professor and fruit extension specialist from Michigan State University advocates that the new chemistries of succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) are also effective in controlling cherry leaf spot.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Succinate {{dehydrogenase}} inhibitors (SDHIs), {{interfering with}} fungal respiration, {{are considered to}} be fungicides at medium to high risk of resistance. Boscalid was the first molecule belonging to the SDHIs that was introduced for the control of Botryotinia fuckeliana. A range of different target-site mutations leading to boscalid resistance have been found in field populations of the fungus. The different types of mutation confer different cross-resistance profiles towards novel SDHIs, such as the recently introduced fungicide <b>fluopyram.</b> This study combines the determination of cross-resistance profiles and the setting-up of methods for fast molecular detection of the mutations. RESULTS: By means of in vitro tests, a range of SdhB mutations were characterised for resistance levels towards boscalid and <b>fluopyram.</b> SdhB mutations conferring P 225 L and P 225 F substitutions conferred high resistance to boscalid and high or moderate resistance to <b>fluopyram</b> respectively. Mutants carrying the N 230 I replacement were moderately resistant to both SDHIs. Substitutions at position H 272 responsible for a high level of resistance to boscalid conferred sensitivity (H 272 R), hypersensitivity (H 272 Y) or moderate resistance (H 272 V) to <b>fluopyram.</b> Allele-specific (AS) PCR was developed and used for genotyping 135 B. fuckeliana isolates. The assay confirmed the strict association between resistance profiles and allelic variants of the SdhB gene. Real-time AS-PCR proved to be sensitive and specific for quantitative detection of different SDHI-resistant genotypes. CONCLUSION: Fluopyram-resistant mutants are currently rarely detected in the field sprayedwith boscalid, but thismay change with intensive exposureof the fungalpopulation tofluopyram. PCRassays/methodsdeveloped inthe study provide tools for fast monitoring of field populations and observing possible changes in population composition following <b>fluopyram</b> introduction, useful for the setting-up of appropriate preventivemeasures...|$|E

In 2014, two field trials were established to evaluate seed treatments and their efficacy in managing SDS and SCN. The locations were selected because each has a history of SDS and SCN. Plots were 3. 04 meters wide by 6. 1 meters in length with row spacing of 0. 76 meters. Each plot received 2. 45 grams of infested sorghum per 30. 5 centimeters of row. At each location, two soybean varieties and ten different seed treatments were tested in 2014. In 2015, twelve seed treatments were tested on the same two varieties at the same two locations. Seed treatments were evaluated for phytotoxicity, vigor, stand count, SDS foliar ratings and soybean yield. Soil samples were collected at planting and at harvest to determine SCN reproduction. Root samples were collected from each plot to quantify the amount of F. virguliforme DNA in the soybean roots using a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) protocol. ANOVA and Fisher’s LSD Test were used to separate treatment means. Analysis of the qPCR was done by comparing the quantification cycle (Cq) values and separating means using ANOVA. There were significant differences between varieties for soybean yield and disease index. Treatments containing <b>fluopyram</b> had more phytotoxicity than treatments lacking <b>fluopyram</b> at both locations. Several treatments allowed for higher SCN reproduction than treatments with Clariva. At Ina, a <b>fluopyram</b> treatment and one of the Clariva treatments had higher soybean yield than the non-treated control.

40|$|Resistance of Alternaria alternata to boscalid, {{the first}} succinate {{dehydrogenase}} inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide labeled on pistachio, {{has become a}} common occurrence in California pistachio orchards and affects the performance of this fungicide. In this study, we established the baseline sensitivities of A. alternata to the new SDHIs <b>fluopyram,</b> fluxapyroxad, and penthiopyrad and assessed their cross resistance patterns with boscalid. Examination of the effective fungicide concentration that inhibits mycelial growth to 50 % relative to the control (EC 50) for 50 baseline isolates revealed that the majority were sensitive to boscalid, penthiopyrad, <b>fluopyram,</b> and fluxapyroxad. Analysis of EC 50 values for boscalid for 117 A. alternata isolates originating from boscalid-exposed orchards showed that 44, 3, 1, and 69 isolates had sensitive, reduced sensitivity, moderately resistant, and highly resistant boscalid phenotypes, respectively. Molecular investigation of the occurrence of known SDH mutations showed that, among the 69 isolates highly resistant to boscalid, 44, 2, 14, and 1 isolates possessed the mutations leading to the H 277 Y, H 277 R, H 134 R, and H 133 R amino acid substitutions in AaSDHB, AaSDHB, AaSDHC, and AaSDHD subunits, respectively. Some SDHB or SDHC mutants displayed highly sensitive, sensitive, or reduced sensitivity phenotypes toward penthiopyrad or fluxapyroxad, whereas other had low, moderate, or high levels of resistance to these fungicides. In contrast, all the SDHB mutants were sensitive to <b>fluopyram,</b> while 10, 5, and 1 SDHC mutants had sensitive, reduced sensitivity, and moderately resistant <b>fluopyram</b> phenotypes, respectively. The SDHD mutant had reduced sensitivity to <b>fluopyram</b> and penthiopyrad but was highly resistant to fluxapyroxad. The discrepancies of cross-resistance patterns between SDHIs suggest that their binding sites in complex II may differ slightly and that additional mechanisms of resistance to these compounds are likely involved. Ultimately, {{the findings of this}} study should lead to the rational and sustained deployment of new SDHIs in Alternaria late blight spray programs...|$|E

40|$|Zymoseptoria tritici causes Septoria leaf blotch (SLB), {{the most}} {{important}} foliar disease in winter wheat in Northern Europe and the UK. Chemical control of Z. tritici has seen a continuous introduction and substitution of fungicides with distinct mode of actions, due {{to the development of}} fungicide resistance. Emergence of diverse resistance mechanisms and their fixation in field populations of Z. tritici represents a constant threat to the control of SLB by fungicides. The aim of this research was to determine the biological potential of Z. tritici to adapt to the multi-site inhibitors chlorothalonil and folpet, and the single-site succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fluxapyroxad. In vitro microtitre plate based fungicide sensitivity assays indicated that there was evidence for reduced sensitivity to chlorothalonil or folpet in the Z. tritici field isolates tested. Field isolates obtained from plots treated with solo applications of chlorothalonil or folpet were less sensitive to the fungicides compared with isolates sampled from non-treated plots. No evidence was found for reduced sensitivity to fluxapyroxad in the same set of field isolates. RNA sequencing analysis of the genome-wide transcriptional response of the reference Z. tritici isolate IPO 323 after exposure to chlorothalonil or folpet in the lag and log phase of growth revealed a compound-specific “functional gene expression signature”. In addition, several genes encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) or major facilitator superfamily (MFS) efflux pumps were significantly overexpressed in response to chlorothalonil or folpet exposure. In vitro evolutionary studies determined the course of evolution of resistance to the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fluxapyroxad in replicate populations of Z. tritici derived from the sensitive isolate IPO 323. Resistance to fluxapyroxad arose mainly through alterations in the target protein that also often conferred cross-resistance to other SDHIs (e. g. <b>fluopyram</b> and carboxin). Additionally, overexpression of an ABC transporter or a GST gene was associated with resistance to fluxapyroxad and lower sensitivity to <b>fluopyram</b> or carboxin in a mutant without target-site alteration. The frequency of six amino acid substitutions in the target protein subunits sdhB, sdhC or sdhD – determined by SNP pyrosequencing assays – indicated that evolution of resistance was driven by a successive substitution of fitter mutants carrying distinct amino acid substitutions as selection at increasing concentrations of fluxapyroxad continued...|$|E
40|$|Powdery mildew is an economically-important {{pathogen}} {{of grapes}} worldwide. This report details {{the findings of}} our annual powdery mildew fungicide trials on grapevine cultivar Chardonnay (Vitis vinifera). The trials were conducted at Herzog Ranch, near Courtland, California in 2009. Treatments were placed in five adjacent trials in the vineyard. Spraying commenced in mid April, shortly after a heavy rainfall event that likely promoted the release of powdery mildew (Uncinula necator) ascospores from overwintering chasmothecia. Spraying was completed in mid July and treatments were evaluated for disease incidence and severity on 21 July 2009, at about the beginning of veraison. Trial I consisted of IR- 4 -funded biofungicide research that focused on two products: caprylic acid (a novel control agent in current development) and Actinovate (a registered product containing the bacterium Streptomyces lydicus WYEC 106). Trials II-V included various fungicide products (either currently registered or {{in various stages of}} product development) including strobilurins, demethylase inhibitors, oils, and other materials. Spray frequencies varied from weekly applications to 21 day intervals. Temperatures were mild during much of the 2009 growing season, providing optimal conditions for the asexual reproduction and dispersal of powdery mildew. Risk index data was high from about mid-May {{through the rest of the}} evaluation period and the pathogen quickly colonized leaves. Disease pressure was higher than in similar trials conducted in 2007 or 2008. By mid-June, heavy to severe mildew was evident on untreated clusters. Treatment performances varied widely. Biological fungicides generally reduced disease severity, but were more effective when used in a combination program with synthetic materials. As a stand-alone product, caprylic acid was most effective when applied weekly at a concentration of 0. 3 % (v/v). At a concentration of 0. 5 % it consistently showed phytotoxic effects on berries. A few organic materials performed well, lowering disease severity to < 10 %: paraffinic oil + Foliar Supreme (sulfur + nutrient cocktail) and two types of fertilizers alternated with trifloxystrobin.

40|$|Chemical {{control of}} Septoria leaf blotch, caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola, is {{essential}} to ensure wheat yield and food security in most European countries. Mycosphaerella graminicola has developed resistance to several classes of fungicide and, with the efficacy of azoles gradually declining over time, new modes of action and/or improvements in host varietal resistance are urgently needed to ensure future sustainable disease control. Several new-generation carboxamide fungicides with broad-spectrum activity have recently been introduced into the cereal market. Carboxamides inhibit succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex II) but, because of their single-site specificity, these fungicides may be prone to resistance development. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the risk of resistance development to different Sdh inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides in M. graminicola. UV mutagenesis was conducted to obtain a library of carboxin-resistant mutants. A range of SDHI resistance-conferring mutations was found in Sdh subunits B, C and D. Pathogenicity studies with a range of Sdh variants did not detect any fitness costs associated with these mutations. Most of the amino acid residues identified (e. g. B-S 221 P/T, B-H 267 F/L/N/Y, B-I 269 V and D-D 129 E/G/T) are directly involved in forming the cavity in which SDHI fungicides bind.

40|$|The Greenhouse Emission Model has {{recently}} been adopted as a model package for assessing emissions to and concentrations in groundwater and surface water after use of plant protection products in greenhouse crops. Stakeholders advised that the model be tested against experimental data. In October 2014, facilities of WUR Plant Research were used to perform a pilot experiment in which cucumber plants on stone wool substrate were treated with three plant protection products, using a drip irrigation method. Concentrations of the active substances were measured in both the water flowing to and draining from the substrate. GEM was tailored to the experimental conditions and used to predict concentrations {{in parts of the}} experimental system. Measured and simulated concentrations of imidacloprid and <b>fluopyram</b> were comparable from approximately 36 hours after the start of the experiment onwards. Prior to this, concentrations in the inflowing water were underestimated and concentrations in the drain water were overestimated, probably because of incomplete mixing. For dimethomorph, agreement between the measured and calculated concentrations was reached after approximately 80 hours. This more lengthy period may be due to exceeding the solubility of the substance, causing precipitation or settling on the tube walls, and redissolving later on; the model does not account for these processes. Degradation of all three substances was found to be negligible over the duration of the experiment. Plant uptake was the major dissipation process. Experimental results show that uptake of substances was lower than uptake of water, thereby supporting the transpiration stream concentration approach proposed by Briggs et al.

Southern root-knot {{nematodes}} (Meloidogyne incognita-RKN) {{are among}} the most destructive plant pathogens and are infectious on a range of crops, including lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), a crop vital to the Mid-Atlantic Region vegetable industry. Control of root-knot nematode (RKN) cannot be limited to crop rotation or the fallowing of fields due to an extensive host range and survival characteristics that enable the pathogen to persist in the soil, even in non-ideal conditions. In relatively recent years, the most effective chemical nematode controls, such as methyl bromide, organophosphate and carbamate nematicides, were found to be harmful to the environment and to non-target soil biota, leading to a reduction or even prohibition of their usage, spurring a revival in research to control RKN. ☐ In this research, the effects of new chemicals, biologicals, and cultural practices on RKN populations were examined. Chemical controls on RKN populations and lima bean plants were studied, in multiple greenhouse and microplot experiments. Emergence of lima bean seedlings was negatively affected by ethoprophos, but RKN galling and populations were significantly reduced, often as the best performing nematicide in the experiments. Two new nematicides, fluensulfone and <b>fluopyram,</b> reduced RKN galling compared to the untreated control. Spirotetramat, applied as a foliar treatment, performed equivalent to the control in every experiment (no significant effect). In addition, the use of biofumigant mustard and sorghum cover crops, which can reduce RKN levels by releasing compounds that react in the soil with an end-product resulting in natural fumigation, were investigated with findings that support the widespread use of ‘Dwarf Essex’ rapeseed in the region to control RKN. Cultural approaches also impacted RKN populations. Organic matter additions showed small but significant reductions in RKN galling with high rates of compost and chicken manure. Winter survival rates of RKN on common cover crops in the region was similar for all crops tested. University of Delaware, Department of Plant and Soil SciencesM. S...|$|E

Decline in azole sensitivity, in combination with European legislation, {{poses a threat to}} wheat production in Ireland. Azole fungicides select CYP 51 mutations differentially; it was hypothesised that using combinations of azoles could be an effective anti-resistance tool. Naturally inoculated field experiments were carried out {{in order to understand the}} impacts of using combinations of azoles, epoxiconazole and metconazole, on azole sensitivity. Approximately 3700 isolates were isolated and their sensitivity to both azoles analysed. Findings showed that limiting the number of applications, by alternating each fungicide, slowed selection for reduced azole sensitivity. Limiting azole use by reducing doses did not reduce selection for decreased azole sensitivity. Although not complete, cross-resistance was observed between the two azoles, which will lead to general reduction in azole sensitivity. A sub-selection of isolates from each treatment at each location were analysed for changes in the CYP 51 gene. Sequence analysis identified 49 combinations of mutations in the CYP 51 gene, and three different inserts in the CYP 51 promoter. Intragenic recombination also featured in these populations. Baseline studies of five new SDHIs were carried out on 209 naturally infected, non-SDHI-treated isolates. With the exception of <b>fluopyram,</b> cross-resistance was apparent between the SDHIs. Analysis of 2300 isolates found that when compared to the solo products, mixing the SDHI isopyrazam and the azole epoxiconazole increased epoxiconazole sensitivity, but had no apparent effect on isopyrazam sensitivity. SDHI resistance-conferring mutations were absent in the baseline and experimental isolates. As long as azoles are used, Z. tritici populations will continue to evolve towards resistance. Combining different modes-of-action, SDHIs and multi-sites, with azoles will relieve some of that selective pressure. To get the best out of available fungicides, they should be used in combination with host resistance and good crop management practices...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium virguliforme, {{the causal}} agent of soybean sudden death {{syndrome}} (SDS), and Heterodera glycines, {{soybean cyst nematode}} (SCN), {{are two of the}} most important pathogens of soybean. Host resistance is currently the main management strategy for both pathogens, and there are few other options available for each pathogen. Seed treatments are now an option for farmers for use of pesticides in early plant development. Bayer CropScience recently registered a seed treatment, ILeVO® (<b>fluopyram),</b> with reported activity against both SDS and SCN. The research described in the following manuscript tested ILeVO® in different combinations with currently available seed treatment products for management of each pathogen separately and together. All experiments were performed in temperature-controlled water baths in the greenhouse. The first experiment evaluated seed treatments on soybean seedlings infected with SCN alone. Plants were grown for 30 days at 27 ˚C. The experiment was run three times and the data were combined for analysis. Results for this experiment were somewhat unclear. However, plants treated with a seed treatment combination of Trilex® + Allegiance® + Poncho/VOTiVO® + ILeVO® had less SCN females per gram of root when compared to the same combination without ILeVO®. The second experiment examined the effects of ILeVO® on soybeans inoculated with F. virguliforme and F. virguliforme combined with SCN. For this experiment, water baths were maintained at 24 ˚C and plants were allowed to grow for 35 days. Three runs of this experiment were conducted, but the data from each run was analyzed separately due to changes in experimental design. No significant differences were found among the seed treatments in any of the three runs for SDS foliar symptom severity. SDS root rot severity was significantly lower for Trilex® + Allegiance® + ILeVO® compared to Trilex® + Allegiance® in one of the three experimental runs. When looking at SDS and SCN in combination, there were significantly fewer SCN females per gram of root in the presence of ILeVO® for the contrast involving Trilex® + Allegiance® + Poncho/VOTiVO® and Trilex® + Allegiance® + Poncho/VOTiVO® + ILeVO® for the first run of the experiment. There were also significantly fewer SCN females per gram of wet root mass for the contrast of Trilex®+Allegiance®+ILeVO® compared to Trilex® + Allegiance® in the third run. These results indicate that ILeVO® may negatively affect SCN, but we detected no such negative effects of ILeVO® on SDS foliar disease symptoms in our greenhouse experiments...|$|E
40|$|Nematode-protectant seed {{treatments}} for controlling the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, {{have been introduced}} for integration into existing nematode management plans. Several seed treatments labeled for H. glycines control are currently available, with more expected in the near future. This dissertation describes i) tools to study nematode chemotaxis to chemicals and roots and ii) assessment of two commercial seed treatments, ILeVO (active ingredient: <b>fluopyram)</b> and VOTiVO (active ingredient: Bacillus firmus I- 1582), on important H. glycines life processes. The first objective was to develop and test two novel microfluidic chips to study chemotaxis of plant-parasitic nematodes to chemicals (“basic chip”) and roots (“root chip”). Proof-of-concept experiments were conducted with both chips. Several ionic solutions were tested with the basic chip on second-stage juveniles (J 2 s) of H. glycines and the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. There was a differential response of the two nematode species {{to a number of}} the ionic solutions. Custom software was written to assist in tracking nematodes in the root chip using a flatbed scanner. The attraction of H. glycines J 2 s to 3 -day-old soybean seedlings (cv. Williams 82) was successfully captured using the root chips over an 18 -hour period. The second objective was to assess the effects of ILeVO and VOTiVO seed treatments on several H. glycines life processes. In greenhouse experiments, ILeVO consistently reduced H. glycines reproduction on soybean roots. Seed exudates from ILeVO-treated seeds inhibited hatching and motility of H. glycines J 2 s, relative to the untreated control. Conversely, radicle exudates from seedlings grown from ILeVO-treated seeds reduced H. glycines hatching modestly in only one experimental run did not affect motility of J 2 s. In a growth chamber experiment, ILeVO significantly reduced H. glycines root penetration compared to untreated plants at two nematode inoculation levels. In another root penetration experiment, soybeans grown from treated or untreated seeds were inoculated with H. glycines J 2 s at soil depths of 2. 5, 5, or 7. 5 cm. ILeVO reduced nematode root penetration only at the 2. 5 -cm inoculation depth. Nematode behavioral changes in response to exudates from treated and untreated seeds then were assessed using custom software. ILeVO seed exudates significantly reduced speed of H. glycines J 2 s after two hours of exposure. A flatbed scanner then was used to study the movement of H. glycines populations exposed to seed treatments. Treated and untreated seeds were incubated in well plates for one hour before removal with clean forceps and insertion of H. glycines J 2 s. The percentage of the H. glycines populations that moved over a critical threshold distance (300 μm) in the wells were evaluated every hour for 24 hours using another custom software program. ILeVO significantly reduced population movement relative to the untreated control. And H. glycines J 2 s in wells that had a seed, treated or not, had significantly less movement compared with the blank control. Overall, the results suggest that ILeVO affects multiple life processes of H. glycines. VOTiVO did not consistently affect any of the variables measured in the experiments...|$|E
