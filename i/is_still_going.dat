25|$|Radiation {{exposure}} from radon is indirect. Radon has a short half-life (4 days) and decays {{into other}} solid particulate radium-series radioactive nuclides. These radioactive particles are inhaled and remain {{lodged in the}} lungs, causing continued exposure.

25|$|The bombings {{also caused}} a major rift within the D-Company, the most {{powerful}} criminal organisation in the Mumbai underworld, headed by Dawood Ibrahim. Infuriated at the bombings, Ibrahim's right-hand man, Chotta Rajan, split from the organisation, taking most of the leadership-level Hindu aides such as Sadhu, Jaspal Singh and Mohan Kotiyan with him. Rajan's split divided the Mumbai underworld along communal lines and pitted Chotta Rajan's predominantly Hindu gang against Dawood Ibrahim's predominantly Muslim D-Company. The ensuing gang war took the lives {{of more than a}} hundred gangsters and <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on in 2017. Seven of the accused (Salim Kurla, Majeed Khan, Shakil Ahmed, Mohammed Jindran, Hanif Kadawala, Akbar Abu Sama Khan and Mohammed Latif) were assassinated by Chotta Rajan's hitmen.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the series had {{received}} attention of Fargo advertising agency H2M, who, in 2006, created its own “Talking Orange”, which is the spokesman for an ad campaign for the North Dakota Department of Transportation. Both of the two characters were two anthropomorphic oranges with ties to the Fargo-Moorhead area. Despite only slightly resembling the “Talking Orange”, the Annoying Orange was looked into by H2M’s attorneys as an intellectual property matter. Boedigheimer stated he had not watched the “Talking Orange” videos before he was told about the disagreement, also believing that the characters weren’t very similar. Boedigheimer and Grove were later sued by H2M in May 2013 for allegedly copying the character. No source has been released stating whether the case has been disclosed or <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on.|$|E
25|$|As {{cards are}} read in round, {{it is common}} for an {{opponent}} to collect and examine even while a speech <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on. This practice originated in part because cards are read at a rate faster than conversational speed but also because the un-underlined portions of cards are not read in round. Taking the cards during the speech allows the opponent to question the author's qualifications, the original context of the evidence, etc. in cross-examination. It is generally accepted whichever team is using preparation time has priority to read evidence read previously during a round by both teams. As a result, large amounts of evidence may change hands after the use of preparation time but before a speech. Most judges will not deduct from a team's preparation time for time spent finding evidence which the other team has misplaced.|$|E

25|$|Two record labels, Extasy Records (Tokyo) and Free-Will (Osaka), were {{instrumental}} in promoting the visual kei scene. Extasy was created by X Japan's drummer and leader Yoshiki and signed bands, not limited to visual kei acts, that {{would go on to}} make marks on the Japanese music scene, including , Tokyo Yankees and Ladies Room. Luna Sea and Glay, who went on to sell millions of records, with Glay being one of Japan's best-selling musical acts, had their first albums released by Extasy in 1991 and 1994. Free-Will was founded by Color vocalist and leader Dynamite Tommy, while at the time not as popular as Extasy, it had many moderately successful acts, such as By-Sexual and Kamaitachi. Currently Free-Will <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> strong and has been a major contributor in spreading modern visual kei inside and outside Japan, whereas Extasy followed its owner and became based out of the US, signing and producing American acts, and has since faded away.|$|E
25|$|Charangas supplanted the típica as the {{standard}} instrumental line-up for the danzón. Initially called charangas francesas (though {{they have nothing to}} do with France), they were 'invented' at the start of the 20th century. The formulation <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> strong, with appropriate adjustments to the instrumentation. The basic idea is to pitch the tone of the orchestra higher and brighter than the típica, by removing the brass, replacing the clarinet with a flute and replacing the kettle drums with a new invention, the pailas criollas, now called timbales. This metal-cased drum, hit with timbales sticks, and not timpani sticks, produces a distinctive effect. The two timbales drums are pitched differently, and may be supplemented with two timbalitos, pitched even higher, and one or two cencerros (cowbells). Also noteworthy is the use of the sticks on the metal casing to produce a rhythm known as the cascara. From early on these bands also included a piano. The overall effect is to produce a lighter, brighter flavor to the music; who actually originated the idea is not known.|$|E
