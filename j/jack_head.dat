He states [...] "For instance, breakfast all day, or maybe a burg-." [...] At that moment, a bus is seen to strike <b>Jack</b> <b>head</b> on, as onlookers cringe and his hat knocked off. The ad ends with Jack lying on the ground badly injured while the paramedics are being summoned. Viewers were then directed to visit the website hangintherejack.com to check on his condition.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{actuators}} typically convert {{rotary motion}} of a control knob or handle into linear displacement via screws and/or gears {{to which the}} knob or handle is attached. A jackscrew or car jack is a familiar mechanical actuator. Another family of actuators {{are based on the}} segmented spindle. Rotation of the jack handle is converted mechanically into the linear motion of the <b>jack</b> <b>head.</b> Mechanical actuators are also frequently used in the field of lasers and optics to manipulate the position of linear stages, rotary stages, mirror mounts, goniometers and other positioning instruments. For accurate and repeatable positioning, index marks may be used on control knobs. Some actuators include an encoder and digital position readout. These are similar to the adjustment knobs used on micrometers except their purpose is position adjustment rather than position measurement.|$|E

The Doctor frees Colby and helps Stael shoot himself after killing one of the new Fendahleen, in turn finding out that the Fendahleen are fatally allergic to salt, leaving the Fendahl core two short of the twelve it needs to be complete and form a gestalt. The Doctor rigs the scanner to implode upon itself and grabs the now dormant skull, leaving with the others only just before the priory is destroyed, along with the Fendahl core and the remaining Fendahleen. The Doctor and Leela then leave and plan to dump the skull near a supernova, thus ending the Fendahl race forever.|$|E

5000|$|Jack rushes over, outfights {{the enemy}} and kicks in the backup coolant all to no avail. New Atlantis explodes, killing Blake and {{thousands}} of innocents. Jack alone survives because Eve beamed {{him out of there}} just in time. She explains that President Krieger used Jack to locate and bring back the psionic orb, because this will give him all but unlimited power. Krieger then set up both Curtis Brothers—just as he set up their father years ago—to [...] "tie up the loose ends." [...] Eve is the head of a rebel faction attempting to overthrow Krieger's tyrannical Presidency and replace it with their own benevolent regime. She convinces Jack of their cause, then gives him a new psionic implant: Terrablast. Jack takes on Krieger's private army as he infiltrates the evil president's headquarters, but he gets captured by a boobytrap. Krieger uses a machine to try to retrieve the Terrablast implant from Jack's skull, but Jack resists and battles his way free of the machine. He then storms through Krieger's secret base {{and the rest of the}} evil president's forces, at last taking out Krieger. At this point, two different endings await depending on the difficulty level. In easy mode, Eve becomes President of the U.N., and <b>Jack</b> <b>head</b> of the LightStormer Corps. In hard mode, Jack himself becomes the U.N.'s new president. Either way, he gets the girl and the orb.|$|E
