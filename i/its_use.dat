5|$|A level-number of 66 is used {{to declare}} a re-grouping of {{previously}} defined items, irrespective of how those items are structured. This data level, also referred to by the associated , is rarely used and, circa 1988, was usually found in old programs. Its ability to ignore the hierarchical and logical structure data meant <b>its</b> <b>use</b> was not recommended and many installations forbade <b>its</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). <b>Its</b> <b>use</b> {{as an antidote}} is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to <b>its</b> <b>use</b> exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E

5|$|Desiccated thyroid extract is an animal-based {{thyroid gland}} extract, most {{commonly}} from pigs. It {{is a combination}} therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3.

This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but <b>its</b> <b>use</b> today is unsupported by evidence; British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage <b>its</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding <b>its</b> <b>use</b> of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to <b>its</b> <b>use</b> of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E
