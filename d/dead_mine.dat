5000|$|Following {{objections}} {{from her family}} and friends that Leard was not [...] "good enough" [...] for her, Montgomery broke off her relationship with Leard, who died shortly afterwards of the flu. In 1898, after much unhappiness and disillusionment, Montgomery broke off her engagement to Simpson. Montgomery no longer sought romantic love. Despite breaking off the relationship with Leard in 1898, Montgomery was greatly upset when she learned of his death in June 1899, writing in her diary: [...] "It is easier to think him as <b>dead,</b> <b>mine,</b> all mine in death, as he could never be in life, mine when no other women could ever lie on his heart or kiss his lips".|$|E

50|$|On March 28, 1908 the Hanna Mine #1 {{exploded}} again, trapping 18 miners.

6000|$|We come to {{my third}} argument; which is to prove, that it is lawful to hold church communion with the godly sincere believer, though he hath not be baptized with water, because he hath the DOCTRINE of baptisms (Heb 6:2).

25|$|Once {{in control}} of the city, the army encircled each {{district}} looking for young men. At first they shot whomever they saw. After a day or so, they arrested every male over the age of 15.

Helicopter gunships on the outskirts reportedly strafed civilians fleeing the city as well.|$|R

60|$|Thus {{she spoke}} most sweetly, {{looking at me}} the while with her clear and earnest eyes, that I ever fancied must be such as adorn the shining faces of angels.

50|$|In Norway {{the last}} {{available}} casualty record, from August 29, 1945, shows that {{by that time}} a total of 275 German soldiers had been killed while clearing mines, while an additional 392 had been maimed. German protests that forcing POWs to clear mines was against international law, article 32 of the Geneva conventions, were rejected with the assertion that the Germans were not POWs; they were disarmed forces who had surrendered unconditionally ("avvæpnede styrker som hadde overgitt seg betingelsesløst"). Mine clearance reports received by the Allied Forces Headquarters state: June 21, 1945; 199 dead and 163 wounded Germans; 3 Norwegians and 4 British wounded. The last registration, from August 29, 1945 lists 392 wounded and 275 <b>dead</b> Germans. <b>Mine</b> clearance was then for unknown reasons halted for close to a year before recommencing under better conditions during June-September 1946. This time many volunteered thanks to good pay, and death rates were much lower, possibly {{thanks in part to}} a deal permitting them medical treatment at Norwegian hospitals.|$|R

60|$|And as I {{looked at}} this wide expanse of houses and {{factories}} and churches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous hopes and efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this human reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung over it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled back, and that men might {{still live in the}} streets, and this dear vast <b>dead</b> city of <b>mine</b> be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave of emotion that was near akin to tears.|$|R
40|$|In March 1979 {{there was}} an {{explosion}} in a coalmine in Lancashire. As a result three men were found <b>dead</b> down the <b>mine</b> and a further seven men, all with extensive burns, died between the third and thirteenth day after the explosion. The lungs were studied in all the cases. Pulmonary infection was the commonest cause of death. Despite high levels of oxygen being given to these seven men, only one case showed a focal intra-alveolar fibrosis. In this case the inspired oxygen requirement came down before death. The toxicity of oxygen in the short term management of patients with severe trauma is questioned...|$|R
50|$|Silver was {{discovered}} in the Cochise County mountains as early as 1858, but ongoing conflict with the native Indians prevented development. In 1858, Frederick Brunckow, a Prussian-born mining engineer, built a cabin near the San Pedro River after finding a small silver deposit nearby. He hired three other white men and about a dozen Mexican miners. In September 1860, two of the white men were robbed and murdered at the cabin and Brunckow was found <b>dead</b> in the <b>mine</b> with a rock drill through him. The German cook blamed the Mexican workers for the murders. The cabin {{was the site of}} 22 murders during the frontier days.|$|R
50|$|The nitrate oficina (saltpeter mine) of Marusia {{was located}} {{in the foothills of}} the Andes in the región de Tarapacá, about 4½ miles {{northwest}} of the town of Huara. Its monthly production was 865 tons of salt. On March 1925, the mine workers went on strike to demand higher pay, a shorter workday, and better working conditions. While the negotiations were taking place between the company executives and the worker's representatives, the British engineer who ran the mine, a man much hated because of his habit of whipping his workers, was found <b>dead</b> near the <b>mine.</b> A Bolivian engineer was accused of the crime and executed without due process by decision of the company owners.|$|R
50|$|And the Saved World Remembers is {{a monumental}} {{painting}} by Belarusian artist Mai Dantsig measuring 3.75 x 7 m {{and based on}} the Sistine Madonna by Raphael Sanzio. Dantsig was inspired by the salvage of the Sistine Madonna from the bombing of Dresden during World War II. And the Saved World Remembers depicts the moment when the Sistine Madonna was retrieved by the Soviets. The background shows an army, the left side depicts a postman delivering news of victory amid ruined cities and the right side shows German soldiers among concentration camps. The painting also shows women lamenting their <b>dead</b> and a <b>mine</b> detector. Dantsig spent over ten years working on the painting and completed it in 1985, during the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.|$|R

5000|$|Frederick Brunckow, a Prussian-born mining engineer, {{discovered}} {{silver in}} the hills of Cochise County in 1858.

In September 1860, two of the white men were robbed and murdered at the cabin and Brunchow was found <b>dead</b> in the <b>mine</b> with a rock drill through him. The German cook blamed the Mexican workers for the murders. After Brunckow's death, ongoing conflict with native Indians prevented further development of the mines for several years. [...] Brunckow's San Pedro mine influenced Ed Schieffelin to prospect the rocky outcropping northeast of the cabin. [...] In 1876, Schieffelin and his party were attacked by Apaches, and a man named Lenox was killed. The cabin was the site of 22 murders during the frontier days.|$|R
