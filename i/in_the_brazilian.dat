5|$|Don Juan Manuel de Rosas, the {{dictator}} of Argentina, had assisted the separatist rebels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> province of Rio Grande do Sul during the 1830s, {{and continued to}} attempt its annexation.

5|$|Ganga Bruta was {{the sixth}} feature film {{directed}} by Humberto Mauro {{and his second}} for film studio Cinédia, a company owned by Adhemar Gonzaga.

5|$|The Unicamp {{national}} exam is very competitive {{and is considered}} one of the most difficult in Brazil.

5|$|The {{territory}} {{which would}} {{come to be known}} as Brazil was claimed by Portugal on 22 April 1500, when the navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on its coast. Permanent settlement followed in 1532, and for the next 300 years the Portuguese slowly expanded westwards until they had reached nearly all of the borders of modern Brazil. In 1808, the army of French Emperor Napoleon I invaded Portugal, forcing the Portuguese royal family—the House of Braganza, a branch of the thousand-year-old Capetian dynasty—into exile. They re-established themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> city of Rio de Janeiro, which became the unofficial seat of the Portuguese Empire.|$|E
5|$|A secessionist {{rebellion}} {{in the southern}} province of Cisplatina in early 1825, and the subsequent attempt by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata to annex it, led the Empire into the Cisplatine War. In March 1826, PedroI briefly became king of Portugal before abdicating in favor of his eldest daughter, Dona MariaII. The situation worsened in 1828 when {{the war in the}} south resulted in Brazil's loss of Cisplatina. During the same year in Lisbon, MariaII's throne was usurped by Prince Dom Miguel, PedroI's younger brother. The Emperor's concurrent and scandalous sexual affair with a female courtier tarnished his reputation. Other difficulties arose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> parliament, where a struggle over whether the government would be chosen by the monarch or by the legislature dominated political debates from 1826 to 1831. Unable to deal with problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, on 7 April 1831 PedroI abdicated in favor of his son Dom PedroII, and sailed for Europe.|$|E

5|$|As {{was common}} at the time, Joaquim Inácio began his {{education}} {{at home and}} was later enrolled in Seminário de São José (Saint Joseph School) and after that, in Seminário São Joaquim (Saint Joachim School), which became PedroII School in 1837. His teachers included Januário da Cunha Barbosa, who later {{became one of the}} leading figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> independence movement. Joaquim Inácio chose to follow his father, a naval officer who achieved the rank of second lieutenant, in his choice of a career. On 20 November 1822 at the age of 14, Joaquim Inácio was admitted as aspirante a guarda-marinha (aspiring midshipman or naval cadet) at the Navy Academy. On 11 December 1823, he graduated from the academy, majoring in mathematics, with the rank of guarda-marinha (midshipman). As he had in previous studies at other schools, Joaquim Inácio proved to be a brilliant student. Among his colleagues at the academy was Francisco Manuel Barroso da Silva (later Baron of Amazonas) whom he befriended.|$|E
5|$|Attalea {{species have}} a long history of human utilisation. Carbonised Attalea maripa seeds have been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to 9000 BP. A variety of species remain {{important}} sources of edible oil, thatch, edible seeds and fibre. The leaves of Attalea butyracea and A.maripa are used extensively for thatching. Several species are oil palms, with A.speciosa among the most important economically. Products extracted from A.speciosa were reported to support over 300,000 households <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> state of Maranhão in 2005, and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450,000 households throughout the Brazil. Piassava fibres, extracted from the leaf bases of A.funifera, are commercially important, and generated about US$20 million in annual income to Brazilian farmers in 1996.|$|E

The first professional firefighter corps in Brazil was formed during his tenure as agriculture minister. In late 1866, Inhaúma was appointed commander-in-chief of the fleet engaged in the Paraguayan War. During the fighting, he achieved the rank of admiral, the highest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> armada. He was also awarded a noble title, eventually being raised from baron to viscount. In 1868, he was elected to the national legislature's lower house, but never assumed office.|$|E
