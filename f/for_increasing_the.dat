5|$|The Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 {{was passed}} by the House and Senate before their August recess to add $16 billion in {{supplemental}} funding for the VA, with $10 billion for allowing some Veterans to receive private medical care at taxpayer expense, and $6 billion <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> number of VA staff. The Act also gives the VA Secretary expanded authority to fire managers who perform poorly, and authorized the VA to lease additional facilities.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{circumstances}} {{where this is}} not the case, and it is desirable to make the width of the transition line larger than the Doppler profile. For instance, when tracking a quickly accelerating object, the band-pass of the ALF must include within it the maximum and minimum values for the reflected light. The accepted method <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> band-pass involves placing an inert gas in the vapor cell. This gas both widens the spectral line and increases the transmission rate of the filter.|$|E

5|$|After a {{short period}} of demobilization, the major naval nations of the globe began {{programmes}} <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> size and number of their capital ships. Wilson's plan for a world-leading set of capital ships led to a Japanese counter-programme, and a plan by the British to build sufficient ships to maintain a navy superior to either. American isolationist feeling and the economic concerns of the others led to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921. The outcome of the conference included the Washington Naval Treaty (also known as the Five-Power treaty), and limitations on the use of submarines. The Treaty prescribed a ratio of 5:5:3:1:1 for capital ships between treaty nations. The treaty recognized the U.S. Navy as being equal to the Royal Navy with 525,000 tons of capital ships and 135,000 tons of aircraft carriers, and the Japanese as the third power. Many older ships were scrapped by the five nations to meet the treaty limitations, and new building of capital ships limited.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exchange}} rate stability sustained by the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem {{now known as the}} Triffin dilemma, in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.|$|E

After a decade in which she raised a daughter and taught school, she divorced, returned to the U.S., and joined the UNIA. Quickly rising in the ranks from a translator, because she was fluent in Spanish, de Mena became {{one of the leaders of}} the pan-African movement. She was responsible <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> membership of the organization in the Caribbean and Latin America. When Garvey left the U.S. and relocated to Jamaica, de Mena became Garvey's official representative in New York and was the first woman to carry such a high distinction in the organization.|$|E
5|$|The {{sections}} of the International that recognised {{the leadership of the}} International Secretariat remained optimistic about the possibilities <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> International's political influence and extended the entrism into social democratic parties which was already underway in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into communist parties and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for democratic reforms, ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution. Tensions developed between those who subscribed to the mainstream views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the World Congress, and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, John Lawrence, George Clarke, Michele Mestre (a leader of the French section), and Murray Dowson (a leader of the Canadian group).|$|E

40|$|Several {{reasons are}} offered why workers will receive larger {{compensating}} wage differentials <b>for</b> <b>increases</b> in <b>the</b> duration of wage losses than <b>for</b> <b>increases</b> in <b>the</b> probability of loss that {{produce the same}} expected loss. A formal model of occupational choice is developed that shows {{the extent to which}} <b>the</b> compensation <b>for</b> <b>increased</b> duration exceeds that <b>for</b> <b>increased</b> risk. Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data linked to industry data on injuries and unemployment, we find: 1) Nearly all the compensating wage differential for losses due to workplace injuries is compensation <b>for</b> <b>increases</b> in <b>the</b> duration of loss; 2) Similarly, nearly all the compensation for losses due to cyclical unemployment is compensation <b>for</b> <b>increases</b> in duration, especially <b>for</b> <b>increases</b> in duration beyond the 26 weeks of unemployment that are usually compensated by unemployment insurance. The compensating differentials for risk of injury are larger for union than for nonunion workers, while those for cyclical unemployment are smaller for union workers. ...|$|R
