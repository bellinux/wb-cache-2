5|$|The Dalek Prime Minister {{explains}} {{that they have}} a planet known as the Asylum where they keep insane, battle-scarred Daleks. The Parliament has received a transmission of the Habanera Aria from the Asylum. The Doctor makes contact with the source of the transmission: the survivor of a starliner crash named Oswin Oswald. Oswin claims to have spent a year fending off Dalek attacks and making soufflés. The crash had ruptured the planet's <b>force-field,</b> thus risking escape of the insane Daleks. To prevent this, the Parliament wishes to destroy the planet remotely, but the <b>force-field</b> is still too strong to allow that. The Daleks task the Doctor, Amy and Rory with deactivating the force field from the planet. The three are given bracelets to protect them from the planet's nanogene cloud, which would convert them into Dalek puppets, before being dropped onto the planet.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise, {{along with}} other ships in the sector, {{experience}} a localized time-distortion, and soon after receive a distress-call from Dr. Paul Manheim in a nearby system. Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) recalls that Manheim was ejected from the Federation Science Institute for conducting unauthorized experiments. They find the distress signal coming from a facility on a planetoid surrounded by a <b>force-field.</b> When they {{make contact with the}} facility, a woman requests help to save her husband, Dr. Manheim, and lowers the shields.|$|E
5|$|Like the old revolutionary States-General, the new National Assembly {{contained}} radically opposed parties: the unitary democrats, led by Pieter Vreede, Johan Valckenaer and Pieter Paulus, and the federalists, such as Jacob Abraham de Mist and Gerard Willem van Marle. But {{there was}} a broad continuum of opinion between these poles. In this <b>force-field</b> the federalists held the upper hand after the sudden demise of Paulus (who might otherwise have acted as a unifier). The conservative federalists were more adept at parliamentary manoeuvering (Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved himself especially adept at this). The frustration this engendered among the democrats led them to appeal to popular opinion and to extra-parliamentary action. Meanwhile, the Assembly installed a constitutional commission that in November 1796 presented a report that amounted to {{a continuation of the}} old federal arrangements. As this was totally unacceptable to the unitarists, this draft was subsequently amended into its opposite, by a compromise that finally formed a basis for a new Constitution. The Assembly now started upon a discussion of other important matters, like the separation between church and state, and the emancipation of minorities. The organs of the state were to be a bicameral Legislative Corps, to be elected in indirect elections, and a Directoire-like Executive of five members. The end result looked much like the French Constitution of 1795. This was approved by the Assembly on 10 May 1797.|$|E

Locke's goal-setting theory and Victor Vroom's expectancy theory. These tend to stress cultural differences {{and the fact}} that individuals tend to be motivated by different factors at different times.|$|E
25|$|Availability of {{high-resolution}} X-ray crystallographic {{measurements of}} complete molecular structures provides {{information about the}} type and location of all atoms that forms the protein. In BioMOCA the protein atoms are modeled as static point charges embedded in a finite volume inaccessible to the ions and associated with a user-defined dielectric coefficient. Moreover, a number of <b>force-field</b> parameters are available that provide information about the charge and radii of atoms in different amino-acid groups. The conjunction of the molecular structure and force fields provide the coordinates, radii, and charge of each atom in the protein channel. BioMOCA uses such information in the standard PQR (Position-Charge-Radius) format to map the protein system onto a rectangular grid.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} form of coarse-graining is {{the united}} atom (sometimes called extended atom) and was used in most early MD simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. For example, instead of treating all four atoms of a CH3 methyl group explicitly (or all three atoms of CH2 methylene group), one represents the whole group with one pseudo-atom. It must, of course, be properly parameterized so that its van der Waals interactions with other groups have the proper distance-dependence. Similar considerations apply to the bonds, angles, and torsions in which the pseudo-atom participates. In this kind of united atom representation, one typically eliminates all explicit hydrogen atoms except those that {{have the capability to}} participate in hydrogen bonds (polar hydrogens). An example of this is the CHARMM 19 <b>force-field.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Doctor and Amy {{land near}} each other, and are {{discovered}} by Harvey, another crash survivor. Rory, however, is {{dropped into the}} Asylum. He inadvertently awakens some of its inhabitants, but is remotely guided to safety by Oswin. Harvey, revealed to be a Dalek puppet, attacks the Doctor and Amy. He is joined by other survivors who were also converted. The puppets steal Amy's protective bracelet just before the pair are saved by Oswin, who reunites them with Rory. Amy begins experiencing symptoms of the conversion process. The Doctor, surmising that the Daleks will destroy the planet {{as soon as he}} deactivates the <b>force-field,</b> plots an escape via a nearby teleporter which will transport them to the Dalek ship. Oswin agrees to deactivate the <b>force-field</b> in return for the Doctor coming to rescue her. Rory tries to give Amy his bracelet reasoning if loves slows the Dalek puppet conversion he will be less susceptible because he has always loved Amy more than she loves him. Amy angrily replies that she loves him equally, but divorced him because of her infertility. They realize that the Doctor had secretly slipped his bracelet onto her without telling them, since he is likely immune to the nanogenes, to force them to reconcile.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor {{makes his}} way to Oswin, venturing through a section, which holds Daleks who survived {{encounters}} with him. Oswin saves the Doctor from these Daleks by removing any memories of him from the Daleks' collective telepathically-shared knowledge. The Doctor enters Oswin's chamber and discovers to his horror that she is a Dalek. Oswin is revealed to have been captured by Daleks after her ship crashed on the Asylum and, to preserve her genius-level intellect for Dalek use, was turned into a Dalek rather than a standard puppet. Unable to cope with her conversion, her mind retreated into a fantasy of survival as a human. After this revelation, Oswin is briefly overcome by her Dalek personality and nearly kills the Doctor. Oswin fulfils her promise of deactivating the <b>force-field,</b> making her final request that the Doctor remember her as the human she once was. The Doctor returns to Amy and Rory, and they teleport back to the TARDIS just as the planet is destroyed.|$|E

They are tasked with an impossible and suicidal mission: to infiltrate the planet and disable the <b>force-field</b> so that the Daleks can destroy the Asylum, stopping the prisoners from escaping. Whilst seeking a way to disable the <b>force-field,</b> the trio meet Oswin Oswald, who has a suspiciously vast amount {{of access to the}} Asylum and is able to 'hack' Dalek technology to help guide the trio's way through the Asylum. When the Doctor enters a room called 'Intensive Care', he is faced with all of the battle-scarred Daleks who had survived the Doctor's interference throughout many battles. The Doctor's presence wakes them up with the intention of exterminating him, but Oswin hacks into the path-web (a psychic layer which all Daleks use to communicate with each other) and performs a 'master delete' on all information connected to the Doctor. This causes all Daleks to forget the Doctor, not recognising him while he returns to the Dalek ship to boast about his escape from the Asylum.|$|E
2500|$|Citizens of the Culture {{live there}} only very {{occasionally}} as guests, usually {{to study the}} complex ecosystem of the airspheres and the dominant life-forms: the [...] "dirigible behemothaurs" [...] and [...] "gigalithine lenticular entities", which may be described as inscrutable, ancient intelligences looking similar to a cross between gigantic blimps and whales. The airspheres slowly migrate around the galaxy, taking anywhere from 50 to 100 million years to complete one circuit. In the novels {{no one knows who}} created the airspheres or why, but it is presumed that whoever did has long since sublimed but may maintain some obscure link with the behemothaurs and lenticular entities. Guests in the airspheres are not allowed to use any <b>force-field</b> technology, though no reason has been offered for this prohibition.|$|E
2500|$|The puzzles {{require the}} player to collect tetromino-shaped [...] "sigils" [...] by {{navigating}} mazes and overcoming obstacles within them. These include computer-controlled drones that will detonate {{if they are}} {{too close to the}} player and kill them, and wall-mounted turrets that will shoot down the player if they get close; if the player dies this way, they are reset {{to the start of the}} specific puzzle. Drones and turrets can be disabled using portable jammer units, which can also disable <b>force-field</b> walls that block the player's path. As the player collects sigils and completes more puzzles, new puzzle elements become available. Portable crystalline refractors allow the player to activate light-based switches. Boxes let the player climb to higher levels or to block the path of drones, among other factors, and large fans that can launch the player or other objects across the puzzle. Later, the player gains access to a device that can create a time recording of their actions, such that they can then interact with this recording to complete tasks, such as having the clone stand atop a switch to keep it activated for some time.|$|E

The men and the brach steal a flitter and escape, flying it to Cartl's holding, a large farmstead where they can call the authorities in Trewsport.|$|E
50|$|The Doctor and the Army plan {{to attack}} the Millennium Dome. Having {{retrieved}} his TARDIS from the base, the Doctor manages to materialize right inside the Dome but the Army cannot enter due to a <b>force-field</b> {{set up by the}} Cybermen. The Doctor cooperates with the remaining two Cybermen & the Cyberleader, and opens their portal by linking up their equipment to the TARDIS. But the Cybermen realize that the Doctor's methods do not work, and the <b>force-field</b> does not lead to the Void. Instead, it leads to Prehistoric Earth. A Tyrannosaurus rex appears and kills two Cybermen. Martha damages the <b>force-field</b> generator, and the Doctor uses an electrical cord from it to fry the Cyberleader. The portal then closes. With the Army entering too late, the Doctor and Martha say good-bye, then leave in the TARDIS to go somewhere 'peaceful'.|$|E

50|$|The Dalek Prime Minister {{explains}} {{that they have}} a planet known as the Asylum - which the Parliament is currently orbiting - where they keep battle-scarred Daleks that have gone insane. They are unwilling to kill these Daleks, as destroying such pure hatred would contravene their sense of beauty - something which sickens the Doctor. The Parliament has received a transmission of the Habanera Aria from the heart of the Asylum. The Doctor makes contact with the source of the transmission: a woman named Oswin Oswald, who states that she was Junior Entertainment Manager on the starliner Alaska, which crashed into the Asylum. Oswin claims to have been fending off Dalek attacks for a year, occupying herself by making soufflés, which intrigues the Doctor as he wonders where she got the milk and eggs. The crash had ruptured the planet's <b>force-field,</b> thus risking escape of the planet's inmates. To prevent this, the Parliament wishes to destroy the planet remotely, but the <b>force-field</b> is not ruptured sufficiently to allow that.

He is maintaining the <b>force-field,</b> preventing a rescue mission from Alpha—and, Maya interjects, holding the planet together. Magus must be countering the gravitational force of the Moon (which is much closer and larger in relation to this planet than it was to Earth); otherwise, the planet would break apart under the strain.
