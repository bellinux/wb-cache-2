Strawberries and cream is a popular dessert during the British summer, famously consumed at the Wimbledon tennis tournament. In Sweden, strawberries are a traditional dessert served on St John's Day, also known as [...] Midsummer's Eve. Depending on area, strawberry pie, strawberry rhubarb pie, or strawberry shortcake are also popular.

40|$|The {{profile of}} the {{strawberry}} polyphenols was analysed on <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberry,</b> immediately after freezing or after pasteurization and during frozen storage of strawberry at − 20 °C for 360 days. Freezing increased the extractability of (−) -epigallocatechin gallate (60 %), (−) -epicatechin (48 %) and ellagic acid (51 %) and decreased the pelargonidin- 3 -glucoside (18 %). Direct pasteurization of <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberry</b> increased the extractability for (−) -epigallocatechin gallate (73 %), (−) -epicatechin (45 %) and ellagic acid (143 %) and decreased for pelargonidin- 3 - glucoside (16 %).

40|$|AbstractVitamin C is an {{essential}} nutrient needed for maintaining the human health. Strawberry fruit have a relatively high content of vitamin C, which is around 40 - 70 mg/ 100 g strawberries. However, vitamin C which {{is also known as}} ascorbic acid is easily degraded during storage. The objective of this research is to study the kinetics of degradation of vitamin C in <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberry</b> juices upon storage and to investigate the effect of storage temperatures and sugar addition on the ascorbic acid loss in strawberry juices. Four different types of <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberry</b> juices were prepared, namely A, B, C, and D. Juices A and C were stored at a room temperature of 28 °C, while samples B and D were stored at a refrigerated temperature of 8 °C. Furthermore, juices A and B were prepared without sugar addition, while sugar was added to juices C and D. The concentration of ascorbic acid in the juice was analyzed using iodimetric titration method. It was monitored every one hour for 8 hours of storage for the kinetics of ascorbic acid degradation study. The results showed that the degradation reaction of vitamin C followed zero-order kinetic models in all types of juices. The degradation reaction rate constants obtained for juices A, B, C, and D were 4. 42; 3. 63; 2. 32; and 1. 85 mg vitamin C/(100 ml. h), respectively. The activation energy for the vitamin C degradation in <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberry</b> juices with sugar and without sugar addition was estimated to be 1. 90 kcal/ mol and 1. 65 kcal/ mol, respectively. In conclusion, the storage at a lower temperature combined with sugar addition could effectively slow the rate of degradation of vitamin C...|$|R

40|$|A finite mixture {{model is}} used to {{estimate}} farm-retail price transmission in the US <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberry</b> market.

Moreover, price changes are transmitted completely throughout the marketing channel in the off-peak regime when the market power parameter is zero, but not in the peak-harvest regime when the market power parameter is positive. This suggests that produce buyers are more apt to exercise market power when farm supplies are abundant than when they are scarce, and that the exercise of such power causes the farm-retail price linkage to become asymmetric. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to study the ability of starch, carrageenan and chitosan based coatings to extend the shelf life of strawberry fruit (Fragaria ananassa). To do so, the surface properties of <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberry</b> and the wettability of the coatings were studied. The superficial tension of the strawberry was 28. 94 mN/m, and its polar and dispersive component was 22. 99 mN/m and 5. 95 mN/m, respectively. The critical superficial tension of the strawberry was 18. 84 mN/m, obtained from a Zisman plot. The wettability of the coatings (starch, carrageenan and chitosan) is optimized with compositions of, respectively: 2 % of starch and 2 % of sorbitol; 0, 3 % of carrageenan, 0, 75 % of glicerol and 0, 02 % of Tween 80; 1 % of chitosan and 0, 1 % of Tween 80. The effect of the application of these coatings in <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberry</b> was assessed by controlling the content in soluble solids, the colour evolution, the firmness, the mass variation and the microbiological growth {{during a period of}} 6 days. No {{significant differences were found between}} the chromaticity coordinates. The minimum loss of firmness was obtained in strawberries coated with carrageenan and calcium chloride. The minimum loss of mass was obtained in fruits with chitosan and carrageenan coatings both with calcium chloride. Relatively to the content in soluble solids the coating of chitosan and calcium chloride presented the best result. The addition of 1 % of di-hydrated calcium chloride to coatings was also studied, and this was shown to decrease the microbial growth rate of the fruit.
