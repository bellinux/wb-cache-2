25|$|<b>Deinstitutionalisation</b> (or deinstitutionalization) is {{the process}} of {{replacing}} long-stay psychiatric hospitals with less isolated community mental health services for those diagnosed with a mental disorder or developmental disability. <b>Deinstitutionalisation</b> works in two ways: the first focuses on reducing the population size of mental institutions by releasing patients, shortening stays, and reducing both admissions and readmission rates; the second focuses on reforming mental hospitals' institutional processes so as to reduce or eliminate reinforcement of dependency, hopelessness, learned helplessness, and other maladaptive behaviours.|$|E
25|$|Italy was {{the first}} country to begin the <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> of mental health care {{and to develop a}} {{community-based}} psychiatric system. The Italian system served as a model of effective service and paved the way for <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> of mental patients. Since the late 1960s, the Italian physician Giorgio Antonucci questioned the basis itself of psychiatry; from 1973 to 1996 Antonucci worked on the dismantling of the psychiatric hospitals Osservanza and Luigi Lolli of Imola and the liberation – and restitution to life – of the people there secluded. In 1978, the Basaglia Law had started Italian psychiatric reform that resulted in the end of the Italian state mental hospital system in 1998.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> {{has been}} {{positive}} {{for the majority of}} patients, it also has severe shortcomings. Expectations that community care would lead to fuller social integration have not been achieved; many remain without work, have limited social contacts, and often live in sheltered environments.|$|E

The movement for <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> moved to the forefront in various countries during the 1950s and 1960s {{with the advent of}} chlorpromazine and other antipsychotic drugs.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the trend}} towards <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> {{began in the}} 1950s. Enoch Powell, the Minister of Health in the early 1960s, criticized {{psychiatric}} institutions and called {{for most of the}} care to be transferred to general hospitals and the community. In 1983, the government of Margaret Thatcher began the Care in the Community initiative {{to reduce the number of}} mental hospitals.|$|E
25|$|Findings on {{violence}} committed {{by those with}} mental disorders in the community have been inconsistent and related to numerous factors; {{a higher rate of}} more serious offences such as homicide have sometimes been found but, despite high-profile homicide cases, the evidence suggests this has not been increased by <b>deinstitutionalisation.</b> The aggression and violence that does occur, in either direction, is usually within family settings rather than between strangers.|$|E
25|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Loren Mosher, most <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> in the USA {{took place}} after 1972, {{as a result}} of the availability of SSI and Social Security Disability, long after the antipsychotic drugs were used universally in state hospitals. This period marked the growth in community support funds and community development, including early group homes, the first community mental health apartment programs, drop-in and transitional employment, and sheltered workshops in the community which predated community forms of supportive housing and supported living.|$|E

2500|$|In {{many cases}} the <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> {{of the mentally ill}} in the Western world from the 1960s onward has {{translated}} into policies of [...] "community release". Individuals who previously would have been in mental institutions are no longer continuously supervised by health care workers. Some experts, such as E. Fuller Torrey, have considered <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> to be a failure, while some consider many aspects of institutionalization to have been worse.|$|E
2500|$|In some {{countries}} where <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> has occurred, [...] "re-institutionalisation", or relocation to different institutions, has begun, {{as evidenced by}} increases {{in the number of}} supported housing facilities, forensic psychiatric beds, and the growing prison population.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{psychiatrist}} and author Thomas Szasz, <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> is {{the policy and}} practice of transferring homeless, involuntarily hospitalised mental patients from state mental hospitals into {{many different kinds of}} de facto psychiatric institutions funded largely by the federal government. These federally subsidised institutions began in the United States and were quickly adopted by most Western governments. The plan was set in motion by the Community Mental Health Act as a part of John F. Kennedy's legislation [...] and passed by the U.S. Congress in 1963, mandating the appointment of a commission to make recommendations for [...] "combating mental illness in the United States".|$|E
2500|$|A key {{text in the}} {{development}} of <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> was , a 1961 book by sociologist Erving Goffman. The book {{is one of the first}} sociological examinations of the social situation of mental patients, the hospital. Based on his participant observation field work, the book details Goffman's theory of the [...] "total institution" [...] (principally in the example he gives, as the title of the book indicates, mental institutions) and the process by which it takes efforts to maintain predictable and regular behavior on the part of both [...] "guard" [...] and [...] "captor," [...] suggesting that many of the features of such institutions serve the ritual function of ensuring that both classes of people know their function and social role, in other words of [...] "institutionalizing" [...] them.|$|E

Asylums was a key text in the development of <b>deinstitutionalisation.</b> At the same time, academic psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Thomas Szasz began publishing articles and books that were highly critical of psychiatry and involuntary treatment, including his best-known work The Myth of Mental Illness in 1961.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{homelessness}} {{started as}} a result of economic stresses in society and reductions in the availability of affordable housing such as single room occupancies (SROs) for poorer people. In the United States, in the 1970s, the <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> of patients from state psychiatric hospitals was a precipitating factor that seeded the homeless population, especially in large cities like New York City. This theory is vigorously disputed by clinical psychologist Seth Farber who points out that [...] "the emptying of the state mental hospitals took place almost entirely in the 1960s and 1970s," [...] a decade or more before the steep rise in homelessness which began in the late 1980s. Some feel that Ronald Reagan's signing (as governor of California in 1967) of the Lanterman–Petris–Short Act greatly exacerbated homelessness among the mentally ill. This law lowered the standards for involuntary commitment in civil courtrooms and was followed by significant de-funding of 1700 hospitals caring for mental patients [...]|$|E

5000|$|The {{world wide}} move to <b>deinstitutionalisation</b> and {{community}} care gathered {{momentum in the}} 1980s, and the government produced another white paper on <b>deinstitutionalisation,</b> and the Principal nurse of the time travelled overseas to look at facilities in the UK. Many staff {{found it impossible to}} believe that the hospital which had been a major employer in the rural area, and provided jobs for entire families over generations would ever close.
