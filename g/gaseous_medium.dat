In particular, we have studied the rubidium diatomic molecular <b>gaseous</b> <b>medium's</b> absorption spectrum with high resolution single mode laser spectroscopy. The derived electronic and rotational vibrational constants were used in the backward Raman amplification experiment of Rb diatomic molecule. Both experimental results and theoretical calculation confirms that there is strong backward directionally dependent radiation. This effect can further be utilized in remote detection of chemical material. In the saturated spectroscopy experiment of the cesium diatomic molecule, long-lived ground state coherence was observed. The coherence would decay at a rate less than the natural life time of the excited states, which indicates great possibility for performing the quantum optics experiments previously performed in atomic systems only. Electromagnetically induced transparency has been observed in many atomic systems for many years, while it has been seldom realized in molecular systems. In our experiment of electromagnetically induced transparency in cesium diatomic molecules, we utilized ???? energy levels, and observed subnatural linewidth.

50|$|The Townsend {{discharge}} is a {{good example}} of the creation of positive ions and free electrons due to ion impact. It is a cascade reaction involving electrons in a region with a sufficiently high electric field in a <b>gaseous</b> <b>medium</b> that can be ionized, such as air. Following an original ionization event, due to such as ionizing radiation, the positive ion drifts towards the cathode, while the free electron drifts towards the anode of the device. If the electric field is strong enough, the free electron gains sufficient energy to liberate a further electron when it next collides with another molecule. The two free electrons then travel towards the anode and gain sufficient energy from the electric field to cause impact ionization when the next collisions occur; and so on. This is effectively a chain reaction of electron generation, and is dependent on the free electrons gaining sufficient energy between collisions to sustain the avalanche.|$|E
50|$|The current {{focus in}} R&D is on cost reduction, {{increase}} of power density, increase of reliability and reduction of parasitic lumped elements. These parasitics are unwanted capacitances between circuit parts and inductances of circuit traces.

Another problem connected to parasitics is their {{negative impact on the}} switching behavior and the switching loss of the power semiconductors. Therefore, manufacturers work on minimizing the parasitic elements of their modules while keeping cost low and maintain a high degree of interchangeability of their modules with those of a second source (other manufacturer).A further aspect for optimization is the so-called thermal path between the heat source (the dies) and the heat-sink. The heat has to pass through different physical layers as solder, DCB, baseplate, thermal interface material (TIM) and the bulk of the heat-sink, until it is transferred to a <b>gaseous</b> <b>medium</b> as air or a fluid medium as water or oil. Since modern silicon-carbide power semiconductors show a larger power density, the requirements for heat transfer are rising.|$|E
