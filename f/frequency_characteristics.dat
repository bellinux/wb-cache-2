5|$|It {{had become}} {{apparent}} in around 1987 {{that a number}} of units already in the field were not up to specification. In particular, it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain KEF drivers of acceptable tolerances, particular the woofer. Measurements of the 1–1.5kHz peak of some units produced at the time were up to 6dB higher. KEF underwent a program to improve consistency of both drive-unit and the associated crossover, taking care not to alter <b>frequency</b> <b>characteristics</b> or tonal balances. KEF specially redesigned the B110, creating the B110 SP1228 where the surround changed from neoprene to a vinyl compound. KEF also designed a new crossover, designated SP2128. The crossover, also redesigned to accommodate the changes, saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms. KEF also manufactured and supplied the crossover with the drive units in kits where the pairs have been electrically matched by computer to ensure balanced performance. Martin Colloms had implied in Hi-fi News in August 1988 that the BBC had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise the design, to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained.|$|E
