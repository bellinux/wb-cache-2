2500|$|... "Gasolina", the album's lead single, was {{inspired}} by a Puerto Rican phrase about having a good time partying. Before the release of Barrio Fino, Daddy Yankee shared an apartment with {{his wife and three children}} in the Villa Kennedy housing project, where he occasionally heard people in the streets shouting [...] "¡Cómo le gusta la gasolina!" [...] ("How she likes gasoline!") at women who accepted rides from men with fancy cars. The hook [...] "a mí me gusta la gasolina, dame más gasolina" [...] ("I like gasoline, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> gasoline") was born after he chanted rhythmically what he was hearing outside. He contacted his colleague and friend Eddie Dee to work with him on the song's lyrics.|$|E

And while I am still aware of the {{distance}} between Christ's perfection and my own imperfection, I feel that the possibility is greater of lessening that distance. It <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> self-respect, more self-reliance. George Bridges says that the logical conclusion of that old doctrine is what philosophers call determinism--Calvinistic predestination. I can't believe in that. The kind of grace God <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> is the grace to help myself by drawing force from the element of him in my soul. He <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> the satisfaction of developing." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Tachikawa Air Base for Seoul at 16:31 JST. [...] Just {{one minute}} into the flight, the aircraft's No. 1 (outer left) engine burst into flames. [...] Voruz {{shut down the}} engine and called that he was returning to Tachikawa. [...] ATC asked if he wanted a ground-controlled approach (GCA), which Voruz accepted; during this, he could be heard shouting [...] "Give me more power!

The {{architect}} was {{not invited to}} the ceremony, nor was his name even mentioned during any of the speeches. He was, however, to be recognised later {{when he was asked}} to design updates to the interior of the opera house. The Utzon Room, overlooking Sydney Harbour, was officially dedicated in October 2004. In a statement at the time Utzon wrote: [...] "The fact that I'm mentioned in such a marvellous way, it gives me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction. I don't think you can <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> joy as the architect. It supersedes any medal of any kind that I could get and have got." [...] Furthermore, Frank Gehry, one of the Pritzker Prize judges, commented: [...] "Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology, and he persevered through extraordinarily malicious publicity and negative criticism to build a building that changed the image of an entire country." ...|$|E

Ingraham accepted his apology: [...] "Ed Schultz said something about me on his show that was not all that nice, to say the least. It was pretty crude. He apologized, and I accept his apology. It seemed heartfelt, {{it seemed like he}} really wished he hadn't said it and I accept that apology." [...] MSNBC issued a statement saying that it had accepted Schultz's offer to take one week of unpaid leave over the matter. Schultz ended his radio show on May 23, 2014. He stated on MSNBC, [...] "This change will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> flexibility to be on the road, to do the kind of shows I want to do here for The Ed Show here on MSNBC.
