25|$|From 1860 many {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} Persian Jewish community to secure assistance from European Jews against Muslims. These requests were full of descriptions of poverty and persecution faced by Jews in Persia. The following is one example of such requests :"Allow us to present our supplications to you. You would not want your brethren, your own flesh and blood, to perish in frightful penury, to be victims of renewed persecutions which awaits them with each passing day. We are subject to the scorn of our enemies (Muslims) who view us as defenseless and <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> whatever they like. We live every day, hour and moment of our lives in constant dread of some new tragedy which they might bring upon us. our lives, property, honor, everything that is dear to us is at the mercy of their anger and hostility, a situation which is worse than slavery. Apostate Jews have the right to inherit their parents entire estate, the widow and orphans who did not abandon their faith must hand over their property to the apostate. A Muslim who kills a Jew will not go to a trial, even if there were witnesses to the crime, the Muslim will pay at most a fine for his deed. We are groaning under the burden of disgraceful taxes.|$|E

All the talk about the French Situationists being {{associated}} with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!" [...] Cook concurs: [...] "Situationism had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing.

500|$|In the {{subsequent}} decade, two pioneers {{of the style}} became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and it had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, {{if you want to call}} it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E

They scored another top-ten hit in 1964 with the debut single written for Marianne Faithfull, [...] "As Tears Go By".
