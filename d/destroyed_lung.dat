40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the validity and reliability of the Korean version of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test (CAT) and Dyspnea- 12 Questionnaire for patients with bronchiectasis or tuberculous <b>destroyed</b> <b>lung.</b> Methods: For 62 bronchiectasis patients and 37 tuberculous <b>destroyed</b> <b>lung</b> patients, 3 questionnaires including St. George's Respiratory Questionnaires (SGRQ), CAT, and Dyspnea- 12 were obtained, in addition to spirometric measurements. To assess the validity of CAT and Dyspnea- 12, correlation with SGRQ was evaluated. To assess the reliability of CAT and Dyspnea- 12, Cronbach's α coefficient was calculated. Results: The mean ages of the patients were 60. 7 ± 8. 3 years in bronchiectasis and 64. 4 ± 9. 3 years in tuberculous <b>destroyed</b> <b>lung.</b> 46. 8 % and 54. 1 % were male, respectively. The SGRQ score was correlated with the score of the Korean version of CAT (r= 0. 72, p＜ 0. 0001) and Dyspnea- 12 (r= 0. 67, p＜ 0. 0001) in bronchiectasis patients. The SGRQ score was correlated with the score of CAT (r= 0. 86, p＜ 0. 0001) and Dyspnea- 12 (r= 0. 80, p＜ 0. 0001) in tuberculous <b>destroyed</b> <b>lung</b> patients.

40|$|Background: In Korea, {{patients}} with <b>destroyed</b> <b>lung</b> due to tuberculosis (TB) {{account for a}} significant portion of those affected by chronic pulmonary function impairment.

Results: The mean age {{of the total number of}} patients was 63 ± 9 years, where 15 patients were male. The pre-treatment mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) was 1. 02 ± 0. 31 L (44. 1 ± 16. 0 % predicted). The pre-treatment mean forced vital capacity (FVC) was 1. 70 ± 0. 54 L (52. 2 ± 15. 8 % predicted). Overall, the change in FEV 1 % predicted over baseline with tiotropium was 19. 5 ± 19. 1 % (p< 0. 001). Twenty patients (72 %) got better than a 10 % increase in FEV 1 over baseline with tiotropium, but one patient showed more than a 10 % decrease in FEV 1. Overall, the change in FVC % predicted over baseline with tiotropium was 18. 5 ± 19. 9 % (p< 0. 001). Seventeen patients (59 %) experienced greater than a 10 % increase in FVC over baseline with tiotropium; 12 (41 %) patients had stable lung function.

40|$|Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin (LT) {{is a key}} {{virulence}} {{factor of}} anthrax and contributes significantly to the in vivo pathology. The enzymatically active component is a Zn 2 +-dependent metalloprotease that cleaves most isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKKs). Using ex vivo differentiated human lung epithelium we report that LT <b>destroys</b> <b>lung</b> epithelial barrier function and wound healing responses by immobilizing the actin and microtubule network. Long-term exposure to the toxin generated a unique cellular phenotype characterized by increased actin filament assembly, microtubule stabilization, and changes in junction complexes and focal adhesions. LT-exposed cells displayed randomly oriented, highly dynamic protrusions, polarization defects and impaired cell migration. Reconstitution of MAPK pathways revealed that this LT-induced phenotype was primarily dependent on the coordinated loss of MKK 1 and MKK 2 signaling. Thus, MKKs control fundamental aspects of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. Even though LT disabled repair mechanisms, agents such as keratinocyte growth factor or dexamethasone improved epithelial barrier integrity by reducing cell death.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Early-stage {{lung cancer}} is best treated by {{anatomic}} pulmonary resection. Patients with lung cancer and severe emphysema are often denied resection or are offered only limited, nonanatomic resections when established pulmonary function criteria for lobectomy are not met. Recently, {{with the introduction}} of the volume reduction operation, selected patients with disabling emphysema have undergone excision of approximately 30 % of the most <b>destroyed</b> <b>lung</b> tissue and have subsequently demonstrated subjective and objective improvement in pulmonary function. Using these principles, we elected to combine anatomic lobectomy with volume reduction in a select group of patients with both emphysema and lung cancer who would not otherwise be candidates for pulmonary resection. Methods: Five patients with severe emphysema and suspected or proven lung cancers, who were poor candidates for anatomic lobectomy by traditional criteria but were good candidates for volume reduction, underwent lobectomy combined with volume reduction of one or more additional lobes. Results: All five patients having lung volume reduction and anatomic lobectomy for early-stage primary lung cancer did well postoperatively. Furthermore, each patient has demonstrated subjective and objective improvement in respiratory function on serial postoperative studies. Conclusions: Selected patients with disabling emphysema and suitable anatomy for volume reduction, who have a lung cancer situated in <b>destroyed</b> <b>lung</b> tissue, may benefit from combined lobectomy and volume reduction.

40|$|The {{emphysema}} of al-antitrypsin (alAT) deficiency is concep-tualized {{to result}} from insufficient alAT allowing neutrophil elastase to <b>destroy</b> <b>lung</b> parenchyma. In addition to the defi-ciency ofalAT in these individuals resulting from mutations in the alAT gene, it is recognized that, for unknown reasons, there are also increased numbers of neutrophils in their lungs compared with normal individuals. With the knowledge that alveolar macrophages have surface receptors for neutrophil elastase, we hypothesized that the neutrophil accumulation in the lower respiratory tract in alAT deficiency may result, in part, from release ofneutrophil chemotactic activity by alveolar macrophages as they bind uninhibited neutrophil elastase. Consistent with this hypothesis, alAT-deficient alveolar mac-rophages spontaneously released nearly threefold more neutro-phil chemotactic activity than normal alveolar macrophages. Analysis ofalAT-deficient macrophage supernates by reverse-phase HPLC, molecular sieve chromatography, radioimmuno-assay, and absorption with anti-LTB 4 antibody revealed {{that the majority of}} the chemotactic activity was leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4), a mediator absent from normal macrophage super-nates. Consistent with this hypothesis, incubation of normal macrophages with human neutrophil elastase resulted in the release of the same neutrophil chemotactic mediator. Further-more, purified human alAT was able to prevent the neutrophil elastase from stimulating the macrophages to release the che-motactic factor. Together, these findings suggest that the ab-sence of a normal antineutrophil elastase screen in the lower respiratory tract permits free neutrophil elastase to bind to al-veolar macrophages, resulting in the release ofLTB 4, a process which attracts neutrophils to the alveoli ofalAT deficient indi-viduals, thus accelerating the lung destruction that character...|$|R
40|$|This {{retrospective}} study of elective pneumonectomy for complicated inflammatory lung disease {{was done to}} define modern-day mortality and morbidity. One hundred twenty-four patients received elective pneumonectomy. Patient ages ranged from 6 months to 71 years. Past, recurrent, or new pulmonary tuberculosis was present in 107 patients (86. 3 %). Clinical presentation involved recurrent infections or severe suppurative sequelae (abscess, empyema). Forty-seven patients had chronic hemoptysis and 25 patients had past or recent massive hemoptysis (> 600 ml of hemoptysis fluid within 24 hours). Nutritional deficiencies were common. One hundred six patients (85. 5 %) had end-stage <b>destroyed</b> <b>lungs.</b> Evaluative bronchoscopy showed inflammatory endobronchial changes in 106 patients (85. 5 %), bronchial strictures in 4, and indolent endobronchial tumor in 2. Lung separation was by double-lumen tube in 96 patients, single lung-single tube in 6, bronchus blocker in 6, and prone posture in 9. Extrapleural pneumonectomy was done in 83 patients (66. 9 %). Fifty-seven of these procedures were left sided and 26 were right sided. Standard transpleural pneumonectomy was done in 41 patients (33. 1 %) : 30 left sided and 11 right sided. Nine pneumonectomies were conducted with the patient in the prone position. Four patients had completion pneumonectomy. Hospital mortality was three deaths (2. 4 %). Morbidity included postpneumonectomy empyema in 19 patients (15. 3 %). Seven postoperative bronchopleural fistulas occurred. Empyema in most patients was managed by open pleural drainage (thoracostoma) and later space closure. Pneumonectomy proved effective therapy with low mortality but postpneumonectomy empyema posed serious morbidity...|$|R
30|$|Colopleural fistula as a {{complication}} after lung resection is a quite rare condition. Few {{cases of}} colopleural or colobronchial fistula have been reported, and those fistulas {{are caused by}} Crohn’s disease, malignant tumor of gastrointestinal tract, or other clinical conditions. On the other hand, the aspergillus species are sometimes detected in the lung in immune-compromised hosts and are liable to infect preexisting <b>destroyed</b> <b>lung.</b> Aspergillus invades by destroying lung structure and causes hemosputum, hemoptysis, and other severe complications. Here, we describe an extremely rare case with colopleural fistula caused by lung aspergillus which was revealed after lung resection. The patient had gotten in serious straits but was successfully treated with immediate colostomy and appropriate drainage.|$|E
40|$|Hemoptysis {{constitutes}} a common and urgent medical problem. Swift and effective management is of crucial importance, especially in severe, life-threatening cases. Because of bronchial artery or {{a branch of}} pulmonary artery erosion due to cavitary infiltration, bronchiectasis, fungus ball, broncholithiasis, or <b>destroyed</b> <b>lung,</b> the bleeding can lead to highly compromised gas exchange or sometimes can be a life-threatening situation. Chest computerized tomography and bronchoscopy remain the methods of choice for lateralization of the disease. Some patients can be treated successfully with endobronchial interventions. Bronchial artery embolization can be rewarding in some patients but the recurrence rate is higher in tuberculosis than other etiologies of hemoptysis. Surgical resection of the lung, mainly lobectomy, remains a life-saving procedure {{but it should be}} performed very selectively to avoid higher postoperative morbidity and mortality...|$|E

The Indacaterol effectiveness in COPD patients with Tuberculosis history (INFINITY) study assessed the efficacy and safety of once-daily inhaled indacaterol 150 µg for the treatment of Korean COPD patients with <b>destroyed</b> <b>lung</b> by TB and moderate-to-severe airflow limitation. Methods: This was a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study, in which eligible patients were randomized (1 : 1) to receive either once-daily indacaterol 150 µg or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s at Week 8; the secondary endpoints included changes in transition dyspnea index score and St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD score at Week 8. Safety was evaluated over 8 weeks. Results: Of the 136 patients randomized, 119 (87. 5 %) completed the study treatment. At Week 8, indacaterol significantly improved trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s versus placebo (treatment difference [TD] 140 mL, P< 0. 001). Statistically significant improvement in transition dyspnea index score (TD = 0. 78, P< 0. 05) and numerical improvement in St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD score (TD =- 2. 36, P= 0. 3563) were observed with indacaterol versus placebo at Week 8. Incidence of adverse events was comparable between the treatment groups. Conclusion: Indacaterol provided significantly superior bronchodilation, significant improvement in breathlessness and improved health status with comparable safety versus placebo in Korean COPD patients with <b>destroyed</b> <b>lung</b> by TB and moderate-to-severe airflow limitation.

40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the most deadly cancer in the United States. Radiation therapy uses {{ionizing}} radiation with high energy to <b>destroy</b> <b>lung</b> tumor cells by damaging their genetic material, preventing those cells from reproducing. The most challenging aspect of modern radiation therapy for lung {{cancer is the}} motion of lung tumors caused by patient breathing during treatment. Most gating based radiotherapy derives the tumor motion from external surrogates and generates a respiratory signal to trigger the beam. We propose a method that monitors internal diaphragm motion, which can provide a respiratory signal that is more highly correlated to lung tumor motion compared to the external surrogates. We also investigate direct tracking of the tumor in fluoroscopic video imagery. We tracked fixed tumor contours in fluoroscopic videos for 5 patients. The predominant tumor displacements are well tracked based on optical flow. Some tumors or nearby anatomy features exhibit severe nonrigid deformation, especially in the supradiaphragmatic region. By combining Active Shape Models and the respiratory signal, the deformed contours are tracked within a range defined in the training period. All the tracking results are validated by a human expert and the proposed methods are promising for applications in radiotherapy. Another important aspect of lung patient treatment is patient setup verification, which is needed to reduce inter- and intra-fractions geometry uncertainties and ensure precise dose delivery. Currently, there is no universally accepted method for lung patient verification. We propose to register 4 DCT and 2 D x-ray images taken before treatment to derive the couch shifts necessary for precise radiotherapy. The proposed technique leads to improved patient care...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is characterised by {{an excess}} of free proteinases that <b>destroy</b> <b>lung</b> tissue. Despite this, previous {{studies have shown that}} patients with CF with a mild deficiency variant of the proteinase inhibitor α 1 -antitrypsin have less, rather than more, severe pulmonary disease. Alpha 1 -antichymotrypsin is another important serine proteinase inhibitor that protects the lung against proteolytic attack, and point mutations in the α 1 -antichymotrypsin gene that result in plasma deficiency are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  METHODS—The effect of α 1 -antichymotrypsin deficiency and the - 15 α 1 -antichymotrypsin signal peptide genotype on lung function was assessed in patients with CF.  RESULTS—One hundred and fifty seven patients with CF were screened and 10 were identified with a plasma deficiency of α 1 -antichymotrypsin (plasma concentration < 0. 2 g/l). In a multivariate analysis these individuals had significantly less severe lung disease than those who had normal or raised levels of α 1 -antichymotrypsin: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 69. 9 % predicted versus 53. 2 % predicted (p= 0. 04) and chest radiographic score of 7. 2 versus 9. 7 (p= 0. 03) for those with and without α 1 -antichymotrypsin deficiency, respectively. The - 15 signal peptide genotype did not affect plasma levels, but the - 15 Ala/Ala signal peptide genotype was over-represented in individuals with CF compared with healthy blood donor controls.  CONCLUSION—These data indicate that deficiency of α 1 -antichymotrypsin is associated with less severe pulmonary disease in patients with CF, and support our previous observations that mild genetic deficiency of a proteinase inhibitor is associated with an improved outcome. ...|$|R
