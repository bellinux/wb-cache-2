As Venkatadri Express chugs along, we wonder how he’s going to weave in innumerable characters into a tightly-knit plot. This isn’t comedy that will knock your socks off; nor is it an assembly of mindless gags. Venkatadri Express is backed by reasonably good writing and acting makes for an entertaining watch." [...] Desimartini.com gave a review stating [...] "The defining moments of the film come when Sundeep restrains himself all the time from committing the hundredth mistake. Venkatadri Express starts with a gripping narration and towards the end it meanders into a <b>dripping</b> <b>zone.</b> Further, {{the weight of the}} climax pulls it down. However, the movie stays faithful to its genre and provides a thrilling experience. The movie falls short of being an edge-of-the-seat thriller but has its moments" [...] and rated the film 3/5. Film Fog stated [...] "'Venkatadri Express' is a Family Entertainer and it analysed and published [...] "Director Merlapaka Gandhi {{has come up with a}} unique story line and while the presentation was rich, Though you can find few flaws during the establishment of story. The dialogues were just okay but the twists and emotions were worked very well. The script was made with good amount of entertainment but the screenplay was not up to the mark. Ramana Gogula background score was good and songs were worth watching more than hearing. Chota K Naidu's Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was required during second half. Costumes were well designed while the art department was natural. Sundeep Kishan is good with his casual acting. Rakul Preet Singh is beautiful, she has potential. As usual, Nagineedu was natural. Positives of the film are Thagubothu Ramesh - Sapthagiri comedy, lead performances and Music. Others did their bit as required and added value." ...|$|E
40|$|A first {{principle}} based {{mathematical model}} has been developed to characterise the effect of total liquid hold-up on the bosh silicon distribution behaviour in the <b>dripping</b> <b>zone</b> of a blast furnace. Two specific cases of hold-up behaviour have been investigated, namely, hold-up in the absence and {{in the presence of}} counter current gas flow conditions. The model exemplifies coupled phenomenon of chemical kinetics, transport processes and liquid hold-up to characterise the silicon behaviour in the <b>dripping</b> <b>zone.</b> The present modelling investigation shows that the bosh silicon level diminishes with the enhanced liquid hold-up in the <b>dripping</b> <b>zone.</b> Further, the influence of counter current gas flow on the hold-up is not significant. However, it has been observed that the liquid phase temperature reduces with increased liquid hold-up in <b>dripping</b> <b>zone</b> under steady state operating conditions. The model predictions of bosh silicon distribution have been validated with the published literatures (bulk values) and found to be in good agreement...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of molten}} iron and slag in the <b>dripping</b> <b>zone</b> of a blast furnace is very {{critical}} {{to reach a}} stable operational condition. The existence of several fluid phases and solid particles in the <b>dripping</b> <b>zone</b> of a blast furnace, makes the newly developed eXteneded Discrete Element Method (XDEM) as an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, suitable to resolve the <b>dripping</b> <b>zone</b> of a blast furnace. In the proposed model, the fluid phases are treated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) while the solid particles are solved by Discrete Element Method (DEM). These two methods are coupled via momentum, heat and mass exchanges. The main focus of current study is to investigate the influence of packed properties such as porosity and particle diameters, calculated by the XDEM, on the fluid phases for isothermal. In order to present the capability of the XDEM for this application. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by comparing model prediction results with the available experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{physical}} {{thermal model}} {{was established in}} this study, and the gas temperature in the model was measured with temperature sensors under different experimental conditions. The {{results show that the}} packed bed, cohesive zone, <b>dripping</b> <b>zone</b> and raceway in melter gasifier can be roughly distinguished by temperature gradient analysis along the vertical direction. The changes of different zones in the COREX melter gasifier were also investigated in this paper under different operation conditions...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that the dynamic {{viscosity}} coefficient of slag – with an increased titanium compounds content in the reducing conditions of the blast furnace - may rapidly change. The products of the reduction reaction, precipitation and separation of titanium compounds {{are responsible for the}} thickening effect of the slag and the problems of permeability of blast furnace, causing anomalies in the dipping zone. The presence of solid components (particles) in the melts determines the rheological character of the entire system. Identifying the rheological character of semi-solid slag systems provides opportunities for the development of mathematical modeling of liquid phase flows in a <b>dripping</b> <b>zone</b> of the blast furnace, allowing e. g to indentify the unstable parts of a metallurgical aggregate...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dripping</b> <b>zone</b> plays {{a crucial}} role in modern high {{productivity}} blast furnaces; it affects production rate, hot metal quality, and process efficiency. This is a four phase region, where gas, solid, liquid, and powder coexist with each other. Solid and liquid flow downward driven by gravity, whereas gas and powder suspended in the gas flow upward due to the pressure force. The flow of four phases in this region is considerably different from that in the upper shaft region due to the geometry and the presence of deadman zone at the center and discrete raceways at the periphery. This paper presents the review of the current status of the understanding of this flow phenomena of different phases namely, granular solids, dripping liquids, powder, and gas. Discussion on the fundamental aspects of the flow of each phase are followed by review of the current status of experimental investigations and modeling efforts. Gaps in understanding and challenges ahead for future investigations are suggested...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the complicated in-furnace phenomena of pulverized coal injection in ironmaking blast furnaces, a three-dimensional CFD model has been developed to simulate the gas-particle behaviors in not only raceway cavity but also the surrounding coke packed bed under practical conditions. The model considers two different fuels, pulverized coal and coke bed. The model is validated against the measurements in terms of coal burnout and gas composition, respectively. The typical in-furnace phenomena are simulated. Then an array of parametric study is carried out to evaluate the effects of local porosities of different coke bed zones. The qualitative and quantitative analysis is conducted. The results indicate that the local porosities of different coke bed zones can affect the coal burnout and gas composition differently: significantly in the deadman zone but insensitive in the <b>dripping</b> <b>zone.</b> In addition, the present model is able to provide a more reliable indicator to describe coal burnout, i. e. burnout over raceway surface, rather than burnout only along the centerline. The model is expected to be useful for understanding the flow-thermo-chemical behaviors and then optimizing the PCI operation in full-scale blast furnaces. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{description of}} fluid flow through porous media {{is very important}} to predict, design and optimize many industrial phenomena principally in condition where experimental studies are difficult to perform. In these kind of problems numerical simulations can help to gain a better process understanding. During last decades many numerical approaches mainly Finite Volume Method (FVM) were applied to model different multiphase flows containing gas, liquid and solid phases. The solid phase may treat by continuous or discrete frameworks. In the former method which is based on Eulerian framework the solid phase is considered as a continuous phase like other fluid phases while in the second method which is based on Lagrangian framework, the solid phase is considered as separate particles. In this study, the flow behavior of several incompressible isotherm phases through solid particles was modelled. The model describes the motion of fluid flows such as gas and liquid phases using continuum approach by applying Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as a numerical method and the solid particles by Lagrangian framework using so-called eXtended Discrete Element Method (XDEM). XDEM is a numerical simulation framework based on classical Discrete Element Methods (DEM) extended by consideration of thermophysical states. A combination of the two numerical methods was performed through momentum and mass exchange between fluid and solid phases which is called combined continuum discrete approach. The solid phase is considered as packed solid particles. The model results demonstrate enormous effect of solid particles on deviation of fluid phases while passing through particles by testing different drag force models. This model was applied to the <b>dripping</b> <b>zone</b> of blast furnace where the liquid phases of liquid iron and slag flow downward through coke particles and gas phase ascends upwards through the shaft which is classified as a counter-current multiphase packed bed reactor. The main goal of this project is to provide a solver which is able to treat several fluid phases through porous media using combined Eulerian-Lagrangian framework by exchanging data between this two approaches...|$|E
