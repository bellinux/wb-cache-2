5|$|Novick sent Cody's {{screenplay}} to {{his friend}} Jason Reitman; by the time Reitman had read halfway through the script, he felt {{that if he did}} not direct the film, he would regret {{it for the rest of}} his life. Initially, Reitman found it difficult to acquire the script, because his first film, Thank You for Smoking, had not been released yet, so he did not have any feature film credits. Other directors, including Jon Poll, were considered, but Reitman was chosen and he interrupted work on his own spec script in order to direct Juno. Cody says she had a cynical attitude when writing Juno ("I didn't <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> this film would be produced") and, indeed, the film was delayed by financial problems. After its controversial nature scared off a number of major studios, John Malkovich's production company, Mr. Mudd, took on the project. It was later brought to production company Mandate Pictures by co-producer Jim Miller.|$|E
25|$|Safe solo divers must be self-sufficient, well trained, {{prepared}} and practised. They {{should have a}} completely redundant set of all life support equipment (e.g. a complete, self-contained backup breathing gas supply). In addition, the responsible solo divers adhere to a very conservative dive profile, both in depth and level of difficulty. Unlike the buddy system, which encourages divers to rely on others {{in the event of}} an emergency, solo diving encourages divers to prepare themselves to overcome emergencies by their own means. The divers who engage in solo diving are typically those who are experienced and equipped enough to handle problems themselves. Solo divers must feel totally comfortable and relaxed in doing this sort of diving, and nobody should <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of doing diving solo if they are not both competent and comfortable in doing so.|$|E

500|$|Murasaki {{probably}} {{earned an}} ambiguous nickname, [...] "The Lady of the Chronicles" [...] (Nihongi no tsubone), for teaching Shōshi Chinese literature. A lady-in-waiting who disliked Murasaki {{accused her of}} flaunting her knowledge of Chinese and began calling her [...] "The Lady of the Chronicles"—an allusion to the classic Chronicles of Japan—after an incident in which chapters from Genji were read aloud to the Emperor and his courtiers, one of whom remarked that the author showed {{a high level of}} education. Murasaki wrote in her diary, [...] "How utterly ridiculous! Would I, who hesitate to reveal my learning to my women at home, <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of doing so at court?"

500|$|After {{graduating from}} the Ethical Culture School, Marshall spent a year at Columbia University. In 1920, he {{transferred}} to the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. [...] Marshall had decided in his teens {{that he wanted to}} be a forester, writing then about his love of [...] "the woods and solitude;" [...] he wrote that he [...] "should hate to spend the greater part of my lifetime in a stuffy office or in a crowded city". For a while he was unhappy and withdrawn at Syracuse. But, he succeeded academically and was known for his individuality. As one classmate put it, Marshall was [...] "always doing something no one else would <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of doing. He was constantly rating things—the Adirondack peaks, his best days with George, and dozens of others." [...] Marshall became a member of Alpha Xi Sigma, the forestry college's honor society. He ran on the Syracuse University freshman track team and participated in both junior varsity lacrosse and cross country running. Halfway through school, Marshall had become a class leader; he was elected as class secretary and appointed an associate editor of the Empire Forester, the College's yearbook.|$|E
500|$|... "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is an electropunk song, which {{consists}} of three songs welded together, according to journalist Peter Robinson: one with a samba rhythm, one with a sped-up sample and a breakbeat, and an intro from elsewhere. The track opens with Cole singing over a [...] "spooky" [...] instrumentation. Her vocals have been vocodered and she sings [...] "Cause I've been sitting back, no chance of falling / Hoping that nothing ever blows, no no / Boy, did you <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> that loving would be / Nothing more than walking me home, no no". As the chorus begins, the song incorporates a sample from Scottish rock band Nazareth's 1975 track [...] "Hair of the Dog", and the group starts singing, [...] "Did you tell him? No no no / Give him kisses? No no no / Whisper honey? No no no / You're delicious? Hell no". John Murphy of musicOMH noted that [...] "Sexy! No No No.." [...] is not [...] "structured like a proper pop song - there's no verse-chorus-verse". The instrumentation of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is composed of multi-layered guitar riffs and [...] "euphoric woo woo-oo harmonies", while the song's structure follows as introduction, chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, middle eight, verse. A Newsround reviewer described the lyrical content, saying that Girls Aloud are [...] "trying {{a different approach to}} getting the guy", in that [...] "instead of being 'sexy', they've backed off." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Lovato {{started to}} work and {{recorded}} on her second album, right after filming from the first season of Sonny with a Chance. In April 2009, Lovato explained about the album's process and collaborating with songwriters from the album including Jon McLaughlin and The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett. According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly finished in just two weeks, noting that she [...] "basically went from full time acting mode to full time album mode". As she wanted to accomplish more [...] "John Mayer-ish type of songs", she contacted Mayer's management in order to collaborate him, citing {{him as one of}} her biggest musical influences. Mayer accepted the offer, of which Lovato said, [...] "I was completely shocked [...] It was more of a pipe dream. I didn't <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> it would be a reality, but it came true. He was taking a chance on working with a younger artist in the pop realm." [...] The two wrote three songs together, [...] "World of Chances", [...] "Love is the Answer" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Love Me". Lovato said that it was intimidating to work with him as she was worried that he would not like her lyrics, and she would get [...] "super excited" [...] whenever he complimented her. [...] "World of Chances", the first song she wrote with Mayer, was the only of these songs to make the album's final cut. The song was inspired by Lovato's first experience of love and heartbreak.|$|E

At that point, the notorious Chechen warlord Arbi Barayev contacted Gelayev, promising him aid and transportation to a safe area. When Gelayev's forces arrived at the specified meeting place, where buses {{were supposed to be}} waiting to evacuate their wounded, they were ambushed by a large number of Russian troops. They retreated to Gelayev's native village of Komsomolskoye (Saadi-Kotar). There, around a thousand or more rebels were trapped and the village was pounded for weeks by the federal forces in the Battle of Komsomolskoye, one of the bloodiest battles of the war, ending with hundreds of Chechen fighters and civilians dead, along with more than 50 government troops (according to Russian figures). Gelayev escaped, but with only a fraction of his men, and many of demoralized survivors decided to give up the fight. Anna Politkovskaya wrote, [...] "How could he <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of taking the war home, to Komsomolskoe, knowing in advance that his own home village would be destroyed!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Ward {{was killed}} in the Battle of Cixi and his {{successor}} H. A. Burgevine, an American was disliked by the Imperial Chinese authorities. Burgevine was an unsavory character known for his greed and for being an alcoholic. Moreover, Burgevine made little effort to hide his racism, and his relations with the Chinese were very difficult at the best of times. Li Hongzhang, the governor of the Jiangsu province, requested Staveley to appoint a British officer to command the contingent. Staveley selected Gordon, who had been made a brevet major in December 1862 and the nomination was approved by the British government. Given Burgevine's alcoholism, open corruption, and a tendency to engage in acts of mindless violence when drunk, the Chinese wanted [...] "a man of good temper, of clean hands and a steady economist" [...] as his replacement. These requirements led Staveley to choose Gordon. Li was impressed with Gordon, writing:It is a direct blessing from Heaven, the coming of this British Gordon. ... He is superior in manner and bearing to any of the foreigners whom I have come into contact with, and does not show outwardly that conceit which makes most of them repugnant in my sight...What an elixir for a heavy heart-to see this splendid Englishman fight! ... If there is anything that I admire nearly as much as the superb scholarship of Zeng Guofan, it is the military qualities of this fine officer. He is a glorious fellow!...With his many faults, his pride, his temper, and his never-ending demand for money – but he is a noble man, and in spite of all I have said to him or about him, I will <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> most highly of him. ... He is an honest man, but difficult to get on with. Gordon was honest and incorruptible, and unlike many Chinese officers, did not steal the money that was meant to pay his men, but rather insisted on paying the Ever Victorious Army on time and in full. Gordon's insistence on paying his men meant that he always pressing the Imperial government for money, something which often irritated the mandarins who did not understand why Gordon did not just let his men loot and plunder as a compensation for wages. Gordon designed the uniform for the Ever Victorious Army, which consisted of black boots together with turbans, jackets and trousers that were all green while his personal bodyguard of 300 men wore blue uniforms.|$|E
