In the video, she sings [...] "When I lay in bed <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> myself and I think of you". The video then shows Gaga rehearsing for the festival and displays in pink font, [...] "We wanna give you #sexdreams'". Gaga also promoted the song on social media by posting song lyrics ("Last night damn, you were in my #SexDreams doing really nasty things"), and encouraging use of a hashtag containing lyrics (#whenilayinbeditouchmyselfandthinkofyou).|$|E
500|$|The anti-gang-violence [...] "Beat It" [...] {{became a}} homage to West Side Story and was Jackson's first {{successful}} rock cross-over piece. Jackson later said of [...] "Beat It", [...] "the point {{is no one}} has to be the tough guy, you can walk away from a fight and still be a man. You don't have to die to prove you're a man". [...] "Human Nature", co-written by Steve Porcaro of the band Toto, is moody and introspective, as conveyed in lyrics such as, [...] "Looking out, across the morning, the City's heart begins to beat, reaching out, <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> her shoulder, I'm dreaming of the street".|$|E
500|$|Those {{close to}} him thought he was {{suffering}} from dementia, and in mid-1960 Mary placed him in a clinic near Merano when his weight dropped. He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a neo-Fascist May Day parade in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The following year he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi: [...] "I spoil everything <b>I</b> <b>touch.</b> I have always blundered... All my life I believed I knew nothing, yes, knew nothing. And so words became devoid of meaning." ...|$|E

500|$|R. Kelly, portraying [...] "The Remix Killer", {{released}} an unofficial remix {{of the song}} in April 2008. During most of his section of the song, Kelly sings of shining, drinking and two-stepping in a club, and he promises to kiss any place on Mariah's body she wants: [...] "Girl, if you let me, I'm gonna touch it / But if <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> it, I'm gonna wanna hit it." [...] Later, he mimics Carey's bridge: [...] "If some honies up in here that want me to touch her body / Touch it / Let me hear you say, 'I-i-i-i do.'" [...] According to Kelly, the remix is unofficial, and his lyrics are freestyle rap.|$|E
500|$|Eisenberg has obsessive–compulsive {{disorder}} and is open about it. He {{said of his}} condition: [...] "I touch the tips of my fingers in a weird way; I don't step on cracks; if I'm going onto a new surface – be it carpet to concrete, or concrete to wood, or wood to concrete, any new surface – I {{have to make sure}} all parts of my feet touch the ground equally before <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> that new thing. So I'll often hesitate before walking into a new room." [...] He has also spoken about going to therapy to manage his anxieties – OCD, separation anxiety, social anxiety – and depression, the latter of which he struggled with a lot when he was younger, as well as how acting helped him better cope. He has said that acting serves as his coping mechanism.|$|E
500|$|Bågenholm {{arrived at}} the {{hospital}} at 21:10. Her body temperature {{at the time was}} , the lowest survived body temperature ever recorded in a human with accidental hypothermia, until fellow Swede Stella, 7 years old, survived [...] at Christmas 2010. Dr. Mads Gilbert, an anesthesiologist and the chief of the hospital's emergency room, proceeded with the resuscitation attempt. He commented on Bågenholm's state: [...] "She has completely dilated pupils. She is ashen, flaxen white. She's wet. She's ice cold when <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> her skin, and she looks absolutely dead." [...] Gilbert had treated many cases of hypothermia before because of the cold climate in Norway, and knew how to treat Bågenholm. The electrocardiogram connected to her showed no signs of life, but Gilbert knew patients should be [...] "warmed up before you declare them dead". He and his team hoped Bågenholm's brain had received enough oxygen from the CPR she was given after her rescue.|$|E

500|$|The pair {{travelled}} through Innsbruck, then {{due south}} to the Brenner Pass into Italy. They continued through Bolzano and Rovereto to Verona and Mantua, before turning west towards Milan. Leopold's financial plans for the journey were broadly {{the same as for}} the family's grand tour—travel and accommodation costs were to be met by concert proceeds. This [...] winter journey to Milan occupied a difficult and unpleasant six weeks, with the weather forcing extended stops. Leopold complained in his letters home about unheated inn rooms: [...] "...freezing like a dog, everything <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> is ice". Early concert receipts were modest; according to Leopold, costs were running at around 50florins a week. After having unwisely boasted about profits made from the grand tour, Leopold was now more cautious about revealing financial details. He tended to emphasise his expenses and minimise his takings, writing, for example: [...] "...On the whole we shall not make much in Italy...one must generally accept admiration and bravos as payment." ...|$|E

When Shaw asked: [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> it?", the reply was, to his surprise: [...] "You {{do what you have to}} do." ...|$|E

[...] "A world of experimentation and hopefully some happy accidents". The animated short <b>I</b> <b>Touch</b> a Red Button Man, a collaboration between Lynch and the band Interpol, played in the background during Interpol's concert at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2011. The short, which features Interpol's song [...] "Lights", was later made available online.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{poems are}} studied in British schools at GCSE, National 5, A-level, and Higher levels. In August 2008, her Education for Leisure, {{a poem about}} violence, {{was removed from the}} AQA {{examination}} board's GCSE poetry anthology, following a complaint about its references to knife crime and a goldfish being flushed down a toilet. The poem begins, [...] "Today I am going to kill something. Anything./I have had enough of being ignored and today/I am going to play God." [...] The protagonist kills a fly, then a goldfish. The budgie panics and the cat hides. It ends with him, or her, leaving the house with a knife. [...] "The pavements glitter suddenly. <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> your arm." ...|$|E
2500|$|Utilisation: Any {{utilisation}} {{leads to}} increasing trance depth. All utilisation should proceed as {{a continuation of}} extension of the initial procedure. Much can be done nonverbally; for example, if any subjects are just looking blankly at me, I may slowly shift my gaze downward, causing them {{to look at their}} hand, which <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> and say [...] "look at this spot.". This intensifies the trance state. Then, whether the subjects are looking at you or at their hand or just staring blankly, you can use your left hand to touch their elevated right hand from above or the side - so long as you merely give the suggestion of downward movement. Occasionally a downward nudge or push is required. If a strong push or nudge is required, check for anaesthesia.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 April, the {{cardinals}} assembled in St. Peter's Basilica {{in the morning}} to concelebrate the mass Pro Eligendo Romano Pontifice (For the Election of the Roman Pontiff). As Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was the principal concelebrant. He chose to give the homily himself. In the afternoon, {{the cardinals}} assembled in the Hall of Blessings for the procession to the Sistine Chapel. The cardinals proceeded to the Sistine Chapel while the Litany of Saints was chanted. After taking their places the [...] "Veni Creator Spiritus" [...] ("Come, Creator Spirit") was sung. Cardinal Ratzinger read the oath. Each cardinal elector beginning with Ratzinger, followed by Vice Dean Angelo Sodano and the other cardinals in order of seniority, affirmed the oath by placing his hands on the book of the Gospels saying aloud: [...] "And I, , do so promise, pledge and swear. So help me God and these Holy Gospels which <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> with my hand." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Telephone" [...] was {{originally}} written by Gaga for singer Britney Spears's sixth studio album, Circus (2008), but Spears's label rejected it. Later, Gaga recorded the song as a collaboration with Beyoncé for The Fame Monster. The song {{talks about the}} singer preferring the dance floor rather than answering her lover's call with the verses sung in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats. Gaga explained that the song deals with her fear of suffocation, [...] "fear [...] never being able to enjoy myself. 'Cause I love my work so much, I find it really hard {{to go out and}} have a good time." [...] In [...] "So Happy I Could Die", Gaga presents an ode to sexual feeling and actions, stating, [...] "I love that lavender blonde, The way she moves the way she walks, <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> myself, can't get enough." [...] Essentially a love song, the object of affection in [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] becomes Gaga herself as she talks about drinking, dancing, observing, and touching herself. Gaga's voice sounds sedated in the song. The song also uses Auto-Tune in the singer's vocals. The last song on The Fame Monster is [...] "Teeth", which contains gospel music and S style music composition.|$|E
2500|$|Blampied’s {{earliest}} etchings are dated December 1909, {{suggesting that}} he did not begin to learn this technique until the academic year 1909–1910; his teacher at Bolt Court was Walter Seymour. Blampied’s prints were first shown at an exhibition of students’ work in March 1914, where his etching of an ox cart was noted by the correspondent of The Times. [...] The first print believed to have been published was an etching entitled At the wings (illustration removed) which was reproduced in the Annual Report of Bolt Court in 1914. Blampied later recorded his method of working on zinc for etching and copper for drypoint in Ernest Stephen Lumsden's treatise The Art of Etching. Blampied wrote: [...] "I generally chose from amongst my various drawings one which would tend to produce a successful plate. I do not trace on to the copper, but copy a few important lines on to the bare metal with litho-chalk. I then sketch over this with an ordinary sewing needle and rub in a little black oil-colour[...] [...] From the first my efforts are to improve on the sketch until I consider the plate finished[...] [...] In very few cases do <b>I</b> <b>touch</b> a plate after the first proof, so the majority have but one state. If I am dissatisfied with either the composition or details, I prefer to start afresh upon another plate rather than make radical alterations." ...|$|E
