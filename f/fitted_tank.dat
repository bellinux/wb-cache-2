5000|$|Chemical tankers {{often have}} a system for tank heating in order to {{maintain}} the viscosity of certain cargoes, typically by passing pressurized steam through stainless steel 'heating coils' in the cargo tanks, transferring heat into the cargo which circulates in the tank by convection. All modern chemical tankers feature double hull construction and most have one hydraulically driven, submerged cargo pump for each tank with independent piping, which means that each tank can load a separate cargo without any mixing. Consequently, many oceangoing chemical tankers may carry numerous different grades of cargo on the same voyage, often loading and discharging these [...] "parcels" [...] at different ports or terminals. This means that the scheduling, stowage planning and operation of such ships requires a high level of coordination and specialist knowledge, both at sea and on shore. Tank cleaning after discharging cargo is a very important aspect of chemical tanker operations, because tanks which are not properly cleaned of all cargo residue can adversely affect the purity of the next cargo loaded. Before tanks are cleaned, they must be properly ventilated and checked to be free of potentially explosive gases. Chemical tankers usually have transverse stiffeners on deck rather than inside the cargo tanks, in order to make the tank walls smooth and thus easier to clean using permanently <b>fitted</b> <b>tank</b> cleaning machines.|$|E

50|$|However, other strategists saw {{new roles}} for tanks in war, and wanted more {{specifically}} developed guns tailored to these missions. The ability to destroy enemy tanks was foremost on their minds. To this end, the emerging anti-tank gun designs were modified to <b>fit</b> <b>tanks.</b> These weapons fired smaller shells, but at higher velocities with higher accuracy, improving their performance against armor. Such light guns as the QF 2-pounder (40 mm) and 37 mm equipped British cruiser tanks and infantry tanks {{in the late}} 1930s. These weapons lacked a good high-explosive shell for attacking infantry and fortifications, but were effective against the light armor of the time.|$|R

25|$|The early 0-6-0 <b>tank</b> engines were <b>fitted</b> {{with either}} saddle tanks (wrapped over the boiler) or side tanks (mounted {{at the side}} of the boiler and {{reaching}} down to the running platform). GWR first <b>fitted</b> pannier <b>tanks</b> (mounted on the side of the boiler but not reaching down to the running platform) in 1898 to nine 4-4-0 tank locomotives and, in 1901, to five 0-6-0T locomotives which were also fitted with Belpaire fireboxes. The shape of the Belpaire firebox gives a larger surface area which improves heat transfer and steam production, but their rectangular shape made them difficult to combine with saddle <b>tanks.</b> Locomotives <b>fitted</b> with pannier <b>tanks</b> have a lower centre of gravity than those with saddle tanks (enabling higher speeds on curves), and access for maintenance is easier than for those <b>fitted</b> with side <b>tanks.</b>|$|R

50|$|Although {{the data}} did not {{consider}} which type of fuel <b>tanks</b> were <b>fitted,</b> the report mentioned four fatal accidents to the R44 <b>fitted</b> with bladder-type <b>tanks,</b> {{but as far as}} they knew, did not involve a post-accident fire. The ATSB recommended that the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) take further action to urge R44 owners to <b>fit</b> bladder-type <b>tanks.</b> The FAA, the governing body in the country of manufacture whose directives would normally be followed in other countries like Australia, had not mandated the retrofit; CASA therefore issued Australian-specific airworthiness directive AD/R44/23, grounding R44 aircraft on 30 April 2013 that had not yet been upgraded.|$|R

5000|$|... "Helitack" [...] {{is the use}} of {{helicopters}} to combat wildland fires. The helicopters are used for aerial firefighting (water bombing) and may be <b>fitted</b> with <b>tanks</b> or carry helibuckets. Helibuckets, such as the Bambi bucket, are usually filled by submerging the bucket into lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or portable <b>tanks.</b> <b>Tanks</b> <b>fitted</b> onto helicopters are filled from a hose while the helicopter is on the ground or water is siphoned from lakes or reservoirs through a hanging snorkel as the helicopter hovers over the water source. Helitack helicopters are also used to deliver firefighters, who rappel down to inaccessible areas, and to resupply firefighters. Common firefighting helicopters include variants of the Bell 205 and the Erickson S-64 Aircrane helitanker.|$|R
