It is a device used to connect the driving shaft to a driven shaft, so that the driven shaft may be started or stopped at will, without stopping the driving shaft. A clutch thus provides an interruptible connection between two rotating shafts Clutches allow a high inertia load to be stated with a small power. The engine power transmitted to the system through the clutch. The failure of such a critical component during service can stall the whole application.

The Dry-type Dual Clutch {{system is}} {{designed}} for a certain Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT), and transient analysis is performed to investigate the thermal influence on <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> in sophisticated slip conditions, which is determined by control strategy of DCT.

Finally, the temperature and thermal stress distributions on the frictional surfaces are acquired, which shows that the previously designed clutch system agrees with thermo requirements. This new approach which is more superior to the traditional clutch analysis, can adjust to different control strategies, thus it can be applied to facilitate the thermo analysis and practical design of DCT system...|$|E

We reconstruct the plate tessellation history and demonstrate that {{both large and}} small plates display two distinct hierarchical patterns, described by different power-law size-relationships.

The organization of large plates rapidly changes from a weak hierarchy at 120 - 100 million years ago (Ma) towards a strong hierarchy, which peaked at 65 - 50, Ma subsequently relaxing back towards a minimum hierarchical structure.

With {{the help}} of the {{orthogonal}} experiment and the friction-wear mechanism by car as the research object of the clutch driven platen friction plate of Chongqing Changan CX 20 auto power take-off installation, the optimization of clutch friction materials is studied.

40|$|In the {{high-frequency}} range, {{there have}} been advances {{in the use of}} non-parametric uncertainty models to predict the vibration response of uncertain structures. In particular, the Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) approach has been combined with the Random Point Process Theory (RPPT) to yield the non-parametric ensemble variance of the subsystem energies without requiring Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) to be performed to propagate the uncertainty. The assumptions behind the RPPT are that the generalised forces acting on a single subsystem and the mode shapes (computed at the points where the forces are applied) are statistically independent and identically distributed. These assumptions are valid for a large variety of cases; however, it has been found that correlation effects can {{have a significant effect on}} the response variance in some cases, particularly when the modal overlap is high. In this paper, the correlation effects are quantified for the case of a system driven by multiple random point loads. It is then shown how these correlation effects can be accounted for in response predictions: closed form analytical solutions are derived for the case of a single random point load, and an efficient numerical method is derived for multiple point loads. The approach is illustrated by application to a randomly <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> system. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{improvements}} and modifications of the imaging techniques have identified and provided measurements of Raleigh-Taylor (R-T) instabilities {{that occur in}} these events. The microscope system in the LLNL Micro Detonics Facility, was converted to an epi-illuminated polarization configuration. A double pulse nanosecond illuminator and a second independently focusable frame camera were also added to the system. A laser <b>driven</b> <b>plate,</b> that is a dense solid driven by a laser heated, lower density plasma, is inherently R-T unstable. The plates are aluminum, deposited {{on the ends of}} optical fibers. They are launched by a YAG Laser pulse traveling down the fiber. Plate velocities are several kilometers per second and characteristic dimensions of the instabilities are a few to tens of microns. Several techniques were used to examine the plates, the most successful being specularly reflecting polarization microscopy looking directly at the plate as it flies toward the camera. These images gave data on the spatial frequencies of the instabilities but could not give the amplitudes. To measure the amplitude of the instability a semi- transparent witness plate was placed a known distance from the plate. As above, the plate was observed using the polarization microscope but using the streak camera as the detector. Both the launch of the plate and its impact into the witness plate are observed on the streak record. Knowing the plate velocity function from earlier velocimetry measurements and observing the variations in the arrival time across the plate, the amplitude of the instability can be calculated...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the short pulse {{durations}} (0. 1 - 10 ns) in laser shock compression ensure a rapid decay of the pulse and quenching of the shocked sample in times that are orders of magnitude lower than in conventional explosively <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> impact experiments. Thus, laser compression, by virtue of a much more rapid cooling, enables the retention of a deformation structure closer to the one existing during shock. The smaller pulse length also decreases the propensity for localization. Copper and copper aluminum (2 and 6 wt% Al) with orientations [001] and [{bar 1 } 34] were subjected to high intensity laser pulses with energy levels of 70 to 300 J delivered in an initial pulse duration of approximately 3 ns.

The developed system is assumed to be resonant, conservative, linear and there is an equipartition of energy between all the resonant modes within a given frequency band in a given sub-system. The aim of this work is to find the energy stored in the sub-systems for two coupled (welded) plates in rectangular angle systems and study the effect of changing sub-systems dimensions, the results shows that as surface area of directly driven plates A 1 increases energy level of plate 1 increases while a reduction in the energy level of indirectly <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> (plate 2) is noticed. This is because of the strength of coupling decreases towards the weak coupling condition and this leads to a reduction in the power transferred from plate 1 to plate 2 and consequently a lower energy level for plate 2. In addition the effect of changing the internal loss factor for a range of (0. 00001 - 0. 1) causes a reduction of the values of energy level in these sub-systems. because the increasing of internal loss factor values led to the increasing of the material resistance and that will dissipate the energy flow across those sub-systems.
