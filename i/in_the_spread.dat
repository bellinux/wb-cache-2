5|$|The {{species has}} been implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of weeds by {{consuming}} and dispersing fruit and seed. In {{the first half}} of the twentieth century, pied currawongs were shot as they were considered pests of corn and strawberry crops, as well as assisting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of the prickly pear. They were also shot on Lord Howe Island for attacking chickens. However, they are seen as beneficial in forestry as they consume phasmids, and also in agriculture for eating cocoons of the codling moth.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{interactions}} {{between humans and}} cattle egrets are beneficial. The cattle egret can be a safety hazard to aircraft due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of airports, {{and it has been}} implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of animal infections such as heartwater, infectious bursal disease and possibly Newcastle disease.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} and quantifies {{the importance}} of sovereign risk in determining corporate yield spreads in emerging economies. It also investigates {{the extent to which}} the practice by rating agencies and banks of not rating companies higher than their sovereign (“country or sovereign ceiling”) is reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreads</b> of South African local-currency-denominated corporate bonds. The main findings are: (i) sovereign risk appears to be the single most important determinant of corporate spreads in South Africa; (ii) the sovereign ceiling does not apply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreads</b> of <b>the</b> industrial multinational companies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sample; and (iii) consistent with rating agency practice, the sovereign ceiling appears to apply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreads</b> of most financial companies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sample...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} {{structure of}} the upper mantle beneath the East Pacific Rise (EPR) at 15 ° 45 ′S is imaged by inverting seafloor magnetotelluric data obtained during the Mantle ELectromagnetic and Tomography (MELT) experiment. The electrical conductivity model shows no evidence for a conductive region immediately beneath <b>the</b> ridge, <b>in</b> contrast to <b>the</b> model previously obtained beneath the EPR at 17 °S. This observation {{can be explained by}} differences in current melt production along the ridge, consistent with other observations. The mantle to the east of the ridge at 60 – 100 km depth is anisotropic, with higher conductivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> direction compared to the along-strike direction, similar to the 17 °S region. <b>The</b> high conductivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> direction can be explained by a hydrated mantle with strain-induced lattice preferred orientation of olivine or by partial melt preferentially connected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> direction...|$|R

5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be {{on the edge of the}} platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of contagious diseases.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the site}} of a 10th-century wooden church, the cathedral was built in the 12th and 13th centuries when the Romanesque style was {{influenced}} by Gothic trends from northern France. It was the first Gothic cathedral in Scandinavia to be built of brick, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of this style throughout northern Europe. With its 39 royal tombs, the cathedral is to this day the burial site for Danish monarchs. Since 1995, it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, encouraging some 100,000 tourists to visit it each year. The cathedral houses a museum on its upper floor, tracing the building's history. A working church, it also hosts concerts throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|The Moravian {{cultural}} influence {{played a}} significant role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of that religion. In the opinion of Davies, the Christianisation of Poland through the Czech–Polish alliance represented a conscious choice on the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one. In a similar fashion, some of the later political struggles involved the Polish Church refusing to subordinate itself to the German hierarchy and instead being directly subordinate to the Vatican.|$|E

5|$|The {{adult cattle}} egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks {{may be lost}} to starvation, calcium {{deficiency}} or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming {{is believed to be}} a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of tick-borne animal diseases.|$|E
5|$|The first written {{records of}} native life {{begin in the}} 6th century AD, when the {{founding}} of the kingdom of Dál Riata took place. This encompassed roughly what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland and County Antrim in Ireland. The figure of Columba looms large in any history of Dál Riata, and his founding of a monastery on Iona ensured that the kingdom would be of great importance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of Christianity in northern Britain. However, Iona was far from unique. Lismore in the territory of the Cenél Loairn, was sufficiently important for the death of its abbots to be recorded with some frequency and many smaller sites, such as on Eigg, Hinba, and Tiree, are known from the annals.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} radiation levels pose {{a higher}} risk of crews developing cancer, and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, lowered immunity results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.|$|E

5|$|London's dead had {{traditionally}} been buried {{in and around}} local churches, and with {{a limited amount of}} space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. In {{the first half of the}} 19thcentury the population of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300acres (0.5sqmi; 1.2km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Graveyards became very congested. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory (the belief that airborne particles were the primary factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of contagious disease), and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite National Park has {{documented}} more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following {{the migration of}} early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause {{an increase in the}} fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.|$|E

40|$|Non-muscle cells express {{multiple}} myosin-II motor proteins myosin IIA, myosin IIB and myosin IIC transcribed {{from different}} loci <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human genome. Due {{to a significant}} homology in their sequences, these ubiquitously expressed myosin II motor proteins {{are believed to have}} overlapping cellular functions, but the mechanistic details are not elucidated. The present study uncovered a mechanism that coordinates the distinctly localized myosin IIA and myosin IIB with unexpected opposite mechanical roles in maneuvering lamellipodia extension, a critical step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initiation of cell invasion, spreading, and migration. Myosin IIB motor protein by localizing at the front drives lamellipodia extension during cell <b>spreading.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, myosin IIA localizes next to myosin IIB and attenuates or retracts lamellipodia extension. Myosin IIA and IIB increase cell adhesion by regulating focal contacts formation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> margins and central part of <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> cell, respectively. Spreading cells expressing both myosin IIA and myosin IIB motor proteins display an organized actin network consisting of retrograde filaments, arcs and central filaments attached to focal contacts. This organized actin network especially arcs and focal contacts formation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> margins were lost in myosin IIA cells. Surprisingly, myosin IIB cells displayed long parallel actin filaments connected to focal contacts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> margins. Thus, with different roles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regulation of the actin network and focal contacts formation, both myosin IIA and IIB determine the fate of lamellipodia extension during cell spreading...|$|R
