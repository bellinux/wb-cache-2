40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} the incorporation of a new additive to asphalt cement oil (CAP). A polyol product was obtained through the oxypropylation reaction of sugarcane bagasse. This polyol was polymerised with pyromellitic anhydride in order to obtain a polyester (BCP) to test its suitability in terms of the material properties to be applied as additives. FTIR spectra of the <b>polymerised</b> <b>material</b> (BCP) confirmed the occurrence of chemical modification due to the appearance of a new band at 1750 cm- 1, characteristic of ester groups. The TGA data showed that the BCP product had higher thermal stability than the polyol. According to the softening point and elastic recovery tests, the incorporation of 11 % and 16 % w/w BCP in conventional CAP met the specifications of regulatory standards...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} self healing {{mechanisms}} for composite materials {{have been presented}} in the previous chapters of this book. These methods vary from the classical concept of micro-encapsulating of healing agents in polymer systems to the autonomous healing of concrete. The key feature of these self healing mechanisms is the transport of material to the damaged zone {{in order to establish}} the healing process. Generally, this material is a fluid and its motion is driven by capillary action which enables transportation over relatively large distances requiring little or no work. In the microencapsulated polymers as developed by White et al. [1], this liquid material is a healing agent, which is enclosed in the material by micro-encapsulation. When the capsule is ruptured by a crack, the healing agent will flow into the crack, driven by capillary action. Polymerisation of this healing agent is triggered by contact with catalysts which are inserted in the material and whose position is fixed. The new <b>polymerised</b> <b>material</b> will rebond the crack surfaces...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the major pigments in red wines are discussed {{and the results of}} an experiment to stabilise the peak of colour extraction which occurs during fermentation are presented. It was found that the peak which occurs early during the fermentation is due to the formation of anthocyanin aggregates and that this could be stabilised by the addition of a solution of commercial grape tannin. This resulted in aged wines which were pressed at 43 hours after innoculation having similar colour densities to those wines fermented to dryness {{in the presence of the}} grape skins. Treated wines showed increases in the amount of polymerised anthocyanin present at fifteen months despite an increase in the amount of <b>polymerised</b> colouring <b>material</b> deposited during this time...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{derivatives}} of naphtho[1, 2 -b]pyran and the [2, 1 -b] and [2, 3 -b] isomers has been prepared. Those compounds with aryl substituents {{adjacent to the}} hetematom have been obtained by an acid catalysed reaction of a naphthol with a 1, 1 - diarylprop- 2 yn-l-ol and thermal cyclisation of the intermediate ether. Alkyl and spiro-cycloalkyl derivatives have been synthesized by {{the reduction of the}} related naphthopyranones and dehydration of the resulting pyranols. The latter reaction was accompanied by dimerised and <b>polymerised</b> <b>material</b> in the [1, 2 -b] and [2, 3 -b] series. Some reactions of the pyran double bond have been studied in order to assess the influence of the position of fusion of the naphthalene unit on to the pyran ring. Based on the reaction with hypobromous acid and on direct epoxidation of the double bond, the naphthopyrans are more reactive than the corresponding benzopyrans. Particular reactivity was exhibited by the [1, 2 -b] and [2, 3 -b] systems, which were also prone to electrophilic attack in the naphthalene moiety. Ring opening reactions of the epoxynaphthopyrans have been investigated and found to be attractive precursors for benzo-fused derivatives of chroman- 3 -ones and chroman- 3, 4 -diones. The 9 -hydroxy derivatives of the naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyrans have been etherified with o-halogenoalcohols and these compounds together with their 9 -hydroxy precursors have been esterified with methacryloyl chloride. A range of novel polymers has been prepared by the free radical solution polymerisation of these methacrylate esters. The resulting naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyran based polymers varied in the substitution at C- 3 and in the length of the group separating the naphthopyran unit from the polymer backbone. Macromolecular weight and its distribution have been measured for all of the polymers by gel permeation chromatography. Increase in the length of the spacer group led to a higher molecular weight and to a narrower distribution for the polymer. Conversely, increasing the size of the substituents at C- 3 resulted in a decrease in molecular weight. The photochromic properties of the monomers and polymers have been investigated. Alkyl and spiro-cycloalkane substituted naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyrans showed no photochromism at 0 °C, but their derived polymers become pale yellow on irradiation. Diaryl derivatives exhibited red to brown photochromism both as monomers and polymers. Polymerisation resulted in a decreased rate of fading which is influenced by the length of the spacer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Conductive ink {{has been}} widely used in many {{application}} of electronic parts. It normally comes in liquid form and {{will need to be}} cured usually by conventional oven or laser irradiation after drawn to expose its metallic contents. But, these curing processes suffer from numerous problems which is costly process and warping defect when cured using conventional oven. Thus, alternative process is prominent and DLP projector has been seen capable of <b>polymerised</b> photopolymer <b>materials.</b> By making use of its potential associated with a proper control of the light intensity, exposure time and distance, it could provides sufficent heat to cure conductive ink. This study investigates the curing process of silver conductive ink on polymer substrate using DLP projector light with a variation of curing time and distance. Electrical resistance, hardness and adhesion level of cured sample were measured to determine its functionality. The conductive ink is deposited on the substrate using doctor blade method and Microsoft Power Point slide is used to shape the light image produced by the projector. It was found that the conductivity and curing level of the sample cured were higher at the distance which getting the sharpest light image. The performances of the samples were also greater as the curing time increased. DLP projector is able to cure the conductive track efficiently with shorter curing time apart from the cheap preparation and setup cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} metal {{residues}} from organometallic reagents used in preparation of poly(9, 9 -dioctylfluorene) by palladium catalysed Suzuki and nickel-induced Yamamoto polycondensations have been determined, and their effect upon the behaviour of the polymer in field-effect transistors (FETs) has been measured. The metal levels from <b>material</b> <b>polymerised</b> by Suzuki method {{were found to}} be much higher than from that made by the Yamamoto procedure. Simple treatment of the polymers with suitable metal trapping reagents lowered the metal levels significantly, with EDTA giving best results for nickel and triphenylphosphine for palladium. Comparison of the behaviour of FETs using polyfluorenes with varying levels of metal contamination, showed that the metal residues have little effect upon the mobility values, but often affect the degree of hysteresis, possibly acting as charge traps. Satisfactory device performances were obtained from polymer with palladium levels of 2000 μg/g suggesting that complete removal of metal residues may not be necessary for satisfactory device performance...|$|R
40|$|The free-radical {{polymerisation}} {{reactions of}} photoactive resins used in dentistry are inhibited by oxygen. There {{is a need}} to better understand the effects oxygen inhibition on critical properties of dental resins and resin composites which may compromise the success of dental resin composite restorations. This investigation aims to examine the formation of the oxygen inhibition layer (OIL) on experimental and commercial methacrylate and epoxy resin based materials and its effect on incremental bond strengths and stain resistance. Experimental BisGMA and TEGDMA comonomer resin mixtures loaded with either barium- or strontium-silicate glass fillers were fabricated. Commercially available dental resin composite restorative materials, including a novel epoxy-based system were also examined. The OIL of each material type was measured using a novel optical depth of focus technique, the integrity of resin composite layers and stain resistance was assessed by shear bond strength and colorimeter testing, respectively. An OIL was measurable for all <b>materials</b> <b>polymerised</b> in atmospheric air including the epoxy-based system Filtek™ Silorane. Different filler particle types complicate OIL formation for similar BisGMA/TEGDMA comonomer mixtures. The OIL had a detrimental effect on stain resistance, where an increased OIL thickness resulted in increased stain susceptibility. From the present findings it was suggested that incremental bond strength between composite layers is not wholly reliant on surface inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) {{techniques are}} especially useful for producing prototypes, single-pieces or small series of products, because AM {{allows for a}} fast transfer from CAD model to physical product. Nevertheless, current AM technologies are mostly constrained to producing mechanical parts, with no extra functionalities. A next frontier is producing multifunctional AM products (electro-mechanical, electro-thermal…) by combining different AM techniques and their specific advantages. Stereolithography (SLA), for instance, is a well-established additive manufacturing process able to produce solid models and objectives by selectively photo-solidifying thin layers of UV curable materials, {{one on top of}} the other. On the other hand, Aerosol Jet® printing (AJP) shows its competitive advantage in printing interconnection, passive- and active components and antennas on glass or flexible substrates, as polyimide foil. By depositing AJP micro conductive traces in between SLA layers, electrical properties to SLA parts can therefore be added, and high functional, fully integrated devices could be realised in the next future. The low surface roughness of SLA layers will also assure repeatable surface conditions, making easier to print tracks in a repeatable manner. In the present work, this concept is further studied, and the feasible combination of stereolithography with aerosol jet® printing is investigated in detail. The conductive traces are created by depositing commercial silver ink using the AJP process. Experiments are conducted on a M 3 D Optomec AJP machine, and the deposition is made on partially polymerized UV – curable Somos SLA acrylics. Partial polymerization of the SLA substrate is specifically selected to exploit the higher surface energy of the resulted layer, thus allowing better wettability when liquids are deposited onto the surface. The degree of polymerization can be adjusted by tuning the exposure time or laser intensity, during the SLA process, and it represents a critical parameter. In the presented experiments curing time of the SLA material under the same lighting conditions is adjusted to find the optimal wetting properties. Insufficient curing, in fact, would cause deformation of the surface when the silver ink is deposited onto the surface. The large set of AJP process parameters (gas flows, temperature setting, printing speed, etc.), with effect on the material output rate, ink- and aerosol properties, were also considered during investigation. According to the first data obtained, the temperature of the aerosol before it enters the printing head seems the most important AJP parameter in this research. By increasing the aerosol temperature, more solvent evaporates before the ink is deposited onto the substrate. This allows for dryer printing of the ink and it decreases the surface tension of the deposited droplets, which will allow the printing of continuous lines with less interruptions. On the other hand, when temperature is set too high, the ink dries too fast also causing interruption of the printed track. Finding an optimum between curing rate and AJP settings is therefore crucial in stable deposition of silver ink onto partially <b>polymerised</b> UV <b>material.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Total joint {{replacement}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} successful surgical procedures and is a proven treatment for arthritis. Despite low failure rates, the wide application of the treatment means that large numbers of prostheses fail and must be revised. Improved pre-clinical testing methods for these orthopaedic devices may assist in developing new prostheses with improved clinical results. Computational modelling of biological systems is becoming increasingly accurate and is a much quicker and cheaper alternative to physical testing, but continued development is necessary to ensure computational models produce accurate and reliable predictions of implant behaviour. Acrylic bone cements have been used as a method of fixation for over 50 years but despite improvements in cement handling techniques and numerous attempts to improve the mechanical properties of the cement in other ways, the cement is often highlighted as the weak link in the joint replacement system. Aseptic loosening is cited as the cause for the majority of revision operations and cement degradation has been shown to be a contributor to the loosening process. In-vivo, cement is subject to cyclic loads and these are the primary cause of cement damage. Residual stresses generated during the polymerisation of the cement are now thought to play a significant role in cement failure. This thesis examines the development of residual stresses as a result of thermal and chemical changes during polymerisation of the cement. Experimental techniques for characterising the evolution of materials properties during the polymerisation reaction are discussed. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure the reaction variables such as the activation energy of polymerisation. The development of an ultrasonic rheometry technique for monitoring the mechanical property evolution within a bone cement specimen is discussed. Computational models were generated to predict the reaction behaviour of the cement in terms of the heat produced and the evolution of the physical properties of the curing mass. Some advantages and disadvantages of candidate mathematical models have been evaluated and are discussed, along with applications in several implant fixation scenarios. The model compared well with experimental data and was used to predict thermal necrosis in the bone surrounding both a hip resurfacing implant and a knee replacement. Using the output reaction path produced by the thermal model a mechanical model was also produced simulating the shrinkage and mechanical property evolution exhibited by the <b>polymerising</b> cement. Two <b>material</b> models were compared with and without the effects of plasticity. Residual stress magnitudes were assessed in comparison with published values and showed better agreement when plasticity was included. Peak stresses were observed to occur during polymerisation. The location of the peak stresses were compared with experimental data on pre-load crack locations in the literature and showed good agreement.
