50|$|The huts {{soon became}} a shanty town, {{situated}} {{out of range of}} the Spanish land batteries at a spot near {{the southern end of the}} peninsula, between the Naval Hospital and the South Barracks on the road leading to <b>Europa</b> <b>Point</b> (now <b>Europa</b> Road). It was first jokingly dubbed New Jerusalem but the appallingly unhygienic conditions led to it being renamed Black Town. A British Army quartermaster named Major Hardy was put in charge of the encampment, and it was eventually called Hardy Town after him. The garrison were somewhat less complimentary and called it the Cowards' Retreat or the Female Camp.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a mobile application for the Android platform, which has a back-end system on the Google App Engine platform. The purpose of the application is to provide cyclists with a better review of their previous cycling trips and help them with selecting a new one. The basic functionality of the application is the ability to display the basic information about the cycling trip, such as the speed and travelled distance. Moreover, the application displays other interesting information for cyclists, who can search for cycling <b>info</b> <b>points</b> and cycling services located nearby. They can search for the treasures that have been marked by other users of the Geocaching web community. The first part of the thesis {{presents the}} technologies we used for the development of our application. The main part explains how we planned and implemented the application, discusses the appearance of the final product, and explores the options for further development of the application...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is the {{implementation}} of an interactive web application, an <b>info</b> <b>point,</b> which could run on a multitouch surface created at the ViCoS lab at Faculty of Computer and Information Science. The developed interactive web application InfoFRI point represents a virtual signpost for the faculty's rooms by drawing an interactive paths on the floor plan of the faculty building and the building of object X, starting at the faculty's lobby in the 1 st floor and continuing up to the specific room. Another web application {{was created in the}} scope of the thesis in order to ease the manipulation and editing of the InfoFRI point database. Both web applications were implemented in web technologies such as HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript (jQuery). In order to comply with the requirements of the multitouch surface for storing data in JSON and to introduce lightweight databases, a document-oriented database CouchDB was implemented. ...|$|R

5000|$|The opera {{takes place}} in Tyre in Phoenicia and tells a story of love, {{violence}} and political discord in ancient times. The central character, Europa, was once the lover of Zeus and helps resolve all disagreements after she discloses her identity - thus the title [...] "Europa Revealed". Though a traditional opera seria, the work differentiates itself from several of the typical characteristics of the genre. For example: a murder is seen onstage and an extended finale is used in both acts, a practice more typical of opera buffa. Musically, the opera is quite challenging, requiring four principal singers capable of spanning wide tessituras, sustaining long phrases, and making dextrous leaps. For example, the roles of Europa and Semele go up to a high F sharp above high C {{a few times and}} at one <b>point</b> <b>Europa</b> even sings a high G.|$|R
