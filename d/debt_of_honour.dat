25|$|Dare also {{appeared}} in a few films including The Argentine Tango and Other Dances (1913), Dr. Wake's Patient (1916), The Common Law (1923), Crime on the Hill (1933), <b>Debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>Honour</b> (1936), Marigold (1938) and Gildersleeve on Broadway (1943). A thoroughbred horse was named after Dare in 1920.|$|E
25|$|During {{her later}} career, {{she turned to}} {{straight}} plays, some of which included Aren't We All in 1929, Words and Music in 1932 and The Fugitives in 1936. She appeared occasionally in films, starring in The Argentine Tango and Other Dances in 1913, Dr. Wake's Patient in 1916, Crime on the Hill in 1933 and <b>Debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>Honour</b> in 1936. In the 1940s she appeared in a tour of Full House and was later cast in Other People's Houses. In 1949, Dare opened as Marta the mistress in Ivor Novello's musical, King's Rhapsody. The show ran {{for two years and}} was Dare's last theatrical endeavour. She retired to Brighton in 1951 and {{died at the age of}} 84.|$|E

[...] in the National Memorial Arboretum in England.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his return}} to England, Walker lived at Scott's Lodge, Knockholt, Kent. During the First World War, he was {{appointed}} as commandant of the internment camp for German and Austrian detainees at Alexandra Palace. According to Baxendale:he tempered his strict regard for discipline with his usual kindness, and the encouragement he gave to the prisoners to pursue their various trades won their respect and affection. [...] Walker suffered from a long-term complaint of the inner ear; {{he died of a}} heart attack on 16 May 1917, a few days after his 67th birthday. He is one of the oldest soldiers commemorated on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission <b>Debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>Honour</b> database. He was buried at St Katharine's Church, Knockholt.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Montalvo, with {{a sudden}} sternness, [...] "an officer and a gentleman cannot treat a <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> thus; but," [...] he added with a little laugh, [...] "if another gentleman chances to {{be good enough to}} charge a <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> for a <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour,</b> the affair is different. If, for instance, it would suit you to lend me four hundred florins, which, added to the six hundred which I have lost to-night, would make a {{thousand}} in all, well, it will be a convenience to me, though should it be any inconvenience to you, pray do not think of such a thing." ...|$|E

"Lost; lost," [...] said Musgrave, gaily--"my own silver candlesticks are all {{melted and}} riding on horseback by this time, and I wish the fellows that enlisted were half as trusty as these.--Here, sir," [...] he {{added to the}} Chief, [...] "is your money; it impairs Hall's {{finances}} and mine somewhat, but <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> must be settled." ...|$|R
50|$|Phryne's {{relationship}} with her family can occasionally be strained. In Cocaine Blues, after a theft of jewelry belonging to a guest {{at a dinner party}} hosted by the Fishers, Phryne's father and mother engage in a vocal altercation, a situation that Phryne describes as 'normal'. On her arrival in Melbourne, she is initially embarrassed to discover that her father had left a number <b>of</b> unpaid <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> there, including one to the local MP, Mr. Sanderson.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no use paying it," [...] said Mr. Walker, doggedly; [...] "it {{would only}} be robbing you, Mr. Woolsey--seven more detainers have come in while my wife has been away. I must go through the court now; but," [...] he added in a whisper to the tailor, [...] "my good sir, my <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>HONOUR</b> are sacred, and if you will have the {{goodness}} to lend ME the twenty pounds, I pledge you my word as a gentleman to return it when I come out of quod." ...|$|R

50|$|The widow {{can gain}} no {{advantage}} from any advancement. No child can {{be forced to}} account {{for his or her}} advancement, but in default thereof he will be excluded from a share in the intestate's estate. The usual judicial view was that any considerable sum of money paid to a child at that child's request is an advancement; thus payment <b>of</b> a son's <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> has been held to be an advancement. On the other hand, trivial gifts and presents to a child are undoubtedly not advancements.|$|R
60|$|A. It {{is hard to}} {{say what}} they would do. I can only judge what other people will think and how they will act by what I feel within myself. I have a great many debts due to me in America, and I had rather they should remain {{unrecoverable}} by any law, than submit to the stamp-act. They will be <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour.</b> It is my opinion, the people will either continue in that situation, or find some way to extricate themselves, perhaps by generally agreeing to proceed in the courts without stamps.|$|R
60|$|Practice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. <b>Debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour.</b> Reaping the whirlwind. Used to {{get good}} {{retainers}} from D. and T. Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work for the Express with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford began on the Independent. Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the same breath.

60|$|December 14.--Summoned to pay arrears of our unhappy Oil Gas concern--£140--which I {{performed}} by draft on Mr. Cadell. This will pinch a little close, {{but it is}} a <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour,</b> and must be paid. The public will never bear a public man who shuns either to draw his purse or his sword when there is an open and honest demand on him.|$|E
60|$|From drinking, the pleased Muse now {{turns to}} {{gambling}}, of which {{in his youth}} our prince was a great practitioner. He was a famous pigeon for the play-men; they lived upon him. Egalité Orleans, it was believed, punished him severely. A noble lord, whom we shall call the Marquis of Steyne, {{is said to have}} mulcted him in immense sums. He frequented the clubs, where play was then almost universal; and, as it was known his <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> were sacred, whilst he was gambling Jews waited outside to purchase his notes of hand. His transactions on the turf were unlucky as well as discreditable: though I believe he, and his jockey, and his horse Escape, were all innocent in that affair which created so much scandal.|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR SIR,--I {{have just}} {{time to write}} the foregoing,[50] and {{to tell you that}} it was (at least most part of it) the {{effusion}} of an half-hour I spent at Bruar. I do not mean it was extempore, for I have endeavoured to brush it up as well as Mr. Nicol's chat, and the jogging of the chaise, would allow. It eases my heart a good deal, as rhyme is the coin with which a poet pays his <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> or gratitude. What I owe to the noble family of Athole, of the first kind, I shall ever proudly boast; what I owe of the last, so help me God in my hour of need! I shall never forget.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not like}} to say it before her," [...] he said {{afterwards}} in their own room;--and now Cecilia was able to observe that his manner was altogether altered,--"but to tell the truth that man behaved very badly to me myself. I know nothing about racing, but my cousin, poor Jack Western, did. When he died, there was some money due to him by Sir Francis, and I, as his executor, applied for it. Sir Francis answered that debts won by dead men were not payable. But Jack had been alive when he won this, and it should have been paid before. I know nothing about <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> as they are called, but I found out that the money should have been paid." ...|$|R
60|$|Viewed in quieter days, the patient, trustful {{attitude}} of this colony of Natal will impress the historian. The devotion {{of its people}} to their Sovereign and to their motherland should endear them to all good Englishmen, and win them general respect and sympathy; and full indemnity to all individual colonists who have suffered loss must stand as an Imperial <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{they must}} keep {{score of the}} amount and {{discharge}} it when they are able. Look you, young man, everything else you may forget, but what you lose over the dice is a <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour.</b> There lives no man who can say that I cheated him of a guilder at cards, though I fear some others have my name standing in their books." ...|$|E
60|$|I want a Shakespeare; I want {{likewise}} an English dictionary,--Johnson's, I suppose, is best. In {{these and}} all my prose commissions, the cheapest is always the best for me. There is a small <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> that I owe Mr. Robert Cleghorn, in Saughton Mills, my worthy friend, and your well-wisher. Please give him, and urge him to take it, {{the first time you}} see him, ten shillings worth of anything you have to sell, and place it to my account.|$|E
60|$|That young nobleman was, as Mr. Brock hinted in {{the little}} autobiographical sketch which we gave in a former chapter, incarcerated for a certain period, and for certain other debts, in the donjons of Shrewsbury; but he {{released}} himself from them by that noble and consolatory method of whitewashing which the law has provided for gentlemen in his oppressed condition; and {{he had not been}} a week in London, when he fell in with, and overcame, or put to flight, Captain Wood, alias Brock, and immediately seized upon the remainder of his property. After receiving this, the Count, with commendable discretion, disappeared from England altogether for a while; nor are we at all authorised to state that any <b>of</b> his <b>debts</b> to his tradesmen were discharged, any more than his <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour,</b> as they are pleasantly called.|$|R
60|$|There {{were none}} of those {{thousand}} sources of irritation that the ingenuity of civilized man has created to mar his own felicity. There were no foreclosures of mortgages, no protested notes, no bills payable, no <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour,</b> in Typee; no unreasonable tailors and shoemakers, perversely bent on being paid; no duns of any description; no assault and battery attorneys, to foment discord, backing their clients up to a quarrel, and then knocking their heads together; no poor relations everlastingly occupying the spare bed-chamber, and diminishing the elbow-room at the family table; no destitute widows with their children starving on the cold charities of the world; no beggars; no debtor’s prisons; no proud and hard-hearted nabobs in Typee; or, to sum up all in one word—no Money! That “root of all evil” {{was not to be}} found in the valley.|$|R
60|$|Madam,--Of {{the many}} {{problems}} {{in the nature of}} that wonderful creature, man, {{this is one of the}} most extraordinary--that he shall go on from day to day, from week to week, from month to month, or perhaps from year to year, suffering a hundred times more in an hour from the impotent consciousness of neglecting what he ought to do, than the very doing of it would cost him. I am deeply indebted to you, first, for a most elegant poetic compliment; then for a polite, obliging letter; and, lastly, for your excellent poem on the Slave Trade; and yet, wretch that I am! though the <b>debts</b> were <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour,</b> and the creditor a lady, I have put off and put off even the very acknowledgment of the obligation, until you must indeed be the very angel I take you for, if you can forgive me.|$|R
60|$|Charley had {{not been}} so {{resolute}} with the usurer, so determined to get £5 from him on this special day, without a special object in view. His credit was at stake in a more than ordinary manner; he had about a week since borrowed money from the woman who kept the public-house in Norfolk Street, and having borrowed it for a week only, felt that this was a <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> which it was incumbent on him to pay. Therefore, when he had walked the length of one street on his road towards his lodgings, he retraced his steps and made his way back to his old haunts.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{appears that}} all his friends, {{conspicuous}} among whom was Mr. Walter Hatherell, tried their very best to dissuade him from pitting his luck against that of Cohen, {{who had been}} having a most unprecedented run of good fortune. But young Ashley, heated with wine, exasperated at his own bad luck, would listen to no one; he tossed one £5 note after another on the board, he borrowed from those who would lend, then played on parole for a while. Finally, at half-past one in the morning, after a run of nineteen on the red, the young man found himself without a penny in his pockets, and owing a debt--gambling debt--a <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> of £1500 to Mr. Aaron Cohen.|$|E
60|$|My ethical {{disposition}} is all against punctilio and I set {{no greater}} value on unblemished honour than I do on purity. I never yet {{met a man}} who talked proudly of his honour who did not end by cheating or trying to cheat me, nor a code of honour that did not impress me as a conspiracy against the common welfare and purpose in life. There is honour among thieves, and I think it might well end there as an obligation in conduct. The soldier who risks a life he owes to his army in a duel upon some silly matter of personal pride is no better to me than the clerk who gambles with the money in his master's till. When I was a boy I once paid a <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour,</b> {{and it is one}} of the things I am most ashamed of. I had played cards into debt and I still remember burningly how I went flushed and shrill-voiced to my mother and got the money she could so ill afford to give me. I would not pay such a <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> now. If I were to wake up one morning owing big sums that I had staked overnight I would set to work at once by every means in my power to evade and repudiate that obligation. Such money as I have I owe under our present system to wife and sons and my work and the world, and I see no valid reason why I should hand it over to Smith because he and I have played the fool and rascal and gambled. Better by far to accept that fact and be for my own part published fool and rascal.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{naturally}} {{my intention}} {{that he should}} succeed me in my business, {{but he was not}} of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour.</b> He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.|$|R
60|$|He got out, with a poor {{attempt at}} a swagger, without his {{customary}} protestations of duty and humble offers of service. And I thanked Heaven he had not made a scene, which in my state of mind I could not have borne, but must have laid hands upon him. Perhaps he believed Grafton not yet secure in his title. I did not wonder then, {{in the heat of}} my youth, that he should have accepted my honour as security. But since I have marvelled not a little at this. The fine gentlemen at Brooks's with whom I had been associating were none too scrupulous, and regarded money-lenders as legitimate prey. <b>Debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> they paid but tardily, if at all. A certain nobleman had been owing my Lord Carlisle thirteen thousand pounds for a couple of years, that his Lordship had won at hazard. And tho' I blush to write it, Mr. Fox himself was notorious in such matters, and was in <b>debt</b> to each <b>of</b> the coterie of fashionables of which he was the devoted chief.|$|R
5000|$|Lydia, at fifteen, Georgiana's {{age when}} he tried to take her away, falls madly in love while they are in Brighton, to the point of agreeing to {{accompany}} him when he flees the regiment for not paying his <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour.</b> She refuses to leave him, insensitive to the collateral damage the scandal will cause to her family, but he only marries her in desperation, negotiating the terms with Darcy who uses his connections and his fortune to procure Wickham a position, and save Lydia's respectability, allying himself with Mr Gardiner for the occasion. The reactions of the Bennet family are mixed: Mrs Bennet, relieved to see a first daughter duly married, and delighted that it is her favourite daughter, welcomes the young couple with affection after the wedding, sorry to see them go to rejoin the Garrison at Newcastle. Jane blushed in confusion and Mr Bennet ironically claims to be [...] "enormously proud" [...] of a son-in-law so shameless and cynical: [...] "He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all." ...|$|R
