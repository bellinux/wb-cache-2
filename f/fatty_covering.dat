5000|$|Leukodystrophy {{is one of}} a {{group of}} {{disorders}} characterized by degeneration of the white matter in the brain. The word leukodystrophy comes from the Greek roots leuko, [...] "white", dys, [...] "lack of", and troph, [...] "growth". The leukodystrophies are caused by imperfect growth or development of the myelin sheath, the <b>fatty</b> <b>covering</b> that acts as an insulator around nerve fibers.|$|E
50|$|Canavan {{disease is}} caused by a {{defective}} ASPA gene which is responsible for the production of the enzyme aspartoacylase. Decreased aspartoacylase activity prevents the normal breakdown of N-acetyl aspartate, wherein the accumulation of N-acetylaspartate, or lack of its further metabolism interferes with growth of the myelin sheath of the nerve fibers of the brain. The myelin sheath is the <b>fatty</b> <b>covering</b> that surrounds nerve cells and acts as an insulator, allowing for efficient transmission of nerve impulses.|$|E
5000|$|Metachromatic {{leukodystrophy}} [...] (MLD, {{also called}} arylsulfatase A deficiency) is a lysosomal storage disease which is commonly {{listed in the}} family of leukodystrophies as well as among the sphingolipidoses as it affects the metabolism of sphingolipids. Leukodystrophies affect the growth and/or development of myelin, the <b>fatty</b> <b>covering</b> which acts as an insulator around nerve fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. MLD involves cerebroside sulfate accumulation. Metachromatic leukodystrophy, like most enzyme deficiencies, has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.|$|E
50|$|The key {{function}} of Schwann cells is the myelination, or simply the insulation of axons. This <b>fatty</b> <b>covering</b> {{aids in the}} conduction of neuronal signals, allowing for efficient transmission. These cells also aid in the elimination of cellular debris, regeneration and upkeep of axons. Additionally, Schwann cells are actively involved in creating an inflammation reaction {{as a response to}} an injury of the PNS. Because injuries can lead to damaged axons, Schwann cells aid in fixing axonal damage and promoting new growth. Due to their healing properties, these cells can be used in spinal cord injuries to encourage regeneration of damaged axons. Finally, these multipurpose cells are key in the formation of protective outer barrier, or the perineurial sheath, that creates a vital separation for peripheral nerves.|$|E
5000|$|MLD is {{directly}} {{caused by a}} deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and is characterized by enzyme activity in leukocytes that is less than 10% of normal controls. [...] However, assay of the ARSA enzyme activity alone is not sufficient for diagnosis; ARSA pseudodeficiency, which is characterized by enzyme activity that is 5~20% of normal controls does not cause MLD. [...] Without this enzyme, sulfatides build up in many tissues of the body, eventually destroying the myelin sheath of the nervous system. The myelin sheath is a <b>fatty</b> <b>covering</b> that protects nerve fibers. Without it, the nerves in the brain (central nervous system - CNS) and the peripheral nerves (peripheral nervous system - PNS) which control, among other things the muscles related to mobility, cease to function properly.|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{bottom line}} Lorenzo's oil has no value in {{patients}} with established symp-toms. It may be of value of asumptomatic patients, and may delay onset of symptoms, but the extent of any effect is un-clear. The {{problem is that the}} fatty acids in Lorenzo's oil do not replace the very long chgain fatty acids in the brain be-cause they do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Background Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare (incidence about 1 in 45, 000), genetic disorder characterized by the breakdown or loss of the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells in the brain and progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland. ALD is {{one of a group of}} genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath, the <b>fatty</b> <b>covering</b> — which acts as an insulator — on nerve fibers in the brain. There are several forms of ALD. Onset of the classic child-hood form, which is the most severe and affects only boys, may occur between ages 4 and 10. Features of this form may include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, dysarthria (poorly articulated speech), dysphagia (difficulty swallow-ing), deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fa-tigue, intermittent vomiting, melanoderma (increased skin pigmentation), and progressive dementia. The most com-mon symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as ab-normal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. In the milder adult-onset form (also called adrenomyeloneuropathy, or AMN), which typically begins between ages 21 and 35, symptoms may include leg stiff-ness, progressive spastic paraparesis (stiffness, weakness and/or paralysis) of the lower extremities, and ataxia. Al-though adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function. Another form of ALD is occasionally seen in women who are carriers of the disorder. Symptoms are mild and may include spastic paraparesis of the lower limbs, ataxia, hyper-tonia (excessive muscle tone), mild peripheral neuropathy, and urinary problems. Neonatal ALD affects both male an...|$|E
