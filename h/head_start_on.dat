After graduating he became involved in politics, working {{as an assistant to}} the mayor of Springfield. He {{served as president of the}} Springfield City Council from 1979 to 1983 while teaching high school history courses and lecturing at local colleges. He served as mayor of Springfield from 1983 to 1989, overseeing a period of economic growth. With his political influence and a <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> contributions, he was nearly uncontested when he ran for election to the House of Representatives in 1988.|$|E
5|$|In {{individual}} Olympic competition, Heath won {{a silver}} medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross's world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the outcome was controversial, however, because of a premature starter gun and a quick start by Gaines, the winner. Gaines' coach, Richard Quick, knew of starter Frank Silvestri's propensity to fire the starter gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about a meter's <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> the competition; video of the event later confirmed that {{one or more of}} the swimmers had not been set when the starter gun fired.|$|E
5|$|Between Kimberley and Mafeking, Maund {{learned from}} Shippard that Grobler {{had been killed}} by a group of Ngwato warriors while {{returning}} to the Transvaal, and that the Boers were threatening to attack the British-protected Ngwato chief, Khama III, in response. Maund volunteered to help defend Khama, writing a letter to his employers explaining that doing so might lay the foundations for a concession from Khama covering territory that the Matabele and Ngwato disputed. Cawston tersely wrote back with orders to make for Bulawayo without delay, but over a month had passed in the time this written exchange required, and Maund had squandered his <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> Rudd. After ignoring a notice Lobengula had posted at Tati, barring entry to white big-game hunters and concession-seekers, the Rudd party arrived at the king's kraal on 21 September 1888, three weeks ahead of Maund.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{engagement}} at Wisconsin Heights, the militia {{decided to wait}} until the following day to pursue Black Hawk. They heard, but did not understand, Neapope's speech during the night, and to their surprise, when morning arrived their enemy had disappeared. The battle, though militarily devastating for the British Band, had allowed much of the group to escape to temporary safety across the Wisconsin River. The reprieve was short-lived for many – a group of Fox women and children who attempted to escape down the Wisconsin following the battle were captured by U.S.-allied tribes or shot by soldiers further downstream. During the night, while the non-combatants escaped in canoes, Black Hawk and the remaining warriors crossed the river near present-day Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin. The band fled west over rugged terrain toward the banks of the Mississippi River, with a week's <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> the militia.|$|E

25|$|Much of the Army of Northern Virginia, local defense {{troops and}} a {{battalion}} of sailors as well as Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet, were able to escape from Petersburg and Richmond just {{in advance of the}} Union troops entering those cities on April 3 because Confederate rear guard forces, especially at Forts Gregg and Whitworth, Fort Mahone and Sutherland's Station, fought desperate delaying actions on April 2 to give most of the Confederates a <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> Union Army pursuers.|$|E

40|$|Project <b>Head</b> <b>Start,</b> {{a federal}} child {{development}} program for low-income families, serves both {{the mother and}} her children. Previous studies have emphasized <b>Head</b> <b>Start’s</b> influence <b>on</b> the child in terms of cognitive gains, social development, and social-emotional development. A continuing problem to understanding the extent of <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> impact <b>on</b> families {{is the absence of}} reliable information about <b>Head</b> <b>Start’s</b> influence <b>on</b> the mother and how that influence transfers to the family as they work toward self-sufficiency. This study investigated two issues: (1) the experiences, perceptions, and levels of involvement of mothers who participate in <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> social services, and (2) how these mothers describe their benefits and relate these benefits to family experiences such as increased problem-solving, coping, and parenting skills. A multiple case study methodology was selected because of its flexibility to allow the researcher to follow new leads that emerged. Participants met three criteria: (1) enrollment in a <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> social services program for at least six months, (2) willingness to sign an informed consent form and participate in three 90 -minute interviews, and (3) having at least one child currently enrolled in <b>Head</b> <b>Start.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|The Wachau, {{along with}} the rest of the Austrian wine industry, responded to the scandal with the {{development}} of strict wine laws and quality assurances. Producers in the Wachau already had a <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> this movement with the development a couple years earlier of the Vinea Wachau in 1983, a collaborative association that aimed to distinguish Wachau wine from other Austrian wines. In addition to holding its members to a guaranteed minimum quality level above the requirements of Austrian wine laws, the Vinea Wachau also established its own classification and wine labeling system that is still being used for Wachau wines today.|$|E

25|$|Not {{much was}} {{expected}} of the Drillers, nowhere {{more evident than in}} the pre-season coaches poll that had them pegged to finish 4–36. Such opinions were hardly unexpected though, as the Power were a dismal 6–34 the year prior. Even then most of the players inherited were good for little more than trade bait as the NPSL required that teams could field no more than four imports. Experienced players were very hard to come by, as not only had there not been any Canadian teams prior to provide a talent base, but there was another Canadian team entering the league that year, the Toronto Shooting Stars, and they had a <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> finding players.|$|E

25|$|While most of Lee's {{army had}} an {{effective}} one day <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> their march, the advance cavalry and infantry corps of the Union Army {{under the command}} of Major General Philip Sheridan were able to keep Lee's forces to their north by pursuing Lee on a parallel course to their south. Union cavalry harassed and skirmished with Confederate units almost from the beginning of Lee's army's flight from Petersburg. On April 3, 1865, advance units of the Union cavalry {{under the command of}} Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) George Armstrong Custer fought with rear guard Confederate cavalry at the Battle of Namozine Church. On April 4, 1865, the opposing forces skirmished at Beaver Pond Creek or Tabernacle Church and at Amelia Court House. Meanwhile, Sheridan's forces occupied Jetersville, Virginia and Burkeville Junction, Virginia, an important railroad junction.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} {{in the days leading up}} to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart's {{impending}} departure from the company had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at Survivor Series would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to doing anything he could to get under McMahon's skin and McMahon thought he would be likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on Nitro the following night (something Bischoff said would not have happened under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> McMahon due to Nitro going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to get the title off of Hart.|$|E
25|$|Steele was now desperately {{short of}} supplies, outnumbered and {{in danger of}} being {{surrounded}} at Camden. After his senior officers agreed with him that he had no other reasonable choice, Steele ordered a night withdrawal toward Little Rock on April 26 and the early morning of April 27, 1864. The Confederates did not detect Steele's movement until later in the day. Steele's forces used a pontoon bridge which they had carried on the campaign to cross the Ouachita River. Steele thus gained a <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> the Confederates who pursued the federal force as soon as they realized that Steele had withdrawn from Camden. First, the Confederates had to get across the swollen, and bridgeless, Ouachita River on the morning of April 28 by constructing a raft bridge. This delay allowed Steele to get a further head start, although rain soon slowed him down. The Confederates struggled through the rain, as well, but they did not have as many wagons or as much equipment to slow down their pursuit.|$|E
