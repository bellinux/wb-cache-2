2500|$|Wisconsin {{produces}} about {{a quarter}} of America's cheese, leading the nation in cheese production. It is second in milk production, after California, and third in per-capita milk production, behind California and Vermont. Wisconsin is second in butter production, producing about one-quarter of the nation's butter. The state ranks first nationally in the production of corn for silage, cranberries ginseng, and snap beans for processing. It grows over half the national crop of cranberries. and 97% of the nation's ginseng. Wisconsin is also a leading producer of oats, potatoes, carrots, tart cherries, maple syrup, and sweet corn for processing. The significance of the state's agricultural production is exemplified by the depiction of a <b>Holstein</b> <b>cow,</b> an ear of corn, and a wheel of cheese on Wisconsin's state quarter design.

Fifty high yielding and fifty low yielding <b>Holstein</b> dairy <b>cows</b> were used in this study. Electrocardiography was recorded by base-apex lead and blood samples were collected from jugular vein for measurement of serum elements such as sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorous, iron and magnesium. Cardiac dysrhythmias were detected more frequent in low yielding <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> (62. 00 %) compared to high yielding <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> (46. 00 %). The cardiac dysrhythmias that were observed in low yielding <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> included sinus arrhythmia (34. 70 %), wandering pacemaker (22. 45 %), bradycardia (18. 37 %), tachycardia (10. 20 %), atrial premature beat (2. 04 %), sinoatrial block (2. 04 %), atrial fibrillation (8. 16 %) and atrial tachycardia (2. 04 %). The cardiac dysrhythmias were observed in high yielding <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> including, sinus arrhythmia (86. 95 %) and wandering pacemaker (13. 05 %). Also, notched P wave was observed to be 30 % and 14 % in high- and low- yielding <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> respectively. The serum calcium concentration of low yielding <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> was significantly lower than that of high yielding <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows.</b> There was not any detectable significant difference in other serum elements between high- and low- yielding <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows.</b> Based on the result of present study, could be concluded that low serum concentration of calcium results to more frequent dysrhythmias in low yielding <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} milk composition and metabolic profile of <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> at different calving orders in the beginning, middle, {{and end of}} lactation. One hundred ten <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> were housed in a free stall system receiving the same diet and were grouped according to calving order (first, second, third, and fourth calving) and days in milk (DIM) : early (1 - 90 DIM), middle (91 - 180 DIM), and end of lactation (over 181 DIM) for comparing milk yield, milk composition, and blood metabolic profile between the calving orders within the same lactation period. These parameters were also evaluated between lactation periods of the cows in different calving orders. The calving order, in any lactation stage, had no influence on milk yield per day and blood biochemical profile of <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> receiving the same diet.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effect of two altitudes (3600 and 1600 m) on nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation and basal metabolism rate in Chinese <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows.</b> Experiment 1 was conducted to investigate the effect of high altitude (3600 m) on rumen fermentation, in vitro dry matter degradability, and nitrogen metabolism compared with low altitude (1600 m) in Chinese <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows.</b> Results indicated that total volatile fatty acids concentration, total gas production and gas coefficient a, b and c, efficiency of microbial protein synthesis and in vitro dry matter degradability were lower at 3600 m than 1600 m (P < 0. 05). The number of protozoa and ammonia nitrogen concentration was higher at 3600 m than 1600 m(P < 0. 05). We concluded that carbohydrate fermentation in the rumen was impaired, and ammonia nitrogen used for microbial nitrogen synthesis was also decreased at high altitude of 3600 m compared with 1600 m. Experiment 2 was conducted in vivo to investigate the effect of high altitude on apparent nutrient digestibility and basal metabolism rate in Chinese <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows.</b> Results indicated that the apparent digestibility of the diet's dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre was lower at 3600 m than those at 1600 m, respectively (P < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess and}} measure the effects of breed, genetic merit for {{production}} traits, and feeding systems (FS) {{on the ability of}} dairy cows to ensure pregnancy through its components (fertilization, embryonic losses, recalving). An experiment was conducted over 9 yr on Normande and <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> assigned to contrasted FS. Diets were based on maize silage in winter and grazing plus concentrate in spring in the high FS group, and on grass silage in winter and grazing with no concentrate during spring in the low FS group. Within breeds, cows were classified into 2 groups with similar estimated breeding values (EBV) for milk solids: cows with high EBV for milk yield were included in a milk group and those with high EBV for fat and protein contents were included in a content group. <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> produced more milk throughout lactation than Normande cows (the differential was greater in the high FS group, + 2, 294 kg, compared with + 1, 280 kg in the low FS group) and lost more body condition to nadir (the differential was greater in the high FS group, - 1. 00 point, compared with - 0. 80 point in the low FS group). Within breeds, milk solids production was similar between genetic groups. Cows in the high FS group produced more milk (+ 2, 495 kg for Holstein and + 1, 481 kg for Normande cws) and had a higher body condition score at nadir (+ 0. 40 point for Holstein and + 0. 60 point for Normande) than cows in the low FS group. <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> had a lower recalving rate than Normande cows (- 19 percentage units). We found no effect of genetic group and FS on fertility of Normande cows. However, according to FS, <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> in the content group exhibited different fertility failure patterns. In the low FS group, <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> in the content group had more nonfertilizations or early embryo mortality (+ 26 percentage units at first and second services) than <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> in the milk group. In the high FS group, <b>Holstein</b> <b>cows</b> in the content group had a higher proportion of late embryo mortality than in the milk group (+ 10 percentage units at first and second services). We observed no effect of FS on recalving rate; however, indicators of energy balance (protein content or body condition score) were positively associated with successful conception and pregnancy. This suggested a link between genetic merit for fat and protein content and lower ability of dairy cows to ensure pregnancy because of more nonfertilizations and early or late embryo mortality...|$|R
