5|$|The pileipellis, the {{top layer}} of hyphae in the cap, is a cutis. The cutis is made up of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick. The inamyloid and thin-walled hyphae are covered in brown granules. The flesh in the cap is made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7µm wide with thin cell walls. They are all generative hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills is basically the same as the flesh in the cap, but for {{the fact that it is}} completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. The flesh of the stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (that <b>is,</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the stem). The cells are 5 to 8µm wide, and are smooth and colourless; the cell walls up to 1µm thick. They are dextrinoid. All M.funalis hyphae lack clamp connections.|$|E
50|$|Several {{scenarios}} were {{suggested in}} the inquiry. One such suggestion was an engine failure, however after {{an investigation of the}} power plants and the propeller governors, this idea was eliminated. It was also suggested that the landing gear may have been operated incorrectly, however the inquiry established that the nose wheel <b>and</b> starboard undercarriage <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> locked, and whilst they could not definitely prove that the port undercarriage <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> locked, the board decided that it <b>was</b> likely <b>up</b> <b>and</b> locked.|$|R

25|$|When Transport for London {{expanded}} its London Overground service {{to include the}} East London Line in 2010, the East London line (extended to Croydon) changed from a solid orange line to a double orange stripe.

25|$|A clew-first waterstart is a {{variation}} used {{to start in}} the opposite direction from the one the board is initially pointing. It is very similar to a standard waterstart. The main difference is that once the sail is flying, the board is on the mast side of the sailor and points a bit further downwind, on a broad reach. The sail is flipped once the sailor <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> on the board.|$|E
25|$|The {{extension}} up to St. Thomas Mount {{is believed}} to benefit several people including those working in the IT establishments, residences and other offices near to the MRTS network. The patronage of the network {{is expected to increase}} significantly with this extension because St. Thomas Mount station will emerge as a single point interchange for 5 different modes of public transport – Public Buses, Southern Railway, the MRTS, Suburban South Line and Metro Line 2 - including a multi level terminal for three different suburban railway networks. Thus, the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) {{is likely to be the}} missing link in the proposed three-way integration at St. Thomas Mount railway station when metro rail <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> running by mid-2014. It also has been further decided to terminate long distance trains there, so that the city traffic may get reduced.|$|E
500|$|Ramirez was {{fourth in}} the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, with 138 points, behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, and Ryan Braun; this was {{remarkable}} for someone who played {{less than half a}} season in the NL. After the Dodgers lost in the playoffs, Ramirez, a free agent to be, was asked about his future. [...] "Gas <b>is</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> so am I", was his reply, indicating that he expected to be valued highly in the free agent market. After long and contentious negotiations that dragged into the start of spring training, Ramirez signed a two-year $45 million contract to remain with the Dodgers on March 4.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Time Is On My Side", Dean discovers Bela {{no longer}} has the Colt. He later gets her {{criminal}} record from England and learns her true name is Abbie. Almost ten years prior, when she was 14, she had her parents killed in exchange for her soul as part of a ten-year deal made with a Crossroads Demon; though Dean believes that she killed them to inherit their fortune and Bela supports this story, the audience is shown a flashback that suggests that she had actually agreed to the deal to escape abuse from her father. Now desperate because her time is running out, Bela tries to kill the Winchesters, but they anticipate her and escape ahead of time. Dean then calls her a few minutes before her deal <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> she confesses to him she tried {{to get out of the}} deal with the Crossroads Demon by trading the Colt. Once she gave it up, however, the deal changed so she had to kill Sam as well. Though Dean refuses her pleas for help, she reveals to him the demon Lilith holds all the contracts brokered by Crossroads Demons, including his own. Bela's deathand her soul's resulting descent into Hellis inevitable, but not shown.|$|E

2500|$|In an IT {{operations}} context, IT {{performance management}} is the subset of tools and processes in IT Operations {{which deals with}} the collection, monitoring, and analysis of performance metrics. These metrics can indicate to IT staff whether a system component <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> running (available), or that the component is behaving in an abnormal way that would impact its ability to function correctly—much like how a doctor may measure pulse, respiration, and temperature to measure how {{the human body is}} [...] "operating".

2500|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} and its results drew {{criticism from the}} Egyptian government, which advanced several alternative theories about mechanical malfunction of the aircraft. In Western countries, the Egyptian rejection of the NTSB report was attributed to a strong Egyptian cultural aversion to suicide.

For example, an elevator assembly hardover (in which the elevator in a fully extended position sticks because the hinge catches on the tail frame) proposed by the Egyptians was discounted because the flight recorder data showed the elevator was in a [...] "split condition."
