40|$|Recent nuclear {{proliferation}} concerns and disarmament agreements have encouraged the U. S. {{to decrease the}} excess amount of weapons-grade and reactor-grade plutonium. Continued use of nuclear power without a permanent solution for waste disposition has also led {{to the need for}} a reliable method by which the waste products, specifically plutonium, can be utilized or destroyed. One possible solution to plutonium destruction is achieved by manufacturing it into small microspheres and embedding it within an inert metal matrix, then placing it inside a conventional nuclear reactor. This process would burn some of the plutonium while producing electricity. PuO 2 Zr <b>dispersion</b> <b>fuel</b> has been proposed for such a purpose. Prior to its use, however, this non-fertile metal matrix <b>dispersion</b> <b>fuel</b> must be shown to be mechanically stable in the reactor environment. The internal mechanical interactions of <b>dispersion</b> <b>fuel</b> were modeled using finite element analysis. The results were used to assess the stability of PuO 2 Zr <b>dispersion</b> <b>fuel</b> inside a reactor. Several parameters, including fuel particle size, volumetric loading, temperature, and burnup, were varied to determine the maximum amount of plutonium that can be burned while maintaining fuel integrity. Earlier experiments using UO 2 stainless steel dispersion fuels were used to validate the model and establish a failure criterion. The validated model was then used to determine the parameter space over which PuO 2 Zr <b>dispersion</b> <b>fuel</b> can be successfully used. These results show that PuO 2 Zr <b>dispersion</b> <b>fuel</b> is robust and may offer a reliable method for plutonium disposal in current reactors. M. S.

40|$|Interaction between U-Mo {{fuel and}} Al {{has proven to}} {{dramatically}} impact the overall irradiation performance of RERTR <b>dispersion</b> <b>fuels.</b> It is of interest to better understand how similar interactions may affect the performance of monolithic fuel plates, where a uranium alloy fuel is sandwiched between aluminum alloy cladding. The monolithic fuel plate removes the fuel matrix entirely, which reduces the total surface area of the fuel that is available to react with the aluminum and moves the interface between the fuel and cladding to a colder region of the fuel plate. One of the major fabrication techniques for producing monolithic fuel plates is friction stir welding. This paper will discuss the interactions that can occur between the U-Mo foil and 6061 Al cladding when applying this fabrication technique. It has been determined that the time at high temperatures should be limited as much as is possible during fabrication or any post-fabrication treatment to reduce {{as much as possible}} the interactions between the foil and cladding.

40|$|Abstract. Historically, uranium enriched to> 90 % 235 U {{has been}} used for many {{peaceful}} applications requiring high fission densities such as driver fuels for research reactors. However, the use of high-enriched uranium or HEU (all enrichments> 20 % 235 U are considered HEU) for civil applications, is considered a proliferation concern. Since the 1970 's, efforts are being devoted to the conversion of research reactors operating on HEU to alternative fuels using uranium with enrichment below 20 % or LEU. These efforts imply the development of high-density LEU fuels to replace the low volume-density (mostly) UAlx based HEU fuels.

To improve {{the understanding of the}} as-fabricated microstructures of <b>dispersion</b> <b>fuel</b> plates, SEM and TEM analysis have been performed on RERTR- 9 A archive fuel plates, which went through an additional hot isostatic procsssing (HIP) step during fabrication. The fuel plates had depleted U- 7 Mo fuel particles dispersed in either Al- 2 Si or 4043 Al alloy matrix. For the characterized samples, it was observed that a large fraction of the ?-phase U- 7 Mo alloy particles had decomposed during fabrication, and in areas near the fuel/matrix interface where the transformation products were present significant fuel/matrix interaction had occurred. Relatively thin Si-rich interaction layers were also observed around the U- 7 Mo particles.

The oxidation rates of nuclear fuels are reviewed in this two-volume report to provide a baseline for comparison with release rate data and technical rationale for predicting general corrosion behavior of DOE SNF. The oxidation rates of nuclear fuels in the DOE SNF inventory were organized according to metallic, Part 1, and non-metallic, Part 2, spent nuclear fuels. This Part 1 of the report reviews the oxidation behavior of three fuel types prototypic of metallic fuel in the DOE SNF inventory: uranium metal, uranium alloys and aluminum-based <b>dispersion</b> <b>fuels.</b> The oxidation rates of these fuels were evaluated in oxygen, water vapor, and water. The water data were limited to pure water corrosion as this represents baseline corrosion kinetics. Since the oxidation processes and kinetics discussed in this report are limited to pure water, they are not directly applicable to corrosion rates of SNF in water chemistry that is significantly different (such as may occur in the repository). Linear kinetics adequately described the oxidation rates of metallic fuels in long-term corrosion. Temperature dependent oxidation rates were determined by linear regression analysis of the literature data. As expected the reaction rates of metallic fuels dramatically increase with temperature. The uranium metal and metal alloys have stronger temperature dependence than the aluminum <b>dispersion</b> <b>fuels.</b> The uranium metal/water reaction exhibited the highest oxidation rate of the metallic fuel types and environments that were reviewed. Consequently, the corrosion properties of all DOE SNF may be conservatively modeled as uranium metal, which is representative of spent N-Reactor fuel.
