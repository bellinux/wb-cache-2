40|$|The The Diploma Thesis {{deals with}} the {{institute}} of Catholic marriage, also called matrimony, and aims to provide detailed analyses on nullity of matrimony due to invalidity of matrimonial consent and its declaration. Firstly, the Thesis states a definition of matrimony with respect to Sacrament of Marriage being governed by the divine law, the canonical law, and, in regards to certain effects, the civil law. Pursuant to Code of Canon Law [CIC], 1983, canon 1055, § 1, the matrimonial covenant, by which {{a man and a}} woman establish between themselves a communion of the whole life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and procreation and education of offspring. Hence, marriage is a contract by which {{a man and a woman}} become irrevocably united, the Code of Canonic Law set up essential properties of marriage obligationes matrimonii essentialis, which are not to be excluded by either contractants. The Thesis further provides commentary on the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> the invalidity of the matrimonial consent, by descripting the reasons <b>for</b> <b>nullity</b> of matrimony which are defined by the Code of Canon Law, and can be grouped under these main causes: serious mental incapacity, incapacity to assume obligations, ignorance, error of person,simple error, fraud, simulation, conditional marriage, force and [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{conditions}} are established <b>for</b> <b>nullity</b> of quantum discord for mixed states {{of a general}} two-qubit system whose dynamical behaviour is given by an X-state form density matrix. It is found that quantum discord can vanish at a finite time even {{in the presence of}} correlations between qubits. The degeneracy of the populations of the combined states of the qubits and the multi-qubit quantum coherences are shown to be responsible for vanishing of the discord. We illustrate our considerations by examining the coherent-state Tavis-Cummings model in which two qubits interact dispersively with the cavity field. The disappearance of the discord is shown to be dependent on the initial atomic conditions that it may occur at a discrete instance or periodically at discrete instances redistributed over whole range of the evolution time. The nullity of the discord is interpreted as resulting from equal preparation of the spin anti-correlated and spin correlated product states in superposition~states. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
5000|$|A vetitum (Latin for [...] "prohibition") is a prohibition, in {{the form}} of a precept, imposed by an ecclesiastical {{authority}} on a particular individual. Most often in Roman Catholic canon law, the term is describes a prohibition against a particular behavior or action that is affixed to a party who has received remission of a penalty such as a declaration of nullity from a matrimonial tribunal of the Catholic Church. This prohibition or directive may involve one or both of the parties. A vetitum is imposed to delay the celebration of a future marriage until a given condition has been fulfilled or addressed. Thus, the pastoral purpose of a vetitum is to help an individual and/or a couple address the underlying problems that led to the breakdown of a former marriage union. At times a recommendation or a warning (a monitum) may also be made by the tribunal which processes a formal petition <b>for</b> <b>nullity.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} obtain a {{declaration}} of nullity, the parties must approach a Catholic diocesan tribunal. Most applications <b>for</b> <b>nullity</b> that are heard by the tribunal are granted because {{one or both of}} the parties are judged to have given invalid consent. In order to give valid consent, the parties must give it freely. They must have a basic understanding of what they are doing and have given some thought and evaluation to their decision to enter marriage (1983 CIC, Canon 1095). They must be capable of fulfilling the promises they make on the wedding day; that is, not suffer from any psychological infirmity (Canon 1095) that will prevent them from giving themselves in a partnership of the whole of life that has as its ends the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of children (canon 1055). They must intend the words that they speak on the wedding day; that is, intend to form a permanent and faithful partnership, open to sexual acts that are procreative (canon 1101). Serious failures in these areas can allow a possible successful application <b>for</b> marriage <b>nullity.</b> There are other reasons that might justify an allegation of invalid consent, such as a serious error concerning the person to whom marriage promises are made (Canon 1097), one party being seriously deceived by the other at the time of the wedding (Canon 1098) or one of the parties being subjected to force or grave fear without which the marriage would not be occurring (Canon 1103).|$|R
