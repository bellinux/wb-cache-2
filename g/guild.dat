50|$|In preindustrial societies, {{governmental}} administrative duties {{were often}} handled by voluntary associations such as <b>guilds.</b> In medieval Europe, <b>guilds</b> often controlled towns.

A thorough summary of the recent scholarship on <b>guilds</b> and their structure and history will help provide context for what may be loosely described as armed <b>guilds.</b> Though armed <b>guilds</b> have not yet been the subject of a proper systematic analysis, it is possible to tentatively identify four types. Combining the summary of ‘civilian’ <b>guilds</b> with the emerging evidence of armed <b>guilds,</b> including the fencing <b>guilds,</b> may help us better understand the social relevance of martial arts in medieval and Early Modern Europe.
