There was local pressure in the 1970s to reroute the branch line, and before the 1972 general election Sir Basil Arthur the Labour spokesman on transport had promised to reroute the line if Labour was elected. But the deviation did not proceed. It would have cost $3 million (1974), with <b>extra</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> of $3000 per year. The new route would have required sharp curves and a level crossing.|$|E

Most of what is left is spent on <b>extra</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> incurred in producing Fairtrade, and some Fairtrade cooperatives make a loss from their Fairtrade membership. Any money left over is spent on social products which may have no economic impact. The farmers do not receive a higher price for Fairtrade and may receive a lower price. Their costs when producing Fairtrade are, however, higher, so their net income is lower.

40|$|Farmers {{throughout}} the wheatbelt of Western Australia {{are interested in}} farming rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, in saline groundwater on salt-affected farmland, to generate an alternative source of income. We compared the relative productivity and profitability of three different production systems: extensive (trout stocked in earthen ponds and totally reliant on natural food); semi-intensive (trout stocked in earthen ponds and provided with supplementary diet); intensive (trout stocked in closed, recirculating tanks). The yield of fish increased with increasing production intensity. The mean wet weight (±SE) of trout after 4 months of grow-out was 61. 3 ± 2. 7 g in extensive systems, 157. 9 ± 5. 2 g in semi-intensive systems and 137. 9 ± 3. 9 g in intensive systems, giving mean yields of 10. 8 kg /pond (13. 5 kg/ha), 27. 9 kg/pond (34. 8 kg/ha) and 54. 9 kg/tank (21. 1 kg/m 3), respectively. A preliminary economic analysis of the different production systems showed that the increases in yield were sufficient to balance the <b>extra</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> involved in semi-intensive systems, but not in intensive systems. We conclude that semi-intensive production systems deserve further study for the commercially viable production of rainbow trout from saline groundwater in Western Australia...|$|E
40|$|Car {{purchase}} {{taxes in}} The Netherlands {{are among the}} highest in the EU. The Dutch government plans to gradually replace car purchase and ownership taxes by a national road user charging system (kilometre charge) in the period 2012 to 2016. As a result, new and second hand car prices in the Netherlands will drop up to 30 %. Relatively little research has been conducted on the impacts of such large price changes on car ownership. Reduced car prices are likely to lead to an increase in car ownership. But consumers could also refrain from buying extra cars when they consider the <b>extra</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> resulting from the kilometre charge. This paper presents one of the few empirical studies to examine the effects of both (large) fixed and variable car cost changes on both car ownership and use. An internet survey among Dutch households was designed and conducted including stated intentions and stated preference experiments. We investigated whether households react more to present one-off fixed costs than to recurrent variable costs, for various specifications of car costs. Model analysis was conducted to derive fixed and variable price elasticities for private car ownership and effects of the kilometre charge. The study shows in their car purchase decisions, households react more strongly to a change in euro per year in fixed car costs than to a euro per year in variable car costs. Abolishing the Dutch car purchase tax while at the same time introducing a kilometre charge will lead to 2 % rise in car ownership on the short to medium run (1 - 5 years) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} of how purity affects fluid degradation in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, commercially available eutectic diphenyl oxide/ biphenyl heat transfer fluids were tested for their thermal stability at different temperatures and for their chlorine content. A model for thermal degradation of the eutectic diphenyl oxide/ biphenylfluids in a parabolic trough CSP plant was built based on laboratory testing results and average fluid analysis results from operating CSP plants. Fluid degradation was compared between high quality product at 99. 9 % purity such as DOWTHERM™ AHeat Transfer Fluid and commercially available products with purities around 99. 5 %. A range of 1. 7 - 2. 4 times more degradation was determined for 99. 5 % purity fluids compared to the 99. 9 % quality for the operating conditions in a CSP plant. More frequent degradation separation operations are needed for lower 99. 5 % purity fluids, which ultimately means <b>extra</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost.</b> In addition to that, the additional new fluid refills needed over a 25 years of operation is $ 2 /kg.

40|$|Aims: The study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} capital <b>cost</b> and <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> on some selected quarries within North Central Nigeria. Study Design: Survey design was used in designing the questionnaire used for collecting data from the selected quarries. Study Area and Methodology: Twenty four quarries were selected in North- Central Nigeria for this study. Sixteen of these quarries were for commercial purposes while eight were for construction purposes. A total number of one hundred and fifty-five questionnaires were randomly distributed to the workers and managements of the various quarries {{to collect data on}} the quantity of granite rock blasted per month, cost of drilling accessories used, cost of explosives used, cost of maintenance of plant/equipment and cost of manpower. Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Returns (IRR) were the two economic evaluation data analyses used for the study because they rely on the time value of money. Results: The result shows that Majok quarry, Cafon quarry, Rock bridge quarry, Academ quarry, Trans Engineering and Sinac granite quarry are not doing well as their internal rate of returns falls short of the annual internal rate of returns of 20 %. This indicates that the companies could not break even as they failed to cover the average <b>operating</b> <b>cost.</b> Conclusion: The study noted that it is not only huge capital cost that determine the production cost of aggregates, rather, such measures as the size of the jaw of the crushing plant, appropriate spacing and burden drilling plan are very important to guide against the <b>extra</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> of secondary blasting...|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, one way {{to determine}} the best operating conditions would be creating a mathematical model or process model using software to simulate the vibrating fluidized bed for the desired process.The effects of gas velocity and temperature were modelled. One optimal operating condition would be increasing the drying rate. This is because with increased drying rate, the drying process in the vibrating fluidized bed will be shorter giving the vibrating fluidized bed an overall better efficiency. There are 3 major mechanisms which determine the drying rate. The mechanisms are the heat & mass transfer in the gas side, the thermodynamic equilibrium in between the two phases during contact and the heat & mass transfer within the wet solid. These three mechanisms will increase with the increase in gas velocity as well as the heat & mass transfer coefficient. This will then cause the drying rate to increase because of the increase in gas temperature which causes the gas humidity to decrease.The effects of particle size were modelled as well. It was found that. Larger particle need longer time to dry to reach the same moisture content due to increase in resistance within the particles against heat and mass transfer. Since the resistance against heat transfer within the particle is lower than the resistance against mass transfer; the convection heat not used to vaporize water is used to elevate the material temperature which will lead to higher moisture transfer coefficients within the particles and will cause higher drying rate. Therefore, it was concluded that for optimum operating conditions to be achieved, the particles which are fed into the vibratory fluidized bed should be decreased. Usually the particle size of the feed material is not a controlled parameter unless methods such as grinding are used but doing so would involve <b>extra</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> which should be avoided. Hence, another option would be by increasing the intensity of the vibrations in the vibrating fluidized bed.|$|R
40|$|The work {{addressed}} the {{greenhouse gas emission}} and electrical energy consumption of the aluminum industry. The objective {{was to provide a}} means for reducing both through the application of wireless instrumentation, coupled to mathematical modeling. Worldwide the aluminum industry consumes more electrical energy than all activities in many major countries (e. g. the UK) and emits more greenhouse gasses (e. g. than France). Most of these excesses are in the 'primary production' of aluminum; that is the conversion of aluminum oxide to metal in large electrolytic cells operating at hundreds of thousands of amps. An industry-specific GHG emission {{has been the focus of}} the work. The electrolytic cells periodically, but at irregular intervals, experience an upset condition known as an 'anode effect'. During such anode effects the cells emit fluorinated hydrocarbons (PFCs, which have a high global warming potential) at a rate far greater than in normal operation. Therefore curbing anode effects will reduce GHG emissions. Prior work had indicated that the distribution of electrical current within the cell experiences significant shifts in the minutes before an anode effect. The thrust of the present work was to develop technology that could detect and report this early warning of an anode effect so that the control computer could minimize GHG emissions. A system was developed to achieve this goal and, in collaboration with Alcoa, was tested on two cells at an Alcoa plant in Malaga, Washington. The project has also pointed to the possibility of additional improvements that could result from the work. Notable among these is an improvement in efficiency that could result in an increase in cell output at little <b>extra</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost.</b> Prospects for commercialization have emerged in the form of purchase orders for further installations. The work has demonstrated that a system for monitoring the current of individual anodes in an aluminum cell is practical. Furthermore the system has been installed twice on a smelter in the US without exposing workers to hazards usually associated with running signal wires in aluminum plants. The results display the early warning of an anode effect that potentially can be used to minimize such anode effects with their excessive GHG emissions. They also point to a possible, but substantial, economic benefit that could result in improved current efficiency by anode adjustment based on individual anode current measurements...|$|R
