40|$|Abstract: Higher {{levels of}} nearby traffic {{increase}} exposure to {{air pollution and}} adversely affect health outcomes. Populations with lower socio-economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to stressors like air pollution. We investigated cumulative <b>exposures</b> <b>and</b> risks from traffic and from MNRiskS-modeled air pollution in multiple source categories across demographic groups. <b>Exposures</b> <b>and</b> risks, especially from on-road sources, were higher than the mean for minorities and low SES populations and lower than the mean for white and high SES populations. Owning multiple vehicles and driving alone were linked to lower household <b>exposures</b> <b>and</b> risks. Those not owning a vehicle and walking or using transit had higher household <b>exposures</b> <b>and</b> risks. These results confirm for our study location that populations on {{the lower end of}} the socio-economic spectrum and minorities are disproportionately exposed to traffic and air pollution and at higher risk for adverse health outcomes. A major source of disparities appears to be the transportation infrastructure. Those outside the urban core had lower risks but drove more, while those living nearer the urban core tended to drive less but had higher <b>exposures</b> <b>and</b> risks from on-road sources...|$|R

5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough.

The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone.

40|$|Background: Increasing data {{on early}} {{biological}} changes from chemical exposures requires new interpretation tools to support decision-making. Objectives: To test {{the possibility of}} applying a quantitative approach using human data linking chemical <b>exposures</b> <b>and</b> upstream biological perturbations to overt downstream outcomes. Methods: Using polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) <b>exposures</b> <b>and</b> maternal thyroid hormone (TH) perturbations as a case study, we model three relationships: (1) prenatal PCB <b>exposures</b> <b>and</b> TH changes, using free T 4 (FT 4); (2) prenatal TH and childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes; and (3) prenatal PCB <b>exposures</b> <b>and</b> childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes (IQ). We surveyed the epidemiological literature; extracted relevant quantitative data; and developed models for each relationship, applying meta-analysis where appropriate. Results: For relationship 1, a meta-analysis of 3 studies gives a coefficient of - 0. 27 pg/mL FT 4 per ln(sum of PCBs) (95 % confidence interval [CI] - 0. 82 to 0. 27). For relationship 2, regression coefficients from three studies of maternal FT 4 levels and cognitive scores ranged between 0. 99 IQ points/(pg/mL FT 4) (95 % CI - 0. 31 to 2. 2) and 7. 6 points/(pg/mL FT 4) (95 % CI 1. 2 to 16. 3). For relationship 3, a meta-analysis of five studies produces a coefficient of - 1. 98 IQ points (95 % CI - 4. 46 to 0. 50) per unit increase in ln(sum of PCBs). Combining relationships 1 and 2 yields an estimate of - 2. 0 to - 0. 27 points of IQ per unit increase in ln(sum of PCBs). Conclusions: Combining analysis of chemical <b>exposures</b> <b>and</b> early biological perturbations (PCBs and FT 4) with analysis of early biological perturbations and downstream overt effects (FT 4 and IQ) yields estimates {{within the range of}} studies of <b>exposures</b> <b>and</b> overt effects (PCBs and IQ).

5|$|In Virginia, some Carolina wrens populations show {{high levels}} of mercury in their blood and this is {{acquired}} from feeding all-year-round on spiders. Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury (through biomagnification) than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood. Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content. <b>Exposure,</b> <b>and</b> prolonged periods of cold, ice, and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations, respectively.

5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins.

A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide <b>exposure</b> <b>and</b> the later onset of Parkinson's disease.
