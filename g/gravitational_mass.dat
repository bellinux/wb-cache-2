25|$|As an example: an {{inertial}} body {{moving along}} a geodesic through space can be trapped into an orbit {{around a large}} <b>gravitational</b> <b>mass</b> without ever experiencing acceleration. This is possible because spacetime is radically curved in close vicinity to a large <b>gravitational</b> <b>mass.</b> In such a situation the geodesic lines bend inward around {{the center of the}} mass and a free-floating (weightless) inertial body will simply follow those curved geodesics into an elliptical orbit. An accelerometer on-board would never record any acceleration.|$|E
25|$|Both general {{relativity}} and Newtonian gravity appear {{to predict that}} negative mass would produce a repulsive gravitational field. In particular, Sir Hermann Bondi proposed in 1957 that negative <b>gravitational</b> <b>mass,</b> combined with negative inertial mass, would comply with the strong equivalence principle of {{general relativity}} theory and the Newtonian laws of conservation of linear momentum and energy. Bondi's proof yielded singularity free solutions for the relativity equations. In July 1988, Robert L. Forward presented a paper at the AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE 24th Joint Propulsion Conference that proposed a Bondi negative <b>gravitational</b> <b>mass</b> propulsion system.|$|E

25|$|Tests of {{the weak}} {{equivalence}} principle are those that verify the equivalence of <b>gravitational</b> <b>mass</b> and inertial mass. An obvious test is dropping different objects, ideally in a vacuum environment, e.g., inside Fallturm Bremen.|$|E
25|$|The {{experimental}} {{observation that}} inertial mass and <b>gravitational</b> <b>mass</b> are equal to unprecedented levels of accuracy {{leads to the}} identification of the gravitational field strength as identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle.

25|$|In 1905, Einstein {{introduced}} {{special relativity}} (even though without using {{the techniques of}} the spacetime formalism) in its modern understanding as a theory of space and time. While his results are mathematically equivalent to those of Lorentz and Poincaré, it was Einstein who showed that the Lorentz transformations are {{not the result of}} interactions between matter and aether, but rather concern the nature of space and time itself. Einstein performed his analyses in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies without reference to forces) rather than dynamics. He obtained all of his results by recognizing that the entire theory can be built upon two postulates: The principle of relativity and the principle of the constancy of light speed. In addition, Einstein in 1905 superseded previous attempts of an electromagnetic mass-energy relation by introducing the general equivalence of mass and energy, which was instrumental for his subsequent formulation of the equivalence principle in 1907, which declares the equivalence of inertial and <b>gravitational</b> <b>mass.</b> By using the mass-energy equivalence, Einstein showed, in addition, that the <b>gravitational</b> <b>mass</b> of a body is proportional to its energy content, which was one of early results in developing general relativity. While it would appear that he did not at first think geometrically about spacetime, in the further development of general relativity Einstein fully incorporated the spacetime formalism.|$|E

25|$|While {{examining}} the Coma galaxy cluster in 1933, Zwicky {{was the first}} to use the virial theorem to infer the existence of unseen matter, which he referred to as dunkle Materie 'dark matter'. He calculated the <b>gravitational</b> <b>mass</b> of the galaxies within the cluster and obtained a value at least 400 times greater than expected from their luminosity, which means that most of the matter must be dark. The same calculation today shows a smaller factor, based on greater values for the mass of luminous material; but it is still clear that the great majority of matter was correctly inferred to be dark.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotating}} observer {{sees the}} walker travel {{a straight line}} {{from the center of the}} carousel to the periphery, as shown in Figure 5. Moreover, the rotating observer sees that the walker moves at a constant speed in the same direction, so applying Newton's law of inertia, there is zero force upon the walker. These conclusions do not agree with the inertial observer. To obtain agreement, the rotating observer has to introduce fictitious forces that appear to exist in the rotating world, even though there is no apparent reason for them, no apparent <b>gravitational</b> <b>mass,</b> electric charge or what have you, that could account for these fictitious forces.|$|E
25|$|Different sets of {{elements}} {{are used for}} various astronomical bodies.

Either the longitude at epoch, , the mean anomaly at epoch, , or the time of perihelion passage, , are used to specify a known point in the orbit.

25|$|Einstein (1908) tried– as a {{preliminary}} {{in the framework}} of special relativity– also to include accelerated frames within the relativity principle. In the course of this attempt he recognized that for any single moment of acceleration of a body one can define an inertial reference frame in which the accelerated body is temporarily at rest. It follows that in accelerated frames defined in this way, the application of the constancy of the speed of light to define simultaneity is restricted to small localities. However, the equivalence principle that was used by Einstein in the course of that investigation, which expresses the equality of inertial and <b>gravitational</b> <b>mass</b> and the equivalence of accelerated frames and homogeneous gravitational fields, transcended the limits of special relativity and resulted in the formulation of general relativity.|$|E
