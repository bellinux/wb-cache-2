5000|$|It {{is unknown}} what {{aspects of the}} natural immune {{response}} to HIV may protect someone from superinfection, {{but it has been}} shown that cytotoxic lymphocyte responses do not seem to be protective. [...] In addition, it has been demonstrated that superinfection can occur in individuals that demonstrate a robust anti-HIV antibody response. The anti-HIV antibody response broadens and strengthens in individuals post-superinfection. [...] Taken with the finding that super-infection is common and occurs within and between HIV subtypes it has been suggested that the immune response elicited by primary infection may confer limited protection and raises concerns that <b>HIV-vaccine</b> strategies designed to replicate the natural anti-HIV immune response may have limited effectiveness in preventing new infections. However at the same time, HIV-infected individuals at high risk for super-infection who do not become superinfected may also provide a very interesting avenue for new vaccine research.|$|E
50|$|Esparza studied {{medicine}} at the Universidad del Zulia Medical School (Maracaibo), where he obtained an M.D. in 1968. During his undergraduate teenage years, Esparza teamed up {{with some of his}} teachers in viral research studies designed to characterize a large zoonotic outbreak of Venezuelan equine encephalitis affecting people and riding beasts in the nearby Guajira region and its surroundings. He entered IVIC (Caracas) to work at as a graduate student under the guidance of Gernot H. Bergold and then moved to Houston, TX, to pursue graduate studies under the mentorship of virologist Priscilla Shaffer and attend advanced virology courses given by Joseph L. Melnick. Esparza obtained his Ph.D. degree in virology and cell biology from Baylor College of Medicine in 1974. He then returned to Venezuela to work at IVIC where he became chairman and full professor of virology in 1985. As part of a sabbatical leave Esparza was invited by the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at Duke University (Durham, N.C.) to work with Wolfgang Joklik. At Durham, Esparza applied modern methods of molecular engineering to study reoviruses. He also applied such tools to the study of rotaviruses, a leading worldwide cause of infantile diarrhea which severely affects and causes many deaths in toddlers living in developing countries like Venezuela. By this stage Esparza had attained hands-on command of many aspects of viral research techniques (i.e., virus-isolation, culture, serotyping, structure, genetic engineering and vaccine development) as well as project-management expertise while heading studies of a variety of human viral pathologies including enchephalitis, herpes, and rotaviruses. In 1986 Esparza was then recruited as a medical officer by the Division of Communicable Diseases of the World Health Organization, a position which implied worldwide supervising responsibilities of research projects involving various vector-borne viral diseases such as yellow fever, dengue, encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. In 1988 Esparza joined the recently created WHO Global Programme on AIDS and in 1996 he was required to head the Vaccine Development Unit sponsored jointly by WHO-UNAIDS, a task he undertook until 2004. He then joined the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Seattle) from 2004 to 2014, first as senior adviser on HIV Vaccines, and from 2011 as senior adviser on global health and vaccines. He then moved to Washington(DC), occupying a position as adjunct professor of {{medicine at}} the Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, where he continues writing about conceptual aspects of <b>HIV-vaccine</b> development and participating in the monitoring of some of the ongoing clinical trials for <b>HIV-vaccine.</b>|$|E

Under these circumstances, the best hope for controlling the HIV pandemic is the development of an effective prophylactic vaccine.

40|$|The {{identification}} of HIV envelope structures that generate broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies {{is a major}} goal for <b>HIV-vaccine</b> development. In this study, we evaluated one such structure, expressed as either a gp 120 –CD 4 or a gp 140 –CD 4 complex, {{for its ability to}} elicit a neutralizing antibody response. In rhesus macaques, covalently crosslinked complexes of soluble human CD 4 (shCD 4) and HIV- 1 IIIB envelope glycoproteins (gp 120 or gp 140) generated antibodies that neutralized a wide range of primary HIV- 1 isolates regardless of the coreceptor usage or genetic subtype. Ig with cross-reactive neutralizing activity was recovered by affinity chromatography with a chimeric single-chain polypeptide containing sequences for HIVBaL gp 120 and a mimetic peptide that induces a CD 4 -triggered envelope structure. These results suggest that covalently crosslinked complexes of the HIV- 1 surface envelope glycoprotein and CD 4 elicit broadly neutralizing humoral responses that, in part, may be directed against a novel epitope(s) found on the HIV- 1 envelope...|$|E
40|$|Richard Horton has seriously {{questioned}} {{the possibility of}} developing a successful HIVpreventive vaccine and has appropriately criticised an over optimistic attitude promoted by some individuals in the <b>HIV-vaccine</b> research community. 1 Horton's piece is, for the most part, on the mark and useful. However, there are points that I believe will benefit from clarification. Whereas he rightly points out that some people working on HIV made glib statements for an early vaccine success, this position was never that of most leading HIV scientists. Indeed, many AIDS scientists regularly acknowledge {{the possibility of the}} impossibility of success. Horton implies that the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) once held an optimistic position, but most scientists recognised that this was naive, and IAVI, like most scientists, no longer argues that a vaccine is just around the corner. Correctly, Horton criticises a vaccine efficacy trial, 2 but it is noteworthy that most AIDS scientists were also not pleased that this trial went forward and were keenly aware that it had little or no chance of success. I think we can all agree that continued promotion, testing, and predictable failure of vaccines that are not evidence-based will continue to foster negativ...|$|E
40|$|To {{test the}} {{efficacy}} of a new <b>HIV-vaccine,</b> preventative trials are held where participants are injected with the vaccine and tested for HIV several times. One of the questions of interest in these trials is whether the efficacy depends on the genetic sequence of the exposing virus. To answer this question, one considers the joint distribution function of the time to infection (a survival time) and the so-called viral distance between the infecting HIV virus and the virus in the vaccine (a continuous mark variable). However, the time to infection is actually not observed; it is subject to interval censoring. Moreover, the viral distance can only be observed if the participant has already been infected {{at the time of}} testing. In the simplest setting, when a participant is tested only once for HIV infection, the observations in these trials can be modeled by the current status continuous mark model. A natural estimator for the distribution function is the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). Maathuis and Wellner (2008) study the MLE in the current status continuous mark model, and prove that it is inconsistent. We study two alternative estimators, the maximum smoothed likelihood estimator and the smooth plug-in inverse estimator. The first estimator is a likelihood based estimator, maximizing a smoothed log-likelihood. The second estimator is based on the explicit (inverse) expression of the distribution function of interest in terms of the density of the observable vector. We consider the asymptotic behavior of both estimators, in particular showing their consistency. Keywords...|$|E

As a vaccine vector the E 1 B 55 K deletion may allow for the insertion of a transgene nearly 1, 000 base pairs larger than now possible. This {{has the potential of}} extending the application for which the vectors are clinically known. However, the immune priming ability of E 1 B 55 K-deleted vectors is unknown, undermining our ability to gauge their usefulness in vaccine applications. For this reason, we created an E 1 B 55 K-deleted Ad 5 vector expressing full-length single chain HIVBaLgp 120 attached to a flexible linker and the first two domains of rhesus CD 4 (rhFLSC) in exchange for the E 3 region. In cell-based experiments the E 1 B 55 K-deleted vector promoted higher levels of innate immune signals including chemokines, cytokines, and the NKG 2 D ligands MIC A/B compared to an E 1 B 55 K wild-type vector expressing the same immunogen. Based on these results we evaluated the immune priming ability of the E 1 B 55 K-deleted vector in mice. The E 1 B 55 K-deleted vector promoted similar levels of Ad 5 -, HIVgp 120, and rhFLSC-specific cellular and humoral immune responses as the E 1 B 55 K wild-type vector. In pre-clinical <b>HIV-vaccine</b> studies the wild-type vector has been employed as part of a very effective prime-boost strategy.

Comparative safety of both routes was evaluated. CD 8 + T-cell immune responses to HIV epitopes (ELISpot interferon-gamma assay) and tetanus toxin-specific CD 4 + T-cell responses (lymphoproliferation) were assessed at baseline, two weeks after each injection, and at week 24. No severe, serious or life-threatening adverse events were observed. Local pain was significantly more frequent after intramuscular injection, but local inflammatory reactions were more frequent after intradermal immunization. At weeks 2, 6, 14 and 24, the respective cumulative percentages of induced CD 8 + T-cell responses {{to at least one}} HIV peptide were 9, 33, 39 and 52 (intradermal group) or 14, 20, 26 and 37 (intramuscular group), and induced tetanus toxin-specific CD 4 + T-cell responses were 6, 27, 33 and 39 (intradermal), or 9, 46, 54 and 63 (intramuscular). In conclusion, intradermal LIPO- 4 immunization was well tolerated, required one-fifth of the intramuscular dose, and induced similar HIV-specific CD 8 + T-cell responses.

40|$|Antibody subclasses exhibit {{extensive}} polymorphisms (allotypes) {{that could}} potentially impact the quality of <b>HIV-vaccine</b> induced B cell responses. Allotypes of immunoglobulin (Ig) G 1, the most abundant serum antibody, {{have been shown to}} display altered functional properties in regard to serum half-life, Fc-receptor binding and FcRn-mediated mucosal transcytosis. To investigate the potential link between allotypic IgG 1 -variants and vaccine-generated humoral responses in a cohort of 14 HIV vaccine recipients, we developed a novel protocol for rapid IgG 1 -allotyping. We combined PCR and ELISA assays in a dual approach to determine the IgG 1 allotype identity (G 1 m 3 and/or G 1 m 1) of trial participants, using human plasma and RNA isolated from PBMC. The IgG 1 -allotype distribution of our participants mirrored previously reported results for caucasoid populations. We observed elevated levels of HIV gp 140 -specific IgG 1 and decreased IgG 2 levels associated with the G 1 m 1 -allele, in contrast to G 1 m 3 carriers. These data suggest that vaccinees homozygous for G 1 m 1 are predisposed to develop elevated Ag-specific IgG 1 :IgG 2 ratios compared to G 1 m 3 -carriers. This elevated IgG 1 :IgG 2 ratio was further associated with higher FcγR-dimer engagement, a surrogate for potential antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) function. Although preliminary, these results suggest that IgG 1 allotype may {{have a significant impact on}} IgG subclass distribution in response to vaccination and associated Fc-mediated effector functions. These results have important implications for ongoing HIV vaccine efficacy studies predicated on engagement of FcγR-mediated cellular functions including ADCC and ADCP, and warrant further investigation.

40|$|The {{pandemic}} {{caused by}} HIV {{is one of}} the fastest growing health problems in the world today. Given the limited resources available to healthcare systems in many of the most heavily affected countries, it is crucially important to know the effectiveness, efficiency, equity, and acceptability of the interventions being implemented to contain this pandemic. This review examines the peer-reviewed literature on the efficiency of prevention, treatment and care interventions published between 1994 and 2004, findings reported by these studies, and methods used. The results varied by geographical setting and population studied. Some interventions were clearly cost effective including: prevention efforts and testing programs among vulnerable populations; blood screening in high-income nations and in sub-Saharan Africa; providing antiretroviral drugs and other interventions to expectant mothers and infants; treating certain opportunistic infections; and providing combination anti-retroviral therapy. However, most studies were set in the US, while only one in six dealt with sub-Saharan Africa. Few studies could be identified from continental Asia and none from Latin America. Three-quarters of all papers focused on hospital or primary care settings, with only prevention studies regularly evaluating community-based interventions. There is a paucity of primary data and thus, outcomes or costs were frequently modeled, using data from multiple sources in the absence of context-specific data. Establishing multicenter prospective monitoring systems on the use, cost and outcome of HIV service provision in middle and lower income countries may provide data to fill some of the large gaps which exist in the literature on interventions in these countries. The resulting gaps in the current scientific literature limits the ability for it to guide policy makers in those settings where the epidemic is most intense. Increased research in such settings and dissemination of their findings is urgently required, especially given the need for intensified prevention strategies to complement the scaling up of HIV treatment and care services in these countries.

40|$|The {{development}} of an effective HIV- 1 vaccine must be considered as one of today s greatest biomedical goals and challenges. The nature of the HIV- 1 virus, characterised by its tropism for the CD 4 + T cells {{of the immune system}} and its integration into the host genome, together with the vast viral variability, allows the HIV- 1 virus to establish a latent infection and evade the host defence mechanisms. In our endeavour to develop a genetic <b>HIV-vaccine</b> that elicits broad and robust immune responses to several virus variants, we have demonstrated major cross-clade Gag responses in patients infected with different subtypes of HIV- 1. This indicates that genetic vaccines encoding Gag from a few strains may act to induce immunity to broad ranges of HIV- 1 clades. We also found that HIV- 1 infection results in release of intracellular perforin into the serum of HIV infected individuals and in SIV/SHIV infected monkeys. As perforin secretion/production {{has been shown to be}} associated with control of HIV- 1 infection, the aberrant perforin release may be a result of a yet unknown viral immune escape mechanism. Individuals enrolled in two therapeutic and one prophylactic HIV- 1 vaccine trial were analysed for their vaccine-specific immune responses. Analyses of the therapeutic vaccine samples revealed that: 1) Multiple injections with recombinant HIV- 1 glycoprotein 160 induces an increased central memory T cell population, which can be associated with increased antigenspecific cellular immune responses in treatment naïve HIV- 1 infected individuals. 2) Topical DNA immunisation, combined with repeated treatment interruptions in patients on successful antiretroviral therapy, induced novel HIV- 1 specific cellular immune responses. Such treatment did permit extended drug-free periods for all participants. Moreover, the viral load set points were significantly lower after the treatment protocol than before initial onset of any antiretroviral treatment. However, the decreased viral load set points were not related to the HIV- 1 immunisation. In the prophylactic study, HIV- 1 DNA followed by a recombinant vaccinia virus vector boost induced strong and broad HIV- 1 specific cellular immune responses. In healthy individuals, we found that previous immunity to vaccinia only moderately reduced the HIV-specific immune responses when vaccinia was used as a vector for HIV genes. This finding suggests that vaccinia-based immunogens can be used despite the presence of pre-existing immunity to this vector. Immunisation of HIV- 1 infected individuals is difficult, as HIV- 1 infection leads to a dysfunctional immune system. Despite efforts to induce new and improve existing immune responses by therapeutic vaccination, no clinical trial has yet been able to show long-term sustained clinical effects of immunisation. The modest and transient effects observed by us with currently available DNA vaccines highlight the need to develop immunisation strategies which combine immunisation with novel antiviral therapies...|$|E
