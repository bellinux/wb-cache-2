25|$|Graphium agamemnon, the tailed jay, is a {{predominantly}} green and black tropical butterfly {{that belongs to}} the swallowtail family. The butterfly is also called the green-spotted triangle, tailed <b>green</b> <b>jay,</b> or green triangle. It is a common, non-threatened species native to Nepal, India, Sri Lanka through Southeast Asia and Australia. Several geographic races are recognized.|$|E
25|$|New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) are {{notable for}} their highly {{developed}} tool fabrication. They make angling tools of twigs and leaves trimmed into hooks, {{then use the}} hooks to pull insect larvae from tree holes. Tools are engineered according to task and apparently also to learned preference. Recent studies revealed abilities to solve complicated problems, which suggests high level of innovation of a complex nature. Other corvids that have been observed using tools include the American crow, blue jay and <b>green</b> <b>jay.</b> Diversity in tool design among corvids suggests cultural variation. Again, great apes are the only other animals known to use tools in such a fashion.|$|E
500|$|Many birds {{migrate to}} the area around Aransas Bay, most notably to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Year-round {{residents}} include least grebe, brown pelican, neotropic cormorant, white-faced ibis, roseate spoonbill, black-bellied whistling-duck, mottled duck, white-tailed hawk, crested caracara, pauraque, golden-fronted woodpecker, great kiskadee, <b>green</b> <b>jay,</b> long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, seaside sparrow, and bronzed cowbird. [...] The endangered whooping crane has also been spotted near the bay. Despite {{the fact that there}} were only 15 in 1900, over 180 are found in the wild today. The whooping crane's and other birds' survival depends on the availability of blue crab. Thousands of crab traps have been removed to preserve the population.|$|E
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>jays</b> feed on a {{wide range}} of insects and other {{invertebrates}} and various cereal grains. They take ebony (Ebenopsis spp.) seeds where these occur, and also any oak species' acorns, which they will cache. Meat and human scraps add to the diet when opportunity arises. <b>Green</b> <b>jays</b> have been observed using sticks as tools to extract insects from tree bark.|$|R
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>jays</b> usually build a nest {{in a tree}} or in a thorny bush or thicket, and {{the female}} lays three to five eggs. Only the female incubates, but both parents {{take care of the}} young.|$|R
50|$|The Lower Coast section {{which lies}} around the Rio Grande offers its own species diversity. South Padre Island and the Laguna Madre areas feature {{magnificent}} frigatebirds, bridled terns, and Cory’s shearwater. Further up the Rio Grande around Santa Ana and McAllen {{one can find}} elf owls, white-tipped doves, <b>green</b> <b>jays,</b> <b>green</b> kingfishers, and Mississippi kite. The brown pelican is found especially on South Padre Island {{in addition to other}} locations on the coast. The inland areas around Zapata are home to white-collared seedeaters, lesser goldfinch, ash-throated flycatchers, and black-tailed gnatcatchers.|$|R
50|$|The bird {{is usually}} lumped with the <b>green</b> <b>jay</b> of North America. Somewhat {{confusing}} in classification, the inca jay is then considered a subspecies of the <b>green</b> <b>jay,</b> {{even though the}} inca jay is nominate.|$|E
50|$|Usually lumped with Inca jay (C. yncas yncas) of South America. Somewhat {{confusing}} in classification, the <b>green</b> <b>jay</b> is {{then used}} as the species name, even though the inca jay is the nominate subspecies. Some authorities split the two species with the Inca jay retaining the binomial C. yncas and the <b>green</b> <b>jay</b> adopting C. luxuosus.|$|E

The breast and underparts range from bright yellow in the south to pale green in the north (e.g., Texas). The upper parts are rich green. It has large nasal bristles that form a distinct tuft in some subspecies, but are less developed in others. The color of the iris ranges from dark brownish to bright yellow depending on the subspecies.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>green</b> <b>jay</b> (Cyanocorax yncas) is a {{bird species}} of the New World jays, and is found in both North and South America.

The basic diet consists of arthropods, vertebrates, seeds, and fruit. The nest is usually built in a thorny bush; the female incubates the clutch of three to five eggs.
