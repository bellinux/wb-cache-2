5|$|Category5 hurricanes are {{tropical}} cyclones {{that reach}} Category5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. They are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet Earth. They are {{rare in the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> and generally form only once every several years. In general, Category5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Larry drifted {{across the}} Isthmus of Tehuantepec, {{dropping}} heavy rainfall of over 9in (229mm) in places. The rainfall led to flooding and mudslides, causing damage {{to thousands of}} houses. The flooding killed five people and resulted in $53.6million (2003USD) in damage. Larry {{was one of three}} tropical cyclones to hit Mexico {{in a short period of}} time, including Tropical Depression Nora and Tropical Storm Olaf in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b>|$|E

5|$|In late September, three {{tropical}} disturbances moved westward {{across the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> One of them organized into a tropical depression on September28. The {{next day the}} depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Monica. The tropical storm initially headed west-northwestward and gradually curved towards the north. It reached its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) on September29. Monica then gradually weakened. It became a tropical depression on October1. The cyclone dissipated shortly thereafter. No impact was reported in association with Tropical Storm Monica.|$|E
5|$|Many of the wettest {{tropical}} cyclones in the United States {{have moved}} into the contiguous United States from the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The highest rainfall totals in {{the country have been}} measured across the Gulf Coast and lower portions of the Eastern Seaboard. Intermediate amounts have been measured across the Southwest, New England, and the Midwest. The northern Great Plains and Pacific Northwest have received the lowest amounts, as those regions lie exceptionally far from the breeding grounds of Atlantic and Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the last}} {{year in which the}} Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center was the primary warning center for tropical cyclones in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The season officially started May 15, 1987, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1987, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1987. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when the vast majority of tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|The 1990 Pacific {{hurricane}} season saw a then-record 16 hurricanes form. Throughout the year, 21tropical cyclones became named storms in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Hurricane Alma formed on May12, 1990, {{three days before}} the season's official start on May15. The Central Pacific {{hurricane season}} began on June1, covering tropical cyclone formation in the region between 140°W and International Dateline. Hurricane Trudy was the last storm to dissipate, doing so on November1, nearly a month before the Pacific hurricane season officially ended on November30.|$|E
5|$|The diamond {{stingray}} {{is found}} in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> from southern California to northern Chile, as well as around the Galápagos and Hawaiian Islands; it is very abundant around Baja California and in the Gulf of California. At the northern and southern extremes of its range, it is generally only present during periods of suitably warm water brought about by El Niño. There is a record of this ray from off British Columbia, which is unconfirmed and would be highly anomalous as it is known to be a tropical and warm-temperate species.|$|E
5|$|The season officially {{started on}} May 15, 2003, in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean,</b> and on June 1, 2003, {{in the central}} Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 2003. These dates {{conventionally}} delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season saw 16 tropical storms form, of which 7 became hurricanes, which is about average. However, this season was the first Pacific hurricane season since 1977 to have no systems become major hurricanes by reaching Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E

5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on July 17. It tracked across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development, and after crossing Central America, it entered the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> on July 25. The cloud pattern and convection began to become better organized on July 28, and shortly thereafter a mid-level circulation developed. It continued to organize, and subsequent {{to the development of}} a low-level circulation it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975miles (1,575km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 29. Operationally, tropical cyclone advisories were not initiated until visible satellite images confirmed the low-level circulation twelve hours after the depression formed.|$|E
5|$|Arizona {{has been}} {{affected}} by hurricanes on numerous occasions. Usually, these storms originate in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean,</b> make landfall in the Mexican states of Baja California or Sonora, and dissipate before crossing into the United States. Thus, in most cases, {{it is only the}} tropical cyclones' remnant moisture that produces heavy rainfall—and in some occasions, flooding—in portions of Arizona. However, approximately every five years, a tropical cyclone retains sufficient strength to enter the state as a tropical storm or a tropical depression. Arizonans can expect indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones to occur about every two years.|$|E
5|$|As Debbie {{approached}} the northern Gulf Coast, {{it failed to}} intensify, despite warm sea surface temperatures, abundant moisture, and an anticyclone aloft. In addition, the storm never developed good outflow, partially due to stable air related to Tropical Storm Hazel in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> After maintaining peak winds for about 12hours, Debbie weakened due to cooler, drier air, deteriorating to a tropical depression on September29. That day, it turned to the northwest, passing {{just east of the}} Mississippi Delta. On September30, the circulation of Debbie dissipated just offshore Mississippi. Its remnants made landfall, accelerated northeastward, and were eventually absorbed by an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Gilma {{was one of}} {{the most}} intense Pacific {{hurricane}}s on record and the second of three Category 5 hurricanes during the active 1994 Pacific hurricane season. Developing from a westward tracking tropical wave over the open waters of the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> on July21, the pre-Gilma tropical depression was initially large and disorganized. Gradual development took place over the following day before rapid intensification began. By July23, the storm intensified into a hurricane and later a Category 5 storm on July24. As Gilma reached this intensity, it crossed into the Central Pacific basin, the fourth consecutive storm to do so.|$|E
5|$|On October11, 2015, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather traversed Central America {{and emerged}} over the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The disturbance moved slowly {{over the next few}} days, later merging with a tropical wave on October15. The merger of these systems and the effects of a concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event spurred the formation of a broad area of low pressure. This feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00:00UTC on October20; at this time the depression was situated roughly 205mi (335km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. A mid-level ridge to the north steered the depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing path.|$|E
5|$|Records of the {{bramble shark}} are fairly rare and {{originate}} from widely scattered locations in tropical and temperate waters worldwide, {{save for the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Most {{have come from the}} eastern Atlantic and western Indian Oceans, where its range extends from the North Sea and the British Isles to southern Mozambique, including the Mediterranean Sea. In the western Atlantic, this species is represented by a handful of specimens from Massachusetts, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tobago, Brazil, and Argentina. In the Indo-Pacific, it is known from Oman, India, southern Japan, southern Australia, New Zealand, and possibly Kiribati.|$|E

50|$|Hurricane, {{tropical}} cyclone, and typhoon {{are different}} {{names for the}} same phenomenon: a cyclonic storm system that forms over the oceans. It is caused by evaporated water that comes off {{of the ocean and}} becomes a storm. The Coriolis effect causes the storms to spin.74 mi/h km/h. Hurricane is used for these phenomena in the Atlantic and <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Oceans,</b> tropical cyclone in the Indian, and typhoon in the western Pacific.|$|R
5|$|The {{most notable}} cyclone {{of the season}} was Hurricane Gilbert, {{which at the time}} was the strongest Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record. The hurricane tracked through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico and caused devastation in Mexico and many island nations, particularly Jamaica. Its passage caused US$5billion in damage (1988 USD; $ USD) and more than 300deaths, mostly in Mexico. Hurricane Joan, striking Nicaragua as a Category4 hurricane, caused about US$2billion in damage (1988 USD; $ USD) and more than 200deaths. The hurricane crossed into the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> and was reclassified as Tropical Storm Miriam.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Arlene {{were from a}} cloud mass that {{developed}} in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> in early May1981. The system crossed Central America, and by the afternoon of May5, a low-level circulation was evident near Roatán, {{off the coast of}} Honduras. Convection was initially disorganized, preventing classification as a tropical cyclone. It was not until late on May6 that Dvorak satellite intensity estimates began on the system. Around that time, it is estimated it became a tropical depression, while located near the Cayman Island. It was a rare example of an Atlantic depression forming from a disturbance that originated in the eastern Pacific.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Emilia {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that crossed northern Central America into the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> on July 16. The system moved westward, developing a well-defined low pressure area about 525miles (850km) southwest of Acapulco by July 19. The next day, its forward motion had shifted to a slow north-northwest track, and with its convection continuing to organize around the low, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked on the potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Early on July 21, its thunderstorm activity organized enough for the NHC to classify it as Tropical Depression Six-E, located to the southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
