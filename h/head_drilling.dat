No friction elements (e.g., belts) of any kind are used, which assures a positive drive at all times and minimizes maintenance requirements. Gear <b>head</b> <b>drills</b> are intended for metalworking applications where the drilling forces are higher and the desired speed (RPM) is lower than that used for woodworking.|$|R

50|$|Geared <b>head</b> <b>drill</b> presses are {{commonly}} found in tool rooms and other commercial environments where a heavy duty machine capable of production drilling and quick setup changes is required. In most cases, the spindle is machined to accept Morse taper tooling for greater flexibility. Larger geared <b>head</b> <b>drill</b> presses are frequently fitted with power feed on the quill mechanism, with an arrangement to disengage the feed when a certain drill depth has been achieved or {{in the event of}} excessive travel. Some gear-head drill presses have the ability to perform tapping operations without the need for an external tapping attachment. This feature is commonplace on larger gear <b>head</b> <b>drill</b> presses. A clutch mechanism drives the tap into the part under power and then backs it out of the threaded hole once the proper depth is reached. Coolant systems are also common on these machines to prolong tool life under production conditions.|$|R

As the major breakthroughs {{were made in the}} development of high power permanent magnet frequency conversion motor, it is possible to develop the permanent-magnet motor direct drive top-driving drilling rig, so the efficiency of drilling can be improved. In this paper, the difficulties of deep drilling and existing problems of deep drilling rigs are analyzed, and direct drive permanent magnet motor top-driving drilling rig and its parameters and characteristics are introduced. The development of deep borehole permanent-magnet motor direct drive top-driving drilling rig accords with the requirements of drilling technology development and innovation concept, it is the development direction of deep core drill's renewal, will promote the development of geo-drilling technology...|$|R
