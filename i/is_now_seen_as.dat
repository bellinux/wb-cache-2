5|$|A {{significant}} change {{at this time}} was that players were no longer required {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, {{as it was in the}} early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than religion <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the primary reason for supporting Hibs, who draw most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder {{attends a}} parole hearing for Monte Propps, {{a serial killer}} he helped to {{apprehend}} in the late 1980s. Propps' method of killing involved brainwashing his kidnapped victims until {{they were willing to}} commit suicide by drowning; however he <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a model reformee and is released. Shortly afterwards, Mulder meets with Frank Black, who warns him of the dangers of the offender's freedom. The two visit the released man's halfway house, arriving shortly after his parole officer; inside they find Propps drowned in his bath. In an alley outside, they parole officer is also found dead, with the ouroboros symbol of the Millennium Group tattooed on her neck. A child in the alley momentarily speaks to Black with the voice of a demonic entity he recognises, warning of impending disaster.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called the Kuiper belt is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E

5|$|The NWOBHM {{triggered}} a renaissance in a stagnant rock genre, but took on heavy criticism for the excessive local media hype surrounding {{a legion of}} typically mediocre musicians. Detractors think that, unlike heavy metal of the preceding decades, their music was unoriginal and included no classic rock recordings. Nevertheless, these bands and their diverse output offered a blueprint that counterparts across the Western world would later emulate and expand. The collision of styles that characterised the NWOBHM <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> key to the diversification of heavy metal {{in the second half}} of the 1980s into various subgenres that came to the fore in the 1990s. The stardom of Def Leppard in the US provided a catalyst for the growth of glam metal, just as bands like Angel Witch, Witchfynde, Cloven Hoof and especially Venom generated the music, lyrics, cover art and attitude that sparked black metal in its various forms in Europe and America. Motörhead, Iron Maiden, Raven, Tank, Venom and other minor groups are viewed as precursors of speed metal and thrash metal, two subgenres which carried forward the crossover with punk, incorporating elements of hardcore while amplifying volume, velocity and aggressive tone.|$|E
5|$|This {{brings the}} issue of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture, and why it so {{immediately}} replaced the Oksywie culture. According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes, the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia (under King Berig) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores, followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids. Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region, and then, some years later (under King Filimer, the fifth one counting from Berig), continued their migration toward the Black Sea. This story, in the past dismissed, <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed. The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of culturally different (although related) people, who mixed with the Oksywie culture population, and being more advanced possibly dominated it (at least culturally) to some degree, is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD.|$|E

25|$|However, {{in recent}} times, his pontificate has been re-evaluated, and he <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a man who}} {{attempted}} to stand against the aristocratic domination of the papacy, who promoted a unified Italy under an imperial ruler, only to be murdered for his efforts.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{having done}} more than most and {{perhaps as much as}} was {{possible}} in the context, {{but the fact remains that}} it was not enough to deter the aggressors or ensure their defeat. Less equivocal was his rediscovery as a moderate and inclusive Conservative for the modern age, part of a 'one nation tradition'.|$|E

50|$|The fear of {{conservative}} {{women at the}} time was the burgeoning feminist movement taking root in women's colleges which would allegedly plant the idea in men's minds that because women <b>were</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> independent, they could shirk their economic duties as providers.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, the Orphan's Court of Philadelphia {{permitted}} {{the use of}} the Magee Trust Fund to establish a rehabilitation center, ruling that rehabilitation <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a dynamic form of convalescent care and that such service was consistent with the wishes of Anna Magee.|$|R
25|$|The Bregler Collection {{papers have}} changed the general {{perception}} of Eakins's departure from PAFA. It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> less of a case of Victorian authority (PAFA's Board) persecuting a heroic iconoclast (Eakins), and more as a conspiracy by his colleagues and personal enemies to engineer his ouster from PAFA and deliberately sabotage his reputation.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the Church on society has changed significantly during the last century. While the church was formerly {{considered to be a}} socially conservative force, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> leftist, and even radical. The Synod of bishops has, on several occasions, criticized the market economy sharply, and the Catechism calls repeatedly for moderation in private pursuits, for example, equating profiteering and exploitative practices with theft.|$|E
25|$|The Brut's {{significance}} <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{being in}} {{the fact that it was}} written by laymen, for laymen, and also that the latter portion, at least, was one of the first chronicles written in the English language; it also occasionally provides historical details not found in other contemporaries' writings. The Brut owned by the Mortimer family in the late fourteenth-century contained their view of their own genealogy (which they also traced back to King Arthur and Brutus).|$|E
50|$|The {{connections}} between this experiment {{and those of}} Pressey were obvious. Active responses by learners and helpful feedback on the activities <b>were</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> critical elements in any successful system of learning.

50|$|Excessive {{sexual desire}} even {{for your own}} wife <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> wrong.

25|$|The Irish general {{election}} of 1918 was {{that part of}} the 1918 United Kingdom {{general election}} which took place in Ireland. It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a key moment in modern Irish history because it saw the overwhelming defeat of the moderate nationalist Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP), which had dominated the Irish political landscape since the 1880s, and a landslide victory for the radical Sinn Féin party, which had never previously enjoyed significant electoral success. In Ulster, however, the Unionist Party was the most successful party.|$|E
25|$|Most {{mushrooms}} sold {{in supermarkets}} have been commercially grown on mushroom farms. The most popular of these, Agaricus bisporus, is considered safe {{for most people}} to eat because it is grown in controlled, sterilized environments. Several varieties of A.bisporus are grown commercially, including whites, crimini, and portobello. Other cultivated species available at many grocers include Hericium erinaceus, shiitake, maitake (hen-of-the-woods), Pleurotus, and enoki. In recent years, increasing affluence in developing countries {{has led to a}} considerable growth in interest in mushroom cultivation, which <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a potentially important economic activity for small farmers.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Eakins {{produced}} {{a number of}} large paintings which brought the portrait out of the drawing room and into the offices, streets, parks, rivers, arenas, and surgical amphitheaters of his city. These active outdoor venues allowed him to paint the subject which most inspired him: the nude or lightly clad figure in motion. In the process he could model the forms {{of the body in}} full sunlight, and create images of deep space utilizing his studies in perspective. Eakins also took a keen interest in the new technologies of motion photography, a field in which he <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an innovator.|$|E
