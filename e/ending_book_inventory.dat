40|$|Manual {{generation}} of a <b>book</b> <b>inventory</b> is time-consuming and tedious, while deployment of barcode and radio-frequency identification (RFID) management systems is costly and affordable only to large institutions. In this paper, we design {{and implement a}} mobile book recognition system for conveniently generating an <b>inventory</b> of <b>books</b> by snapping photos of a bookshelf with a smartphone. Since smartphones are becoming ubiquitous and affordable, our inventory management solution is cost-effective and very easy to deploy. Automatic and robust book recognition is achieved in our system {{using a combination of}} spine segmentation and bag-of-features image matching. At the same time, the location of each book is inferred from the smartphone’s sensor readings, including accelerometer traces, digital compass measurements, and WiFi signatures. This location information is combined with the image recognition results to construct a location-aware <b>book</b> <b>inventory.</b> We demonstrate the effectiveness of our book spine recognition and location estimation techniques in recognition experiments and in an actual mobile book recognition system.

These inventories, however, tend to withhold data of traditional interest to art history with their terse, formulaic, and minimal descriptions. Thus they have been somewhat marginalized. This essay recommends future approaches to these texts. By excavating generic conventions to detect underlying value systems, these inventories become quite voluble regarding medieval attitudes towards precious metalwork, vestments, and other liturgical objects. The approaches discussed here include issues of vocabulary, authorship, and formal convention; the mise-en-page and mise-en-livre of these texts; and their relationship with <b>book</b> <b>inventories...</b>|$|R

Otherwise a large number of false errors would get into the error-backlog because the <b>book</b> <b>inventory</b> is already zero as a consequence of issuing the handling unit as being empty before issuing all the consumption which refer to that specific handling unit.|$|R
