40|$|AbstractThe iron-matrix WC {{wearable}} composite {{reinforced with}} Tungsten Carbide (WC) particles was {{prepared by the}} method of <b>flux-cored</b> <b>wire</b> TIG <b>welding.</b> The microstructure and component of the hardfacing layer were investigated. The {{results indicate that the}} WC particles have been dissolved, but their shapes were not changed. The reaction and diffusion between WC and iron lead to form low melting point compound, which may be the main reason of the dissolving of WC grains in iron. Melting mode of the <b>flux-cored</b> <b>wire</b> and melting input heat affect the dissolving of WC grains. The small current TIG welding may reduce the dissolving of WC grains. The primary influences factor may be the being time and temperature of welding poor, and that affect elements diffusion accordingly. The elements diffusion affects the strength of the substrate directly. Seeking the best corresponding relation between the dissolving of WC and the substrate strength is the key to increase the wear resistance of the surface welded coating...|$|R

40|$|Particulate fume {{generation}} {{rates and}} fume composition have been measured {{for a range}} of continuous <b>wire</b> arc <b>welding</b> consumables as a function of power supply type. <b>Welding</b> <b>wires</b> considered included gas-shielded cored wires of the rutile-flux, basic-flux and metal core types, for joining structural steels; gas-shielded solid and <b>flux-cored</b> <b>wires</b> for stainless steel; and an open-arc surfacing wire. The range of power supply types used included conventional (transformer-rectifier) DC units, conventional (transistor switched) pulsed supplies as well as both low frequency and high frequency inverter-based power supplies. The inverter type power supplies were used in both the DC and pulsed modes. In all cases fume measurements were made at average welding currents at the low and high ends of the normal operating ranges. Significant decreases in fume formation rate, compared to that from conventional DC power supplies, were found for several combinations of power source and consumable type. The magnitude of these reductions depended on the particular power source/wire combination. For the cored joining wires for structural steels the reductions in fume formation rates were generally in the range 20 to 50 % with the most consistent reductions occurring with the conventional-pulsed and pulsed high frequency inverter supplies. Both the solid and cored wires for stainless steel also showed considerable reductions in fume generation rate with certain power supplies. Reductions of about 60 % compared to those from conventional DC power supplies were found from both stainless steel wire types with the most consistent reductions occurring with the conventional-pulsed power supply. Fume generation rates from the open-arc surfacing wire were found to be reduced by 30 to 50 % in some instances and again the most consistent reduction was with the conventional-pulsed supply. Chemical analyses of the collected fume indicated that in most instances power source type did not have a major influence on the chemical composition. This was certainly the case for the <b>flux-cored</b> <b>wires</b> for structural steel. However the results for the stainless steel and hardfacing wires suggested that the lowest hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) levels were achieved with the conventional DC power source...|$|R
