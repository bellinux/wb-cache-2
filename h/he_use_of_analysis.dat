50|$|George Edward Fox (born December 17, 1945) is a {{researcher}} at the University of Houston and, with Carl Woese in the early 1970s, was the first scientist to classify Archaea as a separate domain of life within the three-domain system. Fox and Woese also introduced the idea of a progenote as a primordial entity in the evolution of life. While with Woese, <b>he</b> pioneered <b>use</b> <b>of</b> comparative <b>analysis</b> in prediction <b>of</b> RNA secondary structure. <b>Using</b> comparative analysis, <b>he</b> also recognized the limitations that RNA sequences could provide when identifying closely related species. His research centers around understanding the early evolution of life. Fox contends that one of the earliest components of the genetic machinery to appear in a form bearing resemblance to its modern equivalent was the ribosome. His research is actively involved in the search for biosignatures on Mars.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{discussion}} of problems arising from the "Histories" and the "Life of Augustus Caesar" by Nicolaus. A discussion of the date {{and structure of the}} "Histories" is followed by an examination of the sources Nicolaus used and the way <b>he</b> <b>used</b> them. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> the Ctesias-based sections, with the help of Pap. Oxyrh. 2330, throws considerable light on Nicolaus' method of composition. He appears to have used only one source at a time. His selection concentrated on sensational and romantic stories. These were culled from both novelistic and sober historians. Nicolaus' adaptation consisted of linguistic remodelling and omission of elements inessential to the main story. The retention of some dialect forms of his sources, garbled condensations, and internal inconsistencies show that the "Histories" was not composed with great care. The biography of Augustus is treated next. It is argued that it was written about 25 BC in Rome and was the means by which Nicolaus gained the favour of Augustus and attention of Herod. Its ethos is Roman. Once again Nicolaus appears to have used one source at a time. The commonly-held view that most of {{it is based on the}} "Commentarii" of Augustus is confirmed, but it is suggested that a different source, probably the history of Asinius Pollio, underlies the digression on the conspiracy against Caesar. Nicolaus does little to alter the tone or arrangement of his source material, although he sometimes garbles details through careless condensation or misunderstanding. He has preserved a reasonably faithful account of Augustan propaganda which seems to belong to the period just before Actium: Augustus has toned down the crude call for vengeance of 44 BC, but has not yet adopted the posture of republican constitutionalism found in the "Res Gestae". Neither of the works shows evidence of the ability Nicolaus is known to have displayed in diplomacy and, perhaps, philosophy...|$|R
50|$|From 1971 onward Gottlieb {{used all}} {{traditional}} cytogenetic, ecological, morphological, and molecular techniques techniques as they became available to solve systematics problems, primarily within Clarkia and the Onagraceae {{as well as}} Stephanomeria and the Cichorieae. Isozymes were <b>used</b> during most <b>of</b> his career. It wasn't until 1986 that he applied a newer molecular technique: chloroplast DNA variation using Restriction fragment length polymorphism in determining the origin of Heterogaura from Clarkia, as well as clarifying species relationships in Clarkia. In these two papers Gottlieb and Systma confirmed previous phylogenic results found with earlier isozyme work, as well as exposing limitations of earlier phylogenetic models that only used morphology and reproductive isolation. Post 1986 he continued working with others <b>using</b> gene duplication <b>of</b> PGM in Clarkia and IDH in Layia (references above), including flavonoids in Stephanomeria. In this latter work he showed that the two progenitor-derivative species S. exigua ssp. coronaria and S. malheurensis were also nearly identical, concordant with earlier genetic studies. He continued work on the phylogeny <b>of</b> Clarkia, <b>using</b> restriction site mapping of chloroplast DNA and then in 1996 Ford and Gottlieb <b>using</b> nucleotide sequencing <b>of</b> the duplicated PGI genes further clarified Sections within Clarkia. In 2002 <b>he</b> <b>used</b> an <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> 18S-26S nuclear rDNA and its ITS and ETS sequences to further examine the phylogeny of Stephanomeria; in this he concluded that the annuals probably evolved more recently than the perennials, and further confirmed the progenitor-derived status of S. malheurensis. In 2006 he and others examined sequences of PgiC in Stephanomeria, and showed that it had more resolution for determining species differences than the earlier ITS/ETS results. In 2003 using 18S-26S nuclear rDNA ITS and ETS sequences he expanded his examination of the phylogeny of Stephanomeria to include all 24 North American genera within the tribe Cichorieae, and produced the first modern comprehensive phylogeny of the group. This work gave him the background for his contributions to the 2006 Flora of North America {{as well as his}} contributions to the The Jepson Manual in 2012, his last publication.|$|R
