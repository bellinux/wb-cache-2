40|$|Governments {{increasingly}} recognise {{the need}} for robust strategies to manage the links between service delivery agencies arrangements and the information and communications technology on which such initiatives depend. How do leading initiators of e-government projects ensure that initiatives complement each other? And, does effective delivery of flexible, integrated, user focused services depend on <b>centralised</b> <b>management</b> of information and communications technology? If so, how do proponents of e-government manage tensions between encouraging innovation and <b>centralising</b> <b>management?</b> This paper argues that focusing on the governance of information technology infrastructure reasserts whole-of-government strategies. This is reinforced by citizen demands for integrated services. E-government agendas are extended further by demands for more open, inclusive and community oriented government. The task of information technology infrastructure in government is then radically restated. It is to serve not only the whole of government but {{the whole of the}} community. However, tight governance of information and communications technology infrastructure will not mesh easily with demands for increased public participation...|$|R

The expansion led to a more <b>centralised</b> <b>management</b> of the detention estate whereas before the centres had largely been managed by the airports that they served.

In Vietnam, the main strategies have been <b>centralised</b> <b>management</b> by state agencies and private management by individual households. This article argues that the promotion of nationalisation or privatisation has not solved the problem of resource degradation and overexploitation, as illustrated by a case study of mangrove forest management in Giao Lac village. The article suggests a practical combination of three strategies: nationalisation, privatisation and community?based management in the context of Giao Lac Village, where the dyke system is managed by state agencies, shrimp ponds are managed at the household level, and mangrove forests are protected by the whole community...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Personal Network (PN) concept {{extends the}} Personal Area Network (PAN) by {{including}} remote personal nodes, such as nodes {{at home or}} in the office. This extension is achieved through dynamic tunnels established between the remote PN entities. Scalability presents a major challenge for tunnel management in PNs due to their dynamic nature and the increasing number of simultaneously supported PNs. To reduce the PN management complexity, this paper proposes to use a peer-to-peer-based publish/subscribe naming (PPNS) system. The PPNS system enables an automated provisioning of the location information in the tunnel endpoints. A <b>centralised</b> <b>management</b> approach is proposed for the on-demand PN establishment and a distributed management approach is proposed for the always-on PN establishmen...|$|R

To improve their coherence and management, these resources containing very diverse knowledge have to be unified. As Intuition is available in most of the European languages, the multilingual factor makes this unification more complex. To overcome the problems caused by the structural differences among languages, a new linguistic architecture has been designed and modelled using UML.

40|$|At {{the scale}} of the urban {{neighbourhood}} economies of scale make the local <b>centralised</b> <b>management</b> of resources (energy, water and waste) viable, with considerable environmental dividends. It is also possible to layout buildings to optimise their utilisation of natural resources (e. g. solar radiation and daylight) and to create a pleasant external microclimate. In essence, sustainable urban neighbourhoods are within our grasp. However, to achieve this potential one would ideally utilise an integrated model of the set of resource fluxes that is sensitive both to the urban microclimate and to human behaviour within buildings. This would also accommodate models of renewable and high efficiency energy technologies, both embedded and centralised. This paper describes the successful results of a project that was conceived to solve this non-trivial problem: Project SUNtool (Sustainable Urban Neighbourhood modelling tool) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{proliferation}} of the Internet {{in recent years}} has radically altered the landscape of network security. Despite continuing attempts by organisations to secure corporate networks, the high rate of successful network attacks have led to significant financial losses. This paper concerns the protection of virtual networks against network attack. The limitations of current security tools are outlined. Based on this analysis, a Distributed Cooperative Multi-layer Security Architecture (DCMSA) for virtual networks is proposed. The structure of the DCMSA is detailed and the advantages of this architecture are discussed. In short, the DCMSA provides distributed security enforcement combined with <b>centralised</b> <b>management.</b> Further, it uses the synergy of different security tools working together and multiple layers of defence to provide enhanced protection.

40|$|As {{demand for}} power {{increases}} {{in rural areas}} serviced by Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) networks, distribution issues are becoming increasingly evident. Voltage regulation and system capacity concerns are driving utilities toward using smarter compensation devices for network control {{in an attempt to}} provide longevity for aging SWER infrastructure. To date, despite increasing complexity in power delivery over SWER, no effective network monitoring solutions have been proposed. This paper examines the case for network monitoring and <b>centralised</b> <b>management</b> of smart compensation devices via Power Line Communications (PLC). After establishing advantages in network monitoring, regulation and maintenance for SWER networks, narrowband and broadband PLC issues are reviewed. The channel capacity of typical SWER conductors is then evaluated and compared to data throughput requirements derived from existing infrastructure to validate the applicability of developing PLC over SWER infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of using different decision-making frameworks in local energy systems (LES) through {{the assessment of the}} long-term equilibrium of energy players. For this purpose, the energy system is modelled through two levels of multi-energy player (MEP) and LES, coupled by energy price signals. The conflict between the decision-making of these two levels of players is modelled through a bi-level approach. A mathematical problem with equilibrium constraint is formulated by applying the duality theory, resorting to a linear representation of the constraints. The solution is found by using the CPLEX 12 solver. The numerical results show the characteristics of the MEP behaviour in different energy aggregation modes for the LES, with <b>centralised</b> <b>management</b> or uniform pricing. The MEP may find benefits from possible synergies among the LES due to availability of energy carriers with complementary characteristics...|$|R
