5|$|For the {{majority}} of its history the area now recognised as the Rhondda Valley was an exclusively Welsh speaking area. It was only in the early 20th century that English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse. In 1803, English historian Benjamin Heath Malkin mentioned while travelling through Ystradyfodwg, that he had only met one person with whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk,</b> and then {{with the help of an}} interpreter. This situation was repeated with John George Wood, who on his visit to the area complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were on times difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand. This dialect was once called 'tafodiaith gwŷr y Gloran' ('the dialect of the men of Gloran').|$|E
5|$|The Beatles first {{played a}} full show with Best on 17 August 1960 at the Indra club in Hamburg, {{and the group}} slept in the Bambi Kino cinema in a small, dirty room with bunk beds, a cold and noisy former {{storeroom}} directly behind the screen. Upon first seeing the Indra, where they were booked to play, Best remembered it as a depressing place filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller. As Best {{had been the only}} group member to study O-Level German at school, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> with the club's owner, Bruno Koschmider, and the clientele. After the Indra closed due to complaints about the noise, the group started a residency in the Kaiserkeller.|$|E
25|$|A more {{detailed}} Georgian government account was released later on August 30. According to it, the crisis had begun on August 28, when the armed group captured a patrol of the Border Police of Georgia {{who had been}} searching for the five missing local residents. The gunmen agreed to an offer by a senior border guard officer to keep just him as a hostage and to let go the civilians and the other border guards. Later, an official from the Georgian Interior Ministry arrived to negotiate and demanded their surrender, which was rejected. The group then decided to swap the last captive border guard for the official, telling him {{that he is now}} their hostage. Two of the gunmen then accompanied the official to a location where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> with his superiors to update them about the new developments, but instead they were led to an ambush site, where one of them was shot dead by a government sniper. The shooting sparked a firefight, in which 10 more members of the armed group and three Georgian troops were killed. Georgian forces used helicopters and aerial drones.|$|E

When Clark and Lana met in the cemetery, Clark {{realized that he had}} found someone who understood him, who <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to, even though it was not in as strong a way as he would have liked. Although Clark felt close to Lana, his fear that she would [...] "... kick him out of her life ..." [...] if she learned his secret— that he came in the meteor shower that killed her parents— was strong enough to keep him from becoming as close to her as he wished. The lack of honesty caused issues between them. Judge Byun wondered how this Clark Kent would have room in his heart for Lois Lane later in life, as he had bounced back and forth between Lana and Chloe in the first season.|$|E
500|$|Kaczynski {{attended}} Evergreen Park Community High School {{where he}} excelled academically. He played the trombone in the marching band {{and was a}} member of the math, biology, coin, and German clubs but was regarded as an outsider by his classmates. In 1996, a former classmate said: [...] "He was never really seen as a person, as an individual personality... He was always regarded as a walking brain, so to speak." [...] During this period, Kaczynski became intensely interested in mathematics, spending hours studying and solving advanced problems. He became associated with a group of likeminded boys interested in science and mathematics, known as the [...] "briefcase boys" [...] for their penchant for carrying briefcases. One member of this group recalled Kaczynski as [...] "the smartest kid in the class... just quiet and shy until you got to know him. Once he knew you, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> and talk." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{had been}} working on the {{screenplay}} notes for over a year {{at the time of his}} death. [...] "He was more inquisitive than anybody I ever knew. He was writing a screenplay about his life. He was interested in world affairs, sometimes he'd call me up late at night and discuss philosophy. I think he'll be remembered as a great man. He happened to make a living playing basketball but he was more than that. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> on any subject. He was a Goliath", said Sy Goldberg, Chamberlain's longtime attorney. When million-dollar contracts became common in the NBA, Chamberlain increasingly felt he had been underpaid during his career. A result of this resentment was the 1997 book Who's Running the Asylum? Inside the Insane World of Sports Today (1997), in which he harshly criticized the NBA of the 1990s for being too disrespectful of players of the past. Even far beyond his playing days, Chamberlain was a very fit person. In his mid-forties, he was able to humble rookie Magic Johnson in practice, and even in the 1980s, he flirted with making a comeback in the NBA. In the 1980–81 NBA season, coach Larry Brown recalled that the 45-year-old Chamberlain had received an offer from the Cleveland Cavaliers. When Chamberlain was 50, the New Jersey Nets had the same idea, and Chamberlain declined again. However, he would continue to epitomize physical fitness for years to come, including participating in several marathons.|$|E

2500|$|When the {{territorial}} ambitions of Italy towards Austria-Hungary were shattered Orlando’s {{government had to}} resign in June 1919. It {{was the end of}} Sonnino's political career and he did not participate in the elections in November 1919. Nominated senator in October 1920, he did not actively participate. Sonnino suddenly died on 24 November 1922 in Rome, suffering an apoplectic stroke. Known as the [...] "silent statesman of Italy" [...] <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> five languages fluently.

To stay in the country, he sought out a research position in stellar evolution with Professor Laughlin; the job proposition failed as the research team included an attractive woman, and Raj, who became drunk so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to her, made an inappropriate comment.

2500|$|Karl Benson, John [...] "Jack" [...] Matthias, and Daniel [...] "Dan" [...] Beckwith {{were three}} of the five {{children}} of Matthias Cole Landt, a foreman in the Lackawanna Woolen Mills in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Hulda Teresa Amena Benson Landt, who had immigrated to the United States from Sweden with her parents at the age of two. There were also two daughters, Edith and Mildred. They were a musical family. Matt sang and played guitar, Hulda was a contralto. The parents sang with and to their children, and the children learned to sing and harmonize together. Karl was said to be able to sing harmony before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> and became a boy soloist in the Lutheran Church choir. Matt was enamored of Thomas Edison's new phonographic technology and used wax cylinders to record his children singing. After leaving his job at the woolen mill, he sold Edison phonographs and was known as [...] "the Edison man," [...] until radio displaced phonographs in most homes.|$|E
2500|$|Nitya's {{persistent}} {{health problems}} had periodically resurfaced throughout this time. On 13 November 1925, at age 27, {{he died in}} Ojai from complications of influenza and tuberculosis. Despite Nitya's poor health, his death was unexpected, and it fundamentally shook Krishnamurti's belief in Theosophy and in {{the leaders of the}} Theosophical Society. He had received their assurances regarding Nitya's health, and had come to believe that [...] "Nitya was essential for [...] life-mission and therefore he {{would not be allowed to}} die," [...] a belief shared by Annie Besant and Krishnamurti's circle. Jayakar wrote that [...] "his belief in the Masters and the hierarchy had undergone a total revolution." [...] Moreover, Nitya had been the [...] "last surviving link to his family and childhood.... The only person to whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> openly, his best friend and companion." [...] According to eyewitness accounts, the news [...] "broke him completely." [...] but 12 days after Nitya's death he was [...] "immensely quiet, radiant, and free of all sentiment and emotion"; [...] "there was not a shadow... to show what he had been through." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his radio}} career, he {{performed}} entirely without scripts. His friend and WOR colleague Barry Farber marveled at how <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> so long {{with very little}} written down. Yet during a radio interview, Shepherd once claimed that some shows took several weeks to prepare, but this {{would probably have been}} in the thinking and outlining stage rather than in anything like a script. On most of his Fourth of July broadcasts, however, he would read one of his most enduring and popular short stories, [...] "Ludlow Kissel and the Dago Bomb that Struck Back," [...] about a neighborhood drunk and his disastrous fireworks escapades. In the 1960s and 1970s, his WOR show ran from 11:15pm to midnight, later changed to 10:15pm to 11pm, so his [...] "Ludlow Kissel" [...] reading was coincidentally timed to many New Jersey and New York local town fireworks displays, which would traditionally reach their climax at 10pm. It was possible, on one of those July 4 nights, to park one's car on a hilltop and watch several different pyrotechnic displays, accompanied by Shepherd's masterful storytelling.|$|E

2500|$|As {{historian}} Richard Beeman put it, Henry {{was a man}} who [...] "did {{not bother}} to write much of anything down", a handicap when being evaluated by history. The lack of primary source materials regarding Henry—only a handful of papers and a few of his speeches survive—has frustrated Henry's biographers from Wirt (1817) to Beeman (1974): Wirt commented two years before publishing his book, [...] "It is all speaking, speaking, speaking. 'Tis true he could talk—Gods! how <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk!</b> but... to make the matter worse, from 1763 to 1789... not [...] one of his speeches lives in print, writing or memory". Beeman, for his part, concluded, [...] "the Revolutionary firebrand, whatever his achievements, possessed a miserable sense of history". This was a deficiency not possessed by Jefferson, who not only survived Henry by a quarter century, but who got to fill the vacuum of information about Henry with his own recollections and opinions. Wirt did not print many of Jefferson's criticisms of Henry, which irritated the former president to such an extent he was still mentioning it to guests at Monticello in 1824. Nevertheless, Jefferson's negative assessments of Henry have sullied the latter's historical reputation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, racer Tim Bender was injured, and Bender's crew chief/car owner Robbie Reiser hired {{his former}} {{competitor}} and rival Kenseth to race for him despite having only one Busch start. Reiser said [...] "Matt and I {{used to have}} some fierce races against each other. I needed someone who understood race cars the way I understood them. I knew he could drive and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> {{to me in a}} manner I could understand." [...] Kenseth qualified third for the new team's first race. He was racing in third place in the final laps when he spun and finished eleventh. Kenseth qualified in 20th place for the next race at Talladega in his second time at a track big enough to have a significant draft. He passed thirteen cars to finish seventh. Kenseth had two Top 5 finishes during the partial season. The following year he raced full-time all season. He won his first Busch Series race on February 22, 1998, when he nudged leader Tony Stewart's car entering the final turn of the final lap, culmulating in a second- and third-place finishes in the Busch points. Kenseth drove the No. 17 Chevy.|$|E
2500|$|As World War II {{began to}} wind {{to a close}} in early 1945, Donovan {{began to focus on}} {{preserving}} the OSS beyond the end of the war. A February 19 article in the Washington Times-Herald revealed his plans for a postwar intelligence agency and published a secret memo he had sent to Roosevelt proposing its creation. The article compared the proposed agency to the Gestapo. Knowing that Americans wanted a smaller federal government after the war, Roosevelt was not entirely sold on Donovan's proposal, although Donovan felt reasonably confident <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> the president into the idea. J. Edgar Hoover disapproved of Donovan's plan, which he saw as a direct threat to FBI authority, even though Donovan had stressed that his agency would operate only abroad, not domestically. After Roosevelt's death in April, however, Donovan's political position was substantially weakened. Although he argued forcefully for the OSS's retention, he found himself opposed by the new president, Harry S. Truman. While the OSS got [...] "glowing reviews" [...] from many wartime commanders, notably Eisenhower, who described its contributions as [...] "vital", critics dismissed it as [...] "an arm of British intelligence" [...] and, like the Times-Herald reporter, painted dark pictures of it as an American Gestapo in the making.|$|E
