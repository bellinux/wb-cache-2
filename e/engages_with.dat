5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically <b>engages</b> <b>with</b> strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.|$|E

In the opening scene, Rihanna approaches a drum kit, which she plays as the song progresses. During {{the rest of the}} video, Rihanna <b>engages</b> <b>with</b> and plays with a variety of props, including a male extra, a zebra, a motorcycle and a stuffed lion; these scenes are intercut with scenes of Rihanna playing the drum kit. Rihanna wears a variety of outfits in the video, including a gold net bodysuit and a black and white zebra print catsuit, which she wears while sitting atop a stuffed zebra. Rihanna performs various 1990s dancehall dance moves, such as the Bogle.|$|E

50|$|To recapitulate, these ligands {{activate}} the NK, as we explained. However, before the activation, Killer Inhibition Receptors (KIRs) recognize certain molecules in the MHC class I of the hosted cell and get <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> them. These molecules {{are typical of}} healthy cells but some of these molecules are repressed in infected or transformed cells. For this reason when the hosted cell is really infected the proportion of KARs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> ligands is bigger than the proportion of KIRs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> MHC I molecules. When this happens the NK is activated and the hosted cell is destroyed. On the other hand, if there are more KIRs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> MHC class I molecules than KARs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> ligands, the NK isn't activated and the suspicious hosted cell remains alive. To conclude, we should add that each KAR has its specific KIR and they always work together. For instance, the C-type lectins receptors are inhibited by some CD94/NKG2 complex.|$|R

25|$|Shaping {{involves}} gradually {{modifying the}} existing behavior into the desired behavior. If the student <b>engages</b> <b>with</b> a dog by hitting it, then {{he or she}} could have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which he or she touches the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of operant conditioning principles and extinction. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks.|$|E

It was developed in the United States by Louis Brandeis and Roscoe Pound. It was influenced by the work of pioneer legal sociologists, such as the Austrian jurist Eugen Ehrlich and the Russian-French sociologist Georges Gurvitch.|$|E

25|$|As {{its title}} suggests, Cvetkovich's book is “organized as ‘an archive of feelings,'” and is “an {{exploration}} of cultural texts as repositories of feelings and emotions, which are encoded {{not only in}} the content of the texts themselves but in the practices that surround their production and reception.” According to Cvetkovich, archives of trauma resemble the archives of gay and lesbian cultures. Not only are ephemera, ephemerality, and memory fundamental to both of these archives, but both also challenge the very concept of the archive. Cvetkovich's sources – her archive – include oral interviews, performances, fiction, poetry, memoirs, photographs, and films. Theoretically, she <b>engages</b> <b>with</b> feminist, critical race, Marxist, and queer theory.|$|E
25|$|In I and Thou, Buber {{introduced}} his thesis on human existence. Inspired by Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity and Kierkegaard's Single One, Buber worked upon {{the premise of}} existence as encounter. He explained this philosophy using the word pairs of Ich-Du and Ich-Es to categorize the modes of consciousness, interaction, and being through which an individual <b>engages</b> <b>with</b> other individuals, inanimate objects, and all reality in general. Theologically, he associated the first with the Jewish Jesus and the second with the apostle Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus, a Jew). Philosophically, these word pairs express complex ideas about modes of being—particularly how a person exists and actualizes that existence. As Buber argues in I and Thou, a person is at all times engaged with the world {{in one of these}} modes.|$|E

He readily <b>engages</b> <b>with</b> them and speaks with remarkable candor {{on a wide variety}} of subjects – his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speaks of the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly subjected to cruel persecution and universal moral condemnation. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastassya Filippovna.|$|E

500|$|In an August 2009 {{piece for}} The Wire, {{journalist}} David Keenan coined [...] "hypnagogic pop" [...] while {{inspired by a}} comment made by James Ferraro. Keenan referred to a developing trend of 2000s lo-fi and post-noise music in which artists began to engage with elements of cultural nostalgia, childhood memory, and outdated recording technology. Around that time, a wave of retro-inspired home-recording artists had begun dominating underground indie scenes. Among the artists discussed in Keenan's article were Ferraro, Spencer Clark, Ariel Pink, Zola Jesus, Ducktails, Emeralds, and Pocahaunted. He employed the term [...] "hypnagogic" [...] as referring to the psychological state [...] "between waking and sleeping, liminal zones where mis-hearings and hallucinations feed into the formation of dreams." [...] According to Keenan, these artists began to draw on cultural sources subconsciously remembered from their 1980s and early 1990s adolescence while freeing them from their historical contexts and [...] "hom in on the futuristic signifiers" [...] of the period. He alternately summarized hypnagogic pop as [...] "pop music refracted through {{the memory of a}} memory" [...] and as [...] "1980's-inspired psychedelia" [...] which <b>engages</b> <b>with</b> capitalist detritus of the past in an attempt to [...] "dream of the future." ...|$|E
500|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics was {{reviewed}} by Garner for Environmental Values, and the philosophers Josh Milburn and Dan Hooley for the Political Studies Review and the Journal of Animal Ethics respectively. Garner lamented {{the absence of}} many of the key voices in the political theory literature on animal ethics—such as Cochrane, Donaldson and Kymlicka, O'Sullivan, Tony Milligan, Kimberly Smith or Garner himself—in the book, meaning that Political Animals and Animal Politics [...] "takes on the role of an observer of this debate rather than directly contributing to it in a leading sense". In addition, he felt that the book offered little consideration of the details of the work of these leading theorists, identifying the absence of discussion of Cochrane's interest-based rights approach, a superficial consideration of Regan's account of animal rights, an oversimplification of his own position and a lack of context to understand the respective work of Kimberly Smith and O'Sullivan. He considered Wisseburg's chapter to be the only one which <b>engages</b> <b>with</b> the debate about the political turn in general, but notes that Wissenburg's approach is a negative one; Garner considers this unsurprising, given that Wissenburg is a green political theorist with little sympathy for [...] "animal political theory".|$|E
