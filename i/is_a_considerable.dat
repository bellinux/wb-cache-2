5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E
5|$|Rescued by Rover {{contains}} more than twenty shots; this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> advance when compared with Hepworth's own How it Feels to be Run Over (1900), which contains a single shot. This not only made the film longer, but demonstrated that advances in film language could be made in editing as well as shooting. Additionally, the editing of Rescued by Rover is notable in its use of time contractions, which made Rover's journeys take considerably less time by portrayal {{than they would have}} in reality.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> {{photographic}} {{record of}} early Princes Street, largely {{thanks to the}} presence in the street of the studios of the Burton Brothers, pioneering New Zealand photographers. Many of their images, {{and those of other}} early Dunedin photographers, were collated and published in a series of books by photographic historian Hardwicke Knight, one of which — a collection of photographic works by Daniel Louis Mundy — was entitled Princes Street by gaslight (1977).|$|E

5|$|Special {{considerations}} {{have been}} given for contestants who were unable to return as champion because of circumstances beyond their control, especially when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> time between taping of episodes. This occurred {{for the first time}} in season 25, when Priscilla Ball, who won on January 16, 2009, was unable to attend the taping of the next episode because of illness; as a result, three new contestants appeared on the next episode. Ball returned as a co-champion to play on the episode airing April 9, 2009. On the episode aired December 21, 2015, the returning champion, Claudia Corriere, could not return as champion because of a job offered in the weeks between tapings, so three new contestants played that day as well. Corriere returned as a co-champion on the January 18, 2016, episode, but was eliminated in a three-way loss.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> {{amount of}} {{scholarship}} on Jinnah which stems from Pakistan; according to Akbar S. Ahmed, {{it is not}} widely read outside the country and usually avoids even the slightest criticism of Jinnah. According to Ahmed, some books published about Jinnah outside Pakistan mention that he consumed alcohol, but this is omitted from books published inside Pakistan. Ahmed suggests that depicting the Quaid drinking would weaken Jinnah's Islamic identity, and by extension, Pakistan's. Some sources allege he gave up alcohol {{near the end of}} his life. Yahya Bakhtiar, who observed Jinnah from close quarters, concluded that Jinnah was a very sincere, deeply committed and dedicated Mussalman.|$|E

25|$|While Yukon {{is mostly}} covered with forests, {{most of the}} trees are small and {{take a long time}} to grow and {{regenerate}} because of the dry cold climate. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> amount of small scale logging, but the only area that can sustain industrial forestry is in the southeast with its wetter climate. However, distance from markets and fluctuating prices have resulted in a boom-and-bust industry.|$|E

The building was a polygonal wooden building with three galleries surrounding an open yard. From {{one side of the}} polygon extended a thrust stage. The Theatre is said to have cost £700 to construct, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> sum for the age.|$|E

25|$|Perceptions of {{injustice}} and unfairness are significant antecedents and determinants of turnover intention (DeConinck & Stilwell, 2004; Nadiri & Tanova, 2010). In other words, turnover intention <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> outcome of an employee's fairness perceptions. Although all three dimensions of organizational justice {{may play a}} role in an employee’s intention to exit an organization, interactional and distributive justice are more predictive of turnover intention than procedural justice (Thomas & Nagalingappa, 2012).|$|E
25|$|Mining {{resources}} include lead, copper, chromium, and zinc, {{the reserves}} {{of which are}} almost exhausted. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> amount of lignite, however because its ash and sulfur ratios are high, it suitable only for industrial use. Magnesite, fire clay, gypsum, manganese, diatomite, marble, rock salt and perlite are also present. The few natural geothermal resources, except one, are not suitable for economic investments, and they are used as natural springs.|$|E
25|$|Providing {{water to}} rural {{residents}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> challenge as well. Lower population densities {{mean that the}} cost of water provision in rural areas is often higher than in urban areas, while lower incomes in many rural areas make it difficult for some customers to meet the full cost of high quality services. This decreases the likelihood that the private sector will be willing to engage into the rural water sector.|$|E
