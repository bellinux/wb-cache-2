40|$|Results of {{research}} {{influence of the}} modes of electron beam processing on structure and properties of P 6 M 5 <b>high-speed</b> cutting <b>steel</b> are presented in article. On the basis of pilot studies, the optimum mode of electron beam processing of <b>high-speed</b> cutting <b>steel</b> is chosen. It is experimentally defined that after electron beam processing the microhardness of P 6 M 5 <b>high-speed</b> cutting <b>steel</b> increases to 950 MPa and wear resistance increases to 1, 3 times in comparison with initial material. It is established that electron beam processing allows receiving the modified layer with a high hardness and high resistance to abrasive wear.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the friction surfacing of <b>high-speed</b> <b>steels,</b> BM 2, BT 15 and ASP 30 onto plain carbon steel plate. The events that the matrix and carbides experience as the coating material pass from the coating rod to the substrate, in forming the coating, is described. The coating is observed to harden automatically within a few seconds of being deposited onto the cold substrate. This autohardening is observed to be an inherent feature of the friction surfacing process and the only post-coating heat treatment required is tempering, as with traditionally hardened <b>high-speed</b> <b>steels.</b> The mechanism of autohardening is discussed in terms of the mechtrode/coating/substrate thermal system...|$|R

25|$|<b>High-speed</b> <b>steel</b> (HSS) {{is a form}} of tool steel; HSS bits {{are hard}} and much more {{resistant}} to heat than high-carbon steel.

25|$|In 19th-century {{machining}} practice, it was {{not uncommon}} to use plain water. This was simply a practical expedient to keep the cutter cool, regardless of whether it provided any lubrication at the cutting edge–chip interface. When one considers that <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel</b> (HSS) had not been developed yet, the need to cool the tool becomes all the more apparent. (HSS retains its hardness at high temperatures; other carbon tool steels do not.) An improvement was soda water (sodium bicarbonate in water), which better inhibited the rusting of machine slides. These options are generally not used today because more effective alternatives are available.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This work {{contains}} {{a detailed description}} of the kinetics of phase transformations during continuous heating from quenched state of HS 18 - 0 - 1 and HS 6 - 5 - 2 <b>high-speed</b> <b>steels.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The kinetics of phase transformations during continuous heating (tempering) from as-quenched state of investigated steel, was elaborated using a DT 1000 dilatometer of a French company Adamel. Findings: During heating of previously quenched HS 18 - 0 - 1 and HS 6 - 5 - 2 steel samples, the presence of four basic transformations was found, i. e. precipitation of ε carbide, precipitation of M 3 C, transformation of retained austenite and precipitation of alloy carbides of MC and M 2 C type. It was shown that in quenched <b>high-speed</b> <b>steels</b> a part of retained austenite transforms already during heating for tempering, but its significant part transforms only during cooling process after tempering. Research limitations/implications: The substitution of tungsten with molybdenum in HS 6 - 5 - 2 steel has influenced mainly the stability of retained austenite and the temperature of precipitation beginning of MC (MCs) type carbides.

25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center drill bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel</b> (HSS) twist drill bit) is a spotting drill bit (or a spot drill bit, as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting drill bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{reason for}} writing {{this paper was}} to {{describe}} the kinetics of phase transformations during continuous heating from quenched state. In this investigation two <b>high-speed</b> <b>steels</b> of the variable concentration of W and Mo were used. Moreover, the differences in hardness of samples of the investigated steels {{in relationship to the}} heating rate were evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: The kinetics of phase transformations during continuous heating (tempering) from as-quenched state of investigated steels, was elaborated using a DT 1000 dilatometer of a French company Adamel. The microstructure of investigations steels in as-quenched state were examined by a light microscope Axiovert 200 MAT, scanning electron microscope Hitachi 3500 N and transmission JEM 200 CX microscope. The measurements of hardness were performed with the Vickers HPO 250 apparatus. Findings: Change of heating rate during tempering has strong influence on the temperatures of beginnings and the ends of individual transitions {{as well as on the}} accompanying dilatation effects. It was shown that in quenched <b>high-speed</b> <b>steels</b> a part of retained austenite was already transforming during heating for tempering, but its significant part transformed only during cooling process after tempering. Research limitations/implications: It has been found that the substitution of tungsten with molybdenum in HS 6 - 5 - 2 steel has influenced mainly the stability of retained austenite and the temperature of precipitation beginning of MC (MCs) type carbides. Whereas the precipitation ranges of ε carbide and cementite in both steels are close.

50|$|Although molybdenum-rich <b>high-speed</b> <b>steels</b> such as AISI M1 {{have been}} used since the 1930s, {{material}} shortages and high costs caused by World War II spurred development of less expensive alloys substituting molybdenum for tungsten.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of tool <b>steels</b> and <b>high-speed</b> <b>steels</b> {{has led to}} a significant increase in alloy additions, such as Co, Cr, Mo, N, V, and W. Knowledge about the phase relations in these multicomponent alloys, that is, the relative stability between different carbides or the solubility of different elements in the carbides and in the matrix phase, is essential for understanding the behaviour of these alloys in heat treatments. This information is also the basis for improving the properties or designing new alloys by controlling the amount of alloying elements. Thermodynamic calculations together with a thermodynamic database is a very powerful and important tool for alloy development of new tool <b>steels</b> and <b>high-speed</b> <b>steels.</b> By thermodynamic calculations one can easily predict how different amounts of alloying elements influence on the stability of different phases. Phase fractions of the individual phases and the solubility of different elements in the phases can be predicted quickly. Thermodynamic calculations {{can also be used to}} find optimised processing temperatures, e. g. for different heat treatments. Combining thermodynamic calculations with kinetic modelling one can also predict the microstructure evolution in different processes such as solidification, dissolution heat treatments, carbide coarsening, and the important tempering step producing secondary carbides. The quality of predictions based on thermodynamic calculations directly depends on the accuracy of the thermodynamic database used. In the present work new experimental phase equilibria information, both in model alloys containing few elements and in commercial alloys, has been determined and was used to evaluate and improve the thermodynamic description. This new experimental investigation was necessary because important information concerning the different carbide systems in tool <b>steels</b> and <b>high-speed</b> <b>steels</b> were lacking. A new thermodynamic database for tool <b>steels</b> and <b>high-speed</b> <b>steels,</b> TOOL 05, has been developed within this thesis. With the new database it is possible to calculate thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria with high accuracy and good reliability. Compared with the previous thermodynamic description the improvements are significant. In addition the composition range of different alloying elements, where reliable results are obtained with the new thermodynamic database, have been widened significantly. As the available kinetic data did not always predict results in agreement with new experiments the database was modified in the present work. By coupling the new thermodynamic description with the new kinetic description accurate diffusion simulations can be performed for carbide coarsening, carbide dissolution and micro segregation during solidification.
