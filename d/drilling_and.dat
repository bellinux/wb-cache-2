5|$|Born into {{a musical}} family, Smith taught herself {{to play the}} piano and later became a classically trained musician. Earning a {{teaching}} degree, she began publishing music compositions for children using the philosophy of Friedrich Fröbel, advocating for less memorization and <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> more attention to intuitive appreciation of music. Studying composition and voice in Germany, she also toured the country observing choirs and their teaching techniques.|$|E
5|$|By {{complexity}} of technology: In situ technologies are usually classified either as true in situ processes or modified in situ processes. True in situ processes {{do not involve}} mining or crushing the oil shale. Modified in situ processes involve <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> fracturing the target oil shale deposit to create voids in the deposit. The voids enable a better flow of gases and fluids through the deposit, thereby increasing the volume {{and quality of the}} shale oil produced.|$|E

5|$|Geothermal {{electric}} {{plants were}} traditionally built {{exclusively on the}} edges of tectonic plates where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface. The development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> extraction technology enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range. Demonstration projects are operational in Landau-Pfalz, Germany, and Soultz-sous-Forêts, France, while an earlier effort in Basel, Switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes. Other demonstration projects are under construction in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.|$|E
5|$|The Showa Station is Japan's main {{research}} station in Antarctica. A {{vast array of}} research is conducted there, including upper atmosphere physics, meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy/mapping, oceanography, glaciology, geology, marine and terrestrial biology, and medical research. Japan's other station, Dome Fuji Station was opened {{as part of a}} major ice-coring project. It mainly studies climate change and conducts deep <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> atmospheric observations.|$|E
5|$|Underground mine shafts, some {{reaching}} depths over , {{were created}} for the extraction of metal ores. Borehole <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> derricks were used to lift brine to iron pans where it was distilled into salt. The distillation furnaces were heated by natural gas funneled to the surface through bamboo pipelines. Dangerous amounts of additional gas were siphoned off via carburetor chambers and exhaust pipes.|$|E

5|$|Underwater {{noise from}} shipping, <b>drilling,</b> <b>and</b> other human {{activities}} {{is a significant}} concern in some key killer whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs killer whales along with other marine mammals. Killer whales are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behavior, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.|$|E
5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> filling of the voids produced.|$|E
5|$|Between 1897 and 1900 Pound {{attended}} Cheltenham Military Academy, {{sometimes as}} a boarder, where he specialized in Latin. The boys wore Civil War-style uniforms and besides Latin were taught English, history, arithmetic, marksmanship, military <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> {{the importance of}} submitting to authority. Pound made his first trip overseas in mid-1898 when he was 13, a three-month tour of Europe {{with his mother and}} Frances Weston (Aunt Frank), who took him to England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. After the academy he may have attended Cheltenham Township High School for one year, and in 1901, aged 15, he was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania's College of Liberal Arts.|$|E

5|$|Fluor diversified its {{business}} more extensively in 1967, when five companies were merged into a division called Coral <b>Drilling</b> <b>and</b> it started a deep-water oil exploration business in Houston called Deep Oil Technology. It also created Fluor Ocean Services in Houston in 1968 and acquired {{an interest in}} other fossil fuel operations in the 1970s. Fluor acquired a construction company, Pike Corp. of America and the engineering division of its prior partner in Australia, Utah Construction. In 1972, Fluor bought land in Irvine, California and started building its new headquarters on it. The following year, the company's oil and gas operations were consolidated under a new entity, Fluor Oil and Gas Corp.|$|E
5|$|Phases 3 and 4 {{will extend}} the line south from 63rd Street to Houston Street and Hanover Square, respectively. As part of Phase 3, a {{connection}} to the IND 63rd Street Line would be built, allowing for non-revenue moves into Queens. This connection will be constructed through underground <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> blasting. Bellmouths already exist for this connection east of the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station. This section, {{like the rest of the}} line, will mainly consist of a two-track line. However, between 21st Street and 9th Street, two additional tracks will be constructed on either side of the main alignment to allow for the storage of eight trains. This location was selected due to the sufficient depth of the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) or spark erosion process has become widely used in mould making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes {{that are difficult to}} machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that no heat treatment is required. Changes to a hardened mould by conventional <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> milling normally require annealing to soften the mould, followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the mould surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed in paraffin oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and mould causes spark erosion of the mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.|$|E

5|$|At the Union of 1707 England {{had about}} five times the {{population}} of Scotland, and about 36 times as much wealth, however, Scotland began to experience the beginnings of economic expansion that would begin {{to allow it to}} close this gap. Contacts with England led to a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. <b>Drilling</b> <b>and</b> sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep. However, although some estate holders improved {{the quality of life of}} their displaced workers, enclosures led to unemployment and forced migrations to the burghs or abroad.|$|E

New farm buildings, often based on designs in patterns books, replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep.
