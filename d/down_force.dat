25|$|Caterhams {{have very}} poor {{aerodynamics}} {{due to the}} blunt windscreen, open-wheel design, and open cockpit. At very high speeds, lift becomes a problem. To combat this, the CSR has several features that reduce lift by 50%. The front cycle wings are fitted closer to the tires to reduce turbulence. In addition, they have a small lip that angles air upward and creates {{a small amount of}} <b>down</b> <b>force.</b> Also, the new front suspension scheme reduces turbulence and drag formerly caused by the spring and damper units. The biggest enhancement is the vent added on top of the nose cone. On previous Caterhams, the air from the radiator caused turbulence by knocking against the engine and other parts on the underside. A plastic panel behind the radiator now directs air straight out through the vent, creating <b>down</b> <b>force</b> and reducing turbulence.|$|E
500|$|The {{spermaceti}} organs {{may also}} help adjust the whale's buoyancy. It is hypothesized that before the whale dives, cold water enters the organ, {{and it is likely}} that the blood vessels constrict, reducing blood flow, and, hence, temperature. The wax therefore solidifies and reduces in volume. The increase in specific density generates a <b>down</b> <b>force</b> of about [...] and allows the whale to dive with less effort. During the hunt, oxygen consumption, together with blood vessel dilation, produces heat and melts the spermaceti, increasing its buoyancy and enabling easy surfacing. However, more recent work has found many problems with this theory including the lack of anatomical structures for the actual heat exchange.|$|E

500|$|The {{remnants}} of the convoy steamed on to meet the four minesweepers and seven motor minesweepers of the 17th Minesweeper Flotilla of the Malta Escort Force at 14:30. Melbourne Star, Port Chalmers and Rochester Castle reached Grand Harbour at Valletta at 16:30, where Operation Ceres, the immediate unloading of the ships began. Another air attack at dusk by 14 Ju 87s, sank Dorset but when the main body was within [...] of Malta, 18 Ju 88s were recalled {{in the face of}} 407 Spitfire sorties from the island. Penn tried to tow Ohio but the tanker was listing and snapped the tow line and in a later attack, a bomb hit the same area as a previous torpedo hit and broke Ohios keel. The last ship to arrive, Brisbane Star evaded a U-boat and managed to steam at [...] despite the damage to its bows. Off Tunisia, Brisbane Star was attacked by two SM.79 torpedo bombers, whose torpedoes turned out to be duds. The ship evaded Italian MAS boats; it was then boarded by the Sousse harbour master, who tried to impound the vessel until persuaded to relent and let the ship sail on after dark. Ledbury was attacked by two SM.79s but shot them <b>down.</b> <b>Force</b> X had turned for Gibraltar at 16:00 with the cruisers Charybdis, Kenya and five destroyers and Fliegerkorps II made a maximum effort against the force, which made it easier for the remaining merchant ships to reach Malta. Force X was attacked by 35 Ju 88s and 13 Ju 87s, achieving only a near-miss on Kenya for a loss of one Ju 88 and one Stuka. The Regia Aeronautica attacked with 15 bombers and 20 torpedo-bombers for no loss and during the afternoon, Force X met Force Z, the ships being attacked by aircraft, submarines and light craft and Foresight was scuttled by Tartar when it could no longer sail. Eskimo and Somali, carrying survivors from Manchester were the last to reach Gibraltar at 17:30 on 15 August.|$|E

2500|$|Ford {{planned to}} {{introduce}} another limited edition Torino {{to once again}} dominate at NASCAR. The result was the 1970 Ford Torino King Cobra. Like the Talladega, the King Cobra was modified with aerodynamics specifically in mind and looked very different from a typical 1970 Torino. It had a sloped front end with dual headlamps located in sugar scoop shaped cut-outs on the front fenders, similar in appearance to the Datsun 240Z. The King Cobra's grille was a large opening below the front bumper, much like the bottom breather design now used in some modern cars. Parking lamps were located between the headlamps, molded into the front fascia. The hoods had a blacked-out center portion, and a side stripe similar to 1968-69 Torino GTs ran from the front fender to quarter panel. Ford planned to offer covers for the headlight cutouts to NASCAR teams to improve aerodynamics even further. [...] In actuality it is said the front end created too much <b>down</b> <b>force.</b> [...] In addition to no rear <b>down</b> <b>force</b> creation this caused the car to become very loose in turns as per Musclecar Review.|$|E

2500|$|The {{data was}} {{interpreted}} as representing {{a form of}} in-situ extrusion where the tool, backing plate and cold base material form the [...] "extrusion chamber" [...] through which the hot, plasticised material is forced.

After the material has passed the probe [...] the side pressure exerted by the [...] "die" [...] forces the material back together and consolidation of the join occurs as the rear of the tool shoulder passes overhead and the large <b>down</b> <b>force</b> forges the material.|$|E
