500|$|Digging in swamps {{was more}} complicated; a longer spear (up to 8m) was often used, often {{fitted with a}} <b>hooked</b> <b>end</b> to scoop out the lumps. Scrub was often cleared first with fire; some got {{out of control and}} swamp fires could burn for weeks. Holes were often dug by teams in both hills and swamps—often up to 12m deep—and some {{wetlands}} were drained to aid in the excavation of gum. As field gum became scarce, [...] "bush gum" [...] was obtained by purposely cutting the bark of kauri trees and returning months later to retrieve the hardened resin. Due to the damage caused to the trees by the cutting the practice was banned in state forests in 1905. Gum chips, small lumps useful for the manufacture of linoleum, were difficult to find, and by 1910, the process of washing and sieving to retrieve the chips became common. The process was later mechanised.|$|E

60|$|The gentleman {{addressed}} in these latter words was a dark-complexioned man, inclining indeed to sallow, with long thick black hair, and very evident inclinations (although {{he was close}} shaved) of a stiff beard, and whiskers of the same deep shade. His age {{did not appear to}} exceed thirty, though many at first sight would have considered him much older, as his face was long, and very pale, from the constant application of stage paint. He wore a checked shirt, an old green coat with new gilt buttons, a neckerchief of broad red and green stripes, and full blue trousers; he carried, too, a common ash walking-stick, apparently more for show than use, as he flourished it about, with the <b>hooked</b> <b>end</b> downwards, except when he raised it for a few seconds, and throwing himself into a fencing attitude, made a pass or two at the side-scenes, or at any other object, animate or inanimate, that chanced to afford him a pretty good mark at the moment.|$|E

50|$|A more {{specific}} example {{comes in the}} form of a piano key made from injection moulded styrene acrylonitrile (SAN).

Some time after this cleaning, fracture occurred at the junction where the <b>hook</b> <b>end</b> meets the spring.|$|R
