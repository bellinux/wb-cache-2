25|$|One of {{his drawing}} pupils was Margaret Lindsay, eldest {{daughter}} of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick and Amelia Murray (granddaughter to David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont and sister to the naval officer John Lindsay). He later eloped {{with her and}} on 1 March 1752 they married in the Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh; her father never forgave her for marrying an artist. Ramsay already had to maintain a daughter from his previous marriage and his two surviving sisters, but told Sir Alexander that he could provide Margaret with an annual income of £100. He said it would increase ‘as my affairs increase, and I thank God, {{they are in a}} way of increasing’ and that his only motive for the marriage was ‘my love for your Daughter, who, I am sensible, is entitled to much more than ever <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> to bestow upon her’. Three children survived from their long and happy marriage, Amelia (1755–1813), Charlotte (1758–1818?), and John (1768–1845).|$|E

500|$|The tactic {{continued}} {{to be used in}} the next game by Voce (Larwood and Bowes did not play in this game), against New South Wales, for whom Jack Fingleton made a century and received several blows in the process. Bradman again failed twice, and had scored just 103 runs in six innings against the touring team; many Australian fans were now worried by Bradman's form. Meanwhile, Jardine wrote to tell Fender that his information about the Australian batting technique was correct and that it meant he was having to move more and more fielders onto the leg side: [...] "if this goes on <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> to move the whole bloody lot to the leg side." ...|$|E

500|$|Kelly's first post-Messengers solo {{release was}} the live double CD Live, May 1992, {{released}} in November 1992. AllMusic's Brett Hartenbach noted that Kelly's band had fleshed out his {{songs in the}} studio, {{but he was still}} able to show [...] "his vignettes of life, love, and the underbelly of both have plenty of power on their own". Kelly had relocated to Los Angeles and signed with Vanguard Records to tour the US as a solo artist. While in Los Angeles he produced fellow Australian Renée Geyer's album Difficult Woman (1994). Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and wrote a collection of lyrics, aptly titled Lyrics, which opens with a quote from Anton Chekhov: [...] "I don't have what you would call a philosophy or coherent world view so <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> to limit myself to describing how my heroes love, marry, give birth, die and speak." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{courtesy}} and chivalry of Crillon attracted much admiration {{during his lifetime}} and afterwards. As the English anecdotist William Seward put it in 1798, [...] "Courtesy, no less than courage, was always the appenage {{of the family of}} Crillon". During the siege of Gibraltar, he sent his English opponent General George Eliott a gift of fruits, vegetables and game, along with some ice, which he presumed [...] "will not be disagreeable in the excessive heat of this climate at this season of the year." [...] He expressed his [...] "pleasure to which I look forward of becoming your friend, after <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> learned to render myself worthy of the honour, by facing you as an enemy." [...] Five years later, when his old adversary Eliott was promoted to the peerage and became Lord Heathfield, Crillon wrote to his [...] "dear and respectable enemy", whom he now considered a friend, to offer his congratulations.|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{immediately}} {{prepared for}} battle, repeating a sentiment he had expressed {{at the battle}} of Cape St Vincent that [...] "Before this time tomorrow, <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> gained a peerage or Westminster Abbey." [...] It was late by the time the British arrived and the French, anchored in a strong position with a combined firepower greater than that of Nelson's fleet, did not expect them to attack. Nelson however immediately ordered his ships to advance. The French line was anchored close to a line of shoals, in the belief that this would secure their port side from attack; Brueys had assumed the British would follow convention and attack his centre from the starboard side. However, Captain Thomas Foley aboard [...] discovered a gap between the shoals and the French ships, and took Goliath into the channel. The unprepared French found themselves attacked on both sides, the British fleet splitting, with some following Foley and others passing down the starboard side of the French line.|$|E

500|$|The imposed {{regimen of}} asylum life gave van Gogh a hard-won stability: [...] "I feel happier {{here with my}} work than I could be outside. By staying here a good long time, <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> learned regular habits {{and in the long}} run the result will be more order in my life." [...] While his time at Saint-Rémy forced him to manage his vices, such as coffee, alcohol, poor eating habits and {{periodic}} attempts to consume turpentine and paint, his stay was not ideal. [...] He needed to obtain permission to leave the asylum grounds. The food was poor; he generally ate only bread and soup. [...] His only apparent form of treatment were two-hour baths twice a week. During his year there, van Gogh had periodic attacks, possibly due to a form of epilepsy. By early 1890, when the attacks worsened, he concluded that his stay at the asylum was not helping him to recover, which led him to move to Auvers-sur-Oise just north of Paris in May 1890.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterwards, George's wife Caroline died on 20 November 1737 (O.S.). He {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by her death, {{and to the}} surprise of many displayed [...] "a tenderness of which the world thought him before utterly incapable". On her deathbed she told her sobbing husband to remarry, to which he replied, [...] "Non, j'aurai des maîtresses!" [...] (French for [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> mistresses!"). It was common knowledge that George had already had mistresses during his marriage, and he had kept Caroline informed about them. Henrietta Howard, later Countess of Suffolk, had moved to Hanover with her husband during the reign of Queen Anne, and she had been one of Caroline's women of the bedchamber. She was his mistress from before the accession of George I until November 1734. She was followed by Amalie von Wallmoden, later Countess of Yarmouth, whose son, Johann Ludwig von Wallmoden, may have been fathered by George. Johann Ludwig was born while Amalie was still married to her husband, and George did not acknowledge him publicly as his own son.|$|E
500|$|One of the family's keenest {{customers}} was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch, later Bosvile, {{a wealthy}} collector from Lincolnshire, who bought several specimens from them. In 1820 Birch became {{disturbed by the}} family's poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, {{they were at the}} point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent. So he decided to auction the fossils he had purchased from them on their behalf. He wrote to the palaeontologist Gideon Mantell on 5 March that year to say that the sale was [...] "for the benefit of the poor woman and her son and daughter at Lyme, who have in truth found almost all the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... I may never again possess what I am about to part with, yet in doing it <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied." [...] The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised £400 (worth the equivalent of over £26,000 in 2010). How much of that was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family's profile within the geological community.|$|E

500|$|In the {{expectation}} of a siege, the castle garrison was increased to around 800 soldiers; the avenue of trees outside the castle gates were cut down, and neighbouring buildings destroyed to avoid them being used by Parliamentary forces. Large amounts of food were brought in to support the growing castle community, which also included {{a number of the}} wider Herbert family and other regional Royalist leaders who had sought shelter there. The first Parliamentary army arrived in early June, under the command of Colonel Morgan and Sir Trevor Williams. After several calls for the castle to surrender, a siege ensued, lasting through the summer months. In August, additional Parliamentary forces under General Fairfax arrived, and calls for the castle to surrender were renewed. Fairfax's men began to dig trenches towards the castle, and used these to move mortars forward, probably including the famous [...] "Roaring Meg", bringing the interior of the castle into artillery range. Facing a hopeless situation, the Marquess surrendered the castle on 19 August on relatively generous terms for the garrison. The Marquess himself was arrested and sent to Windsor Castle, where he died shortly afterwards. Informed shortly before his death that Parliament had granted his request to be buried in the family vault at Windsor, the Marquess remarked; [...] "Why then <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> a better castle when I am dead, than they took from me when alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{ordered the}} fleet {{to slow down}} at 16:00 to allow his ships to rig [...] "springs" [...] on their anchor cables, a system of {{attaching}} the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed his ships to swing their broadsides to face an enemy while stationary. It also increased manoeuvrability and therefore reduced the risk of coming under raking fire. Nelson's plan, shaped through discussion with his senior captains during the return voyage to Alexandria, was to advance on the French and pass down the seaward side of the van and centre of the French line, so that each French ship would face two British ships and the massive Orient would be fighting against three. The direction of the wind meant that the French rear division {{would be unable to}} join the battle easily and would be cut off from the front portions of the line. To ensure that in the smoke and confusion of a night battle his ships would not accidentally open fire on one another, Nelson ordered that each ship prepare four horizontal lights at the head of their mizzen mast and [...] hoist an illuminated White Ensign, which was different enough from the French tricolour {{that it would not be}} mistaken in poor visibility, reducing the risk that British ships might fire on one another in the darkness. As his ship was readied for battle, Nelson held a final dinner with Vanguards officers, announcing as he rose: [...] "Before this time tomorrow <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> gained a peerage or Westminster Abbey," [...] in reference to the rewards of victory or the traditional burial place of British military heroes.|$|E
500|$|At the {{invitation}} of his cousin John Amory Lowell, James Russell Lowell was asked to deliver a lecture at the prestigious Lowell Institute. Some speculated the opportunity {{was because of the}} family connection, offered as an attempt to bring him out of his depression. Lowell chose to speak on [...] "The English Poets", telling his friend Briggs that he would take revenge on dead poets [...] "for the injuries received by one whom the public won't allow among the living". The first of the twelve-part lecture series was to be on January 9, 1855, though by December, Lowell had only completed writing five of them, hoping for last-minute inspiration. His first lecture was on John Milton and the auditorium was oversold; Lowell had to give a repeat performance the next afternoon. Lowell, who had never spoken in public before, was praised for these lectures. Francis James Child said that Lowell, whom he deemed was typically [...] "perverse", was able to [...] "persist in being serious contrary to his impulses and his talents". While his series was still in progress, Lowell was offered the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages at Harvard, a post vacated by Longfellow, at an annual salary of $1,200, though he never applied for it. The job description was changing after Longfellow; instead of teaching languages directly, Lowell would supervise the department and deliver two lecture courses per year on topics of his own choosing. Lowell accepted the appointment, with the proviso that he should have a year of study abroad. He set sail on June 4 of that year, leaving his daughter Mabel in the care of a governess named Frances Dunlap. Abroad, he visited Le Havre, Paris, and London, spending time with friends including Story, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Leigh Hunt. Primarily, however, Lowell spent his time abroad studying languages, particularly German, which he found difficult. He complained: [...] "The confounding genders! If I die <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> engraved on my tombstone that I died of der, die, das, not because I caught them but because I couldn't." ...|$|E

500|$|Once {{the team}} arrived in Australia, Jardine quickly alienated the press {{by refusing to}} give team details before a match and being {{uncooperative}} when interviewed by journalists. The press printed some negative stories as a result and the crowds barracked as they had done on his previous tour, which made him angry. Jardine still wore his Harlequin cap and began the tour well with 98 and 127 before the first Test. Once again, he clashed with paceman Bill Bowes, refusing to give his bowler the requested field placings in an early match. As a result, Bowes deliberately gave away easy runs {{in an attempt to}} get his way, but following a discussion, Bowes was converted to Jardine's tactics and ultimately to his ability as a captain. In a tour match, Jardine also instructed Hammond to attack the bowling of Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, whom he considered dangerous and thus did not want him to play in the Tests. Up until this point, there had been little unusual about the English bowling except the number of fast bowlers. Larwood and Voce were given a light workload in the early matches by Jardine. This changed in the match against an Australian XI, from which Jardine rested himself, where the bowlers first used the tactics that {{came to be known as}} Bodyline. Under the captaincy of Wyatt, the bowlers bowled short and around leg stump, with fielders positioned close by on the leg side to catch any deflections. Wyatt later claimed that this was not planned beforehand and he simply passed on to Jardine what happened after the match. These tactics continued in the next match; several players were hit. Many commentators criticised this style of bowling; although bowlers had previously used leg theory bowling, where bowlers bowled outside leg stump with a concentration of fielders on the leg side, using these tactics with fast bowlers dropping the ball short was almost unprecedented. It was seen as dangerous and against the spirit of the game. In a letter, Jardine told Fender that his information about the Australian batting technique was correct and that it meant he was having to move more and more fielders onto the leg side. He said that [...] "if this goes on <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> to move the whole bloody lot to the leg side." [...] Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with Warner over Bodyline as the tour progressed, but his tactics were successful in one respect: in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests, Bradman had scored only 103 runs, causing concern among the Australian public who expected much more from him.|$|E
