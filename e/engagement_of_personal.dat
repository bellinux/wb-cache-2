40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} fields of memory studies and video game studies. As a result, it proposes the concept of virtual {{communicative}} memory to encapsulate the special form of memory that can be produced by player interaction with video games. As an instance of modern media, video games bring the added dimensions of player agency, <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> values and ethical sensibilities of the players, and shared experience of simulated historical environments. These factors justify {{the investigation of the}} memory-making potential of video games. To explore the feasibility of the proposed theoretical development, the thesis presents an analysis of the game Company of Heroes 2 (Relic Entertainment, 2013). In this analysis, the dominant historical themes of the game are fleshed out and the memory making potential of the game is evaluated with a view to virtual communicative memory. The thesis also contains the results of empirical research carried out during the summer of 2016 in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The research was designed to explore player engagement with the game and the process by which players negotiate the meaning potentials and historical themes contained in the game. This research provides some support for the concept of virtual communicative memory and points to numerous further research avenues, {{such as the use of}} video games in education...|$|E

In this application area SST is used to measure second by second changes in brain activity associated {{with a wide range of}} communication media. By measuring brain activity at a number of scalp locations it is possible to estimate second by second changes in a number of relevant psychological parameters including, Long-term Memory Encoding, <b>Engagement</b> (sense <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> relevance), Motivational Valence (whether the material attracts or repels the viewer) as well as Emotional Intensity (arousal) and Visual Attention. Research indicates that a major SST indicator of advertising effectiveness is the level of long-term memory encoding of the key message or the brand in the advertisement.|$|R
40|$|Background: Stress {{may affect}} the sense of {{wellbeing}} and academic achievement of university students. Aim: To assess the relationship <b>of</b> academic <b>engagement</b> and burnout with academic achievement among first year medical students. Material and Methods: The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-Student and Maslach Burnout Inventory Student Survey (MBI-SS) were applied to 277 first year medical students of four universities. Their results were correlated with the grades obtained in the different courses. Results: Moderately high engagement and low burnout levels were detected. There was {{a high level of}} satisfaction with studies and a moderate exhaustion level. Academic achievement was associated with the degree <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> with studies but not with burnout. Conglomerate analysis detected a group of students with high levels of wellbeing, characterized by high levels <b>of</b> academic <b>engagement</b> and low burnout. Other group had moderate levels <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> and lack <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> fulfilment. Other group, identified as extenuated, had high levels <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> exhaustion and depersonalization. Finally the disassociated group had a low academic engagement, low emotional exhaustion, high levels of depersonalization and lack <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> fulfillment. Conclusions: Academic achievement is associated with the level <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> with studies but not with burnout...|$|R

30|$|This article {{investigates the}} drivers and {{mechanisms}} of emigrants’ electoral and nonelectoral political engagement with their homeland. Our analysis {{concentrates on the}} diverse experiences of Polish migrants in the UK. By utilizing original mixed-method data, including a large-N survey of Polish migrant voters across the UK, in-depth interviews with Polish migrants in the UK, and matched interviews with their {{family members and friends}} in Poland, we highlight the importance of the migrant experience and environment as factors explaining the (de-)mobilization <b>of</b> transnational political <b>engagement.</b> The quantitative analysis highlights proxies of integration in the host society as the strongest predictors <b>of</b> transnational political <b>engagement,</b> while the participation in emigrant/diaspora networks has less clear-cut effects than previous studies have suggested. The qualitative analysis unpacks the migrants’ experiences that foster homeland <b>engagement.</b> The composition <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> networks - whether they are primarily Polish or international - emerges as an important element of the causal mechanism behind the (de-)mobilization <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> with Polish politics.|$|R

The second is the encouragement of creative expression in the learning tasks undertaken. The third is facilitating the establishment of a professional social work identity for students. While these three aspects contribute to engaging the interest of students in tertiary education, they are not without their difficulties.

40|$|Students {{today have}} {{unprecedented}} access to technology, the Internet, and social media. Their nearly ubiquitous {{use of these}} platforms is well documented. Given that today’s students may be primed to learn using a different medium, incorporating various technological elements into the classroom in a manner compatible with traditional approaches to teaching becomes a challenge. We recently designed and implemented a strategy that capitalized on this knowledge. Students in their first neuroscience course were required to create a 3 - 5 minute digital video using video-making freeware available on any Mac or PC. They used images, text, animation, as well as downloaded music to describe the fundamental process of neurotransmission {{as it applies to}} a topic of their choice. In comparison to students taught using other more traditional approaches to demonstrate the process of neurotransmission, we observed that students {{who took part in the}} video-making project exhibited better understanding of the neurological process at multiple levels, as defined by Bloom’s revised taxonomy. This was true even of students who had no aspirations of pursuing a Neuroscience career, thus suggesting that there was an overall increased level <b>of</b> student <b>engagement</b> regardless <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> career interests. The utility of our approach was validated by both direct and indirect assessments. Importantly, this particular strategy to teaching difficult concepts offers a high degree of flexibility allowing it to potentially be incorporated into any upper-level Neuroscience course...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{research}} highlighting the importance <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> for students' success in their tertiary studies. Innovations in both theoretical and practical understandings <b>of</b> student <b>engagement</b> are beginning to emerge, informing discussions across diverse contexts including research centres (such as ACER), conferences, and organisations (such as Engagement Australia). In this context, it is relevant to draw together diverse perspectives and arguments regarding what engagement is and could be, and to consider how a unified framework to understand and plan for engagement can impact practice in teacher education. This paper begins with an exploration <b>of</b> an <b>Engagement</b> Framework developed for use in the Faculty of Education at the University of Tasmania. This Framework offers a new way <b>of</b> framing <b>engagement</b> in teacher education, drawing attention to the connections between the intellectual environment of the university and the context of the profession. The Framework presents five dimensions <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> (<b>personal,</b> academic, social, intellectual, and professional) that are distinct and yet interrelated. The second section of this paper focuses specifically on the academic <b>engagement</b> dimension <b>of</b> the Framework, and explores the ways in which this Framework has led to innovations in teacher education practice both within the curriculum (within specific units of study) and outside of the curriculum (such as Student Engagement Days). These innovations provide examples of the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>Engagement</b> Framework as a way of bridging theory and practice, operating as a unifying device within and beyond the curriculum...|$|R
40|$|The Student Affairs Departments {{have seen}} immense {{growth over the}} years, from a {{discourse}} which had no academic relevance in higher education, to that {{which is expected to}} add value to the attraction, retention, and graduation of students. However, the latest developments have seen the role of Student Affairs Departments grow from ‘in‑loco parentis’ to educators who are expected to strategically position the image of their institutions to ensure that students are equipped with relevant, tried and tested skills in preparation for their studies, work, and civic <b>engagement.</b> The level <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> growth <b>of</b> students as they transition from secondary to tertiary institutions is now also traced to the effectiveness of Student Affairs personnel, policies, and structures. Thus the need for the visibility of such departments and the need to add value to higher education in the 21 st century has escalated. More innovative ways of engaging students and academics in this social discourse has a bearing on a professional approach that places emphasis on standards.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the effect of interdisciplinary instructional methods on high school students' attendance, engagement, and connected thinking by comparing it to unidisciplinary instruction. This comparative case study collected both quantitative and qualitative data to answer five research questions related to attendance, metacognition, connected thinking, engagement, and teachers' perceptions. This study compares two programs of study and involves 71 students in a suburban midwestern high school. The unidisciplinary program offers content in two separate classes of English and social studies. The other program offers similar content in a single interdisciplinary class taught by a team of an English and a social studies teacher. Data sources for the study include statistical analysis of attendance, classroom observations, a student survey, a student writing sample, and teacher interviews. The study examined attendance patterns. The data display no difference between the attendance patterns of interdisciplinary students and unidisciplinary students. In a student survey, the junior unidisciplinary students scored higher in their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> and <b>personal</b> connections to class content when compared to the perceptions of freshmen interdisciplinary students. When freshman perceptions <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> and <b>personal</b> connections in both groups are compared, no difference is apparent. However, teacher interviews indicate that the interdisciplinary students are more able to make learning connections. Therefore, this study is unable to conclusively demonstrate a difference between the awareness of connections in the two groups. Interdisciplinary students displayed more connected thinking than unidisciplinary students on a writing sample, which supported the comments made in the teacher interviews. However, this consistent positive result is not statistically significant. The data indicate that interdisciplinary instruction positively affects student holistic engagement. Teacher interviews reveal more in-depth analysis, ability to make learning connections, motivation, and cooperation in interdisciplinary students than in unidisciplinary students. The study concludes with a discussion of the future aims of education. Interdisciplinary instruction may offer certain gains in the way students learn for educators who desire this learning to be connected and holistic...|$|R
40|$|Background The recent {{policy of}} deinstitutionalization {{of health care}} in Western {{countries}} has resulted in {{a growing number of people}} - including elderly - with severe mental illness living in the community where they rely on families and others for support in daily living. Caregiving for partners, parents, children, and significant others can be a stressful experience and has been associated with psychosocial problems and poorer physical health. To support caregivers, a new, complex, nurse-led caregiver - centered intervention was developed. The intervention focuses on preventing deterioration in the wellbeing of caregivers. The objective of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the potentials of this new intervention. Methods We applied an interpretative qualitative field study at two Dutch mental health care institutes. Thirteen caregivers participated in a one-time semi-structured interview. Results From the caregivers’ perspective, a trusting relationship between caregivers and the mental health nurse is an essential condition for the depth and hence the effectiveness of the caregiver-centered counseling intervention. In this trusting relationship three overlapping and mutually reinforcing phases were identified (1) phase <b>of</b> <b>engagement,</b> (2) recognition <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> needs and (3) hope and optimism. Each phase encompasses key experiences that enhanced trust in that phase. Conclusions Collaborative relationships between caregivers and mental health nurses provide a framework in which the mental health nurse can assess and help not only patients but also caregivers to gain insight into their situation and take on new roles and responsibilities in ways that promote their wellbeing...|$|R

40|$|Healthcare {{organizations}} in all OECD countries {{have continued to}} undergo change. These changes {{have been found to}} {{have a negative effect on}} work <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> nursing staff. While the extent to which nursing staff dealt with these changes has been documented in the literature, little is known of how they utilized their personal resources to deal with the consequences of these changes. This study will address this gap by integrating the Job Demands-Resources theoretical perspective with Positive Psychology, in particular, psychological capital (PsyCap). PsyCap is operationalized as a source <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> resources. Data were collected from 401 nurses from Australia and analyses were undertaken using Partial Least Squares modelling and moderation analysis. Two types of changes on the nursing work were identified. There was an increase in changes to the work environment of nursing. These changes, included increasing administrative workload and the amount of work, resulted in more job demands and job resources. On the other hand, another type of changes relate to reduction to training and management support, which resulted in less job demands. Nurses with more job demands utilized more job resources to address these increasing demands. We found PsyCap to be a crucial source <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> resources that has a moderating effect on the negative effects of job demands and role stress. PsyCap and job resources were both critical in enhancing the work <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> nurses, as they encountered changes to nursing work.

40|$|A systematization of some {{approaches}} to the organizational behavior from the motivational aspect is attempted. Motivation as a determinant of the organizational efficiency is given varying importance in the different organizational theories depending on their basic assumptions concerning the human nature and the motives of the organizational behavior. These assumptions which qualify significantly the approach to numerous organizational problems and processes and especially {{to the process of}} management, usually reflect the social situation and existing values, as well as the contemporary insights into the human and organizational behavior. Starting from the limited approach of the traditional organizational theory, new interpretations give more importance to the expression and effects of human potential. Apart from the hypotheses stressing the materialistic determinants of human nature and behavior and the assumptions of the socially determined human behavior favoring the human relations approach, modern theories take into account a great complexity of the human nature and the organizational behavior and the complex motivational systems in constant process of changing as their latent structure. This open the possibilities to the development of new organizational conditions of human action. Organization is regarded as on open system in continuous interaction with the dynamic environment in which the frequent technological and other changes ask for highly developed mechanisms of adaptation and flexibility. The modified organizational theory finds this in the first place in complete development of {{all the members of the}} organization and the full <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> their <b>personal</b> capabilities as well as in creating such organizational forms that would eliminate the conflict between the personal and organizational aims, fostering thus the identification of the individual with the organization. All the consequences of such an approach felt on the West in the participation in management, decentralized decision making, democratic leadership, efficient communication systems, reconciliation of the individual and organizational aims, acquire a new quality and content in the self-management system of organization and society, where the stress is on the humanistic values. Here each member of an organization acts not only as a producer, but as a manager and co-owner at the same time. All this gives greater complexity to the role and status of the individual in the society and the new meaning and content to all the organizational processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to map the resources and methods used at the department OPPC, at AstraZeneca, and derived from that give suggestions on possible solutions that will increase their productivity. Mapping of the product flow, as well as gathering of process data, has mainly been done using observations, but consultation with the process technicians has also played a great role. Further have theoretical methods been used, based on literature studies, within the areas of Lean production and statistics. The work has incrementally gone forward since the steps taken has been restricted by the irregularity of production {{which led to the}} need of creating a fictive production flow. This has affected the lead-time calculations {{in the way that they}} are meant to give an indication, rather than an absolute truth, on how different methods described shall be used. The current state analysis showed multiple areas of improvement when defining capacity as value adding time in relation to total throughput time. Using the "standard scenario" as a basis showed that the actual production flow only constituted 50 % of the total project time. Further it showed that the workflow contained more non-value adding activities than value adding activities, which is a result of how the work is distributed within the department as well as in the different projects. The thesis resulted in different methods that together will show great reduction in throughput time. The new workflow is based on One-Piece flow, which implies that products should be processed without any delay between the different processing steps. Non-value adding activities have been restructured so that they will have no negative effect on the total throughput time. Based on this thesis, the personal at OPPC should be able to continue the improvement work by doing further measurements that would act as foundation for more detailed lead-time calculations. Restructuring of this kind would not be costly for OPPC but would set some demands on concerned departments. Finally, a prerequisite for this to work is that the <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>personal</b> is in focus, or else they may fall back to old routines...|$|R

The level <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> readiness to participate actively in the community {{is a prerequisite for}} building social responsibilities of all individuals. It also influences the development of social entrepreneurship, which, by integrating economic and social values, offers more sustainable solutions for a variety of social problems and the removal of traditional boundaries between government, business community, academia and civil society.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> {{business}} users to Business Intelligence Competency Center (BICC). The concept of BICC is still relatively young {{and it has not}} been researched a lot. The benefits and the downsides of BICC presented in the existing literature are also related to the <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> business users to this more centralized Business Intelligence (BI). New centralized BI offers different means and methods but it also sets up different challenges considering the engagement. The main objective of this thesis was to find out different means and methods to engage business users to Business Intelligence Competency Center. The research was conducted as applied case research on an assignment and it was focused on solving real practical problems in the case environment. The qualitative research material was based on the observations and the interviews of two different BI solution development cases. The analysis of the research material was built on two descriptive narratives and their categorization and summarization. The results of this research show that the means and the methods of engaging business users to BICC are familiar from the existing change management literature. However, the importance of BI solution‟s superiority was notable compared to other ways <b>of</b> <b>engagement.</b> Also the timing of introducing superior BI solution did not make any difference in engagement as opposed to the indications of the existing literature. The research also indicated that as the maturity of BICC increases the means and methods <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> should also change considering increased coverage and standardization, and the dilution <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> touch. Also conducted research brought out different challenges considering the <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> business users to centralized BICC. As a conclusion, this thesis is able to give managers a good overall understanding of engaging business users to BICC. They can achieve better engagement with less effort and consider how the characteristics of their own environment affect on the engagement. For academics this research works as an opening for further research related to engaging business users to Business Intelligence Competency Center. /Kir 1...|$|R
