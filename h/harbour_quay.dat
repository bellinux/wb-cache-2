25|$|In the 1870s, Bristol Docks {{was going}} through a period of {{expansion}} and modernisation in the face of increasing competition from other ports.

25|$|The {{town council}} - working with GOSW, SWRDA and NDDC, {{supported}} by the Alliance and Transform - developed the council offices into a community training resource in the town centre: 'The Ilfracombe Centre'. In 2006, major leisure industry developments by John Fowler, a local holiday camp operator, are expected to help shift the local economy back to tourism. This combined with investment by patrons such as Damien Hirst (who with his partner Mia recently funded a restaurant owned by Simon Brown, No 11 The Quay, on <b>Harbour</b> <b>Quay</b> Road, is developing a boutique guest house on the Torrs, as well owning other properties within the town) {{and the introduction of}} high quality accommodation should make Ilfracombe a more attractive destination for food lovers and tourists.|$|E

500|$|The {{service sector}} is the {{principal}} economy of Poole; {{a large number of}} employees work for the service economy of local residents or for the tourist economy. During the 1970s, Poole's less restrictive regional planning policies attracted businesses wishing to relocate from London. These included employers in the banking and financial sector, such as Barclays Bank (who operate a regional headquarters in Poole), American Express Bank and the corporate trust division of Bank of New York Mellon. Other important service sector employers include the national headquarters and college of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), the UK headquarters of Fitness First, Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth. Poole is also the headquarters for clothing company Animal, cosmetics manufacturer, Lush, and Merlin Entertainments, the world's second-largest theme park operator after Disney. The Dolphin Shopping Centre is Poole's main retail area, and the largest indoor shopping centre in Dorset. It opened in 1969 as an Arndale Centre, and underwent three major refurbishments in 1980, 1989 and 2004. The centre provides [...] of retail space with 110 stores and two multi-storey car parks with 1,400 parking spaces. A pedestrianised high street containing shops, bars, public houses and restaurants connects the Dolphin Centre with the historic Old Town area and Poole Quay. Tourism is important to the Poole's economy and was worth an estimated £158 million in 2002. Poole's <b>Harbour,</b> <b>Quay,</b> Poole Pottery and the beaches are some of the main attractions for visitors. Visitor accommodation consists of hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfast rooms located around the town, particularly in Sandbanks and the town centre. Rockley Park, a large caravan site in Hamworthy, is owned and operated by Haven Holidays.|$|E

In Cork city, any seaborne invaders would be engaged by motor torpedo boats and the 9.2inch and six-inch guns of the Treaty forts. If the enemy {{were able to}} effect a landing in strength, the forts would be demolished by explosives (as would the <b>harbour</b> <b>quays</b> and railway), a blockship would be sunk in the harbour channel and the Haulbowline oil refinery set on fire. The defence of the city itself would be undertaken by the local defence force (LDF) and a regular army battalion, while the First Division would carry out operations in the surrounding countryside.|$|R

Early canals included Florida Gardens, Isle of Capri which were under construction {{at the time of the}} 1954 flood. Recently constructed canals include <b>Harbour</b> <b>Quays</b> and Riverlinks completed in 2007.

5000|$|Peterhead bay and harbour {{became a}} major oil and gas port, {{servicing}} the offshore {{oil and gas industry}} in 1973, principally because of the deep water harbour and the short steaming time to the oil fields. [...] It was found out that the Scottish Secretary of State had responsibility for the harbour, in an 1886 act, that prohibited development in the harbour, except as a Haven of Refuge. A bill was introduced in May 1972 permitting other uses. The Scottish Office and Sidlaw Industries, an Aberdeen company made an agreement to lease the <b>harbour</b> <b>quay,</b> and dredging began on January 1972, to increase the depth of the harbour areas. By 1973, a large investment was made to improve the harbour facilities and to facilitate the building of a gas and oil terminal. Oil and gas from the North Sea flow through Peterhead Bay.|$|E
50|$|Eight barges {{were built}} {{for use on}} the canal, each boat being able to carry between 12 and 15 t of coal along the canal, as much as fifty horses and carts could haul on the road. The problem of blown sand from the dunes filling in the canal was reduced by waste from the pits being {{deposited}} as a bund {{on either side of}} the cut. The Saltcoats terminal was a coal yard with what may have been offices, about 600 yd from the harbour, at a site now known as Canal Street. The Shott at the harbour ran inland and as a very hard igneous rock the cost and effort of cutting the canal through it was not worthwhile. The canal never therefore entered the harbour directly and after tolls were imposed upon the coal carts a railway was built along the Shott to the old <b>harbour</b> <b>quay.</b>|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1919, the {{suspended}} lines began to be reinstated, and the numbering of some lines was changed. Lines from Promenade were redirected to Stadtgraben, after which the lines to Promenade were scrapped. In 1925, {{the construction of a}} line from Centrum to Heubude (modern Stogi) began; it was opened on 4 July 1927. In 1926, tracks on the newly established Paul-Beneke-Weg were opened, scrapping the single rail along <b>Harbour</b> <b>quay.</b> At the time in Neufahrwasser, two balloon loops were constructed; a small loop for the line from Centrum and a larger loop for the line from Brösen. In 1930, a new line from Grosse Allee across Aleja Hallera and ulica Mickiewicza to the loop at the intersection of aleja Legionów and ulica Kościuszki. On the line between Langfuhr and Oliva, the layout was changed, eliminating the line on ulica Szymanowskiego, building it instead on aleja Wojska Polskiego. Construction began for a new tram depot in Langfuhr.|$|E
