5|$|Hearing {{the shark}} has been lured into the pipe, Michael and Kay {{go down to}} repair the {{underwater}} tunnel, so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water. Calvin orders the pump {{to be shut down}} to suffocate the shark, but this act instead allows her to break free from the pipe and attack Michael and Kay, but they are saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room, but the shark appears in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and smashes through the glass, flooding the room and killing a technician. Michael notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat with a grenade, and uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing the shark. In the aftermath, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their brush with the shark.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2010, {{the anchor}} {{desk in the}} studio was {{relocated}} back in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> overlooking Times Square, {{where it had been}} when Good Morning America moved to the Times Square Studios facility in 1999; the news desk was also moved in front of a window. On May 3, 2010, the program debuted new [...] "light blue and sunny" [...] graphics, and new theme music by DreamArtists Studios. An entirely new set for the program was introduced on January 31, 2011; the monitor used for national weather segments (used mainly during the 7:00a.m. hour only) was moved closer to the anchor desk while the news desk remained in the same place. This was the first major set change since the show upgraded to high definition in November 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Scherzinger {{sitting in the}} back of a London hackney carriage. As the rain pours outside and raindrops cover the windows, she sings the first verse while {{changing}} her smart clothes for more casual ones. She stares longingly out of the carriage's window, watching the rain outside. During the chorus, there are two main scenes. In the first she is seen wrapped in blanket while in the second she walks across the room of an old house, in need of renovation. The lighting is cold and dim, and most of the furniture is covered in plastic wrap. Scherzinger stares resentfully at her surroundings while crossing the room. In the second verse, Scherzinger stands in front of a mirror in the bathroom of the house where she has a moment of realisation. After turning the taps on for a while, the sink overflows as she scornfully looks in the mirror, relating to the lyrics of the song. She is then scene walking towards the camera, through a hallway of the house. It is a confident independent walk towards the audience with lights flashing rhythmically behind her. The bridge sees Scherzinger sitting in one the house's empty rooms, in an old armchair and intersects some of the earlier carriage and bathroom scenes. As she sings the lyric [...] "The screen fades to black", the blanket seen earlier on falls in front of the camera, revealing a close up shot of Scherzinger's face. Her hair flows in the wind and she finally gets up from the armchair to stand in front of the room's open windows. In the final scene, she stands confidently in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> as wind and light flood the room. She sings the final verse of the song, looking directly at the camera and smiling for the first time in the video.|$|E

60|$|Aunt Louisa took Philip {{upstairs and}} showed him into a tiny bed-room that {{looked out on the}} drive.

60|$|But on the {{threshold}} she paused.

60|$|Torrance {{strode to}} an open window and blew a silver whistle. Its shrill note had {{scarcely}} died away when a mounted man came up at a gallop, and a band of others in haste on foot.

60|$|On the--of June, 1843, I {{landed the}} second time on <b>the</b> wharf <b>of</b> York Fort, and betook myself to Bachelors' Hall, where Mr Grave, whom I met by the way, {{told me to take}} up my quarters.

60|$|I {{knew that}} he had not been to see Mrs. Haldin yet. Miss Haldin told me he was reluctant; moreover, the mental {{condition}} of Mrs. Haldin had changed.

60|$|It {{was very}} mysterious. My heart beat furiously. Fear {{for the safety}} of my {{precious}} papers held me in a death-like grip. I ran straight to my room, locked the door after me, and pulled the curtains together in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Then, with hands that trembled as if with ague, I pulled aside the strip of carpet which concealed the hiding-place of what meant a fortune to me.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerical study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> opaque external trees with pyramidal shape on <b>the</b> thermal behaviour <b>of</b> a school building in Summer conditions. The software used simulates <b>the</b> thermal response <b>of</b> buildings with complex topology under transient conditions. This software {{has previously been}} validated by real studies both in Summer and Winter conditions. The school building considered is localised in <b>the</b> South <b>of</b> Portugal. It has three levels divided into 97 rooms or spaces, 1277 main structures and 211 windows with plain transparent glass. In the model, the building is shaded by 49 "opaque'' trees of pyramidal shape growing in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> {{on one side of}} each building considered. The simulation considered a typical Summer school day with clear sky and with 800 occupants in the building. Two situations with the same configuration were analysed. In the first one, the trees (located in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows)</b> were placed to the West and South-West <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings, while in the second one, after a 180 degrees building rotation, they were to the East and North-East.

60|$|Northmour was on {{his feet}} in an instant, and he and I ran through the door of {{communication}} with the study. The room was illuminated by a red and angry light. Almost at the moment of our entrance, a tower of flame arose in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and, with a tingling report, a pane fell inwards on the carpet. They had set fire to the lean-to outhouse, where Northmour used to nurse his negatives.|$|E
60|$|The rocking-chair {{had been}} brought out and placed again in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and there sat Priscilla, leaning back at her ease, with the crown on her head, a big fan--made of calf-skin--in her hand, and a general air of superiority pervading her whole being. Behind her, with {{her hand on the}} back of the chair, stood Poqua-dilla, wearing her new turban, but without the red shawl. She looked as if {{something}} had happened.|$|E
60|$|I bore it {{in silence}} for three weeks, but I will shudder {{to the end of}} my life when I {{remember}} those three weeks. Night before last Sara came up to my room where I was lying on my bed with my face in the pillow. I wasn't crying--I couldn't cry. There was just a dreadful dull ache in everything. Sara sat down on the rocker in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and the sunset light came in behind her and made a sort of nimbus round her head, like a motherly saint's in a cathedral.|$|E

60|$|And {{four times}} a day these four men in armour met each other in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, and stood there on horseback for fifteen minutes, with their backs to the curbstone. <b>The</b> forage, however, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horses became so terribly large an item of {{expenditure}} that Mr. Brown's heart failed him. His heart failed him, and he himself went off late one evening to the livery stable-keeper who supplied the horses, and in Mr. Robinson's absence, the armour was sent back to Poland Street.|$|R
