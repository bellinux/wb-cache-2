50|$|Given the fruit's {{attractive}} {{color and}} the conspicuous display at the branch-tips, this tree appears to be distributed by birds which eat the fruit and spread the seeds. Perching birds, namely tanagers (Thraupidae), thrushes (Turdidae) and tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), are most commonly seen to feed on the fruit. Some birds, such as the silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), prune off the seedcoat and eat it, discarding the seed, but most swallow the entire fruit. Species such as the swallow tanager (Tersina viridis) and the pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), but perhaps most of all the sayaca tanager (Thraupis sayaca), appear to be particularly fond of them. Indeed, the sayaca tanager will defend richly fruiting A. glandulosa trees against similar-sized birds such as the blue <b>dacnis</b> (<b>Dacnis</b> cayana) or the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus). It may be that at least locally, T. sayaca is crucial for the tree's reproduction and survival.|$|E

40|$|Schefflera morototoni fruits are {{important}} food source for neotropical frugivorous birds. The {{objectives of the}} present study were to record bird species that consumed fruits of S. morototoni in a forest in the transition Cerrado-Amazon Forest, Mato Grosso, Brazil and evaluate the potential of these bird species as seed dispersers of this plant species. During 31 observation hours, from November 1 to 5, 2011, 23 bird species were recorded consuming S. morototoni fruits. Out of these, 20 bird species were considered potential seed dispersers, as they swallow the fruits whole. The species consuming the greatest number of fruits were Aburria cujubi (24 % of total consumed fruits), Pteroglossus castanotis (18 %), Tangara palmarum (12 %), Patagioenas speciosa (11 %), Ramphastos toco (8 %), and <b>Dacnis</b> lineata (5 %). The species T. palmarum showed the highest visit frequency (VF = 1. 51), followed by P. castanotis (VF = 0. 80), and D. lineata (VF = 0. 77). All bird species employed picking foraging method for removal of fruits and in 11 species (48 %) this method was the only one used. Agonistic interactions represented 13 % {{of the total number of}} visits. <b>Dacnis</b> lineata received the highest number of attacks and P. castanotis and Pitangus sulphuratus were the more aggressive species.

40|$|Several plant characteristics, such as fruit production, {{nutrient}} reward, secondary compounds, {{and fruit}} color display, affect fruit choice by birds. On the other hand, several bird attributes affect their efficiency as dispersers. Here we investigate the ornithochoric seed dispersal of Pera glabrata Schott (Euphorbiaceae) in a cerrado fragment in southeastern Brazil. A set of bird attributes, such as frequency of visits, number of diaspores eaten, time spent foraging, methods of taking and handling the diaspores and agonistic interactions were analyzed {{in order to}} infer about the potential of each species {{to act as a}} seed disperser. Birds were the unique seed dispersers of these oil-rich diaspores. We observed 414 bird visits during 60 hours of focal observations in five trees from December 1999 to January 2000. Twenty bird species from seven families ate the diaspores of P. glabrata, but only 14 species were considered potential seed dispersers because they swallowed the diaspores, increasing the probabilities for the seeds to be defecated and/or regurgitated away from the parent trees. The main potential seed dispersers were: Turdus leucomelas (Muscicapidae), <b>Dacnis</b> cayana (Emberizidae), Colaptes melanochloros (Picidae) and Elaenia spp. (Tyrannidae). We did not find any significant seasonal change in the number of visits on the fruiting trees throughout the day. We also did not find any relation between the number of visits per tree and fruit production. The most effective seed dispersers of P. glabrata were generalist birds, which have a high visiting rate, high fruit consumption rate, and spend short periods on the plants. The large number of species recorded as potential seed dispersers of P. glabrata, being most of them very abundant even in Brazilian disturbed areas, may guarantee seed dispersal of this plant in small fragments and regenerating areas...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the thermal}} and {{mechanical}} properties of CH 4 and CO 2 hydrates {{is essential for}} the replacement of CH 4 with CO 2 in natural hydrate deposits as well as for CO 2 sequestration and storage. In this work, we present isothermal compressibility, isobaric thermal expansion coefficient and specific heat capacity of fully occupied single-crystal sI-CH 4 hydrates, CO 2 hydrates and hydrates of their mixture using molecular dynamics simulations. Eight rigid/nonpolarisable water interaction models and three CH 4 and CO 2 interaction potentials were selected to examine the atomic interactions in the sI hydrate structure. The TIP 4 P/ 2005 water model combined with the <b>DACNIS</b> united-atom CH 4 potential and TraPPE CO 2 rigid potential were found to be suitable molecular interaction models. Using these molecular models, the results indicate that both the lattice parameters and the compressibility of the sI hydrates agree with those from experimental measurements. The calculated bulk modulus for any mixture ratio of CH 4 and CO 2 hydrates varies between 8. 5 GPa and 10. 4 GPa at 271. 15 K between 10 and 100 MPa. The calculated thermal expansion and specific heat capacities of CH 4 hydrates are also comparable with experimental values above approximately 260 K. The compressibility and expansion coefficient of guest gas mixture hydrates increase with an increasing ratio of CO 2 -to-CH 4, while the bulk modulus and specific heat capacity exhibit the opposite trend. The presented results for the specific heat capacities of 2220 - 2699. 0 J kg- 1 K- 1 for any mixture ratio of CH 4 and CO 2 hydrates are the first reported so far. These computational results provide a useful database for practical natural gas recovery from CH 4 hydrates in deep oceans where CO 2 is considered to replace CH 4, as well as for phase equilibrium and mechanical stability of gas hydrate-bearing sediments...|$|E
40|$|Frutos carnosos estão disponíveis na RFC para consumo por aves durante todo o ano, com um pico de espécies frutificando no meio da época seca; 58 espécies vegetais têm frutos comprovada ou potencialmente consumidos por aves. Foram detetadas 68 espécies de aves frugívoras; 47 foram estudadas, das quais 44 vistas se alimentando e três com restos de flutos presentes nas fezes. Passeriformes constituíram a maior parte delas e responderam por 97 % do consumo. Os táxons mais ricos em espécies foram Tyrannidae (13) e Thraupinae (12, 67 % do consumo). Predominaram aves pequenas, onívoras, pouco sensíveis a alterações ambientais, pouco específicas quanto a hábitat e com ampla distribuição neotropica 1. Tais aspectos seriam consistentes com a idéia de que a planície sedimentar onde está a RFC teria sido colonizada por aves oportunistas, a partir das florestas de tabuleiro vizinhas. Seis espécies (Cyanerpes cyaneus, Euphonia violacea, <b>Dacnis</b> cayana, Cacicus haemorrhous, Tangara mexicana e Coereba flaveola) responderam por 74 % do consumo. A taxa de consumo (4, 9 eventos/hora) foi maior nas áreas abertas externas ao fragmento e em suas bordas, e entre o nascer do sol e as 11 : 00; também variou ao longo do ano. A freqüência de consumo de frutos parece ser menor do que em outras áreas neotropicais já estudadas. Quanto ao comportamento alimentar, foi mais comum a coleta de frutos por aves pousadas (93 % dos eventos). Na maior parte dos eventos, o fruto foi removido inteiro (60 %); remoção parcial de polpa é feita com maior freqüência pelos emberizídeos e em geral envolve as infrutescências de Cecropia sp. e os frutos de Clusia hilariana. O {{material}} removido foi preparado antes da ingestão, principalmente por mandibulação, em 83 % dos casos. A ingestão de sementes ocorreu em 71 % dos eventos; não-ingestão foi mais comum em Emberizidae e Icteridae. As visitas a plantas com frutos eram curtas (90 % com menos de 3 min); visitas com alimentação duraram em média 3, 5 vezes mais que visitas sem alimentação. As aves se alimentaram em todos os estratos de vegetação; na mata alta, apenas 5 % dos eventos ocorreram no subosque. A taxa de encontros agressivos foi baixa (0, 38 /hora), talvez por haver pouca sobreposição das preferências alimentares (tamanho de fruto, horário e altura de forrageamento), entre as espécies de aves mais freqüentes. Apenas 11 espécies (16 % das aves flugívoras) parecem ser potencialmente boas dispersoras das plantas estudadas; para algumas plantas não foi possível determinar um dispersor eficiente. A pequena disponibilidade e as baixas taxas de remoção de frutos, e a impossibilidade de identificar os dispersores de algumas plantas parecem indicar uma certa ineficiência das aves como agentes dispersores na RFC, e poderiam contribuir para que a recomposição natural de ambientes de restinga seja tão difícil. Não foi possível determinar se essas e outras feições da relação entre aves e frutos decorrem das alterações antrópicas que levaram ao isolamento e à descaracterização da RFC ou se já existiriam nas vegetações originaisThis {{study was}} conducted at the Reserva da Foz do Comboios (19 ° 46 ' S - 40 ° 02 ' W), state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. The RFC is a restinga forest fragment surrounded by anthropic open landscape and grows on an extensive coastal sand plain of quaternary deposition (about 5, 500 years old). Additional infromation was collected at nearby sites. Fleshy fruits are available for avian consumption at RFC year round with {{the greatest number of}} fruiting plants occurring {{in the middle of the}} dry season. Fifty-eight species of plant species produce fruits with confirmed or potential consumption by birds. From February 1993 to February 1994, 68 species of frugivore birds were detected at RFC and of these, 47 species were studied. Forty-four species were seen feeding on fruiting trees and the other three species had fruit remains in their droppings. Most were Passeriformes, which accounted for 97 % of total fruit consumption. The taxa richest in species were Tyrannidae (13 species, 5 % fruit consumption) and Thraupinae (12 species, 67 % fruit consumption). There was a predominance of small, omnivorous species with low sensitivity to environmental changes, little habitat specificity and wide Neotropical distribution. This is consistent with the theory that the very recent sedimentary plain where RFC lies could have been colonized by opportunistic bird species coming from nearby tabuleiro forests. Six species (Cyanerpes cyaneus, Euphonia violacea, <b>Dacnis</b> cayana, Cacicus haemorrhous, Tangara mexicana and Coereba flaveola) accounted for 74 % of ali fruit consumed. Consumption rate (4. 9 events/hour) was higher in open areas outside the forest and in forest border, and between sunrise and 11 : 00 h. Consumption frequency appears to be lower at RFC than in other previously studied Neotropical localities. Birds collected fruit most frequently while perched (93 % of observations). In most cases, fruit was taken whole (60 %). Partial removal of pulp was more frequently observed in Emberizidae and usually involved Cecropia sp. catkins and Clusia hilariana fruits. The material removed was handled prior to swallowing (83 % of observations), mostly by mandlbulation. Seed ingestion occurred in 71 % of observations. Non-ingestion was observed mostly in Emberizidae and Icteridae. Visits to fruiting plants were short, 90 % lasted less than 3 minutes and feeding visits were 3. 5 times longer than nonfeeding visits. Birds fed at ali vegetational levels. In taller forest, only 5 % of the feeding observations occurred in the under story. The frequency of aggressive confrontations between birds of the same or of different species was low (0. 38 per hour), perhaps due to the low visitation rates and to the low overlap of feeding preferences (fruit size, feeding time and feeding height) amongst the most important avian consumers. Only 11 species (16 % of avian frugivores at RFC) seem to be potentially good seed dispersers of the plants studied and for some plant species it was not possible to determine an efficient seed disperser. Low availability of fruits, low rates of fruit removal and the failure to detect the dispersers of some plant species point to the somewhat inefficient role of birds in the seed dispersal at RFC. These factors could add to the difficult of disturbed restinga habitats recovering naturally. It was not possible to determine if these and other features of the bird-fruits relationship arose due to the human impact that led to the fragmentation and deterioration of RFC restinga or if they were already present in the original, undisturbed habita...|$|E
