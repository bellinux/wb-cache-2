500|$|In 1962, all Grosset & Dunlap books become [...] "picture covers", {{books with}} artwork and {{advertising}} printed directly on their covers, {{as opposed to}} books with a dust jacket over a tweed volume. The change was to reduce production costs. Several of the 1930s and 1940s cover illustrations were updated by Nappi for this change, depicting a Nancy of the Kennedy era, though the stories themselves were not updated. Internal illustrations, which were dropped in 1937, were returned to the books beginning in 1954, as pen and <b>ink</b> <b>line</b> drawings, mostly by uncredited artists, but usually corresponding with Nappi's style of drawing Nancy on the covers. Nappi followed trends initiated by Gillies and often illustrated Nancy wearing the same clothing more than once, including a mustard shirtwaist dress.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cumulative}} recorder makes a pen-and-ink {{record of}} simple repeated responses. Skinner designed it {{for use with}} the Operant chamber as a convenient way to record and view the rate of responses such as a lever press or a key peck. [...] In this device, {{a sheet of paper}} gradually unrolls over a cylinder. [...] Each response steps a small pen across the paper, starting at one edge; when the pen reaches the other edge, it quickly resets to the initial side. The slope of the resulting <b>ink</b> <b>line</b> graphically displays the rate of the response; for example, rapid responses yield a steeply sloping line on the paper, slow responding yields a line of low slope. The cumulative recorder was a key tool used by Skinner in his analysis of behavior, and it was very widely adopted by other experimenters, gradually falling out of use {{with the advent of the}} laboratory computer. [...] Skinner's major experimental exploration of response rates, presented in his book with C. B. Ferster, Schedules of Reinforcement, is full of cumulative records produced by this device.|$|E
60|$|But {{the black}} outline {{seems to be}} peculiarly that which we ought to begin to reason upon, because it is simple and open-hearted, and does not {{endeavor}} to escape into mist. A pencil line may be obscurely and undemonstrably wrong; false in a cowardly manner, and without confession: but the <b>ink</b> <b>line,</b> if it goes wrong at all, goes wrong with a will, and may be convicted at our leisure, and put to such shame as its black complexion is capable of. May we, therefore, begin with the hard line? It will lead us far, if we can come to conclusions about it.|$|E

60|$|Then, {{when you}} are {{satisfied}} with {{the shape of the}} letter, draw pen and <b>ink</b> <b>lines</b> firmly round the tint, as at d, and remove any touches outside the limit, first with the India-rubber, and then with the penknife, so that all may look clear and right. If you rub out any of the pencil inside the outline of the letter, retouch it, closing it up to the <b>inked</b> <b>line.</b> The straight lines of the outline are all to be ruled,[203] but the curved lines are to be drawn by the eye and hand; and you will soon find what good practice there is in getting the curved letters, such as Bs, Cs, &c., to stand quite straight, and come into accurate form.|$|R

40|$|Using easy ambient sonic-spray {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} (EASI-MS), fast and non-destructive fingerprinting identification and aging of ballpoint pen ink writings {{have been performed}} directly from paper surfaces under ordinary ambient conditions. EASI-MS data obtained directly from the <b>ink</b> <b>lines</b> showed that pens from different brands provide typical ink chemical profiles. Accelerated ink aging has also been monitored by EASI-MS revealing contrasting degradation behaviors for six different common ink dyes. As demonstrated for Basic Violet 3, some dyes display a cascade of degradation products whose abundances increase linearly with time thus functioning as 'chemical clocks' for ink aging. Analysis of questionable documents has confirmed the ink aging capabilities of EASI-MS. The order of superimposition at a crossing point has also been determined by EASI-MS. For two superimposed <b>ink</b> <b>lines,</b> continuous EASI-MS analysis has also shown that the EASI spray is able to penetrate through the layers and therefore both ink layers could be characterized...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dermoscopy is {{a helpful}} tool that can assist {{experienced}} users improve the diagnostic accuracy for pigmented lesions in acral sites. As a simplification, one {{can assume that}} if pigment is found predominantly in the furrows, the lesion can be considered benign, and if the pigmentation is present predominantly on the ridges, the lesion should be considered malignant. The differentiation between furrows and ridges is the main clue for the diagnosis, but this can sometimes be difficult to discern. For this reason, we describe a simple in vivo technique that makes this task much easier for the clinician. OBSERVATIONS: Liquid ink (ie, from a fountain pen) should be applied directly onto the lesion. The ink should be left on the skin {{for a few seconds}} to allow the ink to penetrate into the furrows. The excess ink should then be wiped off. The ink will at first diffusely color the entire skin surface. The subsequent cotton swab wiping will only remove the ink on the skin overlying the ridges. The furrows will retain the stain and become clearly visible on dermoscopic examination as thin <b>inked</b> <b>lines.</b> This in turn will make it easy to evaluate whether the melanin pigmentation follows the <b>ink</b> <b>lines</b> (benign pattern) or if the pigmentation is located in between these <b>ink</b> <b>lines</b> (malignant pattern). Conclusion The furrow ink test is a quick and easy method to facilitate the correct identification of furrows and ridges on volar skin and facilitates dermoscopic diagnosis of pigmented lesions in acral sites...|$|R
5000|$|The current {{from the}} {{telegraph}} line {{is applied to}} the coil. The pulses of current representing the Morse code [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] flowing through the coil create a magnetic field which interacts with the magnetic field of the magnet, creating a torque which causes the coil to rotate slightly about its vertical suspension axis. The wire linkages cause the siphon support plate to rotate about its horizontal axis, swinging the siphon tube across the paper tape. This draws a displacement in the <b>ink</b> <b>line</b> on the tape as long as the current is present in the coil. Thus the <b>ink</b> <b>line</b> on the tape forms a graph of the current in the telegraph line, with displacements representing the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of the Morse code. An operator knowing Morse code later translates the line on the tape to characters of the text message, and types them onto a telegram form.|$|E
