40|$|The {{emerging}} {{paradigm of}} network function virtualization advocates deploying virtualized network functions (VNF) on standard virtualization platforms for significant cost reduction and management flexibility. There have been system designs for managing dynamic deployment and scaling of VNF service chains within one cloud data center. Many real-world network services involve geo-distributed service chains, with prominent examples of mobile core networks and IMSs (<b>IP</b> <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Subsystems).</b> Virtualizing these service chains requires efficient coordination of VNF deployment across different geo-distributed data centers over time, calling for new management system design. This paper designs a dynamic scaling system for geo-distributed VNF service chains, using {{the case of}} an IMS. IMSs are widely used <b>subsystems</b> for delivering <b>multimedia</b> services among mobile users in a 3 G/ 4 G network, whose virtualization has been broadly advocated in the industry for reducing cost, improving network usage efficiency and enabling dynamic network topology reconfiguration for performance optimization. Our scaling system design caters to key control-plane and data-plane service chains in an IMS, combining proactive and reactive approaches for timely, cost-effective scaling of the service chains. We evaluate our system design using real-world experiments on both emulated platforms and geo-distributed clouds...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} management supports {{are becoming}} more and more important not only in the fields of IT infrastructures for Internet applications and services, but steadily also in the field of telecommunication services and infrastructures. More and more telecommunication service providers have adopted <b>IP</b> <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Subsystems</b> (IMS) to consolidate their service infrastructures towards converged, all-IP, access network independent Next Generation Networks (NGNs). Although modern NGN service environments have the potential to greatly reduce new telecommunication services time-to-market, until now significant upfront investments into computational resources are required, that is still often a risk for the enterprise, with unsure return on invest. The application of cloud computing technologies to IMS-based service infrastructures enables new pay-per-use cost models, so IMS service providers may be charged for what they use only, significantly lowering the risk of bad investments. This work presents the design and implementation of a cloud brokering system for IMS services, capable of simultaneously interworking with multiple cloud infrastructures. We developed a Cloud Broker Engine (CBE) able to dynamically up/down-scale cloud resources across multiple cloud platforms. Our CBE is capable of coping with dynamic load situations and QoS requirements optimizing resource utilization across different cloud infrastructures: it enables QoS assurance and optimizes resource consumption across multiple cloud providers...|$|R

In this paper, we report on progress on ongoing research by our group toward putting together a platform as a testbed used for NGN application development. We examine a novel component based development model used for SIP based mobile applications. The developed model is to be used as framework for general purpose application development over the testbed.

40|$|Abstract — On the one hand, the {{challenge}} of meeting various security requirements in the mobile and wireless environment is difficult, compared to the fixed and wired environment, because of {{the very nature of}} radio communications. On the other hand, wireless networks such as GSM, PCS and CDMA, which are predominantly circuit-switched voice networks, have been shielded from the vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet. With the introduction of the <b>IP</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>subsystems</b> (IMS) solutions, data, voice and video will be accessible using UMTS and CDMA 2000 networks via the Internet. The current mobile equipment has the capability to work with multiple radio interfaces using heterogeneous radio access networks. Mobile subscribers have also become truly mobile since they are not constrained by mobile equipment, networks and applications. However, information between individuals has to be protected. Therefore, there will exist always the notion of private and public communications. In the mobile and wireless environment, {{the challenge}} is private communications between peers over non private domains. This paper describes schemes offering secure communications between mobile nodes using virtual private networking technologies based on IP security (IPSec). In addition, mobility management is done using mobile IP along with route-optimization techniques. This paper also describes how latencies suffered by real-time traffic when traversing IPSec and mobile IP tunnels can be reduced so that real-time delay constraints can be meet...|$|R
