In this paper, an innovative hybrid dynamic model of the tooling system in <b>internal</b> <b>turning,</b> based on FE beams and empirical models, is presented.

40|$|When {{machining}} {{high precision}} mechanical parts, self-excited chatter vibrations must be absolutely avoided since they cause unacceptable surface finish and dimensional errors. Such unstable vibrational phenomena typically arise when the overall machining system stiffness is relatively low, {{as in the}} case of <b>internal</b> <b>turning</b> operations performed with slender boring bars. In general, it is not easy to determine stable tooling system configurations for a given machining operation, since data available in literature are often incomplete or inaccurate. In this paper, a new probabilistic algorithm for a robust analysis of stability in <b>internal</b> <b>turning</b> is presented. In this approach, model parameters are considered as random variables, and robust analysis of stability is carried out in order to estimate system’s probability of instability for a given boring bar geometry and material, tool geometry, workpiece material and cutting parameters. By so doing, robustly stable tooling system configurations and cutting conditions may be identified in the preliminary production planning phase. The proposed approach was experimentally validated by considering different boring bar geometries and materials (including special boring bars made of high-damping carbide), tool geometries, workpiece materials and cutting conditions. For each machining system configuration, the developed approach was capable of successfully estimating the maximum ratio between boring bar overhang L and bar diameter D which assures process stability for most cutting parameters combinations...|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{control has}} been and still remains a subject of primary {{importance}} in modern manufacturing industry. To be able to remove high volumes of material in shorter {{time as well as}} {{to be able to get}} the right quality of the parts at the first time are goals that many shops would like to achieve. Tooling systems, and especially cantilever tools, and cantilever structural units of machine tools are the least rigid components of machining systems and therefore the most prone to vibration. Boring tools are often encountered as rotating tools in machining centres or as stationary tools in <b>internal</b> <b>turning.</b> In this thesis the focus is on <b>internal</b> <b>turning.</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>turning</b> is widely known as a very delicate operation and it is often carried out with cutting parameters far from optimal, from a productivity point of view, due to limitations imposed by vibration. Another type of tooling system whose functionality is impaired by vibration is the parting-off tool. The design of damped parting-off tool is one of the focus of this thesis as well. Vibration control has the purpose to achieve an efficient energy dissipation of a vibrational system. Basically this is achieved by controlling the damping of the system. Since damping involves the conversion of energy associated with a vibration to other forms, there are several mechanisms to remove energy from a vibrating system. Typically these mechanisms are divided in two classes: 1. Mechanisms that convert mechanical energy to heat, i. e. passive damping. 2. Mechanisms that transport energy away from vibrating systems, i. e. active damping. Both these techniques have been used during the years and both have been giving excellent results. The active vibration control mechanisms are more expensive and not suitable for machining due to the cables they necessitate that could interfere with the machining operation. This work proposes an original approach to vibration damping in machining systems, the objects of vibration dissipation being the structural components on the link between turret and cutting insert. The idea is to use composite materials to create damping interfaces between and within the different structural components. Different clamping system designs are being compared in order to see how these influence the performance of the machining system and different cutting inserts have been compared for machining hardened steel. The newly designed components have been going through both extensive off-line (modal analysis) and on-line dynamic testing (machining test) and the results show that the new tool holders used in combination with hydrostatic clamping system are the most optimal solution among the tested ones. The new design for the turret has been giving promising results and more can be achieved by bringing minor changes to it, these changes are being implemented at the time of writing this thesis.

40|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>turning</b> or boring {{operations}} {{have a history}} of being a cumbersome manufacturing process.

40|$|Boring bar {{vibration}} during <b>internal</b> <b>turning</b> {{operations in}} machine tools is a pronounced {{problem in the}} manufacturing industry. Vibration may easily be induced by the workpiece’s material deformation process, due to the bar’s normally slender geometry. In order to overcome the vibration problem in <b>internal</b> <b>turning</b> active or/and passive control methods may be utilized. The level of success achieved by implementing such methods is directly dependent on the engineer’s knowledge of the dynamic properties of the system to be controlled. This thesis focuses predominantly on three steps {{in the development of}} an accurate model of an active boring bar. The first part considers the problem of building an accurate ” 3 -D” FE model of a standard boring bar used in industry. The influence of the FE model’s mesh density on the accuracy of the estimated spatial dynamic properties is addressed. With respect to the boring bar’s natural frequencies, the FE modeling also considers mass loading effects introduced by accelerometers attached to the boring bar. Experimental modal analysis results from the actual boring bar are used as a reference. The second part discusses analytical and experimental methods for modeling the dynamic properties of a boring bar clamped in a machine tool. For this purpose, Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko distributedparameter system models are used to describe the dynamics of the boring bar. Also, ” 1 -D” FE models with Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam elements have been developed in accordance with distributedparameter system models. A more complete ” 3 -D” FE model of the system ”boring bar - clamping house” has also been developed. Spatial dynamic properties of these models are discussed and compared with adequate experimental modal analysis results from the actual boring bar clamped in the machine tool. This section also investigates sensitivity of the spatial dynamic properties of the derived boring bar models to variation in the structural parameters’ values. The final part focuses on the development of a ” 3 -D” FE model of the system ”boring bar - actuator - clamping house”, with the purpose of simplifying the design procedure of an active boring bar. A linear model is addressed along with a model enabling variable contact between the clamping house and the boring bar with and without Coulomb friction in the contact surfaces. Based on these FE models’ fundamental bending modes, eigenfrequencies and mode shapes, control path frequency response functions are discussed in conjunction with the corresponding quantities estimated for the actual active boring bar...|$|E
40|$|Vibrations in <b>internal</b> <b>turning</b> or boring {{operations}} are usually a cumbersome {{part of the}} manufacturing process. The manufacturing industries are having problems {{with these kinds of}} cutting operations. When cutting in pre-drilled holes the cross sectional area of the boring bar is limited {{at the same time as}} it is long. Since a general boring bar is long and slender it is sensitive to external excitation and thereby inclined to vibrate. The vibration problem affects the surface finish in particular. The demand for smaller and smaller tolerances of the surface finish leads to that the manufacturing industry seeks for a solution to the boring bar vibration problem. The tool life is also likely to be influenced by the vibrations involved in a cutting operation. Another problem in boring operations is the high noise level in the cutting process. The noise level in the environment of the operators is today more and more regulated, especially in the western world. Active vibration control will reduce the amount of vibrations in the cutting operations. Since the noise is induced by the vibration of the boring bar, the noise level will also be reduced due to the cancellation of the noise source. Preliminary results show reduction of vibrations in the boring bar by up to 30 dB...|$|E
40|$|Vibration in <b>internal</b> <b>turning</b> is {{a problem}} in the {{manufacturing}} industry. Vibrations appear under the excitation applied by the material deformation process during the machining of a workpiece. In order for a lathe to perform an <b>internal</b> <b>turning</b> or boring operation, for example, in a pre-drilled hole in a workpiece, it is generally required that the boring bar should be long and slender; therefore extra sensitive to vibrations. These vibrations will affect the result of machining, in particular the surface finish, also the tool life may be reduced. As a result of tool vibration, severe acoustic noise frequently occurs in the working environment. This thesis comprises three parts and the first part presents a method for active control of boring bar vibration. This method consists of an active boring bar controlled by, for example, an analog controller. The focus lies on the analog controller and the advantages that may be obtained from working in the analog domain. The controller is a lead-lag compensator with digitally controlled parameters, such as gain and phase. However, signals remain in the analog domain. In addition, the analog controller is compared with a digital adaptive controller and it is found that both controllers yield an attenuation of the vibration by up to 50 dB. The second part of this thesis concerns the dynamic properties of a clamped boring bar used by the industry. In order to design a robust controller for a certain system, knowledge about the system's dynamic properties is required. On the workshop floor, a boring bar is dismounted and remounted, and reconfiguration of boring bars will alter the dynamic properties of the clamped boring bar. The dynamic properties of a standard boring bar and an active boring bar for a number of possible clamping conditions, as well as for a linearized clamping have been investigated based on an experimental approach. Also simple Euler-Bernoulli modeling of clamped boring bars incorporating simple non-rigid models of the boring bar clamping are investigated. Initial simulations of nonlinear SDOF systems have been carried out: one with a signed squared stiffness and one with a cubic stiffness. The purpose of these simulations was to identify a nonlinearity that introduces a similar behavior in the SDOF system dynamics as the nonlinear behavior observed in the dynamic properties of a clamped boring bar. The third and final part of this thesis focuses on vibration analysis methods in engineering education. A signal analyzer (which is a commonly used instrument in signal processing and vibration analysis) was made accessible via the Internet. Assignments were developed for students to learn and practice vibration analysis on real signals from a real setup of a relevant structure; a clamped boring bar. Whilst the experimental setup was fixed, the instrument and sensor configuration nonetheless enable a variety of experiment, for example: excitation signal analysis, spectrum analysis and experimental modal analysis...|$|E
