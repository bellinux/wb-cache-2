40|$|Abstract Background In England and Wales, the Department of Health {{introduced}} a primary prevention programme, NHS Health Checks, to provide screening for cardiovascular risk amongst people aged 40 - 74. The {{aim of this}} programme is to offer treatment and advice to those identified with {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The North East of England has some of the highest rates of CVD in the UK and prevention is therefore a priority. NHS Tees funded this programme of work under the local branding of Healthy <b>Heart</b> <b>Checks</b> (HHC). These were initially implemented principally through GP practices from October 2008 but, in order to mitigate the possibility that some hard to reach communities would be reluctant to engage with some primary care settings, plans were also developed to deliver the programme through workplace settings and through community pharmacies. This paper reports specifically on the findings from the evaluation in respect of the setting up of HHCs in community pharmacies and aims to offer some lessons for other service settings where this option is seen as a way of providing low threshold services which will minimise inequalities in intervention uptake. Methods In assessing the community pharmacy component of HHCs, a selection of staff having direct involvement in the process was invited {{to take part in the}} evaluation. Interviews were carried out with representatives from community pharmacy, staff members from the commissioning Primary Care Trusts and with Local Pharmaceutical Committee members. Results Evaluation and analysis identified challenges which should be anticipated and addressed in initiating HHC in community pharmacies. These have been categorised into four main themes for discussion in this paper: (1) establishing and maintaining pharmacy Healthy <b>Heart</b> <b>Checks,</b> (2) overcoming IT barriers, (3) developing confident, competent staff and (4) ensuring volume and through flow in pharmacy. Conclusions Delivering NHS health checks through community pharmacies can be a complex process, requiring meticulous planning, and may incur higher than expected costs. Findings from our evaluation provide insight into possible barriers to setting up services in pharmacies which may help other commissioning bodies when considering community pharmacy as a location for primary prevention interventions in future. </p...|$|R

40|$|During tree growth, {{mechanical}} stresses accumulate in the stem {{because of the}} increasing tree weight and wood maturation. These "growth stresses" fulfil essential biomechanical functions: they allow {{the control of the}} tree orientation and improve its resistance against bending loads. But they generate technological problems during tree transformation, causing <b>heart</b> <b>checks</b> after cross-cutting, checks and deformations of boards after sawing, etc [...] . Research in this area aims at understanding how these stresses appear during growth, in order to find solutions to reduce them. Radial profiles of growth stress were studied by measuring the longitudinal strains due to the release of growth stress at different radial positions on diametrical boards. A biomechanical model based on the beam theory adapted to growing structures is presented. It allows calculating growth stress accumulation in a cross-section of any shape, with any distribution of material properties. Experimental profiles were compared to those simulated by the model assuming particular growth scenarios. They were consistent with the predictions of biomechanical models, showing a maximal tension at the periphery of the tree, and an increasing compression towards the tree centre. Asymmetric profiles were sometimes observed, and were consistent with simulations obtained when eccentric diameter growth and asymmetric maturation strains were taken into account. The correspondence between experimental results and simulations provides a first validation of the biomechanical model of growth stress accumulation in stems...|$|R

Honey causes confusion by mistaking Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) for Patrick, but truth prevails, and Honey and Billy become friends. Honey has aspirations to become a model. Billy helps her find employment, acting as her manager. Billy and Honey are attracted to each other, and {{after a period of}} trepidation, they finally confess their feelings and became a couple in December 2005. The following month, Honey falls pregnant. Overjoyed, Billy proposes and despite initial objections from her father, Jack (Nicky Henson), Honey says yes. When Jack discovers that Honey is pregnant, he tries to persuade her to abort her unborn child, convinced that she would share the same fate as her mother. Not wanting to lose Honey, Billy insists that she enquire about an abortion but a check-up reveals that Honey does not have the same heart defect as her mother, so there is no danger of her dying of the same cause. Honey is furious with Jack for making her so unnecessarily fearful about her health all her life, and chastises him for not getting her <b>heart</b> <b>checked</b> when she was a child.

Though the heart is the organ that affects other organs, in other words, the good performance of the heart {{as the source of}} much-needed work of other organs.
