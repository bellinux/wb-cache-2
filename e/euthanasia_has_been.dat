We review the historical aspects of euthanasia, its definition and why no distinction is now made between active and passive euthanasia in the Netherlands. The guidelines for euthanasia, in use in the Utrecht University Hospital, are presented {{and the result of}} some studies on euthanasia is discussed. Non-treatment decisions were taken in 17. 5 % of all deaths in 1990 but only 1. 8 % of all deaths were the result of euthanasia. Life-terminating acts without explicit and persistent request of the patients occurred in 0. 8 % of all deaths. The most common reasons for requests for euthanasia were loss of dignity in 57 %, pain in 46 %, distressing mode of dying in 46 % and being dependent on others in 33 %. Of all medical decisions concerning the end of life 79 % related to patients older than 65 years.

5000|$|Doing {{nothing can}} result {{in the numbers of}} feral cats increasing. A study of six managed colonies in rural North Carolina showed a 36% decline in {{population}} over two years, while three control colonies without TNR increased by 47% on average. Further, animal welfare problems such as high rates of kitten mortality continue to occur. One study suggests that [...] "While still fairly common, this is not a responsible or constructive choice." [...] Removal is an alternative to TNR control their population. Eradication programs [...] "often require years to accomplish and hundreds of hours of work and are only successful in closed populations where no new cats can arrive." [...] Further, methods used often involve poisoning, shooting, hunting, and other methods considered animal cruelty in many North American jurisdictions. Trapping and removal of cats by <b>euthanasia</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used in many communities, but almost never results in a permanent decrease in the cat population. [...] "It is extremely difficult to remove every cat in a particular location, and most locations are not sufficiently isolated to prevent migration of new cats into the ecological vacuum created by cat removal. If there is sufficient food and shelter, new cats will move in from nearby areas, and survivors of the removal program will continue to reproduce until the maximum carrying capacity is reached again." [...] Many local and state governments have turned to TNR as a more effective and humane approach to control feral cat populations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Debate over {{euthanasia}} is not {{a recent}} phenomenon. Over the years, public opinion, decisions of courts, and legal and medical approaches {{to the issue of}} <b>euthanasia</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> con-flicting. The connection between murder and <b>euthanasia</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> attempted in a few debates. Although it is widely accepted that murder is a crime, a clearly defined stand has not been taken on euthanasia. This article considers euthanasia from the medical, legal, and global perspec-tives and discusses the crime of murder in relation to euthanasia, taking into consideration the issue of consent in the law of crime. This article concludes that {{in the midst of this}} debate on euthanasia and murder, the important thing is that different countries need to find their own solution to the issue of euthanasia rather than trying to import solutions from other countries...|$|E

It examines the conditions present at particular periods of time and a specific, but disorderly collection of incidents that have allowed our present constructions of euthanasia to come about.

This genealogy challenges both the origins and functions of our present day ‘knowledge’ regarding euthanasia and the assumptions of self-evidence and inevitability that accompany prevailing discourses...|$|R
