500|$|She {{occasionally}} {{drifted into}} the public's eye, attracting publicity in 1989 when she admitted voting for Labour {{in an election}} as opposed to her father's Conservative Party, and then criticised Margaret Thatcher in print. Regarding her political relationship with her father, Lawson has stated, [...] "My father would never <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> agree with him about anything in particular and, to be honest, we never talk about politics much." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{told him}} to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause {{constantly}} thrown in my face. I {{did not believe that}} a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it. [...] "I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things." ...|$|E

500|$|Daniels {{has said}} {{his time in}} the private sector at Eli Lilly was the {{experience}} that most helped him to serve as an effective governor. [...] "I probably learned more there," [...] Daniels said in 2015. [...] "I’ll say this, I’ve enjoyed each opportunity, but frequently I was asked later, 'What previous experiences helped most to be an effective governor?,' that sort of thing. People would always <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> name something from public life, but probably the experience in business, trying to manage for results, trying to get large numbers of people aligned and headed in a common direction, these were probably the most valuable days I spent." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Victoria's first acts as queen was {{to dismiss}} Conroy {{from her own}} household, though she could not dismiss him from her mother's. Queen Victoria, as an {{unmarried}} young woman, was still expected {{to live with her}} mother, but she relegated the Duchess and Conroy to remote apartments at Buckingham Palace, cutting off personal contact with them. The Duchess unsuccessfully insisted that Conroy and his family be allowed at court; Victoria disagreed, saying: [...] "I thought you would not <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> invite Sir John Conroy after his conduct towards me for some years past." [...] In 1839, the Duke of Wellington convinced Conroy to leave the Duchess's household and take his family to the Continent in effective exile. The Times reported that he no longer had official duties, though they were unsure if he had resigned or been dismissed. That year rumours abounded that Lady Flora Hastings, whose abdomen had grown large, was pregnant by Conroy. A subsequent medical investigation concluded that Lady Flora was a virgin and she died from liver cancer several months later. This scandal, in tandem with the Bedchamber Crisis, damaged Victoria's reputation.|$|E
500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1935, Anne McCormick {{wrote to}} Arthur Hays Sulzberger, [...] "I hope you won't <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> revert to 'woman's-point-of-view' stuff." [...] Later, she interviewed major {{political}} leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues did. Even those who witnessed her in action were unable to explain how she got the interviews she did. Clifton Daniel said, [...] " [...] I'm sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment." [...] Covering world leaders' speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches, they still {{were not allowed to}} ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work. Times reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment. Nan Robertson's article on the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said, [...] "'It will {{come as a surprise to}} you, perhaps, that the reporter is a girl, he began... asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'" [...] The New York Times hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the Chicago Tribune, where [...] "he did a series on maids, going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{recording}} a cover version of Foy Vance's [...] "Make It Rain" [...] for [...] Sons of Anarchy, Sheeran was cast by creator Kurt Sutter to play Sir Cormac {{in the medieval}} drama The Bastard Executioner on FX. He said of his role [...] "It’s gruesome and it’s {{going to be fine}} because my friend wrote it... I feel like people would <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be in a rom-com or something, so I wanted to be in something people don’t expect me to".|$|E
2500|$|Bouazizi, {{angered by}} the confrontation, went to the governor's office to {{complain}} and to ask for his scales back. The governor refused to see or listen to him, even after Bouazizi was quoted as saying, [...] "If you don't see me, I'll burn myself." [...] Bouazizi then acquired a can of gasoline from a nearby gas station {{and returned to the}} governor's office. While {{standing in the middle of}} traffic, he shouted, [...] "How do you <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make a living?" [...] He then doused himself with the gasoline and set himself alight with a match at [...] local time, less than an hour after the altercation.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} critics have commented {{that as he}} grew older the line that {{distinguished}} Thompson from his literary self became increasingly blurred. Thompson himself admitted during a 1978 BBC interview that he sometimes felt pressured {{to live up to}} the fictional self that he had created, adding [...] "I'm never sure which one people <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be. Very often, they conflict— most often, as a matter of fact.... I'm leading a normal life and right alongside me there is this myth, and it is growing and mushrooming and getting more and more warped. When I get invited to, say, speak at universities, I'm not sure if they are inviting Duke or Thompson. I'm not sure who to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, {{who flew}} back to the state from New Hampshire during his presidential campaign, left to resume campaigning shortly after the storm passed. He was criticized for his quick {{departure}} and heated responses to questions about why he left the state. He stated that while there was some locally significant flood damage in Southern New Jersey, the overall effects across the state did not warrant his presence. He responded to one person by saying, [...] "I don’t know what you <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do. You {{want me to go}} down there with a mop?" [...] A Stockton University graduate started up a fund to provide 1,000mops to Christie in response to his comment. On January26, Christie apologized to North Wildwood Mayor Patrick Rosenello for calling him [...] "crazy" [...] during his response to criticism the day prior. Christie also requested that Rosenello apologize on his behalf to first responders, residents, and business owners.|$|E
2500|$|French {{at first}} {{reported}} to Kitchener that the German attacks by Fourth and Sixth Armies were their [...] "last card" [...] and the BEF were holding them off. [...] He was unimpressed by Smith-Dorrien telling him (midnight on 25 October) that his Corps [...] "might go during the night", {{although he did}} send reinforcements. Generals Macdonogh and Radcliffe later testified to the Official Historian Edmonds in the early 1920s that French [...] "believed what he wished to believe" [...] and [...] "never could believe that the Germans were not at their last gasp". [...] He thought [...] "everything was going splendidly" [...] and [...] "the Germans were exhausted" [...] until warned of the arrival of German reinforcements, at which point he (allegedly) grew angry and banged his fist on the table shouting [...] "How do you <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> carry out my campaign if you carry on bringing up these blasted divisions?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{attacks on}} Clark were not entirely {{politically}} motivated. Clark's professional {{reputation as a}} historian declined during the later period of his life, and the final two volumes of the History were given scant attention by other serious historians, regardless of their political views. This was {{not because they were}} seen as too [...] "left-wing," [...] but because they were seen as verbose, repetitive and with few new insights to offer. Clark's publisher at MUP, Peter Ryan, maintains that leading historians acknowledged to him in private that the later volumes of the History were inferior work, but would not say so publicly out of respect for Clark, or out of a reluctance to give ammunition to the political attacks on him. [...] "By the time Volume V was published in 1981, this approached the proportions of a professional scandal. Quadrant, for example, asked five of Australia's leading historians to review it, and received five more of less identical replies: 'It's a terrible book, but you can't <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say that in print".|$|E
2500|$|One {{remaining}} competitor was Octave Lapize. In {{the fifth}} stage, Defraye {{had problems with}} his knees, and was more than fifteen minutes behind Lapize. Defraye came back, and kept Lapize one point behind him in the general classification. In the sixth stage, Defraye attacked and only Lapize could follow, as they climbed the major Alp mountains together. Then Defraye punctured, and Lapize won the stage, so Lapize shared the lead with Defraye. In the seventh stage, Defraye punctured again, but {{he came back and}} won the stage. The eighth stage was a flat stage, and the fight was expected to continue in the ninth stage. Before the ninth stage, Lapize was only 2 points behind. During that stage in the Pyrénées, Defraye broke away on the Col de Portet d'Aspet, and Lapize could not follow. Later, Lapize stopped in protest because all the Belgians were riding for Defraye. Lapize said: [...] "How can you <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> challenge in such conditions?" [...] The rest of his team La Française, the two remaining Charles Crupelandt and Marcel Godivier did not start the next stage, also in protest.|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, 2016, David Feldman Promotions {{confirmed}} a {{fight between}} Jones and undefeated bare-knuckle fighter and former world title challenger Bobby Gunn would be announced for February 17, 2017 for the vacant WBF Cruiserweight championship {{at a press conference}} on December 6 at the Chase Center in Delaware. At the time of announcement, Gunn was a former IBA cruiserweight champion and bare-knuckle heavyweight champion, with a record of 72-0 with 72 knockouts. The fight was made official at the press conference on December 7. Jones spoke of his long-awaited desire to fight Gunn, [...] "I always do things that people don't <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do. I promised Bobby {{a long time ago that}} I would give him the opportunity, and I am a man of my word. Come February 17th, I am going to shock the world again." [...] At the official weigh-in Jones came in 199 pounds and Gunn weighed in lighter at 197.4 pounds. In a slow-paced fight, Jones stopped Gunn in the beginning of the 8th round, before Gunn had even left his corner, to win the vacant World Boxing Foundation cruiserweight title. Gunn injured his nose and was out boxed by Jones throughout seven rounds. In the post fight, Jones and Gunn both embraced.|$|E
