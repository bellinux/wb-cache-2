25|$|Prior to Rhodesia's internationally {{recognised}} independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, an {{arms embargo}} {{imposed by the}} United Nations limited the nation's ability to modernise its arsenal. As part of a <b>general</b> <b>import</b> substitution <b>programme</b> initiated during the Rhodesian Bush War, commercial vehicles were converted for military uses and several types of light ammunition manufactured. Small arms such as the Kommando LDP and the Rhogun submachine guns were also produced, although primarily for civilians; most Rhodesian weaponry was designed with those unaccustomed to handling firearms in mind. The local industry remained dependent on South African technical assistance to promote the export of its products and facilitate general distribution. Individual weapons were assembled by joint efforts between civilian engineers and companies that processed the raw metals. Rhodesian security forces occasionally cooperated with their South African counterparts to design equipment which could later be produced in South Africa and imported {{in violation of the}} embargo.|$|R

40|$|Porin, also {{termed the}} voltage-dependent anion channel, {{is the most}} {{abundant}} protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane. The process of import and assembly of the protein {{is known to be}} dependent on the surface receptor Tom 20, but the requirement for other mitochondrial proteins remains controversial. We have used mitochondria from Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to analyze the import pathway of porin. Import of porin into isolated mitochondria in which the outer membrane has been opened is inhibited despite similar levels of Tom 20 as in intact mitochondria. A matrix-destined precursor and the porin precursor compete for the same translocation sites in both normal mitochondria and mitochondria whose surface receptors have been removed, suggesting that both precursors utilize the <b>general</b> <b>import</b> pore. Using an assay established to monitor the assembly of in vitro–imported porin into preexisting porin complexes we have shown that besides Tom 20, the biogenesis of porin depends on the central receptor Tom 22, as well as Tom 5 and Tom 7 of the <b>general</b> <b>import</b> pore complex (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane [TOM] core complex). The characterization of two new mutant alleles of the essential pore protein Tom 40 demonstrates that the import of porin also requires a functional Tom 40. Moreover, the porin precursor can be cross-linked to Tom 20, Tom 22, and Tom 40 on its import pathway. We conclude that import of porin does not proceed through the action of Tom 20 alone, but requires an intact outer membrane and involves at least four more subunits of the TOM machinery, including the <b>general</b> <b>import</b> pore...|$|R
