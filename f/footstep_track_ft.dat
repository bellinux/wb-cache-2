Introduction: Fast <b>track</b> (<b>FT)</b> cardiac surgery and early extubation (EE) are aimed at safe and effective rapid post-op-erative progression to discharge, and have been practiced {{for more than two}} decades. Their goal is to optimize patient care perioperatively in order to decrease costs without negatively affecting morbidity and mortality. However, the fac-tors that predict successful EE are poorly understood, and patients with significant co-morbidities are frequently ex-cluded from protocols. We hypothesize that independent of disease severity, early extubation leads to shorter hospita...|$|R
40|$|The present-day {{picture of}} the Eurasian plate {{basement}} units in the Central Alps {{is that of a}} Varis-can consolidated continental crust that towards S (and with increasing metamorphic grade) changes into an body of increasing Alpine deformation with tectonic slicing in the north but nappe formation in the south. The current outcrops of the crystalline rocks within Helvetic and Subpenninic units has been attributed to late shortening and thrusting within the crystalline basement and erosion of their cover. Fission <b>track</b> (<b>FT)</b> data enable us to quantify the late-stage exhumation and illustrate the relatively late incorporation of the Aar and Gotthard crystalline rocks into the Alpine orogeny in the Tertiary (Her-wegh & Pfiffner 2005).

40|$|Amsterdam Aiport Schiphol (AAS) has the {{ambition}} of becoming Europe's cargo preferred airport. However, {{in addition to}} facing spare capacity for future growth, past research has shown key issues preventing it from reaching this goal. Some of these are truck waiting times, long throughput times and 1 st line warehouse efficiency. One of the logistical concepts aimed at solving these is a Fast <b>Track</b> (<b>FT),</b> based on the transshipment purpose of a cross-dock. The focus {{of this research is}} thus to answer: "How can the input and output distribution processes of a Fast <b>Track</b> (<b>FT)</b> at AAS facilitate a seamless flow {{in the context of a}} multi-actor environment?" Having conducted a thorough process analysis and literature review, different designs are proposed based on the airside distribution, the existence of FT storage and the push/pull nature of the system. A simulation study is conducted in Simio with the goal of understanding if the designs have an effect on the KPIs and if these are relevant. When contrasted to the single handler distribution, the multiple handlers one proved to positively impact lead time (LT), reducing it from 2. 3 to 1. 6 hours and decreasing variability by 50 %. The remaining designs are tested on this configuration and based on it, a design with storage and a push nature selected. The existence of storage affected LT whereas the Push designs positively impacted the landside KPIs. As a conclusion, the decision-making power needs to rest in the FT operator so that the dynamism of the push/pull logic can be sustained and as a consequence, stream and efficient operations ensured.

40|$|In {{response}} to crowding in hospital emergency departments (ED), {{efforts have been}} made to increase patient flow through the Fast <b>Track</b> (<b>FT).</b> The use of FT, however, has not always been accompanied by an increase in the overall patient flow, sometimes leaving the FT underutilized. We find that this is mainly caused by the current practice of assigning patients to FT based only on the Emergency Severity Index. One index for two functional requirements results in a coupling between prioritizing of patients and encouraging the fast flow of them. By introducing a new index for patient flow, we could uncouple this design problem and significantly decrease the overall patient waiting time (~ 50 %) compared to that of the existing use of FT.
