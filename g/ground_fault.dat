25|$|Residual current breaker with {{over-current}} protection (RCBO) — {{combines the}} functions of an RCD and an MCB in one package. In the United States and Canada, panel-mounted devices that combine ground (earth) fault detection and over-current protection are called <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> interrupter (GFI) breakers; a wall mounted outlet device or separately enclosed plug-in device providing <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> detection and interruption only (no overload protection) is called a <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> circuit interrupter (GFCI).|$|E
25|$|High-resistance {{grounding}} (HRG) systems use an NGR {{to limit}} the fault current to 25A or less. They have a continuous rating, and are designed to operate with a single-ground fault. This means that the system will not immediately trip on the first <b>ground</b> <b>fault.</b> If a second <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> occurs, a <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> protection relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit. On an HRG system, a sensing resistor is used to continuously monitor system continuity. If an open-circuit is detected (e.g., due to a broken weld on the NGR), the monitoring device will sense voltage through the sensing resistor and trip the breaker. Without a sensing resistor, the system could continue to operate without ground protection (since an open circuit condition would mask the <b>ground</b> <b>fault)</b> and transient overvoltages could occur.|$|E

40|$|This paper treats fault {{detection}} in DC distributed power systems, {{with emphasis on}} <b>ground</b> <b>faults.</b> The difficulty of detecting <b>ground</b> <b>faults</b> arises {{from the fact that}} the AC sources and loads are ungrounded or have heavy impedance to ground, on the converter side, to effectively block zero sequence currents otherwise flowing between the AC systems. A grounding scheme for the DC distribution system together with algorithms for detection of <b>ground</b> <b>faults</b> is presented. The proposed method detects <b>ground</b> <b>faults</b> on both the AC and DC sides and is extended to cover also short circuit faults with a minor work effort, which is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} handle the {{situation}} of power system <b>grounding</b> <b>fault</b> better, this paper built the mathematical model of power system resonance <b>grounding</b> <b>fault</b> based on the resonance grounding principle.

The obtained results show that there will appear zero sequence current at each point of power system when the <b>grounding</b> <b>faults</b> occurrs. And if the circuit has the point of biggest amplitude of zero sequence current, then {{it is just the}} fault phases. The simulation data further verified that arc suppression coil grounding could directly decreases the grounding current when the single-phase <b>grounding</b> <b>fault</b> occurred. Moreover, it effectively eliminates the arc from the process and becomes the more reasonable grounding mode...|$|R

30|$|Taking GZ-HVDC as an example, {{assessments}} of fault areas that cause CF {{are carried out}} by PSCAD/EMTDC simulations and by the proposed method, for comparison. Four types of AC system faults are applied in the PSCAD/EMTDC models of the CSG: a three-phase <b>fault,</b> a single-phase <b>grounding</b> <b>fault,</b> a two-phase <b>grounding</b> <b>fault,</b> and a two-phase short-circuit fault.

25|$|Residual-current and {{overcurrent}} protection {{may be combined}} in one device for installation into the service panel; this device {{is known as a}} GFCI (<b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> circuit interrupter) breaker in the USA and Canada, and as an RCBO (residual-current circuit breaker with overload protection) in Europe. In the US, GFCI breakers are more expensive than GFCI outlets.|$|E
25|$|Low-resistance {{grounding}} systems use {{a neutral}} grounding resistor (NGR) {{to limit the}} fault current to 25A or greater. Low resistance grounding systems will have a time rating (say, 10 seconds) that indicates how long the resistor can carry the fault current before overheating.

40|$|Abstract. When {{a circuit}} breaker cuts off a transformer’s {{different}} fault types, there will be different voltage recovery processes. Studying on these transient processes provides bases for the section of breaker and the extraction of fault feature. Based on theoretical analysis and simple calculation, this paper uses PSCAD/EMTDC software to model and emulates every fault system. The results show that when a transformer takes place two-phase <b>grounding</b> <b>fault,</b> the peak of recovery voltage between circuit breaker’s both ends is highest. A conclusion is drawn that when to choose a breaker, {{pay attention to the}} two-phase <b>grounding</b> <b>fault...</b>|$|R
40|$|With growing {{diffusion}} of DC microgrids, <b>ground</b> <b>faults</b> in the DC section of networks {{will become more}} and more likely. This is mainly due to the expected increase in size of such networks. <b>Ground</b> <b>faults</b> may involve significantly high currents, which may not be limited by front-end converters (FECs). The work presented in this paper is focused on the analysis of normal and faulty operation of a DC microgrid interfaced to a low voltage (LV) AC network by means of an IGBT FEC. Two different configurations of the LV star point of the transformer have been considered: connected to and isolated from the midpoint of the DC bus. Normal operation has been analyzed and the presence of high frequency homopolar currents has been detected in the first configuration. <b>Ground</b> <b>faults</b> of the positive pole have also been analyzed with decreasing values of fault resistance. DC values of the fault current and of the DC bus voltage have been analyzed. Moreover, the effect of the presence of a storage device has been investigated...|$|R

25|$|Having one RCD feeding {{another is}} {{generally}} unnecessary, provided {{they have been}} wired properly. One exception {{is the case of}} a TT earthing system, where the earth loop impedance may be high, meaning that a <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> might not cause sufficient current to trip an ordinary circuit breaker or fuse. In this case a special 100 mA (or greater) trip current time-delayed RCD is installed, covering the whole installation, and then more sensitive RCDs should be installed downstream of it for sockets and other circuits that are considered high-risk.|$|E
25|$|Contact voltage energizes objects {{which are}} {{normally}} safe – fences, telephone booths, street signs, etc. Anywhere buried electric wiring exists, a failure {{can occur in}} that wiring and create conditions that allow electricity to flow into the immediate surroundings. Some systems have protective devices such as circuit breakers or <b>Ground</b> <b>Fault</b> Circuit Interrupters (GFCI), designed to isolate such a fault. However, {{in the absence of}} protective devices, if the devices fail, or if they are not installed correctly, a fault will go undetected until it either causes a failure of the circuit or until it is found by a person.|$|E
25|$|Distribution {{power systems}} may be solidly grounded, with one circuit {{conductor}} {{directly connected to}} an earth grounding electrode system. Alternatively, some amount of electrical impedance may be connected between the distribution system and ground, to limit the current that can flow to earth. The impedance may be a resistor, or an inductor (coil). In a high-impedance grounded system, the fault current {{is limited to a}} few amperes (exact values depend on the voltage class of the system); a low-impedance grounded system will permit several hundred amperes to flow on a fault. A large solidly grounded distribution system may have thousands of amperes of <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> current.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new transient based scheme to detect single phase to <b>ground</b> <b>faults</b> (or <b>grounded</b> <b>faults</b> in general) in distribution systems with high penetration of distributed generation. This algorithm combines the fault direction based approach {{and the distance}} estimation based approach {{in order to determine}} the faulted section. The wavelet coefficients of the transient fault currents measured at the interconnection points of the network are used to determine the direction of fault currents and to estimate the distance of the fault. The simulations have been carried out by using DigSilent software package and the results have been processed in MATLAB using the Wavelet Toolbox. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{the same}} way, {{utilizing}} the zero-sequence direction element, the limited wide area backup protection {{can be established}} based on the pilot channel. The high sensitivity and fast protection for the high resistance <b>grounding</b> <b>fault</b> can be achieved.|$|R
50|$|Fault current can {{be limited}} by using current {{limiting}} devices such as grounding resistors or fuses. If the fault current is limited to 5 amperes or less, then many <b>ground</b> <b>faults</b> self-extinguish and do not propagate into phase-to-phase faults.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>Ground</b> <b>Fault</b> Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs), Arc-fault circuit interrupter devices (AFCI) are equally important as they offer added protection from potentially hazardous arc-faults resulting from damage in branch circuit wiring {{as well as}} extensions to branches such as appliances and cord sets. By detecting hazardous arc-faults and responding by interrupting power, AFCIs helps {{reduce the likelihood of}} the home's electrical system being an ignition source of a fire. Dual Function AFCI/GFCI devices offer both electrical fire prevention and shock prevention in one device making them a solution for many rooms in the home, especially when replacing an existing standard receptacle or existing ungrounded receptacle.|$|E
