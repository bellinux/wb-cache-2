5|$|The bells {{that draw}} the knights to the Grail {{ceremony}} at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of Parsifal in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed {{as a substitute}} for church bells. For the first performances, the bells were combined with tam-tam and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams tuned to the pitch of the four chime notes and another tam-tam on which a roll is executed by using a <b>drumstick.</b> In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with tubular bells or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used in the moment of the destruction of Klingsor's castle.|$|E
5|$|Timber {{recruits}} a team {{of eight}} racers: Diddy Kong, the first recruit; Conker the Squirrel and Banjo the Bear, recruited by Diddy; Krunch the Kremling, Diddy's enemy who follows after him; and Tiptup the Turtle, T.T. the Stopwatch, Pipsy the Mouse, and Bumper the Badger, inhabitants of Timber's island. Aided by Taj, an Indian elephant-like genie residing on the island, they eventually complete all of Wizpig's challenges and confront Wizpig himself to a race and defeat him. Shortly afterwards, <b>Drumstick</b> is turned back into a rooster, and Wizpig leaves for his home planet, Future Fun Land. Fearing that Wizpig would again attempt to invade Timber's Island, the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a second challenge. When Wizpig loses the second race, the rocket he rides on malfunctions and launches him to the moon. However, an additional cutscene reveals Wizpig's spaceship flying through the sky, unscathed.|$|E

5|$|Timber the Tiger's parents go {{on holiday}} and leave their son {{in charge of}} the island they live on, leaving him and his friends to {{organize}} a race. Their enjoyment is derailed when an evil intergalactic pig-wizard named Wizpig arrives at Timber's Island and attempts to take it over after having conquered his own planet's racetracks. He turns the island's four guardians (Tricky the Triceratops, Bubbler the Octopus, Bluey the Walrus and Smokey the Dragon) into his henchmen. The only solution available to the island's inhabitants is to defeat Wizpig in an elaborate series of races that involve cars, hovercrafts, and aeroplanes. <b>Drumstick</b> the Rooster, the best racer on the island, failed this challenge and was transformed into a frog by Wizpig's black magic.|$|E

50|$|The long <b>drumsticks</b> {{are often}} cut into shorter lengths and stewed in curries and soups. Because the outer skin is tough and fibrous, <b>drumsticks</b> are often chewed {{to extract the}} juices and nutrients, with the {{remaining}} fibrous material discarded. Others describe a slightly different method of sucking out the flesh and tender seeds and discarding the tube of skin. Traditional dishes which commonly include <b>drumsticks</b> prepared this way include South Indian sambar where it is stewed with lentils, and the Thai dish kaeng som which is a sour curry with <b>drumsticks</b> and fish.|$|R
25|$|In Armenia the dhol {{does not}} have as large of a {{circumference}} and is usually played with the hands, although a wooden, spoon-shaped <b>drumstick</b> is also used. It is frequently heard in Armenian folk music. Not only is it in folk music but also in modern music as well, even having solos in many prominent songs.|$|E
25|$|Bass drums {{are also}} highly visible in modern drum kits. In 1909, William Ludwig created a {{workable}} bass drum pedal, which would strike a two-headed bass drum {{in much the}} same way as a <b>drumstick.</b> During the 1960s, many rock ‘n’ roll drummers began incorporating more than one bass drum in their drum kit, including The Who's Keith Moon and Cream's Ginger Baker.|$|E
25|$|Moringa oleifera is {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} species of the genus Moringa, {{which is the only}} genus in the family Moringaceae. English common names include: moringa, <b>drumstick</b> tree (from the appearance of the long, slender, triangular seed-pods), horseradish tree (from the taste of the roots, which resembles horseradish), ben oil tree, or benzoil tree (from the oil which is derived from the seeds). It is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree, native to the southern foothills of the Himalayas in northwestern India, and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas where its young seed pods and leaves are used as vegetables. It can also be used for water purification and hand washing, and is sometimes used in herbal medicine.|$|E

500|$|Peart {{has also}} {{designed}} his own signature series <b>drumstick</b> with Pro-Mark. [...] The Promark PW747W, Neil Peart Signature drumsticks, {{are made of}} Japanese White Oak, which adds more weight than a standard hickory stick. They have the thickness of a standard 5A (0.551", 1.4cm) but are longer (16.25", 41.3cm) with a thicker taper and larger olive shaped wooden tip. When Rush held their Time Machine Tour, Pro-Mark released three limited edition sticks, each {{with one of the}} three designs selected from Peart's [...] "Steam Punk" [...] tour kit printed with copper ink. Some other artists who use the Neil Peart Signature series include Ben Johnston of Biffy Clyro, Richie Hayward of Little Feat and Paul Garred of The Kooks.|$|E
500|$|Two fiddles, a bow, a still shawm or doucaine, three three-hole pipes, and a tabor drum with a <b>drumstick</b> {{were found}} {{throughout}} the wreck. These would {{have been used for}} the personal enjoyment of the crew and to provide a rhythm to work on the rigging and turning the capstans on the upper decks. The tabor drum is the earliest known example of its kind and the <b>drumstick</b> of a previously unknown design. The tabor pipes are considerably longer than any known examples from the period. Their discovery proved that contemporary illustrations, previously viewed with some suspicion, were in fact accurate depictions of the instruments. Before the discovery of the Mary Rose shawm, an early predecessor to the oboe, instrument historians had been puzzled by reference to [...] "still shawms", or [...] "soft" [...] shawms, that were said to have a sound that was less shrill than earlier shawms. The still shawm disappeared from the musical scene some time in the 16th century, and the instrument found on the Mary Rose is the only surviving example. A reproduction has been made and played. Combined with a pipe and tabor, it provides a [...] "very effective bass part" [...] that would have produced [...] "rich and full sound, which would have provided excellent music for dancing on board ship". Only a few other fiddle-type instruments from the 16th century exist, but none of them of the type found on the Mary Rose. Reproductions of both fiddles have been made, though less is known of their design than the shawm since the neck and strings were missing.|$|E

500|$|Blyton {{published}} several further books {{featuring the}} character of Scamp the terrier, following on from The Adventures of Scamp, a novel she had released in 1943 under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock. Scamp Goes on Holiday (1952) and Scamp and Bimbo, Scamp at School, Scamp and Caroline and Scamp Goes to the Zoo (1954) were illustrated by Pierre Probst. She introduced {{the character of}} Bom, a stylish toy drummer dressed in a bright red coat and helmet, alongside Noddy in TV Comic in July 1956. A book series began the same year with [...] Bom the Little Toy Drummer, featuring illustrations by R. Paul-Hoye, and followed with Bom and His Magic <b>Drumstick</b> (1957), Bom Goes Adventuring and Bom Goes to Ho Ho Village (1958), Bom and the Clown and Bom and the Rainbow (1959) and Bom Goes to Magic Town (1960). In 1958 she produced two annuals featuring the character, {{the first of which}} included twenty short stories, poems and picture strips.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Adventure Mode", players {{control the}} racer {{of their choice}} to {{progress}} through the story. Players begin on Timber's Island, which consists of five interconnected worlds; Dino Domain, Snowflake Mountain, Sherbet Island, Dragon Forest, and Future Fun Land. Each world contains four race tracks, an unlockable battle stage, a race against a boss character, and a trophy challenge with all four race tracks. Depending on the race track, players may {{have a choice of}} using either a car, hovercraft or aeroplane (Choice is restricted on some tracks). Each race track contains boosters to racers that cross them, and balloons of various colours that provide power-ups to racers. Winning a race earns one gold balloon. Then if the player collects all the gold balloons and wins the boss race, they earn one piece of the wizpig amulet. Then if the player collects all of them, they face Wizpig. Then if they beat Wizpig, they unlock <b>Drumstick</b> the rooster as a playable character, as well as Future Funland. If the player collects all the gold balloons and defeats Wizpig in Future Fun Land, the player will be able to play in a mode called [...] "Adventure 2". In this mode, all of the balloons change colour to platinum and the tracks are inverted from left to right. The game also features four battle modes which consist of two deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag-style battle and a mode which involves opponents capturing eggs.|$|E
