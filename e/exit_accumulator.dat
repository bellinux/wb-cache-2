These systems store energy in high pressure hydraulic fluid accumulators, and require a high-pressure shutoff valve (HPSOV) to seal them when not in use. The goal of this project was to design a HPSOV that: a) when “open” allows flow in and out with minimal pressure drop, b) when normally “closed” allows fluid to enter the accumulator but not to <b>exit</b> the <b>accumulator,</b> and c) would equalize the pressure {{on both sides of}} the valve when opening. Other safety and reliability concerns were also addressed...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss a}} scheme for {{injection}} without losses from the H/sup -/ linac into the accumulator and compressor of the neutrino factory- muon collider facility under study at CERN. Protons are {{produced in the}} peak field regions of a wiggler by Lorentz stripping of excited H /sup 0 / atoms produced by Lorentz stripping of the incoming H/sup -/ beam. The excitation of the H/sup 0 / atoms is obtained by laser light stored in Fabry-Perot cavities. The cavities are powered by continuous lasers. Protons emerging from the wiggler stay in the accumulator. The beam of residual H/sup 0 /s emerging from the wiggler <b>exits</b> the <b>accumulator</b> and is exploited for low-energy applications. The sharing of H/sup 0 /s between the accumulator and the low-energy applications {{is controlled by the}} number of powered Fabry-Perot cavities. (38 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|Chained turbo {{equalization}} (CHATUE) is {{a simple}} detection scheme for block transmission without cyclic prefix (CP), where turbo equalizers for the several consecutive frames exchange information about the interference components {{in the form of}} a posteriori Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR). Although elimination of CP in the block transmission can significantly increase bandwidth efficiency, the received signal suffers from inter-block interference (IBI), which can not be effectively compensated by block-by-block equalization. In this paper, we apply the CHATUE algorithm to effectively suppress inter-symbol interference (ISI), inter-carrier interference (ICI), and multiple-access interference (MAI) in a Multiuser Single Input Multiple Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MU-SIMO-OFDM) system without CP. Results of computer simulations show the superiority of our proposed MU-SIMO-OFDM to conventional CP-aided systems, without requiring high computational complexity. The convergence property of the proposed technique is analyzed using the extrinsic information transfer (<b>EXIT)</b> chart. Doped <b>accumulator</b> is used to achieve a mutual information point close enough to the (1, 1) point, and also to obtain better matching between the equalizer and decoder EXIT curves...|$|R
40|$|Accumulators are {{important}} components {{used in many}} systems at commercial boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors in the United States. The accumulators are vessels attached to fluid systems to provide 1) a limited backup source of stored fluid energy for hydraulic/pneumatic mechanical equipment, 2) a damping effect on pressure pulses in fluid systems, and 3) a volume of fluid to be injected passively into a fluid system. Accumulators contain a gas that is compressed or expanded as the fluid from the system enters or <b>exits</b> the <b>accumulator.</b> The gas and fluid in accumulators are usually separated from each other by a piston or bladder. In support of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Nuclear Aging Research Program (NPAR), the Pacific Northwest Laboratory conducted an analysis of available industry databases to determine if accumulator components already had been studied in other NPAR assessments and to evaluate each accumulator type for applicable aging issues. The results of this preliminary study indicate that two critical uses of accumulators have been previously evaluated by the NPAR program. NUREGICR- 5699, Aging and Service Wear of Control Rod Drive Mechanisms for BUT Nuclear Plants (Greene 199 I), identified two hydraulic control unit components subject to aging failures: accumulator nitrogen-charging cartridge valves and the scram water accumulator. In addition, NUREGICR- 6001, Aging Assessment of BWR Standby Liquid Control Systems (Buckley et al. 1992), identified two predominant aging-related accumulator failures that result {{in a loss of}} the nitrogen blanket pressure: (charging) valve wear and failure of the gas bladder. The present study has identified five prevalent aging-related accumulator failures: rupture of the accumulator bladder separation of the metal disc {{from the bottom of the}} bladder leakage of the gas from the charging valve leakage past the safety injection tank manway cover gasket leakage past O-rings. An additional study of the accumulator subcomponents associated with these failures is recommended, including an evaluation of current inspection programs to verify that they are detecting the aging degradation effects. The study may also provide beneficial input to the design of passive accumulator applications in advanced reactor designs...|$|R
