50|$|Electrified barbed wires {{were used}} to block the main {{entrance}} to the community along with old burnt out cars and sharp metal scraps and cement. These barriers were further fortified {{by the use of}} IEDs made from cooking gas cylinders armed with electronically <b>detonated</b> <b>fuses.</b> Manholes were uncovered and filled with spikes and the roads were lined with hidden IEDs made from somatol explosives.|$|R
50|$|History-The EWA is {{currently}} {{pushing for a}} Superfund status for Pompton Lakes, a community located in northern New Jersey. DuPont began manufacturing explosives in the town when it acquired Laflin & Rand Powder Company in 1902. During World War 1, employment and production at the factories surged, where the company size increased from 300 {{to a high of}} 7,500. Production mainly focused on munitions, including rifle and hand grenades, blasting caps, <b>detonating</b> <b>fuses,</b> boosters, and primer. During World War II production and employment once again increased, and employees were bussed in from surrounding cities to meet this demand. Once again production centered around munitions.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} booster {{separation}} motors on {{each end of}} each SRB. The BSMs separate the SRBs from the external tank. The solid rocket motors in each cluster of four are ignited by firing redundant NSD pressure cartridges into redundant confined <b>detonating</b> <b>fuse</b> manifolds.|$|E
50|$|VoD can be {{measured}} by using the D'Autriche method.In essence, this method relies on the time lag between the initiation of two ends of a detonating fuse,inserted radially at two points into the explosive charge at a known distance apart.When the explosive charge is detonated, it triggers {{one end of the}} fuse, then the second end. This causes two detonation fronts travelling in opposite direction {{along the length of the}} <b>detonating</b> <b>fuse,</b> which meet at a specific point away from the centre of the fuse. Knowing the distance along the detonation charge between the two ends of the fuse,the position of the collision of the detonation fronts, and the VoD of the <b>detonating</b> <b>fuse,</b> the VoD of the explosive is calculated and is expressed in km/s.|$|E
5000|$|The M56 is the M26A1 with {{a larger}} 5/8-inch fuze well. It uses the M215 <b>detonating</b> <b>fuse</b> (with a delay of 4-5 seconds) and has a [...] "jungle clip" [...] like the M61. The M215 {{is similar to the}} M213 fuse used in the M33-series grenades except it has a curved lever rather than the bent {{straight}} lever of the M213.|$|E

5000|$|The Mk 2 {{used the}} M5, M6, M10, M11, or M204 series fuses. The early M5, and the later M6 and M204 series <b>detonating</b> <b>fuses,</b> were used on high explosive-filled grenades. The M10 and M11 series igniting fuses were used on low explosive-filled ones. The early fuses had many problems. In the M5, {{moisture}} {{could get in}} under the foil fuse cap, causing the weapon to fail to <b>detonate.</b> The early <b>fuses</b> were not completely silent and made a loud [...] "bang" [...] and produced sparks when activated. They also made a faint [...] "hissing" [...] sound while burning, potentially alerting the enemy of their presence. The M10, used during the interwar period, and the M10A1, used early in WWII, sometimes prematurely detonated when the flash from the primer hit the explosive charge rather than the delay fuse. They were replaced by the M10A2 and M10A3. A less common type of igniting fuse was the M11.|$|R
50|$|Counter-battery radars {{operate at}} {{microwave}} frequencies with relatively high average energy consumption (up to {{the tens of}} kilowatts). The area immediately forward of the radar array for high energy radars is dangerous to human health. The intense radar waves of systems like the AN/TPQ-36 can also <b>detonate</b> electrically <b>fused</b> ammunition at short ranges.|$|R
5000|$|The central character, a {{businessman}} called Biedermann, is {{seen at the}} outset reading newspaper reports of arson, convinced that he could never be taken in. Within minutes, the first [...] "hawker" [...] has appeared (Schmitz), and {{through a combination of}} intimidation and persuasion he talks his way into spending the night in the attic. As the play unfolds, a second arsonist appears (Eisenring), and before Biedermann can do anything to stop it, his attic is piled high with oil drums full of petrol. He even helps them to measure the <b>detonating</b> <b>fuse</b> and gives them matches, refusing to believe the full horror of what is happening. He soon becomes an accomplice in his own downfall.|$|E
50|$|McDonnell {{engineers}} came up {{with two}} different quick release hatches for the Mercury spacecraft. One with a latch, used on Ham's (a chimpanzee) MR-2 and Shepard's MR-3 missions. The other design was an explosive release hatch. The quick release latching hatch weighed 69 lb (31 kg), {{too much of a}} weight addition to use on the orbital version of the spacecraft. The explosive hatch design used the 70 bolts of the original design, but each quarter-inch (6.35 mm) titanium bolt had a 0.06 in hole bored into it to provide a weak point. A mild <b>detonating</b> <b>fuse</b> (MDF) was installed in a channel between the inner and outer seal around the periphery of the hatch. When the MDF was ignited, the resulting gas pressure between the inner and outer seal would cause the bolts to fail in tension.|$|E

Realizing that a detonation of explosives would prematurely disclose to the enemy the assault about to be carried out, and with full knowledge of the peril involved, Ens. Parle unhesitatingly risked his life to extinguish a smoke pot accidentally ignited in a boat carrying charges of high explosives, <b>detonating</b> <b>fuses</b> and ammunition. Undaunted by fire and blinding smoke, he entered the craft, quickly snuffed out a burning fuse, and after failing in his desperate efforts to extinguish the fire pot, finally seized it with both hands and threw it over the side. Although he succumbed a week later from smoke and fumes inhaled, Ens. Parle's heroic self-sacrifice prevented grave damage to the ship and personnel and insured the security of a vital mission. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|R

40|$|Mild <b>detonating</b> <b>fuse</b> is an {{extruded}} {{aluminum tube}} that contains explosive material. Fuse prepared {{by a new}} supplier (Company B) exhibited a formability problem and was analyzed to determine the source of that formability problem. The formability problem was associated with cracking of the aluminum tube when it was bent around a small radius. Mild <b>detonating</b> <b>fuse</b> prepared by the existing supplier of product (Company A) did not exhibit a formability problem. The two fuses were prepared using different aluminum alloys. The microstructure and chemical composition of the two aluminum alloys were compared. It {{was found that the}} microstructure of the Company A aluminum exhibited clear signs of dynamic recrystallization while the Company B aluminum did not. Recrystallization results in the removal of dislocations associated with work hardening and will dramatically improve formability. Comparison of the chemical composition of the two aluminum alloys revealed that the Company A aluminum contained significantly lower levels of impurity elements (specifically Fe and Si) than the COMPANY B aluminum. It has been concluded that the formability problem exhibited by the COMPANY B material will be solved by using an aluminum alloy with low impurity content such as 1190 -H 18 or 1199 - 0...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to determine the feasibility of using explosive materials to open the diaphragm used {{for the release of}} the chamber pressure in a 4 -inch gas model launcher. A method was developed, using linear-shaped mild <b>detonating</b> <b>fuse</b> for controlled rupture of the stainless steel diaphragm. The diaphragm is ruptured at a predetermined delay time after the gas propellant has reached a given pressure. The tests show that diaphragms can be ruptured at chamber pressures up to 10, 500 psi under the ultimate rupture pressure for the diaphragm...|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} survey and a test program {{to develop and}} evaluate an advanced confined linear energy source were conducted. The advanced confined linear energy source is an explosive or pyrotechnic X-Cord (mild <b>detonating</b> <b>fuse)</b> supported inside a confining tube capable of being hermetically sealed and retaining all products of combustion. The energy released by initiation of the X-Cord is transmitted through the support material to {{the walls of the}} confining tube causing an appreciable change in cross sectional configuration and expansion of the tube. When located in an assembly that can accept and use the energy of the tube expansion, useful work is accomplished through fracture of a structure, movement of a load, reposition of a pin, release of a restraint, or similar action. The tube assembly imparts that energy without release of debris or gases from the device itself. This facet of the function is important to the protection of men or equipment located in close proximity to the system during the time of function...|$|E
50|$|As {{providing}} {{terminal guidance}} {{for such a}} high-speed object would likely be difficult, RKKVs are usually proposed as a strategic weapon targeted against large and predictable targets such as planets. However, they can still be used against smaller targets like spaceships, by aiming the weapons in the area they are in, and <b>detonating</b> a <b>fuse</b> in advance to shatter the mass into swarms of smaller particles, all traveling at nearly the same speed. This would cover a much larger area, and destroy smaller targets in space. Accelerating a mass to such velocities {{in the first place}} will likely require vast amounts of energy and large, unwieldy accelerators.|$|R

40|$|Explosives and its {{accessories}} are {{the cheapest}} {{source of energy}} to excavate the rock for mining industry. On detonation, explosives and blasting accessories produce various types of energy like shock, gas, light, heat, sound, seismic etc,. A good energy product enhances the production and productivity of the mine. It has been experienced that the open pit mining operations are feasible up to 90 m depth and below this it is neither economical nor technically convenient. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} dig out the coal through underground mining operations below this depth to fulfill the demand of power. An underground coal-mine contains methane air mixture and coal dust which are highly inflammable in nature. During blasting they may ignite and causes accidents. Every year, in India and abroad many accidents occur in underground coal mines during the firing of explosive and its accessories. The flame characteristics and detonation temperature of explosives and its accessories are mainly responsible for the ignition of methane air mixture and coal dust.

40|$|The aim {{of study}} is to confirm a new {{technique}} that can crush the frozen soil and/or ice block using underwater shock wave generated by the underwater explosion of explosive. This technique {{can lead to the}} earlier sowing, which can have the larger harvest because the duration of sunshine increases. Especially, in Hokkaido prefecture, Japan, if the sowing is carried out in April, we can expect to have 150 % of harvest in the ordinary season. In the case of small processing area such as road repairing, frozen soil is thawed by using the heat of gas burner and/or the electric heater. It is not a suitable plan to apply these heating methods to agriculture, {{from the point of view}} enormous amount of processing area. Thawing technique for frozen soil is effective against the cold regions, for example, Russia, Norway, and Sweden, etc. At first, we carried out experiments using a <b>detonating</b> <b>fuse</b> and ice block. The propagation process of shock wave into the ice block was observed by means of a high-speed camera. In order to check about that influence we tried to give an actual frozen soil a shock wave.
