The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors.

50|$|The pterygo-maxillary or {{zygomatic}} Fossa is an irregularly shaped cavity, situated {{below and}} {{on the inner side}} of the zygoma; bounded, in front, by the zygomatic surface of the superior maxillary bone and the ridge which descends from its malar process; behind, by the posterior border of the external pterygoid plate and the eminentia articularis; above, by the pterygoid ridge on the outer surface of the great wing of the sphenoid and the under part of the squamous portion of the temporal; below by the alveolar border of the superior maxilla; internally, by the external pterygoid plate; and externally, by the zygomatic arch ramus of the lower jaw.

The smallest rodent is the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa, which averages only 4.4 cm in head and body length, with adult females weighing only 3.75 g. Rodents have wide-ranging morphologies, but typically have squat bodies and short limbs. The fore limbs usually have five digits, including an opposable thumb, while the hind limbs have three to five digits. The elbow gives the fore arms great flexibility. The majority of species are plantigrade, walking on both the palms and soles of their feet, and have claw-like nails. The nails of burrowing species tend to be long and strong, while arboreal rodents have shorter, sharper nails. Rodent species use a wide variety of methods of locomotion including quadrupedal walking, running, burrowing, and climbing, bipedal hopping (kangaroo rats and hopping mice), swimming, and even gliding.Scaly-tailed squirrels and flying squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide from tree to tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E

50|$|On the inside, the {{mandible}} presents {{about its}} center the oblique mandibular foramen, for {{the entrance of}} the inferior alveolar vessels and nerve. The margin of this opening is irregular; it presents in front a prominent ridge, surmounted by a sharp spine, the lingula mandibulae, which gives attachment to the sphenomandibular ligament; at its lower and back part is a notch from which the mylohyoid groove runs obliquely downward and forward, and lodges the mylohyoid vessels and nerve. Behind this groove is a rough surface, for the insertion of the <b>internal</b> <b>pterygoid</b> <b>muscle.</b> The mandibular canal runs obliquely downward and forward in the ramus, and then horizontally forward in the body, where it is placed under the alveoli and communicates with them by small openings. On arriving at the incisor teeth, it turns back to communicate with the mental foramen, giving off two small canals which run to the cavities containing the incisor teeth. In the posterior two-thirds of the bone the canal is situated nearer the internal surface of the mandible; and in the anterior third, nearer its external surface. It contains the inferior alveolar vessels and nerve, from which branches are distributed to the teeth.|$|R
40|$|The {{temporomandibular}} {{joint and}} its associated musculature are described in a neonate gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) and {{serve as the basis}} for direct anatomical comparisons with the temporomandibular region in other clades of baleen whales (Mysticeti). Members of the right whale/bowhead whale clade (Balaenidae) are known to possess a synovial lower jaw joint, while members of the rorqual clade (Balaenopteridae) have a nonsynovial temporomandibular joint characterized by a highly flexible fibrocartilaginous pad and no joint capsule. In contrast, the gray whale possesses a modified temporomandibular joint (intermediate condition), with a vestigial joint cavity lacking a fibrous capsule, synovial membrane, and articular disk. In addition, the presence of a rudimentary fibrocartilaginous pad appears to be homologous to that seen in balaenopterid mysticetes. The intrinsic temporomandibular musculature in the gray whale was found to include a multibellied superficial masseter and a single‐bellied deep masseter. The digastric and <b>internal</b> <b>pterygoid</b> <b>muscles</b> in E. robustus are enlarged relative to the condition documented in species of Balaenoptera. A relatively complex insertion of the temporalis muscle on the dentary is documented in the gray whale and the low, knob‐like process on the gray whale dentary is determined to be homologous with the prominent coronoid process of rorquals. Comparison with the anatomy of the temporomandibular musculature in rorquals reveals an increased importance of alpha rotation of the dentary in the gray whale. This difference in muscular morphology and lines of muscle action is interpreted as representing adaptations for suction feeding. Anat Rec, 298 : 680 – 690, 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Sensory {{complaints}} {{in the area}} of the mandible and mouth often escape notice or remain undiagnosed. Using electromyographic recording of the trigeminal reflexes and motor responses, we sought trigeminal dysfunction in 50 patients with peripheral neuropathy, and tried to gain pathophysiological information on the mechanisms provoking trigeminal damage. Trigeminal reflex recordings (early and late blink reflex after supraorbital stimulation, early and late masseter inhibitory reflex after mental stimulation, and jaw jerk) disclosed abnormalities caused by sensory trigeminal neuropathy in 8 out of 15 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), 13 out of 23 patients with severe diabetic polyneuropathy, and in none of 12 patients with mild diabetic polyneuropathy. Six patients had abnormal motor responses in facial or masseter muscles. The response affected most frequently was the masseter early inhibitory reflex (also called first silent period, SP 1) after mental nerve stimulation, its latency being strongly delayed. We found these long delays not only in patients with CIDP, but also in diabetic patients with severe polyneuropathy. We conclude that peripheral polyneuropathies often cause subclinical damage to the trigeminal nerve, especially to its mandibular branch. We believe that the nerve fibers running along the alveolar-mandibular pathway are more exposed to damage because of their cramped anatomical route in the mandibular canal and below the <b>internal</b> <b>pterygoid</b> <b>muscle</b> and fascia.

50|$|Facial {{expressions}} {{are vital}} to social communication between humans. They are caused by the movement of muscles that connect to the skin and fascia in the face. These muscles move the skin, creating lines and folds and causing the movement of facial features, such as the mouth and eyebrows. These muscles develop from the second pharyngeal arch in the embryo. The temporalis, masseter, and <b>internal</b> and external <b>pterygoid</b> <b>muscles,</b> which are mainly used for chewing, have a minor effect on expression as well.

30|$|The infratemporal fossa is {{a highly}} complex {{anatomical}} region that has various nerves and vessels exiting from the foramina of the skull base [17]. The inferior boundary of infratemporal fossa is the medial <b>pterygoid</b> <b>muscle</b> and the temporal bone locates in the superior and posterior region of the infratemporal fossa. Superiorly, it is bounded by a greater wing of sphenoid bone and, anteriorly, by the posterior border of the maxillary sinus [17]. The medial border consists of the pterygopalatine fossa and pterygoid plate [18]. Laterally, the zygomatic arch, temporalis muscle, condyle, parotid gland, and facial nerve are surrounded [19]. The surgical approach to the infratemporal fossa has been performed by the pre-auricular and temporal approach [19]. Osteotomy of the zygomatic arch, mandible condyle, and coronoid process has been performed for surgical access to the middle cranial fossa [17, 20]. The mandibular condylar process is temporarily resected to the access of the infratemporal fossa and excised the chondrosarcoma [21].

Condylar resection was required to access the infratemporal fossa and for complete excision of the mass. Before vertical osteotomy of the mandibular condylar process, plates and screws were pre-drilled on the condylar neck and mandible ramus area. Next, osteotomy was performed from the sigmoid notch to the posterior border of the mandible. After resection of the condyle segment, the crystal mass was carefully dissected from the surrounding structure including the <b>internal</b> maxillary artery, <b>pterygoid</b> <b>muscles,</b> and mandibular nerve (Fig.  2). After excision of the mass, the segmented condyle was anatomically repositioned with the pre-drilled plate and screws (Fig.  3).

40|$|The {{activity}} of the lateral <b>pterygoid</b> <b>muscle</b> has been regarded {{to be related to}} the pathological condition of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in the craniomandibular disorders.

The purpose of this study was to establish a non-invasive method for the evaluation of muscle {{activity of}} the lateral <b>pterygoid</b> <b>muscle</b> using mechanomyogram (MMG). In three male subjects, surface electromyogram (EMG) in the left masseter muscle, left anterior and posterior belly of the temporal muscle, left anterior belly of the digastric muscle and needle EMG of the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid were recorded during mandibular movement tasks simultaneously with the MMG derived from a condenser microphone in the external ear canal.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{does not}} support the hy-pothesis that the angle of the jaw becomes more obtuse with age and loss of dentition. A sample of women was studied radio-grammetrically in a cross-sectional and longitudinal manner. It was demonstrated that the mandibular angle maintains a stable configuration from adulthood to old age regardless of dental status. It is commonly thought that the mandibular angle widens in individuals who have been edentulous for many years. Modern anat-omy textbooks give illustrative and written descriptions of senile changes in the man-dible characterized by obtuseness of the angle between the body and ramus. t 2 In 1865, Humphry 3 gave an explanation of aging changes in the mandible in his treatise on the human skeleton. He said: In order to permit the jaws, deprived of teeth and alveoli, to be brought into something like proximity with one an-other, so that the food may be rubbed down between them and between them and the lips, the angle of the lower jaw again becomes widened to between 130 and 140 degrees, and the neck of the bone is more or less backwards. These changes in the angle and neck are, prob-ably, in some measure, dependent upon the influence of the masseter, <b>internal</b> <b>pterygoid</b> and temporal <b>muscles,</b> which tends to bring the condyle and the ramus into a straight line, after the resistance afforded by the contact of the teeth with those of the upper jaw has been with-drawn.
