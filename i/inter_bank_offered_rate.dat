40|$|We use {{a dynamic}} factor model and a {{detailed}} panel data set with quarterly accounts data on all Norwegian banks {{to study the}} effects of banks' funding costs on their retail rates. Banks' funds are categorized into two groups: customer deposits and long-term wholesale funding (market funding from private and institutional investors including other banks). The cost of market funding is represented in the model by the three-month Norwegian <b>Inter</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (NIBOR) and the spread of unsecured senior bonds issued by Norwegian banks. Our estimates show clear evidence of incomplete pass-through: a unit increase in NIBOR leads to an approximately 0. 8 increase in bank rates. On the other hand, the difference between banks' loan and deposit rates is independent of NIBOR. Our findings are consistent with the view that banks face a downward-sloping demand curve for loans and an upward-sloping supply curve for customer deposits. interest rates; NIBOR; pass-through; funding costs; bank panel data; dynamic factor model...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we examine the}} issue of {{integration}} of financial markets in India. Given the growing movement of capital flows, particularly short-term capital, into the domestic financial markets, {{it is necessary to}} examine this issue so as to reap the positive benefits with having stable markets. For this purpose, the present study examines this issue in the post- 1991 period by using monthly data on call money rates, 91 day Treasury Bill rates, Indian Rupee/US dollar exchange rates, and the London <b>Inter</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (LIBOR). By using a multiple co-integration approach, the study found that there is a strong integration of the domestic call money market with the LIBOR. Though, the study found that there is a long-term co-movement between domestic foreign exchange market and LIBOR, it is not robust. This may be due to frequent intervention by the Central Bank in the foreign exchange market. As the Government securities market in India is still in the developing stage, it was not found to be integrated with the international market. Policy measures (or reforms) are necessary to increase integration of financial markets. This would help in reducing the arbitrage advantage in some specific segment of the financial markets. The degree of integration of financial markets around the world increased significantly during the late 1980 s and 1990 s. A key factor underlying this process has been the increased globalization of investment seeking higher rates of return and the opportunity to diversify risk internationally. At the same time, many countries have encouraged inflows of capital by dismantling restrictions, deregulating domestic financial markets, and improving their economic environment and prospects through the introduction of market-oriented reforms. This increase in the degree o...|$|E
40|$|The arbitrage-free term {{structure}} model of Heath, Jarrow and Morton {{is one of}} the standard tools for the theoretical analysis of fixed income securities and their associated derivatives. A specific HJM model is fully determined by a choice of volatility structure. This is attributed to the forward rate drift restriction of HJM models. Therefore, once the volatility structure is specified one can price–at least theoretically–any derivative in an interest rate market. The question which we have attempted to answer is 2 ̆ 2 what specific HJM model is consistent with the observed price of an Eurodollar futures contract 2 ̆ 2 ? Eurodollar futures, apart from being the worlds heavily traded futures are connected to LIBOR (London <b>Inter</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate)</b> and to domestic monetary conditions. The answer to the above question will help in pricing any new derivative on Eurodollar futures or price the one which is not heavily traded. ^ We restrict ourselves to HJM models with bounded and deterministic integrated volatility, known as Gaussian HJM. The reason why we restrict ourselves to Gaussian framework is for practical purpose. As a first step, we examine the question of normality of Eurodollar futures prices. Then we suggest a simple tool to measure the adequacy of different HJM structures that may be used to model Eurodollar futures price process. A plot of monthly realized volatility will be our machinery. ^ Estimation of volatility is the next major part of this thesis. Although it sounds like a standard Statistical procedure one must be careful in applying methods which are not suitable under arbitrage for example – Maximum Likelihood. However one of the procedures which we employ is ML! This is because of an interesting observation which we make from the estimates obtained through ML and by the method of realized volatility. The latter method is model free and within the confines of arbitrage theory. We then suggest the use of a two-stage procedure to estimate volatility whenever the method of ML or realized volatility poses optimization problems. Finally we conclude by discussing some properties of a one-dimensional Gaussian model which may be considered as an alternate to Ho-Lee and Vasicek. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to fi nd out the {{forecasting}} model that is the one, which gives the best output of forecasting. So that policy makers can be benefi ted from this research. Thus, this research will also evaluate the performance of ARMA, and Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) forecasting models for KIBOR in case of Pakistan. Karachi <b>Inter</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Offer</b> <b>Rates</b> (KIBOR) is the average interest rate at which banks want to lend money to other banks. KIBOR as a benchmark, to encourage transparency, to promote consistency in market based pricing and to improve management of the market risk undertaken by banks. Researchers have used 6 -month rates of KIBOR; data is of 4 years from 2012 to 2015. Therefore, keeping in view of the importance of KIBOR, the objective of this research is to forecast, Karachi <b>Inter</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Offer</b> <b>Rates</b> (KIBOR) using time series autoregressive moving average (ARMA), Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) model. The study is signifi cant at 1 %, the forecasting of rates shows that the rates are very close to the actual one and it further concluded that the applied model Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) is perfect for the forecasting. The results of AIC revealed that there is no evidence of autocorrelation and there is no sample error and the model is useful and robust. It is fi nally concluded that the forecasting of KIBOR rates by ARIMA (Box-Jenkins) model is very helpful for policy makers. The results extracted from this model are reliable for making any forecasting and also benefi cial for government functionaries, fi nancial experts and policy makers of fi nancial institutions in order to device their future strategies...|$|R

This issue is also important in matters related to risk management practices, monetary policy formulation by the central banking authority, as well as the valuation of securities. However, despite that most researchers devoted in this specific area, their related findings have been found to fluctuate with changes in macro-economic changes. This paper scrutinizes the effect of expected and unexpected interest rate changes on the stock returns of the United Kingdom (UK) firms.

40|$|The {{volatility}} {{of interest rates}} can impact financial institutions in several different ways. It is called as the interest rate risk. Interest rate risk {{is defined as the}} adverse impact of interest rate movements on an institution's net interest income and market value. This paper examines the existence and the severity of interest rate risk on Malaysian Commercial Banks through the analysis of cycles in market rates and its impact on bank loans and deposit rates. The data that were used in this study is sourced from Bank Negara Malaysia's monthly bulletins. It covers the aggregate balance sheet of all commercial banks in Malaysia over a period of 20 years (1985 - 2004). Monthly observation of Kuala Lumpur <b>Inter</b> <b>bank</b> <b>Offer</b> <b>rates</b> (KLIBOR) and Malaysian Treasury Bills rates were used as proxies to the open market rates. The regression and correlation analysis was conducted in testing the impact of market rates movement on the asset and liability rates. Descriptive Statistic also was used to identify the severity of the interest rates. Market rates (T-Bills 3 month, T-Bills 12 month, <b>Inter</b> <b>bank</b> overnight and <b>Inter</b> <b>bank</b> 1 week) will be used as independent variable and Fixed Deposit rates and Average Lending rates will be used as dependent variable. The finding from this study shows that all dependent variable which are Fixed Deposit Rates and Average Lending Rates have a positive relationship and statistically significant effect with those four market rates which are T-Bills 3 month, T-Bills 12 month, <b>Inter</b> <b>bank</b> 1 week and <b>Inter</b> <b>bank</b> overnight.

Applied to the banking industry, recent theoretical contributions suggest that deposit interest rates should be more attractive to customers in areas characterized by greater in-migration and should be less attractive to customers of banks that have greater numbers of locked-in depositors. Empirical evidence on the first to these propositions has been quite limited, and on the second of these points it has been nonexistent. In this paper, we seek to test both of these propositions by using data that allow as to distinguish between a bank’s new depositors and those that may be regarded as “locked in. ” To obtain more efficient estimates, our empirical test entails joint estimation of an equation explaining {{the extent to which}} banks generate new deposit accounts and an equation explaining deposit rates. The analysis is applied to a rich data set obtained for the Spanish banking industry.
