5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> sing it all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Manoj and Babli {{began to}} show {{interest}} in each other. Manoj was {{two years older than}} Babli. All residents of their Karora village belong to the same clan of Banwala, a Jat community, and marrying within the clan is considered incest. Chanderpati recalled, [...] "We knew about Babli long before they decided to marry each other. She would call up often and I would sermonise to her about staying away from Manoj, fearing the fallout of such an alliance. They were, however, unconcerned and chatted for hours together. If I did walk into the room while they were talking, Manoj would quickly disconnect the phone and run off to avoid any questioning." [...] She continued, [...] "I even went to Babli's house and told her mother that Manoj and Babli were seeing each other. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> dissuade Babli or quickly marry them before the word spread." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tyrrel {{turned to}} him without one word of reproach. [...] "Well, we're no rivals now," [...] he answered, generously. [...] "Even if she would have me--even if she loved me well--how could <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> take--her brother's murderer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry to}} baulk Feemy of her walk, Captain Ussher, {{if she did}} say so. It's not very often <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> put herself out for me; but this afternoon, I shall feel obliged <b>to</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> go." ...|$|R
60|$|OCTAVIUS. [shaking his head] <b>I</b> couldn't <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{marry me}} because her father wished it, Mr Ramsden.|$|R
2500|$|Part 2, pages 51–53, dated July 1878, {{had another}} note {{attached}} to it: [...] "I've sealed the previous fifty pages {{in an envelope}} as finished. But {{in the course of}} the last 2.5 years lots of things have happened related to this case and I see that, having once started, I need to continue..." [...] There is an inscription on the envelope: [...] "These papers which have to do with me personally, I commit to Sophia Aleksandrovna Nikitenko for her to deal with them as <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to.</b> Ivan Goncharov, May 19, 1883".|$|E
2500|$|... "Now {{you need}} to know how to undress and go to bed in the {{presence}} of a man. [...] So start undressing." [...] Slowly, in an almost automatic fashion, she undressed. [...] I had her show me her right breast, her left breast, her right nipple, her left nipple. [...] Her belly button. [...] Her genital area. [...] Her knees. [...] Her gluteal [...] regions. [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> point where she would like to have her husband kiss her. [...] I had her turn around [...] [...] I had her dress slowly. [...] She dressed. [...] I dismissed her.|$|E
2500|$|... "I Want to Be Your Man" [...] is a ballad {{featuring}} Roger's vocals {{filtered through}} a vocoder. According to Roger, {{he had never}} mixed his [...] "human" [...] voice with the talk box before, and recording the vocals was tedious because he could only play one note at a time on the vocoder. To layer six-part harmonies, he spoke the lyric while playing a melody line then rewound the tape and repeated the process for the harmonizing part while playing together with the previously recorded one. After he finished layering tracks, if he didn't like the result he had to scrap everything and start over. Larry Troutman recommended Nicole Cottom, {{a friend of his}} daughter, to help sing background vocals. Roger recalled her being in the studio one day while he was recording his vocals: [...] "There was a spot in the song where there was a hole and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do something. It was so good, {{there was no need to}} take it out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know that. I {{think that}} if <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> take me for about two guineas a week {{it will be very}} moderate. It costs me so much more now in London. And the money I am {{spending}} besides in cabs and finery--I am afraid, Constance, that I am degenerating because I have this money, and that I am forgetting how many poor people are in actual want." ...|$|R
60|$|I felt quite uncomfortable--as if Mrs. Micawber {{supposed}} <b>I</b> had <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{do anything}} of the sort!--and sat looking at her in alarm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Postwhistle--yes, <b>I</b> did <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{look out}} for someone for me. Why, {{do you know of}} anyone? Have you been sent by anybody?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the High School Musical series, Hudgens confirmed that she was taking a break from her music career to focus more on acting. She played a supporting role in a musical comedy Bandslam, which was released theatrically on August14, 2009. Hudgens plays [...] "Sa5m", a 15-year-old awkward freshman with untapped talents. Although Bandslam was commercially unsuccessful, Hudgens's performance received praise from critics. David Waddington of the North Wales Pioneer noted that Hudgens [...] "outshines the rest of the cast, failing to fit in with the outcast narrative and making the inevitable climactic ending all the more expected", and Philip French of The Guardian compared her acting to Thandie Newton and Dorothy Parker. Hudgens made a return to theater productions and starred in the musical Rent as Mimi. The stage production ran from August6–8, 2010 at the Hollywood Bowl. Her involvement in the production drew negative comments, but director Neil Patrick Harris defended his decision with casting Hudgens by saying, [...] "Vanessa [...] is awesome. She's a friend. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come in and sing to make sure she had the chops for it. And she was very committed and seemed great." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{marry me}} in a year's time. She shook her head.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{explain her}} meaning, {{but she only}} said that little boys couldn't {{understand}} those things.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is nice every way," [...] {{she told}} the unconvinced Aunt Olivia. [...] "She's clever and well read. She is {{sensible}} and frank. She {{has a sense of}} humour {{and a great deal of}} insight into character--witness her liking for your niece! She can talk interestingly and she can also be silent when silence is becoming. And she has the finest profile I ever saw. Aunt Olivia, may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> visit me next winter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do like her,--I {{love her}} {{better than any}} one in the world; better even than you, Mary; for <b>I</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be my wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor did I;--but I {{should have}} done so had not Captain Aylmer been before me. And now tell me whether <b>I</b> could <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! Mrs. Bowie. And <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> let me {{have you}} at table. And here's my chance. Everybody's talking. Listen, and don't interrupt. You know Mono Creek?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did ask {{something}} of Miss Havisham, however, sir. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{give me some}} information relative to her adopted daughter, {{and she gave me}} all she possessed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. It was {{necessary}} {{for me to see}} her somewhere, so <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come here. Perhaps the Duke has found out and stopped her. Anyhow, call me if she comes." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a stillness {{about her}} then, {{a light on}} her face, which brought to my mind thought of Sally when <b>I</b> had <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> marry me.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I cannot {{know what}} she would say; but I know now what I must say myself. All that is over, Emmeline. <b>I</b> cannot <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> marry a beggar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{this week}} I have been {{studying}} and enjoying far more than you; for I have read a woman's heart and learned to trust and honor what I have loved ever since I was a boy. Absence proved this to me: so I came to look for little Anna, and found her better and dearer than ever. May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> keep on teaching me? Will she share my {{work as well as}} holiday, and be the truest friend a man can have?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I--so <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{give you}} a look in now and then," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Jobling, filling his pipe with great care, [...] "and she said she would. It'll cheer you up a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One morning, when I {{could bear}} it no longer, I wrote, and said I was coming down. I would not force myself on her, but <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{meet me in}} the orchard of the old house we called the Convent. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be there at four o'clock. It has always been my belief that a man must neither beg {{anything}} of a woman, nor force anything from her. Women are generous--they will give you what they can. I sealed my letter, and posted it myself. All the way down I kept on saying to myself, 'She must come--surely she will come!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{turned to}} Mrs. Cleveland, the young, the beautiful, the fascinating, {{and gave her}} my card, {{on the back of}} which I had written [...] "He didn't"--and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> sign her name below those words.|$|E
60|$|My dear Paradine, we're the {{greatest}} friends. You don't suppose I'm going <b>to</b> give <b>her</b> {{the advantage of}} quarrelling with me. I think <b>I</b> shall <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> luncheon to meet you.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I can win Kilmeny's love <b>I</b> shall <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be my wife," [...] he said, {{looking out}} of the window to the dark, southwestern hill beyond which lay his orchard.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2009, Victoria {{was forced}} to {{apologize}} for using unparliamentary language during a late night parliamentary debate. In the incident, Victoria referred <b>to</b> <b>her</b> Labour counterpart MP Danielle Green as a ‘‘fucking bitch’’. MP Danielle Green was quoted saying ‘‘The member for Bayswater has just used words which started with ‘f’ in referring to me,’’ Hansard records Ms Green stating.‘‘And <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> withdraw, because it is very unparliamentary and I take personal offence that any member in this chamber would be so undisciplined as to use words like that.’’ ...|$|R
6000|$|She was an earnest, hearty girl. She {{was always}} in a good humor, and when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do anything, she assented in a bright, cheerful way, and in a loud tone full of good-fellowship, as though she would say: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Moore, a lady {{called to}} inquire after you. None {{of the women}} were about. It is washing-day, and the maids are over the crown of the head in soap-suds in the back kitchen, so <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> step up." ...|$|E
60|$|Then she began, hesitating {{a little}} at times over the {{variable}} chirography of my first amanuensis. I drew up my chair near to the grating, but before she had read two pages <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stop for a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I'm not," [...] {{said the}} cook. [...] "But I'd like to be. Thought I'd wait till I {{got a job}} under roof. <b>I</b> couldn't <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> live in a cow camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{took this}} in with interest. “I shall {{go to his}} sister; <b>I</b> shall <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> bring him to see me. She’s {{extremely}} nice; I think she’ll understand. Unfortunately there’s very little time.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{course it}} would, at laist I suppose so; but Martin," [...] {{and she smiled}} faintly as she looked up into his face, [...] "I want the two dear, dear girls, and I want {{yourself}} to have some little thing to remember me by; and your dear kind mother,--she doesn't want money, but if <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> take {{a few of the}} silver things in the house, I'm sure she'll keep them for my sake. Oh, Martin! I do love you all so very--so very much!" [...] and the warm tears streamed down her cheeks.|$|R
