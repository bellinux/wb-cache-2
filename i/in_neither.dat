Gill ended up signing a contract extension with Buffalo.|$|E

5|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of the spot is delayed {{because of the time}} it takes light to get to the distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. <b>In</b> <b>neither</b> case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 and 1901, Harvard College Observatory {{director}} William Henry Pickering led two {{searches for}} trans-Neptunian planets. The first was begun by Danish astronomer Hans Emil Lau who, {{after studying the}} data on the orbit of Uranus from 1690 to 1895, concluded that one trans-Neptunian planet alone could {{not account for the}} discrepancies in its orbit, and postulated the position of two planets he believed were responsible. The second was launched when Gabriel Dallet suggested that a single trans-Neptunian planet lying at 47AU could account for the motion of Uranus. Pickering agreed to examine plates for any suspected planets. <b>In</b> <b>neither</b> case were any found.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the story}} of a woman {{separated}} from her husband when the plane crashes was going to be used for Kate, but when Kate's role in the series changed the producers kept that story for Rose. Much of the couple's story prior to the plane crash was based on the events of Caldwell's life; she married her husband even though he was dying. Due to Caldwell and Anderson having other acting commitments, the writers found it difficult finding time when both actors could appear together in the show, resulting <b>in</b> <b>neither</b> character featuring in most of season three. Critics reacted positively to the couple, often hoping they would appear more frequently, and both actors were praised for their work.|$|E

5|$|In a {{preliminary}} match involving wrestlers from the Raw brand, Rob Van Dam wrestled Kane under No disqualification regulations. The {{events leading up}} to this match began on the June 23, 2003 edition of Raw, when Kane took his mask off and exposed his face in front of RVD and the crowd after he lost to Triple H during a World Heavyweight Championship match. Then, on July 7, 2003, when Kane attacked Van Dam backstage during an episode of Raw. The following week on an episode of Raw, Eric Bischoff granted Van Dam a standard match against Kane, which took place the following week on Raw and ended <b>in</b> <b>neither</b> wrestler winning the match. On August 4, 2003, Shane McMahon, the son of Mr. McMahon, scheduled a No Disqualification match between the two wrestlers for SummerSlam.|$|E

5|$|In another prelimary match, wrestlers {{from the}} SmackDown! brand competed in a match between four wrestlers for the WWE United States Championship: Eddie Guerrero defended the title against Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri. The buildup to the match began with two {{different}} rivalries, one between Guerrero and Tajiri, {{and the other}} between Benoit and Rhyno. On August 7, 2003 during an episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero and Benoit wrestled in a standard match. However, during the match, Rhyno and Tajiri interfered, resulting <b>in</b> <b>neither</b> wrestler winning the match. Sgt. Slaughter, a WWE official, scheduled a tag team match between the team of Guerrero and Benoit and the team of Rhyno and Tajiri, which Guerrero and Benoit won. The following week on an episode of SmackDown!, a SummerSlam advertisement announced that Guerrero would defend the WWE United States Championship against Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri.|$|E
5|$|Stratus' second {{reign as}} {{champion}} {{came to an}} end on June 23, when she was defeated at King of the Ring by Molly Holly. The two Divas continued their storyline feud for the next three months. After a failed attempt to win the title in July, Stratus won the championship back at Unforgiven. While feuding with Holly, Stratus was also involved in an angle with new Diva Victoria, who held a storyline grudge against Stratus, claiming she was betrayed by Stratus when they both worked as fitness models. The two competed in several title matches, with Stratus retaining until Survivor Series, where Victoria won the title in a Hardcore match. On March 17, 2003, Victoria and Steven Richards defeated Jazz and Stratus in a tag team match when Jazz walked out on Stratus. After the match, Jeff Hardy saved Stratus from an attack by Victoria and Richards and then kissed her, resulting in Stratus becoming Hardy's on-screen girlfriend once more. The two would talk and kiss backstage, compete as an intergender tag team, and come to each other's aid when in danger during singles competition. At no point was their previous relationship acknowledged. The storyline was suddenly dropped when WWE released Hardy in April. This marked the second time in two years that a romance between Stratus and Hardy was abruptly scrapped due to a setback in one of their personal lives. <b>In</b> <b>neither</b> instance did the angle fully play out or reach a conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The second {{main event}} {{resulted}} from events on SmackDown!, WWE's other main television program. In the match, Kurt Angle defended his WWE Championship against Brock Lesnar. The build-up to the match began on July 31, 2003 on {{an episode of}} SmackDown!. During an interview promotion in the ring, Lesnar challenged Angle to a rematch of their bout at Vengeance, WWE's previous pay-per-view event. The WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon, decided that Lesnar would have to earn his rematch by competing in a steel cage match against McMahon himself, and would take place on SmackDown! the following week, with Angle officiating as a special guest referee. The Steel Cage match resulted <b>in</b> <b>neither</b> wrestler winning the match, after McMahon and Lesnar attacked Angle. On August 14, 2003 during an episode of SmackDown!, McMahon announced that Angle would defend the championship against Lesnar at SummerSlam.|$|E

Both coaches were {{replaced}} by John Mitchell on 3 October 2001, {{and he went on}} to coach New Zealand to victory in both the 2002 and 2003 Tri-Nations, as well as regaining the Bledisloe Cup in 2003. The All Blacks entered the 2003 World Cup as one of the favourites and dominated their pool, running up wins against Italy, Canada and Tonga, before winning one of the most competitive matches of the tournament against Wales. They defeated South Africa in their quarter-final, a team they had never beaten at the World Cup, 29–9, but lost to Australia 22–10 in the semi-final in Sydney. Afterwards, Mitchell had to reapply as coach, but the NZRU instead appointed Graham Henry.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} rivalry {{was between}} The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy. On the September 8, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy {{announced that he}} was looking for a new opponent, one that he had never faced before. Long informed Kennedy that he knew a SmackDown! superstar that had never faced Kennedy, The Undertaker. A match was made between the two for No Mercy, in which Kennedy defeated Undertaker by disqualification. At Survivor Series, Kennedy once again defeated Undertaker in a First Blood match. On the December 1 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker fought Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a match where neither wrestler won. During the match, MVP was scripted to attempt escaping from the ring, but Kennedy caught him during the process and tried to throw him back into the ring. MVP instead threw Kennedy in. Undertaker then kicked Kennedy in the face, and Kane attacked MVP at ringside. The following week as Kennedy was in the ring, the hearse, appearing to have nobody in the driver's seat, drove into the arena; suddenly, The Undertaker appeared from the back of the hearse, as Kennedy sprung from the ring. Later that night, Kane defeated Kennedy by disqualification after MVP interfered on Kennedy's behalf. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker and Kane teamed together to face Kennedy and MVP in a tag team match, which ended <b>in</b> <b>neither</b> team winning. Kennedy knocked Kane down in the aisle and jumped into the driver's seat of the hearse that had been at ringside for the match, and threatened to run him over with it however the Undertaker appeared in the passenger side seat scaring Kennedy off.|$|E
