5000|$|SLEDs are optical sources with {{a rather}} wide optical bandwidth. In that they differ from both lasers, {{that have a}} very narrow spectrum, and white light sources, that exhibit a much larger {{spectral}} width. This characteristic mainly reflects itself in a low temporal coherence of the source (which is the limited capability of the emitted light wave to maintain the phase over time). SLEDs may however exhibit {{a high degree of}} spatial coherence, meaning that they can be efficiently coupled into single-mode optical fibers. Some applications take advantage of the low temporal coherence of SLEDs sources to achieve high spatial resolution in imaging techniques. The coherence length, Lc, is a quantity frequently used to characterize the temporal coherence of the light source. It is related to the path difference between the two arms of an optical interferometer over which the light wave is still capable to generate an interference pattern. For sources having a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution,</b> the value of Lc is inversely proportional to the spectral width, BW, so that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the power spectral density can be related to Lc through the equation ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present work {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the defluidization region of a gas-solid fluidized bed system composed by Geldart group D particles using the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectral</b> pressure <b>distribution</b> technique, {{which is based on}} pressure fluctuation measurements in the plenum. In experiments, the defluidization condition of glass beads with apparent density of 2, 450 kg/m 3 was induced in a plexiglas column of 0. 11 m in inner diameter and 1. 0 m in height. The gas-solid behavior close to the incipient fluidization condition was assessed for two fixed bed heights (0. 10 and 0. 20 m) and two mean sizes of particles (1. 55 and 2. 18 mm in diameter). The bed was fluidized with air at environment temperature. The experimental equipment was instrumented with a pressure transmitter connected to a data acquisition system in order to record the pressure fluctuations of the gas-solid flow. The results showed that the defluidization region can be detected efficiently by using the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectral</b> pressure <b>distribution</b> technique, which contributes for a better control of fluidized bed processes...|$|R

40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of x-ray beams typically take {{parameters of the}} electron beam in the accelerating waveguide to be free parameters. In this paper, a methodology is proposed and implemented to determine the energy, spectral width, and beam divergence of the electron source. All treatment head components {{were removed from the}} beam path, leaving only the exit window. With the x-ray target and flattener out of the beam, uncertainties in physical characteristics and relative position of the target and flattening filter, and in spot size, did not contribute to uncertainty in the energy. Beam current was lowered to reduce recombination effects. The measured dose distributions were compared with Monte Carlo simulation of the electron beam through the treatment head to extract the electron source characteristics. For the nominal 6 and 18 MV x-ray beams, the energies were 6. 51 ± 0. 15 and 13. 9 ± 0. 2 MeV, respectively, with the uncertainties resulting from uncertainties in the detector position in the measurement and in the stopping power in the simulations. <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>distributions</b> were used, with full widths at half maximum ranging from 20 ± 4 % at 6 MV to 13 ± 4 % at 18 MV required to match the fall-off portion of the percent-depth ionization curve. Profiles at the depth of maximum dose from simulations that used the manufacturer-specified exit window geometry and no beam divergence were 2 – 3 cm narrower than measured profiles. Two simulation configurations yielding the measured profile width were the manufacturer-specified exit window thickness with electron source divergences of 3. 3 ° at 6 MV and 1. 8 ° at 18 MV and an exit window 40 % thicker than the manufacturer’s specification with no beam divergence. With the x-ray target in place (and no flattener), comparison of measured to simulated profiles sets upper limits on the electron source divergences of 0. 2 ° at 6 MV and 0. 1 ° at 18 MV. A method of determining source characteristics without mechanical modification of the treatment head, and therefore feasible in clinics, is presented. The energies and spectral widths determined using this method agree with those determined with only the exit window in the beam path...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the projectile effective charges and the stopping power with high intensity ion beams is of great fundamental interest. In contrast to the projectile charge state analysis outside the interaction volume (e. g., by means of particle detectors), {{the information about the}} projectile mean charge inside matter has to be obtained in an indirect manner, namely from the projectile radiation emission. The request for negligible absorption and observation of simultaneous several charge states leads to the {{analysis of}} the x-ray <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution</b> originating from complex autoionizing states. The possibility for the observation of these projectile X-ray <b>spectral</b> <b>distributions</b> inside matter was demonstrated recently [1]. Currently, however, there are no models available to transform the measured projectile <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution</b> into an average charge state inside matter. The complexity arises from the need for spectroscopic accuracy to interpret the <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution.</b> Whereas averaged atom models are powerful methods to treat the radiation physics of even complex atoms and ions [2], the averaging process by itself leads to an averaged <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution</b> too: I nmax, m n, m= 1 (ω) max hω ϕ (ω − ω) mn Amn mn mn.

As an application, we consider inferences about the <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution</b> of integrated covolatility (ICV) matrices of high-dimensional diffusion processes based on high-frequency data with microstructure noise. The (slightly modified) pre-averaging estimator is a signal-plus-noise sample covariance matrix, and the aforementioned result, together with a (generalized) connection between the <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution</b> of signal sample covariance matrices {{and that of the}} population covariance matrix, enables us to propose a two-step procedure to consistently estimate the <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution</b> of ICV for a class of diffusion processes.
