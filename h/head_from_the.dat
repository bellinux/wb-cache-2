5|$|The {{breeding}} male mallard is unmistakable, with {{a glossy}} bottle-green {{head and a}} white collar that demarcates the <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly. The rear of the male is black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers. The bill of the male is a yellowish-orange tipped with black, {{with that of the}} female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown. The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe.|$|E

5|$|The king of {{one country}} {{threatened}} by the imminent arrival of the stoor worm sought {{the advice of a}} wise man or spaeman, who suggests that the beast might be appeased if it is fed seven virgins every week. In line with the wise man's advice, every Saturday the islanders provide a sacrificial offering of seven virgins, who were tied up and placed on the beach for the serpent to sweep into its mouth as it reared its <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|E

5|$|Van Gogh's gaze {{is seldom}} {{directed}} at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin. Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter. Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{memorial}} began in 1928 with the cut and placement of marble blocks from Macclesfield and Angaston. The South Australian Monumental Works {{were chosen to}} work on the construction, with Alan Tillett as the principal. Although no sculptor was named in the winning proposal, it did make mention of a possible candidate—who later proved to be Rayner Hoff, a Sydney-based sculptor born in England. Rayner Hoff produced the designs for the sculptures from his Sydney studio, with the bronze castings from Hoff's plaster models being produced by the South Australian firm A. W. Dobbie and Company. (Hoff had expressed reservations that a South Australian company would be capable of handling bronzes of the required size, but a test casting of the lion's <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> memorial was sufficient to overcome his concerns). The two angel reliefs sculpted from the Angaston marble were produced by Julius Henschke in situ from Hoff's designs, expressed through one-third sized plaster models which Henschke then scaled to suit.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, {{writing as}} Major Harold Ridley FRCS RAMC, the English {{ophthalmic}} surgeon published a short {{paper in the}} British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and {{an account of the}} composition and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> grass and forcibly spat venom toward the man's right eye from a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his <b>head,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E
5|$|Roman remains, {{possibly}} a signal station or watchtower, {{have been identified}} on the island by an electrical resistance survey. Accurate exploration and interpretation of the site is difficult as it was reused by builders in both the Victorian era and during World War II. A carved stone head found on the island in 1991 {{is likely to be}} a Celtic <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Romano-British era, but may be from the Iron Age. In addition to shards of cooking pots from the Roman era, some luxury items have been identified including Arretine ware, La Tène style brooches, and an amphora dating from between 90 and 140AD which was made in southern Spain. There have also been shards of Castor ware. Fragments of pottery roofing and box flue tiles have been identified signifying the presence of a heating system and {{possibly a}} bath house. Roman coins from the reigns of Claudius Gothicus (268–270) and Tetricus I (271–273) have also been found.|$|E
5|$|The Camden, Ellisburg, and Marlton Turnpike was {{chartered}} in 1849 as a turnpike {{that was}} to run from Camden east to Marlton along what is today Route 70 and CR 601. The Marlton Pike {{was taken over by}} the county in 1907 at a time many other turnpikes became public roads. The current alignment of Route 70 between Whitesbog (the west end of the CR 530 concurrency) and Lakehurst was legislated as a part of pre-1927 Route 18 in 1923, a route {{that was to}} run from Camden to Toms River. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 40 was designated to run from Camden to Lakewood along the current alignment of Route 70. In addition a spur of this route called Route S40 (now Route 72) was designated to <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> route at Four Mile to Manahawkin. Eventually, the eastern terminus of Route 40 was moved to the Laurelton Circle in Brick Township, where it intersected Route 35 (now Route 88) as well as Route 34, which continued north from this point; the western terminus was placed at the Airport Circle with U.S. Route 30 and U.S. Route 130 in Pennsauken, ending concurrent with Route 38. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 40 was renumbered to Route 70 {{in order to avoid the}} conflict with U.S. Route 40 in the state. Also, Route 70 was designated onto its current alignment between Route 38 in Pennsauken and Route 34 and Route 35 at the Brielle Circle, removing the concurrency with Route 38 and replacing the portion of Route 34 between the Laurelton Circle and the Brielle Circle.|$|E

25|$|The hood was {{originally}} a functional garment, worn {{to shield the}} <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> elements.

25|$|The Museo de Sonora (Museum of Sonora) {{is housed}} in a {{building}} that originally functioned as a prison. It was completed in 1907 and built by the mostly indigenous prisoners themselves.

This museum has eighteen rooms covering {{various aspects of the}} state including its paleontology, history, archeology and ethnography. It has also conserved some of the cells of the original prison.

25|$|The {{tensions}} {{led to an}} rising named Ogun Olomiro (Salt Water War) by the Kosoko faction in July 1845. The Kosoko faction laid siege to the Oba's Palace {{for three}} weeks. Akitoye eventually accepted defeat, escaped up the lagoon to the north, and was granted safe passage through the Agboyi Creek by Oshodi Tapa, Kosoko's war captain. Oshodi Tapa explained Akitoye's escape to Kosoko by saying that Akitoye put his enemies in a trance. Akitoye thereafter arrived in Abeokuta where he was granted asylum. Recognizing Akitoye's escape as a threat, Kosoko demanded Akitoye's <b>head</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Egbas who refused Kosoko's demands. In March 1945, the Egbas provided the now deposed Akitoye with an escort to Badagry, the traditional town of refuge for Lagosians where he rallied his followers and built a partnership with European missionaries and with the British through their Consul John Beecroft.|$|E
