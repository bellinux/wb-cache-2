5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual,</b> and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E

25|$|The patrimonial {{dependency}} (dependencia patrimonial) of {{a hospital}} (or other health care facility) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> or other juridical entity that owns, at least, the building occupied by the facility.

25|$|Another {{important}} factor to consider <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> {{differences in the}} experience of pleasurable effects brought on by the substance or behaviour. It is reasoned that certain individuals may be more sensitive to the pleasurable effects and thus experience them with greater intensity, resulting in addiction. For example, over-responsiveness to substance affects has been found in cocaine addicts – an increased response to methylphenidate in the brain regions associated with emotional reactivity and mood. Thus, strong emotional responses that addicted individuals show in response to substances or behaviours might be results of enhanced sensitivity to their effects.|$|E

25|$|Previously, some economists, such as Carl Menger {{and others}} of the Austrian School, {{maintained}} {{that the value of}} factors of production <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> contribution of each in the final product, but its value is the value of the last contributed to the final product (the marginal utility before reaching the point Pareto optimal). Thus, Wieser identified a flaw in the theory of imputation as expounded by his teacher, Carl Menger: overvaluation may occur if one is confronted with economies where profits jump (maximums and minimums in his utility function, where its second derivative equals 0). Wieser thus suggested as an alternative the simultaneous solution of a system of industrial equations.|$|E
25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} {{of myself as}} a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E
25|$|The forming {{machines}} {{hold and}} move the parts that form the container. The machine consist of basic 19 mechanisms in operation to form a bottle and generally powered by compressed air (high pressure - 3.2 bar and low pressure - 2.8 bar), the mechanisms are electronically timed to coordinate all movements of the mechanisms. The most widely used forming machine arrangement <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> section machine (or IS machine). This machine has a bank of 5–20 identical sections, each of which contains one complete set of mechanisms to make containers. The sections are in a row, and the gobs feed into each section via a moving chute, called the gob distributor. Sections make either one, two, three or four containers simultaneously. (Referred to as single, double, triple and quad gob). In the case of multiple gobs, the shears cut the gobs simultaneously, and they fall into the blank moulds in parallel.|$|E

500|$|Regardless of {{the exact}} details of how the {{supernova}} ignites, it is generally accepted that a substantial fraction of the carbon and oxygen in the white dwarf fuses into heavier elements within a period {{of only a few}} seconds, with the accompanying release of energy increasing the internal temperature to billions of degrees. The energy released (1–) is more than sufficient to unbind the star; that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> particles making up the white dwarf gain enough kinetic energy to fly apart from each other. The star explodes violently and releases a shock wave in which matter is typically ejected at speeds on the order of 5,000–, roughly 6% of the speed of light. The energy released in the explosion also causes an extreme increase in luminosity. The typical visual absolute magnitude of TypeIa supernovae is Mv=−19.3 (about 5 billion times brighter than the Sun), with little variation.|$|E
500|$|The first {{champion}} to {{be recognized}} by CMLL was Fuerza Guerrera, who defeated El Khalifa in the finals of a four-man tournament that took place on February 15, 1992. In addition to being the first champion, Fuerza Guerrera <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> to have held the championship the shortest time, at 22 days. Mephisto holds the record for longest individual title reign, at 1,141 days, while El Felino's three reigns give him the longest combined reign, 1,186 days in total. Mephisto is the current champion; he is on his second reign as CMLL World Welterweight Champion, and is the 32nd overall champion. He defeated Máscara Dorada on May 3, 2016, to win the title. In 1996, then reigning champion El Pantera planned on leaving CMLL to join their main rival AAA; before doing so he lost the CMLL Welterweight Title to Super Delfin in a match not sanctioned by CMLL. As CMLL knew that Pantera was leaving they used the opportunity to [...] the title, stating that Super Delfin's claim to the title was void. After El Felino became the CMLL-endorsed champion, he defeated Super Delfin {{to ensure that there}} was only one undisputed CMLL World Welterweight Champion.|$|E
