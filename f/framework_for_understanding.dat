Instead, they primarily tune the timing of E2F increase, thereby modulating the pace of cell cycle progression.|$|E

25|$|Values such {{as these}} do not give answers {{as to how to}} handle a {{particular}} situation, but provide a useful <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> <b>understanding</b> conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical dilemma or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members. For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse blood transfusions, considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} thought {{is central to}} {{psychology}} and related fields. Cognitive psychology studies cognition, the mental processes' underlying behavior. It uses information processing as a <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> <b>understanding</b> the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology {{is associated with a}} school of thought known as cognitivism, whose adherents argue for an information processing model of mental function, informed by positivism and experimental psychology. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing {{on the development of the}} human mind through the life span, developmental psychology seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or moral development. Psychologists have developed intelligence tests and the concept of intelligence quotient in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its distribution among population.|$|E
500|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics provides a uniform <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> <b>understanding</b> the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. An interaction occurs when two particles, typically {{but not necessarily}} half-integer spin fermions, exchange integer-spin, force-carrying bosons. The fermions involved in such exchanges can be either elementary (e.g. electrons or quarks) or composite (e.g. protons or neutrons), although at the deepest levels, all weak interactions ultimately are between elementary particles.|$|E

In particular, the concepts were developed in order to explain the bizarre behavior of subatomic particles - behavior difficult to explain by quantum physics.|$|R

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{key issues}} in international business strategy from a workers’ perspective and relates these to existing <b>frameworks</b> <b>for</b> <b>understanding</b> decision-making in multinational corporations (MNCs). It begins by identifying key decisions in international business, discussing their interrelationships, and highlighting key empirical trends. Academic research in international business strategy can, it is pointed out, helpfully inform worker representatives and trade unions {{in the context}} of their work within MNCs in Europe. The article goes on to review existing <b>frameworks</b> <b>for</b> <b>understanding</b> how MNCs make decisions about the major strategic issues. Its focus is on five types of approaches: the resource-based perspective on the firm; transaction cost economics; institutionalism; the network approach; and the actor-centred perspectives. It is argued that research on MNC strategies, insofar as it is aimed at informing trade unions and worker representatives and at evaluating the impact of their activities, should be based on frameworks that bring together these disparate paradigms...|$|R
500|$|The dogma is a <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> <b>understanding</b> the {{transfer}} of sequence information between information-carrying biopolymers, in the most common or general case, in living organisms. There are 3 major classes of such biopolymers: DNA and RNA (both nucleic acids), and protein. There are 3×3 = 9 conceivable direct transfers of information that can occur between these. The dogma classes these into 3 groups of 3: three general transfers (believed to occur normally in most cells), three special transfers (known to occur, but only under specific conditions in case of some viruses or in a laboratory), and three unknown transfers (believed never to occur). The general transfers describe the normal flow of biological information: DNA can be copied to DNA (DNA replication), [...] DNA information can be copied into mRNA (transcription), and proteins can be synthesized using the information in mRNA as a template (translation). The special transfers describe: RNA being copied from RNA (RNA replication), DNA being synthesised using an RNA template (reverse transcription), and proteins being synthesised directly from a DNA template {{without the use of}} mRNA. The unknown transfers describe: a protein being copied from a protein, synthesis of RNA using the primary structure of a protein as a template, and DNA synthesis using the primary structure of a protein as a template - these are not thought to naturally occur.|$|E

2500|$|Nelson and Narens {{proposed}} a theoretical <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> <b>understanding</b> metacognition and metamemory. In this framework {{there are two}} levels: the object level (for example, cognition and memory) and the meta level (for example, metacognition and metamemory). Information flow from the meta level to the object level is called control, and information flow from the object level to the meta level is called monitoring. Both monitoring and control processes occur in acquisition, retention, and retrieval. Examples of control processes are allocating study time and selecting search strategies, and examples of monitoring processes are ease-of-learning (EOL) judgments and FOK judgments.|$|E
