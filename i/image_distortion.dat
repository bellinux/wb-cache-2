25|$|A {{number of}} such systems were being used {{experimentally}} in the 1920s. The best-known was John Logie Baird's, which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in Britain for several years. Indeed, Baird's system was demonstrated {{to members of the}} Royal Society in London in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true, working television system. In spite of these early successes, all mechanical television systems shared a number of serious problems. Being mechanically driven, perfect synchronization of the sending and receiving discs was not easy to ensure, and irregularities could result in major <b>image</b> <b>distortion.</b> Another problem was that the image was scanned within a small, roughly rectangular area of the disk's surface, so that larger, higher-resolution displays required increasingly unwieldy disks and smaller holes that produced increasingly dim images. Rotating drums bearing small mirrors set at progressively greater angles proved more practical than Nipkow discs for high-resolution mechanical scanning, allowing images of 240 lines and more to be produced, but such delicate, high-precision optical components were not commercially practical for home receivers.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1993, the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration used digital {{infrared}} imaging technology to produce photographs of Dead Sea Scrolls fragments. In {{partnership with the}} Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center and West Semitic Research, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory successfully worked to expand {{on the use of}} infrared photography previously used to evaluate ancient manuscripts by expanding the range of spectra at which images are photographed. NASA used this multi-spectral imaging technique, adapted from its remote sensing and planetary probes, in order to reveal previously illegible text on fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The process uses a liquid crystal tunable filter in order to photograph the scrolls at specific wavelengths of light and, as a result, <b>image</b> <b>distortion</b> is significantly diminished. This method was used with select fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls to reveal text and details that cameras that take photographs using a larger light spectrum could not reveal. The camera and digital imaging assembly was developed specifically for the purpose of photographing illegible ancient texts.|$|E

The geometry of stereoscopic camera and display systems is presented first. This {{is followed by the}} analysis and diagrammatic presentation of various <b>image</b> <b>distortions</b> such as depth plane curvature, depth non-linearity, depth and size magnification, shearing distortion and keystone distortion. The variation of system parameters is also analysed with the help of plots of image geometry to show their effects on <b>image</b> <b>distortions.</b> The converged (toed-in) and parallel camera configurations are compared and the amount of vertical parallax induced by lens distortion and keystone distortion are discussed. The range of acceptable vertical parallax and the convergence/accommodation limitations on depth range are also discussed. It is shown that a number of these distortions can be eliminated by the appropriate choice of camera and display system parameters. There are some <b>image</b> <b>distortions,</b> however, which cannot be avoided {{due to the nature of}} human vision and limitations of current stereoscopic video display techniques. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the origins of}} <b>image</b> <b>distortions</b> in the axial offset parallel video system and how to improve viewing comfort. The types and characteristics of <b>image</b> <b>distortions</b> in some stereoscopic video systems are presented first. The geometry equations of stereoscopic camera and display systems are deduced then. The typical distortions in the axial offset parallel video system can be got and the key factors of <b>image</b> <b>distortions</b> can be found out by the analysis on these equations. These distortions include depth non-linearity, puppet theater effect and cardboard effect, shearing distortion. The simulation software is programmed for verification and analysis of above distortions, which are plotted by the variation of system parameters...|$|R

2500|$|The parietal lobes {{are likely}} to play {{a pivotal role in}} this body <b>image</b> <b>distortion</b> during sleep paralysis. Especially the right {{superior}} parietal lobule (SPL) is involved in the construction of a neural representation of the body. [...] According to this theory, the perceived intruder {{is the result of a}} hallucinated projection of the genetically ‘‘hard-wired’’ body image (homunculus), in the right parietal region. This hypothesis is broadly consistent with the laboratory finding that causing a functional disturbance in the TPJ through electric stimulation can induce an illusory shadow-like person mimicking one’s body postures.|$|E

30|$|Our purpose then, is to {{estimate}} the scale and shape parameters of a reference image in a distorted image. In this paper, it provides a very efficient way to distinguish the coefficient histogram {{of different types of}} <b>image</b> <b>distortions.</b> So that only two parameters sequence {α, β} are needed to calculate. Different types of <b>image</b> <b>distortions</b> have different value of parameters. Although GGD model is not characterized well on the wavelet coefficients of the distorted image, the parameters of model are important factors to calculate the distortion. To prove this opinion, we analyzed the relation of parameters between reference image and distorted image.|$|R

40|$|To {{design and}} {{evaluate}} eddy current-nulled convex optimized diffusion encoding (EN-CODE) gradient waveforms for efficient diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that {{is free of}} eddy current-induced <b>image</b> <b>distortions.</b> The EN-CODE framework was used to generate diffusion-encoding waveforms that are eddy current-compensated. The EN-CODE DTI waveform was compared with the existing eddy current-nulled twice refocused spin echo (TRSE) sequence as well as monopolar (MONO) and non-eddy current-compensated CODE in terms of echo time (TE) and <b>image</b> <b>distortions.</b> Comparisons were made in simulations, phantom experiments, and neuro imaging in 10 healthy volunteers. The EN-CODE sequence achieved eddy current compensation with a significantly shorter TE than TRSE (78 versus 96 ms) and a slightly shorter TE than MONO (78 versus 80 ms). Intravoxel signal variance was lower in phantoms with EN-CODE than with MONO (13. 6 [*]±[*] 11. 6 versus 37. 4 [*]±[*] 25. 8) and not different from TRSE (15. 1 [*]±[*] 11. 6), indicating good robustness to eddy current-induced <b>image</b> <b>distortions.</b> Mean fractional anisotropy values in brain edges were also significantly lower with EN-CODE than with MONO (0. 16 [*]±[*] 0. 01 versus 0. 24 [*]±[*] 0. 02, P[*]<[*] 1 x 10 (- 5)) and not different from TRSE (0. 16 [*]±[*] 0. 01 versus 0. 16 [*]±[*] 0. 01, P[*]=[*]nonsignificant).

50|$|Further {{difficulties}} in absolute EIT arise from inter- and intra-individual differences of electrode conductivity with associated <b>image</b> <b>distortion</b> and artifacts. It {{is also important}} to bear in mind that the body part of interest is rarely precisely rotund and that inter-individual anatomy varies, e.g. thorax shape, affecting individual electrode spacing. A priori data accounting for age-, height- and gender-typical anatomy can reduce sensitivity to artifacts and <b>image</b> <b>distortion.</b> Improving the signal-to-noise ratio, e.g. by using active surface electrodes, further reduces imaging errors. Some of the latest EIT systems with active electrodes monitor electrode performance through an extra channel and are able to compensate for insufficient skin contact by removing them from the measurements.|$|E

We show that this framework is a generalization of a number of existing image comparison approaches. As an example of a specific implementation, we select the components based on the structural similarity principle, separating the overall <b>image</b> <b>distortions</b> into non-structural distortions (those that do not change the structures of the objects in the scene) and the remaining structural distortions. We demonstrate that the resulting measure is effective in predicting <b>image</b> <b>distortions</b> as perceived by human observers. 1...|$|R

40|$|We show that, {{when the}} images formed, the frontal {{part of the}} Shroud of Turin laid on a body in the same {{position}} as when the blood stains formed by contact. In other words, after the Shroud was laid on top of a body, no forceful flattening occurred before the images formed. Moreover, the argument that {{the top half of the}} Shroud could not have been draping a real body when the images formed – to avoid prominent <b>image</b> <b>distortions</b> – is shown to be incorrect. If a cloth is appropriately laid on the front part of a body, and a body image forms by a vertical projection on the cloth, no major <b>image</b> <b>distortions</b> occur. Small <b>image</b> <b>distortions</b> are to be expected, and indeed we can observe some on the Shroud. These two aspects – the Shroud was not forcefully flattened before the images formed and no major <b>image</b> <b>distortions</b> occur due to the way the Shroud was laid on the body – give the simplest scenario for the formation of the images. There is no need to claim a special event that would have flattened the Shroud before the images formed. Our analysis is based on precise length measurements on digital images, the blood stain locations, and geometry.
