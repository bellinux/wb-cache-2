It was composed of solid volcanic stone, cut into large square masses, and round it ran a pleasant wooden verandah, with rocking-chairs temptingly displayed in a row under its broad canopy.

Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the <b>glassiness</b> of despair, alone were visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge.

In Mr. Stokes' collection, I have seen a beautiful example of this structure, in a specimen of obsidian from Mexico, which is shaded and zoned, like the finest agate, with numerous, straight, parallel layers, more or less opaque and white, or almost perfectly glassy; the degree of opacity and <b>glassiness</b> depending on the number of microscopically minute, flattened air-cells; in this case, it is scarcely possible to doubt but that the mass, to which the fragment belonged, must have been subjected to some, probably prolonged, action, causing the tension slightly to vary in the successive planes.|$|E

Only in the very last moment, as though in response to some sign we could not see, to some whisper we could not hear, he frowned heavily, and that frown gave to his black death-mask an inconceivably somber, brooding, and menacing expression.

60|$|The {{breadth of}} the entroughed bed varies from 700 yards to two miles where it most dispreads itself. The current {{increases}} from the normal three to five knots in rare places; the surface loses the <b>glassiness</b> of the lower section, and at once shows the boiling and swirling which will be noticed near the cataracts. The shores are often foul, but the midway is mostly clear, and, where sunken rocks are, they are shown by whirlpools. The flow of the tide, or rather the damming up of the lower waters between Porto da Lenha and the mouth, causes a daily rise, which we found to measure about a foot; thus it assists in forming a treble current, the rapid down-flow in the Thalweg being subtended by a strong backwater on either side carrying a considerable portion in a retrograde direction, and showing a sensible reflux; this will continue {{as far as the}} rapids. In the Amazonas the tides are felt a hundred leagues from the mouth; and, whilst the stream moves seawards, the level of the water rises, proving an evident under-current.

60|$|From my {{childhood}} I {{have loved to}} gaze into a spring. The water filled a circular basin, small but deep and set round with stones, {{some of which were}} covered with slimy moss, the others naked and of variegated hue--reddish, white and brown. The bottom was covered with coarse sand, which sparkled in the lonely sunbeam and seemed to illuminate the spring with an unborrowed light. In one spot the gush of the water violently agitated the sand, but without obscuring the fountain or breaking the <b>glassiness</b> of its surface. It appeared as if some living creature were about to emerge--the naiad of the spring, perhaps, {{in the shape of a}} beautiful young woman with a gown of filmy water-moss, a belt of rainbow-drops and a cold, pure, passionless countenance. How would the beholder shiver, pleasantly yet fearfully, to see her sitting on one of the stones, paddling her white feet in the ripples and throwing up water to sparkle in the sun! Wherever she laid her hands on grass and flowers, they would immediately be moist, as with morning dew. Then would she set about her labors, like a careful housewife, to clear the fountain of withered leaves, and bits of slimy wood, and old acorns from the oaks above, and grains of corn left by cattle in drinking, till the bright sand in the bright water were like a treasury of diamonds. But, should the intruder approach too near, he would find only the drops of a summer shower glistening about the spot where he had seen her.|$|E

There was a continued faint rustle around him, as of bees in a hive or ants in a pine-wood. This was the shuffling of the Minimuls' shoes, which are flat, like sandals, and made of silver grass plaited together, that rustles on the sandy floor of their chambers and galleries. This plaited grass they tie, too, round their middles for a belt or pouch, beneath which, as they walk, their long lean tails descend. Their fur shines faintly shot in moon or firelight, and is either pebble-grey or sand-coloured. It never bristles into hair except about their polls and chops, where it stands in a smooth, even wall, about {{one and a half}} to two inches high, leaving the remnant of their faces light and bare. They stand for the most part about three spans high in their grass slippers. Their noses are even flatter than the noses of the Mullabruks. Their teeth stand out somewhat, giving their small faces a cunning mouse-look, which never changes. Their eyes are round and thin-lidded, and almost as colourless as glass. Yet behind their <b>glassiness</b> seems to be set a gleam, like a far and tiny taper shining, so that they are perfectly visible in the dark, or even dusk. Thus may they be seen, a horde of them together in the evening gloom of the forest when they go Mulgar-hunting. When they are closely looked on, they can, as it were within their eyes, shut out this gleam--it vanishes; but still they continue to see, though dimly. By day their eyes are as empty as pure glass marbles. Their smell is faintly rank, through eating so much flesh.

The seed, I said, must have been sown in the reign of Charles the First. What flowers grew in the reign of Charles the First?" [...] I asked--(but I don't remember the answer). Tall flowers with purple tassels to them perhaps. And so it goes on. All the time I'm dressing up the figure of myself in my own mind, lovingly, stealthily, not openly adoring it, for if I did that, I should catch myself out, and stretch my hand at once for a book in self-protection. Indeed, it is curious how instinctively one protects the image of oneself from idolatry or any other handling that could make it ridiculous, or too unlike the original to be believed in any longer. Or is it not so very curious after all? It is a matter of great importance. Suppose the looking glass smashes, the image disappears, and the romantic figure with the green of forest depths all about it is there no longer, but only that shell of a person which is seen by other people--what an airless, shallow, bald, prominent world it becomes! A world not to be lived in. As we face each other in omnibuses and underground railways we are looking into the mirror; that accounts for the vagueness, the gleam of <b>glassiness,</b> in our eyes. And the novelists in future will realize more and more the importance of these reflections, for of course there is not one reflection but an almost infinite number; those are the depths they will explore, those the phantoms they will pursue, leaving the description of reality more and more out of their stories, taking a knowledge of it for granted, as the Greeks did and Shakespeare perhaps--but these generalizations are very worthless. The military sound of the word is enough. It recalls leading articles, cabinet ministers--a whole class of things indeed which as a child one thought the thing itself, the standard thing, the real thing, from which one could not depart save at the risk of nameless damnation. Generalizations bring back somehow Sunday in London, Sunday afternoon walks, Sunday luncheons, and also ways of speaking of the dead, clothes, and habits--like the habit of sitting all together in one room until a certain hour, although nobody liked it. There was a rule for everything. The rule for tablecloths at that particular period was that they should be made of tapestry with little yellow compartments marked upon them, such as you may see in photographs of the carpets in the corridors of the royal palaces. Tablecloths of a different kind were not real tablecloths. How shocking, and yet how wonderful it was to discover that these real things, Sunday luncheons, Sunday walks, country houses, and tablecloths were not entirely real, were indeed half phantoms, and the damnation which visited the disbeliever in them was only a sense of illegitimate freedom. What now takes the place of those things I wonder, those real standard things? Men perhaps, should you be a woman; the masculine point of view which governs our lives, which sets the standard, which establishes Whitaker's Table of Precedency, which has become, I suppose, since the war half a phantom to many men and women, which soon, one may hope, will be laughed into the dustbin where the phantoms go, the mahogany sideboards and the Landseer prints, Gods and Devils, Hell and so forth, leaving us all with an intoxicating sense of illegitimate freedom--if freedom exists....|$|E

Key words: <b>glassiness,</b> Bose-Einstein condesation, hard-sphere system, square well The transition from the liquid state to the glassy state can not be seen as a change in an equilibrium parameter, as when dealing with the liquid-solid phase transition. Transport parameters such as the diffusion constant of an external probe and the viscosity are the main criteria for distinguishing the glassy state from a simple classical liquid [2, 3]. Some years ago an analogy between a simple liquid and a Bose quantum system was used to suggest an equilibrium parameter, which distinguishes between a simple liquid and a glass [1]. That parameter is based on the difference in the symmetry under permutation of the classical liquid and the glass. In both states the system is invariant under permutations but still there is an important difference in the physical effectiveness of the symmetry. In the liquid state configurations which differ by permutations are connected by trajectories in configuration space, which do not have to cross high energy barriers. In the glass, on the other hand, such trajectories have to cross extremely high barriers. In quantum systems the Bose condensed fraction is the parameter that measures the effectiveness of the symmetry under permutations.

Using a replica approach to self generated <b>glassiness,</b> we map the problem onto an effective local problem which can be solved exactly. Applying the approach to the Brazovskii-model, relevant to a large class of systems with frustrated micro-phase separation, we are able to solve the self-consistent local theory without using additional approximations. We demonstrate that a glassy state found earlier in this model is generic and does not arise from the use of perturbative approximations. In addition we demonstrate that the glassy state depends strongly on the strength of the frustrated phase separation in that model. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{distinction}} between a classical liquid and a classical ordered solid is easy and depends on their different symmetries. The {{distinction between}} a classical glass and a classical liquid is more difficult, since the glass is also disordered. The difference is {{in the fact that}} a glass is frozen while the liquid is not. In this article an equilibrium measure is suggested that distinguishes between a glass and a liquid. The choice of this measure is {{based on the idea that}} in a system which is not frozen symmetry under permutation of particles is physically relevant, because particles can be permuted by actual physical motion. This is not the case in a frozen system. In quantum Bose systems there is a natural parameter that can distinguish between a frozen and a non-frozen state. This is the Bose condensed fraction. In this article it is shown how to generalize this concept, in a natural way, to classical systems in order to distinguish between the glass and the liquid. A formal similarity between the ground state wave function of a Bose system and the statistical weight function enables a definition of a Bose Einstein condensed fraction in classical systems.
