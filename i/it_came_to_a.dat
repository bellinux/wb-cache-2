5|$|Parry {{arranged}} for the league chairmen to vote on 18 May 1992. Four days earlier BSkyB and ITV made their formal presentations to the chairmen; Chisholm hinted to his audience that BSkyB would increase their offer. This concerned Dyke, who on the weekend before the vote arranged an urgent meeting with East. They both telephoned the ITV companies to convince them to raise their collective bid. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> total of £262 million – £155 million of which spread out over five years, for 30 live games per season. East presented their new offer to the chairmen and Parry.|$|E
5|$|Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation {{have criticized}} the Debian project for hosting the non-free {{repository}} and because the contrib and non-free areas are easily accessible, an opinion echoed by some in Debian including the former project leader Wichert Akkerman. The internal dissent in the Debian project regarding the non-free section has persisted, but the last time <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vote in 2004, the majority decided to keep it.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{found that}} Train 214 {{had come to}} a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making it {{effectively}} invisible to the automatic train control system. Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum {{to make it to the}} next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator, and <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert the collision.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea behind}} AIESEC started in 1948, when representatives from schools across Europe {{exchanged}} information about various programs and schools that specialized {{in business and}} economics.

25|$|Details {{surrounding}} the crash were unclear {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the incident; a local official reported that the aircraft broke in two as it was landing, and that passengers were thrown from the aircraft, though some survivors said that it remained intact until <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rest away from the runway.|$|E

Buddhist monk Bhikshu Sudarshan Mahasthavir was jailed {{for six months and}} six days. Other prominent campaigners like Durga Lal Shrestha, Hitkar Bir Singh Kansakar and Mangal Man Shakya (of Om Bahal) were forced to go underground. The movement was made leaderless, and <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stop after a year.|$|E

After extensive lobbying from Gregoire, House Democratic and Republican leadership met and agreed to let the measure come up for a vote. It cleared the House shortly thereafter and was swiftly passed by the state Senate and she signed it into law later that week.|$|E
25|$|Moving {{north from}} Moung Kassy on 5 August 1971, the Royalist column crept {{through the rain}} for the {{following}} fortnight, meeting only sporadic Communist opposition. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halt against the defended Routes 7/13 intersection at Sala Phou Khoun. Unable to force entry {{into the mouth of}} Route 7, the Royalist column veered off Route 13 to parallel Route 7 to its south. The flanking movement penetrated 15 kilometers before being balked by a Pathet Lao battalion. Phou Khao Khouai stalled there for about a month, until mid-September.|$|E

25|$|With {{regard to}} the {{economic}} effects of introducing minimum wage legislation in Germany in January 2015, recent developments {{have shown that the}} feared increase in unemployment has not materialized, however, in some economic sectors and regions of the country, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> decline in job opportunities particularly for temporary and part-time workers, and some low-wage jobs have disappeared entirely. Because of this overall positive development, the Deutsche Bundesbank revised its opinion, and ascertained that “the impact of the introduction of the minimum wage on the total volume of work appears to be very limited in the present business cycle”.|$|E
25|$|After the 1949 revolution, the Institute of Geography {{under the}} aegis of the Chinese Academy of Sciences became {{responsible}} for official cartography and emulated the Soviet model of geography throughout the 1950s. With its emphasis on fieldwork, sound knowledge of the physical environment and the interrelation between physical and economic geography, the Russian influence counterbalanced the many pre-liberation Western-trained Chinese geography specialists who were more interested in the historical and culture aspects of cartography. As a consequence, China's main geographical journal, the Dili Xuebao (地理学报） featured many articles by Soviet geographers. As Soviet influence waned in the 1960s, geographic activity continued as part of the process of modernisation until <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stop with the 1967 Cultural Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The three INLA men {{rushed through}} the {{turnstile}} leading to A wing's exercise yard. Peeling away a pre-cut section of wire fence, they {{climbed onto the}} roof of A wing and dropped into the forecourt where the Renault van containing Wright had just started to move forward towards the exit gates. The van was ordered to stop by the armed INLA men, however, the driver, John Park, thinking {{that he and the}} other officer were about to be taken hostage, intended to accelerate through the partially opened gates in a bid to escape. He was prevented from doing so when the gates were automatically shut. The other prison officers stationed at the forecourt gates had spotted the men on the roof, and assuming there was a prison escape in progress, activated the alarm system. The van was ten feet away from the gates when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halt. Neither of the two prison officers inside the van was armed.|$|E

25|$|Born as Kagetora, he was {{the third}} or fourth son of the noted warrior Nagao Tamekage (長尾為景), and his life {{presents}} a unique story - he was not from the Uesugi, but Nagao clan. His father's family were the retainers of the Yamanouchi branch of the Uesugi clan, and his father has gained some renown with his military victories over his lords Uesugi Akisada, Sadanori and Funayoshi. However, in later years, Tamekage found himself at odds with the neighboring Ikkō-ikki of Hokuriku, and as the political power in the region started to shift in favor of the Ikkō (due largely to the sudden rise of Hongan-ji), the situation for Echigo quickly deteriorated. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> peak in 1536, when Kenshin's father gathered up an army and marched westward. However, upon arriving at Sendanno (December 1536) in Etchū, his forces were suddenly attacked by Enami Kazuyori, and in the resulting battle Tamekage himself was slain, and his army put to flight.|$|E
25|$|In late 2010 {{it became}} soon {{clear that the}} {{coalition}} would end its offensive activities in Afghanistan no later than {{by the end of}} 2014. With five infantry battalions now at its disposal, RC-N proceeded to secure the gains scored thus far. Fierce fighting - though less frequent in total due to the now-strong coalition presence - continued throughout 2011, with the Talibans' focus of operations shifting towards Baghlan province for a time until <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> near-halt in late 2011. While this was regarded by some observers as a clear indication of the German success in the region, the insurgents continued to show their strength from time to time; perhaps their most humiliating blow dealt to the Germans took place on May 28, 2011 when Major General Markus Kneip, NATO's highest-ranking officer {{in the northern part of}} Afghanistan, was seriously wounded in an attack. Two soldiers of Kneip's entourage and several Afghans were also killed that day. Kneip is the highest ranking WIA of the Afghanistan War.|$|E

[...] He {{was riding}} home in the front car of his train, which his brother says he likely did to take {{advantage}} of the quieter atmosphere, when it struck an SUV at a grade crossing north of Valhalla, [...] south of the Chappaqua station. The train dragged the SUV while <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stop, loosening segments of the third rail that accumulated in the front car. Dirks, the SUV driver, and four other passengers were killed, making it the deadliest accident in Metro-North's history.|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{the impact}} of the {{government}} shutdown on the Republican Party, Gingrich later commented that, [...] "Everybody in Washington thinks that was a big mistake. They're exactly wrong. There had been no reelected Republican majority since 1928. Part of the reason we got reelected... is our base thought we were serious. And they thought we were serious because when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> show-down, we didn't flinch." [...] In a 2011 op-ed in The Washington Post, Gingrich said that the government shutdown led to the balanced-budget deal in 1997 and the first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920s, as well as the first re-election of a Republican majority since 1928.|$|E
500|$|The Charity Shield was {{presented}} to Bruce by former Arsenal manager Billy Wright. Wright died barely a year later, aged 70. Graham assumed both clubs would share the trophy, so when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> penalty shoot-out he entrusted his players to decide their order. He described Wright's goal as [...] "brilliant" [...] and felt it was [...] "unfortunate" [...] that Seaman missed: [...] "For a goalkeeper, he normally takes great penalties. He normally hits them hard but he decided to try and place this one and it didn't work." [...] Wright was unashamed of his penalty miss, [...] "…just as long as I don't do it when it is important".|$|E
500|$|During {{the night}} of 17 February and the early morning of 18 February 1964, 150 members of the Gabonese {{military}}, gendarmerie, and police, headed by Lieutenant Jacques Mombo and Valére Essone, seized the presidential palace. They arrested President of the National Assembly Louis Bigmann, French commanders Claude Haulin and Major Royer, several ministers, and President M'ba, who was dragged from his bed at gunpoint. On Radio Libreville, the military announced to the Gabonese people that a coup d'état had taken place, asked for technical assistance, and told the French not to interfere in this matter. M'ba was forced to broadcast a speech acknowledging his defeat, in which he said, [...] "The D-Day is here, the injustices are beyond measure, these people are patient, but their patience has limits. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> boil." ...|$|E
