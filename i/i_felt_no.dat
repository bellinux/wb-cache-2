500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, {{when asked if}} she had been too cruel in her writing, Phillips replied, [...] "We all have our standards. People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> constraints. Nothing I did in my book is as mean as any of the people I wrote about." [...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother. I was a pariah because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are." ...|$|E
500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Oblivions {{score was}} {{composed}} by series mainstay Jeremy Soule, {{a video game}} composer whose past scores had earned him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award in the [...] "Game Music Category" [...] and two nominations for an Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) award for [...] "Original Music Composition". The official soundtrack to Oblivion, featuring 26 tracks spanning 58 minutes; it was released in March 2006, via Soule's digital distributor DirectSong. Soule had worked with Bethesda and Todd Howard during the creation of Morrowind, and, in a press release announcing his return for Oblivion, Soule repeated the words he had said during Morrowinds press release: [...] "The stunning, epic quality of The Elder Scrolls series is particularly compatible with the grand, orchestral style of music I enjoy composing the most". As in his compositions for Morrowind, Soule chose to create a soft and minimalist score {{so as not to}} wear out users' ears. Soule stated that while composing the music he did not imagine any specific characters or events; rather, he wanted it [...] "to comment on the human condition and the beauty of life". In a 2006 interview, he related that this desire came {{as a result of a}} car accident that occurred during his composition of the score. He said, [...] "I ended up rolling in my car several times on an interstate while flying headlong into oncoming traffic ... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> fear ... I simply just acknowledged to myself that I've had a good life and I would soon have to say goodbye to all of it in a matter of seconds". Soule sustained only minor injuries, but commented that his feeling during the crash—"that life is indeed precious"—remained with him throughout the rest of the composition.|$|E

60|$|Though I saw {{an uneasy}} change in Mr. Micawber, which sat tightly on him, {{as if his}} new duties were a misfit, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had <b>no</b> right to be offended. My telling him so, {{appeared}} to relieve him; and he shook hands with me.|$|R
2500|$|Dion {{has said}} that his {{involvement}} as [...] "an activist for the separatist cause" [...] ended during a five-hour discussion with a federalist household while he was going door-to-door for the PQ, {{but he did not}} openly commit to federalism until much later. At the time of the 1980 referendum, his sentiments were neutral. In his own words, the 'no' victory left him [...] "neither moved nor outraged. To tell the truth, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> particular feeling." [...] (Moi, je ne me sentais ni ému ni révolté. À vrai dire, je n'éprouvais aucun sentiment particulier.) ...|$|E
2500|$|He did it {{from deep}} revulsion for the {{bitterness}} of the sectarian strife. Any revulsion they might feel from fat-ass bastards they ran up against professionally was ad hominem and not ad genus [...] Mary turned her head away in revulsion. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> revulsion for her maternal fantasies, only a practical concern. She met his advances with revulsion. [...] Pam was driven to revulsion (by {{the sight of the}} dead animal) 〈*The sight of the dead animal drove Pam to revulsion〉. Revulsion at slaughter cut war short [...]|$|E
2500|$|During World War II and the Korean War, Marian Anderson entertained {{troops in}} {{hospitals}} and bases. In 1943, she sang at Constitution Hall {{at the invitation of}} the DAR to an integrated audience as part of a benefit for the American Red Cross. She said of the event, [...] "When I finally walked onto the stage of Constitution Hall, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> different than I had in other halls. There was no sense of triumph. I felt that it was a beautiful concert hall and I was very happy to sing there." [...] By contrast, the District of Columbia Board of Education continued to bar her from using the high school auditorium in the District of Columbia.|$|E
60|$|From {{that moment}} {{not a sound}} could be heard from {{the deck of the}} Avenger. That which Darius said had aroused us all to the danger, and even though we had only a crew of lads, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{confident}} <b>no</b> blunder would be charged against us.|$|R
5000|$|On 19 March Lanza del Vasto began a 15-day {{hunger strike}} at La Cavalerie. He {{was joined by}} four local residents: Etienne Paloc, Pierre Bastide, and Pierre & Christiane Burguière. Mme Burguière {{recalled}} the impact it had on them. In 2011 she told film-maker Christian Rouaud [...] "it was amazing, in a moral sense. When we came back, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> was <b>no</b> longer the same. Yes. Something had happened." ...|$|R
60|$|The fear <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> was <b>no</b> {{rational}} fear, but a panic terror {{not only}} of the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me. Such an extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping silently as a child might do. Once I had turned, I did not dare to look back.|$|R
2500|$|In his {{autobiography}} written in 1876 Darwin reviewed questions about Christianity {{in relation to}} other religions and how [...] "the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible do miracles become". Though [...] "very unwilling to give up my belief", he found that [...] "disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> distress, and have never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion was correct." [...] He noted how [...] "The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered", and how Paley's teleological argument had difficulties with the problem of evil.|$|E
60|$|The routing of Sam {{had left}} me alert and self-confident. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> embarrassment. I greeted her briskly.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me, however, that I was {{sufficiently}} calm: at least <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> longer terrified. I expressed myself composed.|$|E
60|$|It {{was rather}} {{warm in the}} boat, and the rocking motion caused by the waves soon {{put me in a}} drowsy mood. My time was my own, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>no</b> humor to move away. I allowed my head to fall back, and almost before I knew it I had dropped into a light doze.|$|R
60|$|By {{that time}} I {{had made up}} my mind that the period was come when I must tell my {{guardian}} what I knew. The possibility of my being brought into contact with my mother, of my being taken to her house, even of Mr. Skimpole's, however distantly associated with me, receiving kindnesses and obligations from her husband, was so painful that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> could <b>no</b> longer guide myself without his assistance.|$|R
5000|$|Bailey Rae told The Sun: [...] "There's a line {{in there}} that love is bigger than your pride and that's how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> about him. <b>No</b> one was more right for me than him. No one." ...|$|R
6000|$|Strether debated. [...] "Well, she was {{the most}} {{important}} thing--she was definite. She was--at last--crystalline. And <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> remorse. I saw that they must have come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} undeserving of the {{confidence}} you have honoured me with, if <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its subject. I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou knowest," [...] said Hester--for, {{depressed}} as she was, {{she could}} not endure this last quiet stab at the token of her shame--"thou knowest that I was frank with thee. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> love, nor feigned any." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{my belief}} that <b>I</b> could have <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> greater dismay, if the long arm of the Law had laid its hold on me while he was speaking. I asked {{what was to be}} done.|$|R
500|$|The rest of {{his time}} in the High Court passed uneventfully, but he {{continued}} to be unhappy with his work as a judge, noting that [...] "I am nervous of myself, without much confidence in my judgment and hesitant about my sentences and damages and things of that kind. <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> glow of achievement in any summing up, though none of them have been bad." ...|$|R
60|$|Happily, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{in myself}} {{complete}} power to manage my pupils without aid; the enchantment, the golden haze which had dazzled my perspicuity at first, {{had been a}} good deal dissipated. I cannot say I was chagrined or downcast by the contrast which the reality of a pensionnat de demoiselles presented to my vague ideal of the same community; I was only enlightened and amused; consequently, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>no</b> disposition to complain to Mdlle. Reuter, and I received her considerate invitation to confidence with a smile.|$|R
60|$|A maniac's fury kindled {{under her}} brows; she {{struggled}} desperately to disengage herself from Linton's arms. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> inclination to tarry the event; and, resolving to seek medical aid {{on my own}} responsibility, I quitted the chamber.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, sir, said Mr. Giles. 'Misses wished some ale to {{be given}} out, sir; and as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> ways {{inclined}} for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among 'em here.' ...|$|E
60|$|When I entered it, the follies of {{the world}} {{abandoned}} me at the door. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings. My mind seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts.|$|E
60|$|She {{sent for}} me betimes, and I went {{in fear and}} {{trembling}} of her wrath and scorn. How shall I speak of that interview? How shall I describe the immeasurable contempt with which she visited me, and which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> was perhaps <b>no</b> more than I deserved.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{should have}} walked in without knocking, like me," [...] said Jill. She got up. [...] "Well, {{it was very}} kind of you to see me when I came in so unceremoniously.

6000|$|Up to {{this time}} <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> need of {{company on the}} trail, {{and for the most}} part we had {{travelled}} alone. But I now developed a poignant desire to hear the tinkle of a bell on the back trail, for there is no [...] "funny business" [...] about losing a packhorse in the midst of a wild country. His value is not represented by the twenty-five dollars which you originally paid for him. Sometimes his life is worth all you can give for him.|$|R
60|$|January 16.--Went to Court, and {{returned}} through a curious atmosphere, half mist, half rain, famous for rheumatic joints. Yet <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> increase of my plaguey malady, but, on the contrary, am rather better. I had need, otherwise {{a pair of}} crutches for life were my prettiest help.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} help but notice that his eyes were much upon Victory, and I did not like it, for I knew the type of man he was. But as it would not be {{necessary}} ever to leave the girl alone with him <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> apprehension for her safety.|$|E
60|$|That strike {{took six}} hundred feet of line quicker {{than any other}} I had ever experienced. I simply did not dare to throw on the drag. But the instant the speed slackened I did throw it on, and jerked to hook the fish. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> weight. The line went slack.|$|E
60|$|The {{situation}} I {{was saving}} {{was very small}} and distant now; <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> its urgency <b>no</b> more.

6000|$|... "You {{have always}} been that," [...] he told her. [...] "You are so truthful yourself," [...] he went on boldly, [...] "that I shall {{run the risk of}} saying the most banal thing in the world, just because it happens to be the truth. <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> for you since our first meeting what <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> for <b>no</b> other woman in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{believed}} of a verity that {{we walked}} {{at least three}} miles, cutting across lots here, or traveling many rods out of our course there, until {{it seemed as if}} we had traversed every lane and obscure passage {{to be found in the}} city. But we arrived safely at last, which repaid us for all the extra work; we had seen no one who gave any heed to us, and when we sneaked into the smoke-house from behind the ruins of the tavern, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> positive <b>no</b> one saw us.|$|R
