50|$|ESBO is {{manufactured}} from {{soybean oil}} {{through the process}} of epoxidation. Polyunsaturated vegetable oils are widely used as precursors to <b>epoxidized</b> <b>oil</b> products because they have high numbers of carbon-carbon double bonds available for epoxidation. The epoxide group is more reactive than double bond, thus providing a more energetically favorable site for reaction and making the oil a good hydrochloric acid scavenger and plasticizer. Usually a peroxide or a peracid is used to add an atom of oxygen and convert the -C=C- bond to an epoxide group.|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{modification}} of vegetable oils, via epoxidation and epoxide ring-opening with alcohols was studied, using environmentally acceptable methods. Epoxidation of vegetable oils with peracids {{produced in the}} presence of heterogeneous acidic catalysts requires low contact between the epoxide and the acidic centers to avoid consecutive reactions. The main by-product is the ketone, obtained from the epoxide rearrangement reaction. Ketone formation is favored by strongly acidic catalysts and by high temperatures. Apolar solvents decrease the ketone formation, polar-protic solvents react with the epoxide and polar-aprotic solvents suppress this reaction. It is proposed that the epoxide rearrangement occurs via an intra-molecular hydride migration. Molecular sieves, as titanium support for the epoxidation of vegetable oils, do not bring any other advantage than the high surface area. Amorphous Ti-SiO 2 /TBHP (TBHP=tert-butyl hydroperoxide) has similar activity to Ti-MCM- 41 /TBHP. A high titanium dispersion renders the catalysts Ti-SiO 2 more active and apolar-aprotic solvents improve the activity. Ti-SiO 2 lacks of Ti-leaching, and it is reusable. Catalysts based on tungstenate anion/hydrotalcite-like materials showed a very high peroxide decomposition rate and very low epoxide yield. A new general reaction system for the epoxide ringûopening reactions with alcohols, under very mild reaction conditions and using heterogeneous catalysts, was developed. It allows the addition of less reactive alcohols such as those with the neo structure. Highly acidic catalysts are advantageous only when small and linear alcohols are added. For bulkier alcohols, highly acid catalysts decrease the selectivity because the quickly protonated epoxide rearranges faster than it reacts with the alcohols. Crystalline aluminosilicates, like Y zeolite, showed very low activity for the epoxide alcoholysis because most of the acidic sites are not accessible to the bulky <b>epoxidized</b> <b>oil.</b> Lamellar aluminosilicates of the montmorillonite type, especially those with a higher amount of Brönsted sites in the silicate layers, showed to be the best catalysts for the epoxide alcoholysis thanks to the enhanced Brönsted-acid site accessibility that the open structure offers.

The effect of epoxidation degree on the copolymerization reaction between <b>epoxidized</b> <b>oils</b> and vinyl acetate (VAc) was investigated. Results showed that a copolymer can be formed between VAc and epoxidized LO with high epoxy content, while no reaction occurred between VAc and SO or its epoxidized derivatives. As the most reactive monomer among the studied <b>oils,</b> the <b>epoxidized</b> LO with highest epoxy content (i. e.

After curing, the impact of the resulting copolymer issued from the three tested formulations on the wood durability was evaluated. Results showed that the formulation comprising VAc, ELO®, H 2 O, K 2 S 2 O 8 and alkaline emulsifier (Formulation 3) can significantly improve wood’s durability against white rot- (Trametes versicolor) and brown rot fungi (Postia placenta and Coniophora puteana).

40|$|A {{phosphate}} ester-forming {{reaction was}} carried out by mixing <b>epoxidized</b> soybean <b>oil</b> with up to 1. 5 % o-phosphoric acid. In situ oligomerization took effect almost instantly producing a clear, homogeneous, highly viscous, and a low-acid product with a high average functionality. The resulting epoxide was used as a reactant for urethane bioelastomer synthesis and evaluated for rigid foam formulation. Results have shown that with a number of catalysts tested phosphoric acid significantly enhances a solvent-free oxirane ring cleavage and polymerization of the <b>epoxidized</b> soybean <b>oil</b> via phosphate-ester formation at room temperature. The resulting phosphoric acid-catalyzed epoxide-based bioelastomer showed an 80 % decrease in extractable content and increased tensile strength at the same isocyanate loading relative to the noncatalyzed epoxide. The oligomerized <b>epoxidized</b> soybean <b>oil</b> materials exhibited ASTM hydroxyl values 40 % less than the nonoligomerized starting material which translates to reduced isocyanate loadings in urethane applications...|$|R

Randomly orientated short hemp fibres {{were used as}} the reinforcing fibres. The effects of EHO/ELO addition, fibre weight fraction and alkali treatment of the hemp fibre were analysed through flexural tests, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and microscopic analysis.

Improvements in material performance were realized through the use of alkali treatment of the fibres due to enhanced fibre-matrix adhesion. In terms of cost, biodegradability and specific material properties, natural fibre composites represent an alternative to traditional synthetic fibre composites in specific applications.

40|$|Epoxidation of {{vegetable}} oils is a commercially important reaction, because the epoxides obtained from these {{renewable raw materials}} have wide applications as plasticizers and polymer stabilizers, such as PVC. Epoxidized oils are natural, non toxic, non corrosive and biodegradable, for these reasons they are useful as substitutes of phthalates, plasticizers derived from petroleum recently banned by EU in many countries due to their toxicity. Moreover, considering the high reactivity of epoxide groups, the epoxidized plant oils also acts as raw materials {{for the production of}} a variety of chemicals such as polyols, alkanolamines, and polymers like polyesters and polyurethane. Today, {{one of the most important}} <b>epoxidized</b> <b>oil</b> is soybean oil and its production is about of 200000 tons/year. On industrial scale the vegetable oils epoxidation is currently performed in batch reactors, with peracids, generated in situ through the acid catalyzed oxidation of the respective organic acid with hydrogen peroxide. Soluble mineral acids are usually used as catalyst. However, the latter promotes also the side reactions of oxirane ring opening with a dramatic decrease of the selectivity 1, 2. The use of a heterogeneous catalyst, in alternative to a soluble mineral acids, could allow the suppression of the side degradation reactions, improving the selectivity. An ideal catalyst would be characterized by the presence of Brønsted acid sites, and of a porous structure having a size smaller than that of the natural unsaturated triglycerides molecules. This catalyst would be a porous acid solid characterized by a surface having a hydrophilic character, and by acid sites located inside the pore, that is, accessible only to the components dissolved in the aqueous phase. In this case, the catalyst would promote only the formation of performic acid; this migrates in the oil phase where it spontaneously reacts giving the desired product, while, the undesired ring opening reactions are prevented. The use of acidic ionic exchange resins (AIER) as heterogeneous catalysts was found to minimize the side reactions and improve the selectivity, in addition of an easier recovery of the catalyst at end of the process. Acidic resins allow the isolation of stronger sites inside the pore structure thus the oxirane ring can be protected from the attack of the acid protons. Several polystyrene sulphonic resins, with different amount of divinylbenzene as cross-linking agent, were tested in the epoxidation {{of vegetable}} oils 3. Unfortunately, the use of these resins in continuous packed bed reactors is a difficult operation because their strong osmotic swelling, especially with gel-type resins causing a mechanical stress with the consequence of both the breakage of the resin and the increase of the pressure drop. The use of a more dimensionally stable heterogeneous catalyst, that could improve the selectivity allowing the shift from batch to continuous reactor, represents the key point to increase the productivity of the process. High specific area, strong acidity, remarkable (hydro) thermal stability, and the presence of pores of adequate size, comparable with the molecular dimension, should predict that zeolites could be good catalysts for the epoxidation with percaboxylic acids. The use of this type of catalysts in epoxidation is new, although the use of zeolites in acid catalyzed reaction was consolidated. The aim of this work is to evaluate the possibility of using zeolites as heterogeneous catalysts for promoting vegetable oils epoxidation. For this purpose, a preliminary screening of different zeolites was performed considering the diameter size of principal channels. A very high yield than classical process was reached using zeolite Y as solid catalyst. Therefore, different reaction parameters, such as temperature, catalyst and reagent amounts, were investigated, in order to find the optimal conditions to obtain a product that answer to the market requirements. The stability of the catalyst zeolite Y was also studied with reuses runs with satisfactory results...|$|E
40|$|Polymeric {{materials}} have been prevalent in {{our everyday lives}} {{for quite a long}} time. Most of today's polymeric materials are derived from nonrenewable petroleum-based feedstocks. Instabilities in the regions where petroleum is drilled, along with an increased demand in petroleum, have driven the price of crude oil to record high prices. This, in effect, increases the price of petroleum-based polymeric materials, which has caused a heightened awareness of renewable alternatives for polymeric feedstocks. Cellulose, starch, proteins and natural oils have all been examined as possible polymeric feedstocks. Natural oils are commercially available on a large scale and are relatively cheap. It is projected that the U. S. alone will produce 21 billion pounds of soybean oil in the period 2008 / 2009. Natural oils also have the advantages of inherent biodegradability, low toxicity, high purity and ready availability. Most natural oils possess a triglyceride structure as shown in Figure 1. Most natural oils have a unique distribution of fatty acid side chains, along with varying degrees of unsaturation per triglyceride. Common fatty acid side chains in naturally occurring oils are palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), a 16 carbon fatty acid with no unsaturation; stearic acid (C 18 : 0), an 18 carbon fatty acid with no unsaturation; oleic acid (C 18 : 1), an 18 carbon fatty acid with one double bond; linoleic acid (C 18 : 2), an 18 carbon fatty acid with two double bonds; and linolenic acid (C 18 : 3), an 18 carbon fatty acid with three double bonds. Of course, there are other fatty acids with varying degrees of unsaturation, but their abundance is usually minimal. All of the unsaturated fatty acids mentioned have naturally occurring cis double bonds, which is common for most unsaturated fatty acids. In addition, the afore mentioned fatty acids have the first double bond at the position of carbon 9 (C 9), followed by carbon 12 (C 12), if there are two degrees of unsaturation, then at carbon 15 (C 15), if there are three degrees of unsaturation. In addition, the double bonds are not in conjugation. Table 1 gives the fatty acid make-up of linseed oil. It can be seen that linseed oil has an average of 6. 0 double bonds per triglyceride. Its fatty acid content consists of 5. 4 % palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), 3. 5 % stearic acid (C 18 : 0), 19 % oleic acid (C 18 : 1), 24 % linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) and 47 % linolenic (C 18 : 3). Table 1 also gives the fatty acid composition and varying degrees of unsaturation for various other naturally-occurring natural vegetable oils. The regions of unsaturation in natural oils allow for interesting polymer chemistry to take place. Some of this interesting polymer science, however, involves chemical modification of the regions of unsaturation. Acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) is prepared by epoxidation of the double bonds, followed by ring opening with acrylic acid. The resulting oil has both acrylate groups and hydroxyl groups. Wool and colleagues have further reacted the hydroxyl groups within the oil with maleic anhydride to produce maleated acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (MAESO). The MAESO has been copolymerized with styrene free radically to produce promising thermosetting sheet molding resins. Petrovi? and co-workers have directly ring opened the <b>epoxidized</b> <b>oil</b> to produce polyols that produce promising polyurethanes through condensation polymerization with diisocyanates. Our group's work initially focused on direct cationic copolymerization of the double bonds or conjugated double bonds of natural oils with monomers, such as styrene and divinylbenzene, to produce promising thermosetting resins. The only modification of the oils that was carried out in these studies was conjugation of the double bonds to enhance the reactivity of the oil. This work has been expanded recently with the incorporation of glass fiber to produce promising composites. We have also explored thermal polymerization techniques to make novel thermosets. This dissertation is divided into four chapters. The first chapter discusses the synthesis and characterization of biobased thermosets prepared by the free radical polymerization of conjugated linseed oil with commercially available monomers. The second chapter covers the synthesis and characterization of a chemically modified castor oil and its copolymerization with cyclooctene via ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). The third chapter looks at the ROMP of a commercially available vegetable oil containing an unsaturated bicyclic moiety with dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and characterization of the resulting materials. The fourth chapter discusses the reinforcement of a ROMP resin using short glass fibers to make composite materials...|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} {{is focused on}} the preparation of a value-added product called biolubricant using canola oil and canola biodiesel as feedstocks. The presence of unsaturation among the selected feedstocks limits their application as a potential lubricant because unsaturation renders unfavourable oxidative and thermal stability, and poor lubricity when used as a lubricant. The two-step reaction pathway chosen to remove unsaturation in both the feedstocks and make potential lubricants are: (1) epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in the canola oil/canola biodiesel followed by epoxide ring opening and vicinal di-O-acetylation with acetic anhydride; and (2) epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in the canola oil/canola biodiesel followed by epoxide ring opening and O-alkylation with 1 -propanol. This research work is primarily focused on the preparation and development of heterogeneous catalysts using metal oxides or metal supported catalysts for the above-mentioned two-step synthesis procedure. The research work is divided into four phases. The first phase involved preparation of a heterogeneous catalyst for the epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in the canola oil. Sulfated tin oxide demonstrated promising activity with 100 % conversion of canola oil to epoxidized canola oil (biolubricant base oil) at the optimum conditions such as: temperature (70 oC), ethylenic unsaturation in the canola oil to H 2 O 2 molar ratio (1 : 3), ethylenic unsaturation in the canola oil to acetic acid molar ratio (1 : 2), catalyst loading of 10 wt% with respect to feed taken and reaction time of 6 h. Catalyst characterization was made to study the properties of sulfated-SnO 2 that promoted epoxidation reaction. Co-ordination of sulfate ions to the tin oxide surface after the calcination at 550 oC is found necessary because sulfate ions induce Lewis and Bronsted acidity to the catalyst surface. The epoxidation of canola oil reaction followed pseudo first-order reaction and the calculated activation energy was found to be 18 kcal/mol. The second phase involved with the preparation of vicinal di-O-acetylated canola oil (biolubricant type 1) using heterogeneous catalyst by epoxide ring opening and vicinal di-O-acetylation of epoxidized canola oil. Catalyst screening tests showed that sulfated-ZrO 2 is highly selective in complete conversion of epoxidized canola oil to vicinal di-O-acetylated canola oil. The optimum conditions obtained from the Taguchi experimental design are: reaction temperature (130 oC), epoxy to acetic anhydride molar ratio (1 : 1. 25), 16 wt% of catalyst loading with respect to the quantity of feed (<b>epoxidized</b> <b>oil)</b> taken, and a reaction time of 1 h 15 min. The reaction was found to follow the second-order and the calculated activation energy was 23 kcal/mol. The third phase of the work {{is focused on the}} development of a single heterogeneous catalyst that is active for both epoxidation, epoxide ring opening and vicinal di-O-acetylation reactions in a single pot. 10 wt% MoO 3 /Al 2 O 3 was found to be highly active and selective in complete conversion of unsaturated canola oil to vicinal di-O-acetylated canola oil in a single pot in minimum reaction time. The optimum conditions obtained based on response surface methodology are: unsaturation in the canola oil to tert-butyl hydroperoxide molar ratio (1 : 2. 25), 10 wt% MoO 3 /Al 2 O 3 as catalyst for both steps, 12 wt% of catalyst loading with respect to amount of canola oil taken, epoxide to acetic anhydride molar ratio (1 : 2) and a reaction time of 5 h 30 min. These optimum conditions are also applied for the one-pot synthesis of vicinal di-O-acetylated canola biodiesel and complete conversion was found to happen in 4 h and 15 min. The developed one-pot synthesis procedure was found effective in minimizing work-up procedures for product extraction, minimized catalyst usage and reaction time. Further, evaluation and comparison of physicochemical properties of vicinal di-O-acetylated canola oil and vicinal di-O-acetylated canola biodiesel were also made to identify their application as a lubricant for various applications. In the fourth phase O-propylated canola oil (biolubricant type 2) was synthesized from epoxidized canola oil by epoxide ring opening and O-propylation reaction. Al-SBA- 15 catalyst with Si/Al ratio 10 showed promising activity with 100 % conversion at the optimum conditions (based on response surface methodology). Catalyst characterization showed that impregnation of aluminum in the crystal lattice of SBA- 15 promoted epoxide ring opening and O-propylation reaction. The optimum conditions are temperature (100 oC), epoxy to 1 -propanol molar ratio (1 : 6), catalyst loading of 12 wt% with respect to epoxidized canola oil taken, and a reaction time of 6 h. The reaction kinetic showed that epoxide ring opening and O-propylation reaction followed second-order reaction, and the apparent activation energy was 12 kcal/mol. Al-SBA- 15 was found to be an efficient catalyst for the preparation of O-propylated canola biodiesel. 100 % conversion was achieved in 6 h reaction time. Determination of physicochemical properties of O-propylated canola oil and canola biodiesel showed that they meet the specifications of transmission gear oil and anti-wear hydraulic oils...|$|E
