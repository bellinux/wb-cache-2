40|$|Each year commercial, {{private and}} {{military}} aircraft jet engines are {{damaged by the}} ingestion of foreign objects. Annual engine repair costs for <b>ingestion</b> <b>damage</b> is {{in the tens of}} millions of dollars. Bird strikes represent the major foreign object threat to aircraft engines, although large hail and objects found on the ramp can also damage an engine. A radar based foreign object ingestion detection system (FOIDS) concept, the subject of this paper, is capable of determining when an object as small as 4 millimeters has entered a fan jet engine. Additionally, such a system is capable of determining the relative size of the object and the approximate point within the engine where the object impacts the engine. These data can be displayed in real time to the pilot. In addition, the information recorded in the data base can be used by the mechanics between major engine inspections to determine if a detailed inspection of the turbine blade roots or other hard to access engine parts is required. Long term statistical data developed by the system can also be used as a measure of the foreign object and bird ingestion problem at various airports and improve the reporting of ingestion and bird strike events above the currently estimated 20 percent reporting rate...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{considerable}} {{progress has been made}} in the last 20 years regarding the three-phase process of ingestion and the lower brain stem nuclei involved in it, no comprehensive descriptions of the ingestion-related lower brain stem nuclei are available for neuropathologists confronted with ingestive malfunctions. Here, we propose guidelines for the pathoanatomical investigation of these nuclei based on current knowledge with respect to ingestion and the nuclei responsible for this process. The application of these guidelines is described by drawing upon the example of the lower brain stem of a male patient with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease, who displayed malfunctions during the preparatory phase of ingestion, as well as lingual and pharyngeal phases of swallowing. By way of the representative application of the recommended investigation procedure to 100 mum serial sections through the patient's brain stem stained for lipofuscin pigment and Nissl material, we observed neuronal loss together with astrogliosis in nearly all of the ingestion-related lower brain stem nuclei (motor, principal and spinal trigeminal nuclei; facial nucleus; parvocellular reticular nucleus; ambiguus nucleus, motor nucleus of the dorsal glossopharyngeal and vagal area; gelatinous, medial, parvocellular and pigmented solitary nuclei; hypoglossal nucleus). In view of their known functional role in the three-phase process of <b>ingestion,</b> <b>damage</b> to these nuclei not only offers an explanation of the patient's malfunctions related to the preparatory phase of ingestion and lingual and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, but also suggests that the patient may have suffered from additional esophageal phase swallowing malfunctions not mentioned in his medical records...|$|E

40|$|Whether chronic ethanol <b>ingestion</b> {{significantly}} <b>damages</b> {{the small}} intestine remains controversial.

Suppression of humoral immunity in drug-treated animals was accompanied by reductions in circulating lymphocytes bearing activation markers (interleukin- 2 receptor beta-chain and OX 40, activated CD 4 + cells) and by striking thymic medullary atrophy. There were, however, {{no significant differences in}} thymic weights or in thymocyte numbers between experimental and control groups during the period of FK- 506 administration. Reduction of the medullary compartment was visualized immunohistochemically, by decreases in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I- and MHC class II-positive cells and in CD 37 + (mature medullary) thymocytes. Flow cytometric analysis of thymocytes showed that FK- 506 induced increases in bright, Thy- 1. 1 + cells and in numbers of CD 4 + and CD 8 + thymocytes, whilst CD 37 + cells were less numerous than in controls. Percentages of MHC class I- and MHC class II-positive cells varied little throughout the course of FK- 506 administration. Evidence of selective damage to medullary epithelial cells, attributable to FK- 506, was found at both the light and electron microscopic levels, whilst thymic macrophages in drug-treated rats displayed features of enhanced phagocytic activity, including <b>ingestion</b> of <b>damaged</b> epithelial cells.

The computations allow insight into the flow physics of ingestion and factors affecting the most efficient use of sealing air, as well as providing information to support the development of the theoretical models of ingestion that are useful to engine designers.

40|$|Ingestion (or ingress) of hot {{mainstream}} {{gas into}} the wheel-spaces between the rotor and stator discs {{in the high}} pressure stages of gas turbines {{is one of the}} most important internal cooling problems for engine designers. A rim seal at the periphery of the wheel-space and a radial outflow of sealing air are used to reduce or prevent this <b>damaging</b> <b>ingestion.</b> The sealing air is also used for rotor disc cooling. In this paper, a simplified axisymmetric computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a gas turbine rotor-stator wheel-space is used to predict the effects of ingress on the flow and heat transfer. The steady flow computations are carried out using the CFD code ANSYS/CFX and the shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model. The rotational Reynolds number, inlet flow rates and thermal boundary settings are selected to represent the operating conditions of an ingress experimental rig, and comparisons are made between computations and measurements of heat transfer in the wheel-space. The computed heat transfer from the steady model (in terms of values of local Nusselt number on the rotor) is in broad agreement with measurements obtained using thermochromic liquid crystal in a transient experiment. Alternative wall-surface thermal boundary conditions are investigated in order to study the sensitivity of computed Nusselt numbers to these modelling assumptions...|$|R

Forty-one healthy untrained males between the ages of 18 and 28 years consumed 2, 000 mg/d of either DHA or corn oil (PCB) for 44 days including a 28 day loading period. Serum fatty acids were analyzed to determine treatment efficacy. During the 17 day training period, an acute eccentric exercise bout was implemented followed by a full-body RT regimen thrice weekly.

D-Cysteine did inhibit chemotaxis but to a lesser degree than D-penicillamine. This dicotomy of drug effect may indicate that the beneficial action of D-penicillamine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is due to the decreased chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the joint, while the absence of an effect of phagocytosis and lysosomal enzymes shows the cells can still function to ingest and destroy bacteria.

Wild-type 129 /SvEv mice were gavaged with Ottawa urban PM 10 (EHC- 93) for 7 - 14 days and mucosal gene expression analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways software. Intestinal permeability was measured by lactulose/mannitol excretion in urine. At sacrifice, segments of small and large intestine were cultured and cytokine secretion measured.

Polyphenols in cocoa have antioxidant properties, and natural cocoa powder (NCP) contains {{the highest levels}} of total antioxidant capacity when compared to all other kinds of edible cocoa products. This study tested the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with NCP mitigates hepatic injury resulting from chronic ethanol consumption. Three groups of eight randomized Sprague-Dawley rats were fed standardrat food and treated daily for 12 weeks as follows: (i) the Ethanol-water group was given unrestricted access to 40 % (v/v) ethanol for 12 hours (at night) followed by water for the remaining 12 hours (daytime), (ii) the Ethanol-cocoa group had similarly unrestricted access to 40 % ethanol for 12 hours followed by 2 % (w/v) NCP for 12 hours, and (iii) the control group was not given alcohol and had unrestricted access to only water which was synchronously replenished every 12 hours as it was for the ethanol treated animals. Results: Qualitative structural liver damage evidenced by hepatocyte cytoplasmic fatty accumulation, nuclear alterations, and disruption of general liver micro-architecture, was severe in the ethanol-water group when compared with the ethanol-cocoa group of rats. Design-based stereologic assessment yielded a significantly greater volume (Tukey’s HSD, p = 0. 0005) ofundamaged hepatocytes (9. 61 ml, SD 2. 18 ml) in the ethanol-cocoa group as opposed to theethanol-water group of rats (2. 34 ml, SD 1. 21 ml). Control rats had 10. 34 ml (SD 1. 47 ml) of undamaged hepatocytes, and that was not significantly greater (Tukey’s HSD, p= 0. 659) than the value for the ethanol-cocoa group of rats. Relative to controls, therefore, histomorphometryFunctional Foods in Health and Disease 2012, 2 (5) : 166 - 187 showed 93 % hepatocyte preservation from alcoholic injury in rats that voluntarily imbibed NCP suspension compared with 23 % in animals that drank water. Conclusions: Ethanol-induced structural liver injury was qualitatively and quantitatively milder in rats which chronically imbibed alcohol then afterward drank NCP beverage in place of water. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of polyphenols in NCP are postulated in mitigating the damage of rat liver due to chronic ethanol consumption. Thus, it is suggested from these findings that regular drinking of NCP beverage may slow progression of alcoholic liver disease in dipsomaniacs...|$|R

Understanding this phenomenon and the required ambient conditions {{is key to}} preventing ice related failures in the future. This paper investigates the required ambient temperature and relative humidity for inlet ice formation. It presents the data collected from an on site ambient temperature and relative humidity meter {{as well as a}} real time bell-mouth inlet camera. An ambient temperature and relative humidity meter was installed on site and used to protect the turbine by shutting it down (trip) based on high relative humidity and low ambient temperatures. The initial criteria of relative humidity greater then 95 % and ambient temperature less then 35. 5 ?F (1. 9 ?C) used to trip and protect the unit were a combination of an educated guess and values cited in General Electric document Gas Turbine Inlet Air Treatment. [1] To further refine these trip parameters and better understand the inlet icing process, a camera was installed in the turbine inlet housing {{with a view of the}} bell-mouth and inlet guide vanes (IGV). This provided real time images of the inlet icing phenomena that was then correlated with the ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). Also, the camera images showed, after a significant icing event, that pieces of ice sloughed off the IGVs and were ingested by the turbine. Weather Radar data collected from www. weather. com shows that this can occur without precipitation. The theory of inlet ice formation was investigated using the Magnus equation for dew-point calculations and the ?Ideal Gas Law? with an assumption of constant specific heat for the flowing inlet temperature depression. Using a temperature recovery factor of. 8 (this has been supported by numerical modeling in previous research by Stewart [2]) the inlet guide vane temperature depression was predicted to be 6. 9 ?F (3. 8 ?C). With this IGV temperature depression, icing was predicted for ambient temperatures less then 38. 9 ?F (32 + 6. 9 ?F) (3. 8 ?C) and RH above 74 to 76 %. Evidence is also given for inlet ice formation on a General Electric model Frame 3 turbine at the same location. The collected RH, ambient temperature data and inlet camera images suggest condensate and not precipitate icing could be the root cause of the past ice ingestion failures. With the ambient temperature, RH data and bell-mouth camera images, the temperature depression at the inlet guide vanes was measured to be about 9. 5 ?F (5. 3 ?C). The temperature recovery factor (RF) was shown to be 0. 73. A 9. 5 ?F (5. 3 ?C) IGV temperature drop will result in IGV ice when ambient temperatures are below 41. 5 ?F (32 + 9. 5 ?F) (5. 3 ?C) and RH above 67 to 69 %. Setting the trip criteria to guarantee ice free operation will negatively impact the reliability and drop it to unacceptable levels. The original trip criteria of relative humidity greater then 95 % and ambient temperature less then 35. 5 ?F (1. 9 ?C) remain and are now seen as an acceptable compromise. Inlet air heating as a method of preventing inlet ice formation will be discussed. The amount of heat added to the inlet air to guarantee ice free operation is determined to be greater than 250 hp (186 kW). Finally, options for the inlet air heating energy source are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Nutrition {{science has}} evolved into a {{multidisciplinary}} field that applies molecular biology and integrates individual health with the epidemiologic investigation of population health (Go et al., 2003). Nutritional genomics studies the functional interaction of food and its components, macro and micronutrients, with the genome at the molecular, cellular, and systemic level (Ordovas & Corella, 2004). Diet can influence cancer development in several ways, namely direct action of carcinogens in food that can damage DNA, diet components (macro or micronutrients) that can block or induce enzymes involved in activation or deactivation of carcinogenic substances (Willett & Giovannucci, 2006). Moreover, inadequate intake of some molecules involved in DNA synthesis, repair or methylation can influence mutation rate or changes in gene expression. Several studies support the idea that diet can influence the risk of cancer; however information concerning the precise dietary factor that determines human cancer is an ongoing debate (Ames, 2001; Key et al., 2004; Anand et al., 2008; Couto et al., 2011). A lot of epidemiological studies, involving food frequency questionnaires, have been developed providing important information concerning diet and cancer, however, diet is a complex composite of various nutrients (macro and micronutrients) and non-nutritive food constituents that makes the search for specific factors almost limitless. Micronutrients are a set of approximately 40 substances, including vitamins, essential minerals and other compounds required in small amounts for normal metabolism, that are essential for human health (Ames, 1998; Lal & Ames, 2011). Micronutrients are capable of acting via a number of mechanisms to block DNA damage, mutation, and carcinogenesis by oxygen radicals, PAHs, and other chemical carcinogens (Perera, 2000; Collins & Ferguson, 2004). Micronutrient deficiency or excess can have modifying effects on genomic integrity that may involve nutrient-nutrient or nutrient-gene interactions and may depend on an individual’s genetic constitution (Fenech et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2011). Therefore, determining the intake levels of micronutrients required to maintain genome stability is an essential step in the definition of optimal diets for the prevention of cancer and other diseases caused by genome damage (Fenech et al., 2005). Comet assay {{has become one of the}} standard methods for assessing DNA damage, with a wide range of applications, namely in genotoxicity testing, human biomonitoring and molecular epidemiology, as well as fundamental research in DNA damage and repair (Collins, 2004, 2009); studying the mechanisms of action of genotoxic chemicals; investigating oxidative damage as a factor in disease; monitoring oxidative stress in animals or human subjects resulting from exercise, or diet, or exposure to environmental agents; studying the effects of dietary antioxidants; and monitoring environmental pollution by studying sentinel organisms (Dusinska & Collins, 2008; Azqueta et al., 2009). This research was conducted as a part of a human biomonitoring study to assess genotoxic effects in workers occupationally exposed to cytostatics drugs, and verify how micronutrients can influence a genotoxic response. Therefore, there were constituted two groups, 46 subjects occupationally exposed to antineoplastic drugs and 46 subjects non-exposed. For analysis of DNA damage and oxidative damage a modification of the comet assay originally described by Singh et al. (1988) was used to measure the basal level of DNA oxidation in lymphocytes (Collins, 2009). Percentage of DNA in the tail and oxidative damage parameters were measured using Zeiss AxioScope. A 1 fluorescence microscope and Comet Assay IV capture system (Perceptive Instruments ® software) and 50 nucleoids were scored per gel. Dietary intake was assessed using a self-administered Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) (Lopes, 2000; Lopes et al., 2007). The FFQ included type and quantity of food intake, namely some food items, which allowed for the quantification of different macronutrients and micronutrients. The FQQ is a 3 -page booklet including a list of 92 common food and beverage items and questions relating to food preparation and dietary habits. Participants were required to indicate how often each food and beverage was usually consumed per month, week, or day. Average daily consumption was based on the participants’ reports on how often a specified serving size of each food or beverage item was consumed. This information, along with the nutrient composition of the food item/unit weight taken from 92 selected items, allowed participants’ daily micronutrient and macronutrient intake to be calculated using the FREQUAN dietary analysis program (Baghurst and Record, 1984). The nutritional items selected from the FFQ for analysis were calories, retinol, vitamin B 12, folate, vitamins D and E, iron, and selenium. All the items presented concentrations above the dietary references intakes of Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academies. In order to investigate the association between genotoxicity biomarkers and nutritional items, multiple linear regressions were conducted by group (exposed/controls). It was found in the exposed group negative associations between %DNA in tail and calories (B=- 0. 011, p= 0. 013) and folate (B=- 0. 078, p< 0. 001), and positive associations between vitamin E (B= 1. 912, p= 0. 002) and iron (B= 2. 345, p< 0. 001). In control group, it was found for DNA oxidative damage a positive association with retinol (B= 0. 004, p= 0. 020) and negative associations with calories (B=- 0. 006, p= 0. 002) and vitamin B 12 (B=- 0. 589, p= 0. 006). Retinol was positively correlated with oxidative DNA damage in controls. The study by van Helden et al. (2009) demonstrated that vitamin A enhances OH radical formation in the Fenton reaction, showing that vitamin A can act as pro-oxidant or antioxidant, depending on the type of radicals involved, and may lead to DNA oxidative damage (Alakhras et al., 2011). Azqueta & Collins (2012) clearly distinguished between effects of vitamin A, pro-vitamin A carotenoids, and non-vitamin A carotenoids; being the latter group almost invariably reported to protect against DNA damage, whether endogenous or induced by exogenous agents, the pro-vitamin A carotenoids show a wider spectrum of effects, sometimes protecting and sometimes enhancing DNA damage. Vitamin E was found to be positively correlated with % DNA in tail. Watters et al. (2007) also found a positive association of vitamin E and oxidative DNA damage in a healthy, non-smoking population of young adults. A possible explanation for this result stems from some evidence that in the presence of copper or in smokers with a fat rich diet, vitamin E can act as a strong pro-oxidant, nevertheless it remains an unexpected result. Results found a positive correlation between iron and % DNA in tail, meaning that higher intake of iron associates with higher DNA damage. Oxidative lesions, and more specifically 8 -OHdG, is one of the most prevalent lesions induced by iron containing substances (Prá et al., 2012), however the FPG biomarker was not statistically associated with iron. There is sound evidence that iron deficiency increases genome instability, among other mechanisms, by impairing enzymes involved in antioxidant and nuclei acid metabolism (Prá et al., 2012). Results presented herein found that the amount of calories ingested was negatively correlated with both biomarkers assessed by comet assay. This was somewhat unexpected, as calories restriction reduces metabolic rate and oxidative stress, meaning that lower calories <b>ingestion</b> decreases DNA <b>damage</b> and DNA oxidative damage (Hart et al., 1999; Heilbronn & Ravussin, 2003). A significant negative correlation was found between folate and % DNA in tail. Courtemanche et al. (2004) also found that folate deficiency leads to increased DNA damage in primary lymphocytes, and that deficiency in the physiological level of folate caused more DNA damage than low-dose radiation in primary T lymphocytes. A significant negative correlation between vitamin B 12 and DNA oxidative damage (FPG) was found, suggesting that vitamin B 12 acts like a protective factor (Ames, 2001; Ames & Wakimoto, 2002; Ames, 2006). Minnet et al. (2011) also found a negative correlation between DNA damage and vitamin B 12 levels, meaning that higher levels of vitamin B 12 decrease DNA damage, in good agreement with the results herein. Comet assay allows for the study of the effects of nutrients with known anti- or pro-oxidant capacities on different cell types and in different concentrations. These studies have revealed an apparent paradox, or at least a hormetic effect, whereby many of these antioxidant compounds seem to protect against DNA damage at low doses while actually causing DNA damage at higher doses (Wasson et al., 2008). There are several possible reasons why significant associations are difficult to find. First, samples usually comprise mostly healthy persons; second, it is possible that a synergistic effect exists involving all antioxidants which is not seen for each individual nutrient (Watters et al., 2007). Third, it is plausible that associations between some of the antioxidants examined and oxidative DNA damage may be better captured using other measures of oxidative DNA damage. Fourth, it is possible that the range of antioxidant concentrations and/or oxidative DNA damage in this study was not wide enough to detect associations or that the associations simply do not exist (Watters et al., 2007). Previous studies have suggested a significant moderating effect of long-term antioxidant supplementation on endogenous and exogenous oxidative DNA damage in lymphocytes, supporting the hypothesis that dietary antioxidants may protect against cancer...|$|R
