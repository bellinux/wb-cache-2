His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter."
