5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, boats from {{mainland}} Scotland and the Netherlands dominated the local herring fishery. There is little <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Orcadian fleet until the 19th century but it grew rapidly and 700 boats were involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and later Stromness becoming leading centres of development. White fish never became as dominant as in other Scottish ports.|$|E
5|$|If after 2–4days {{there is}} still <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> air leak, various options are available. Negative {{pressure}} suction (at low pressures of –10 to –20cmH2O) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; {{it is thought that}} this may accelerate the healing of the leak. Failing this, surgery may be required, especially in SSP.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} {{was raised}} in 790 although {{the name of the}} ruler responsible is not preserved. Two more were raised in 800 and three in 810. No monument was erected to commemorate the important Bak'tun-ending of 830 and it is probable that political authority had alreadly collapsed at this time. Important cities such as Oxpemul, Nadzcaan and La Muñeca that were Calakmul's vassals at one time now erected their own monuments, where before they had raised very few; some continued producing new monuments until as late as 889. This was a process that paralleled events at Tikal. However, there is strong <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elite presence at the city continuing until AD 900, possibly even later.|$|E
50|$|<b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Roman {{settlement}} {{was found in}} 1963-64 at quarry site {{to the east of}} Buckden village; in 1981, <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Roman villa was found close to the Towers and a later excavation in 2006 at a site to the north east of Buckden village found <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Romano-British field system from the first to fourth centuries AD.|$|R

30|$|If {{differences}} in responses between burned and unburned plots were relatively consistent across the gradient of invasion, this would provide <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simple (additive) effect {{of fire and}} therefore no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fire × invasion interaction, indicating that fire and plant invasion function independently (Figure 1 a). If instead differences varied in magnitude and direction over the gradient of invasion, this would provide <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fire-by-invasion interaction, indicating that fire and plant invasion function multiplicatively (Figure 1 b).|$|R
5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy. Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties so effectively, and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent {{only a small portion}} of the total issue. The sharp increase in the number of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms dictated by the imperial center.|$|E
5|$|Archæological {{evidence}} from the Birrigai rock shelter in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve indicates habitation dating back at least 21,000 years. It {{is possible that the}} area was inhabited for considerably longer, with <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Aboriginal presence in south-western New South Wales dating back around 40,000–62,000 years. Another site of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation at a bogong moth resting site. These insects were an important source of food for the Aboriginal peoples of the Southern Alps and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in sand or ashes, and then eaten whole.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} time of his union with Cacht, Donnchad aspired to become High King of Ireland. With {{powerful}} maritime forces at his command, Echmarcach would have certainly been regarded as an important potential ally. Clear <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alliance between Echmarcach and the Uí Briain is preserved by the twelfth-century Banshenchas, a text which records the marriage of Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, to Tadc (died 1086), son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain (died 1086). Annalistic evidence of such an alliance is found well into the late eleventh century. In fact, kinship between Echmarcach's descendants and the Uí Briain even led to the accession of one of Echmarcach's maternal grandsons, Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115), to the kingship of the Isles at about the turn of the twelfth century.|$|E

The manor of Bentworth was not named in the Domesday Survey of 1086, but {{it was part of the}} Odiham Hundred. During the Second World War, Bentworth Hall was requisitioned as an {{outstation}} for the Royal Navy and nearby Thedden Grange was used as a prisoner of war camp.|$|E
5|$|Human {{occupation}} {{dates back}} to the Beaker culture of the late Bronze Age. There is also <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Iron Age hill fort and prehistoric barrows and field systems. There is evidence of a shrine dating from pre-Roman times, which was re-established as a Romano-Celtic Temple in the mid-4th century. According to at least one source, it is extremely likely this was succeeded by a small late-4th-century Christian oratory. Several Roman finds including gold coins of Augustus, Nero, and Drusus, two silver denarii of Vespasian and a Roman carnelian ring were found at the site during quarrying.|$|E

X had been tipped off about Mulder's activities by the agent's partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Scully, meanwhile, meets {{a group of women}} with abduction experiences similar to her own, and meets another member of the Syndicate known as the First Elder (Don S. Williams), who claims during her abduction she was placed on a similar train car and experimented upon by the Japanese scientists.|$|E

5|$|Observations {{with the}} Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope, first {{described}} in 1995, revealed that Europa has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of molecular oxygen (O2). The surface pressure of Europa's atmosphere is 0.1μPa, or 10−12 {{times that of}} the Earth. In 1997, the Galileo spacecraft confirmed the presence of a tenuous ionosphere (an upper-atmospheric layer of charged particles) around Europa created by solar radiation and energetic particles from Jupiter's magnetosphere, providing <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Pemex {{disallowed}} {{release of}} specific data but let Penfield and company official Antonio Camargo present their results at the 1981 Society of Exploration Geophysicists conference. That year's conference was underattended and their report attracted scant attention. Coincidentally, many experts in impact craters and the K–Pg boundary were attending a separate conference on Earth impacts. Although Penfield {{had plenty of}} geophysical data sets, he had no rock cores or other physical <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact.|$|E
5|$|Several archaeological digs have {{revealed}} that the site was occupied during the Upper Palaeolithic. There is <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> open settlement of the Creswellian culture on the hill {{in the middle of}} the headland dating to around 14,100 years ago. With over 13,000 lithic artefacts it is probably the largest site of the period. Most interesting were several blades typically found at Upper Paleolithic sites across Europe, but rarely seen outside of caves in the UK, where open air sites of this age are extremely rare. People at the Head were heavily involved with the production of blades, further excavations identified 649 tools, dominated by backed blades, endscrapers and burins.|$|E

5|$|The Gnome Motion Picture Company was a film {{production}} {{company that is}} credited with three productions between 1910 and 1911. The purpose of the company to was to produce stories about gnomes. Alice in Funnyland, The Birth of the Gnomes and Alice's New Year's Party were all productions that were most likely never released. Announcements in trade publications ceased in January 1911 and the company treasurer, Frederick Kalmbach, was later sued by the City of New York for taxes. Of the three planned productions, two official synopses were released in The Nickelodeon. Despite no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> actual release, the American Film Institute still recognizes all three films as being released in January 1911.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} study prehistoric art is {{dependent}} on surviving artifacts. Art created in mediums such as sand, bark, hides and textiles has not normally endured, while less-perishable materials, such as rock, stone, bone, ivory (and {{to a lesser extent}} wood), later pottery and metal, {{are more likely to be}} extant. Whether all these artifacts can be defined as works of art is contested between scholars. Alexander Marshack argued that the earliest, non-representational incisions on rock mark the beginnings of human art. More cautiously, Paul Mellars suggests that the relative rarity of these works means they cannot be seen as integral to early human society and <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> artistic culture.|$|E
5|$|The bronzes of Igbo-Ukwu pay special {{attention}} to detail depicting birds, snails, chameleons, and other natural aspects of the world such as a hatching bird. Other pieces include gourds and vessels which were often given handles. The pieces are so fine that small insects were included on the surfaces of some while others have what looks like bronze wires decorated around them. None of these extra details were made separately; the bronzes were all one piece. Igbo-Ukwu gave the <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> early bronze casting tradition in Nri.|$|E

5|$|The {{tawny owl}} has a {{geographical}} range {{of at least}} 10millionkm2 (3.8millionmi2) and a large population including an estimated 970,000–2,000,000 individuals in Europe alone. Population trends have not been quantified, but there is <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> overall increase. This owl is not believed to meet the IUCN Red List criterion of declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations and is therefore evaluated as being of least concern. This species has expanded its range in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Ukraine, and populations are stable or increasing in most European countries. Declines have occurred in Finland, Estonia, Italy and Albania.|$|E
5|$|With {{respect to}} the theory {{that there was a}} single author, as {{initially}} postulated by Dessau, this is based on the difficulties inherent in having a single work comprising a number of individuals but without any textual <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> editor who brought the material together. This is especially evident in that the text has examples of stated intentions by an author to write a life of one of the emperors, only for that life to be completed by another of the scriptores. If those statements are true, and those additional lives were completed, then an editor must {{have been involved in the}} project in order to select one scriptors life over another's.|$|E
5|$|A {{small area}} of {{convection}} not associated from the ITCZ became Tropical Disturbance 10 on April1, about 215km (350mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands in the Australian region. It moved west-southwestward, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on April2, {{and on the}} same date the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 16S. The thunderstorms organized into a small central dense overcast, and there was <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eye feature, suggesting the system could have been much stronger. Although satellite imagery had difficulty in tracking the low-level circulation, a nearby ship on April3 confirmed {{the presence of a}} circulation. Operationally the system was only classified as a tropical depression. However, data from QuikSCAT helped upgrade the system to moderate tropical storm status in a post-season analysis, with peak winds of 65km/h (40mph) on April3; as a result, it was not named. After previously moving to the west-southwest, the small storm turned back to the west due to a strengthening ridge to the south. Wind shear increased on April4, which rapidly dwindled the convection and thereby leaving behind an exposed circulation. It underwent the Fujiwhara effect with a larger disturbance to the east, causing the system to turn back to the north and dissipate on April5.|$|E
