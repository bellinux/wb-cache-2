5|$|The Egyptian army {{unleashed}} {{its full}} anti-aircraft arsenal and hit Alon's plane, {{but he managed}} to crash-land unharmed at 20:05, performing a <b>ground</b> <b>loop.</b> Weizmann landed at 20:15. Eddie Cohen, a volunteer pilot from South Africa, crashed and died, although it is unknown whether he was hit by anti-aircraft fire, or a technical problem caused the plane to malfunction. A report by Dan Tolkovsky, the Israeli Air Force operations officer at the time, stated that Cohen likely attempted to land at the Hatzor Airbase instead of Ekron, where eyewitnesses saw a burning plane crashing in the distance. He was the first Israeli Air Force KIA, and was buried in Tel Aviv (Nahalat Yitzhak) after his remains were found at the end of 1949.|$|E
25|$|The Berliner-Joyce XFJ was a United States {{prototype}} biplane fighter {{aircraft that}} first flew in May 1930. Designed by Berliner-Joyce Aircraft for the United States Navy, its lower wing, placed below the fuselage and just two {{feet above the}} ground, apparently gave it a tendency to <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> when landing, and it was never ordered for production.|$|E
25|$|The prototype, XFJ-1, {{was sent}} to Anacostia for testing after its initial flights, where the ground-looping habit was noted, and {{eventually}} resulted in a landing accident, necessitating return and repair. The company {{took the opportunity to}} add a Townend ring engine cowling, and upgraded the engine from a 450-hp Pratt & Whitney R-1340C to a 500-hp R-1340-92 Wasp. This and other improvements boosted speed from 177 to 193mph, and the Navy gave the reconstructed aircraft the designation XFJ-2. However, improved performance came at the expense of stability, and the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> problem persisted, and there was no interest in continuing with this design. Nevertheless, the prototype continued to be used for other tests for several years.|$|E
50|$|To {{facilitate}} this 5-way split, {{a device}} called a microphone splitter will be used. The microphone splitter serves several purposes; it will split the signal 5-ways, provide phantom power for condenser microphones and active DI boxes, {{and it will}} provide isolation between the 5 outputs, preventing <b>ground</b> <b>loops.</b> Preventing <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> is an extremely important function, as the severity of <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> typically increases with distance. In a large network of interconnected sound systems, {{such as the one}} in this example, <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> could become dangerously severe. Isolation to prevent <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> is therefore vitally important.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>loops</b> - When <b>grounding</b> a circuit, it is {{important}} to avoid <b>ground</b> <b>loops.</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>loops</b> occur when there is a voltage drop between the two ground potentials. Since ground is thought of as 0 V, the presence of a voltage is undesirable at any point of a ground bus. If this is the case, {{it would not be a}} true ground. A good way to fix this is to bring all the ground wires to the same potential in a ground bus.|$|R

25|$|After {{turning off}} the runway {{to the left and}} {{attempting}} a <b>ground</b> <b>loop,</b> the aircraft continued into Village Creek. The right wheel dropped off the 12-foot (3.7-m)-high bank first, allowing the right wing to strike rocks on the bank. The DC-3 then spun to the right and struck the south bank of the 35-foot (10.7-m)-wide creek. Village Creek was swollen from the rain which had plagued the Southern United States in the days of and before the accident, with widespread flooding and deaths due to tornadoes in neighboring Mississippi the day of the accident. The plane came to rest nose-down with the passenger area suspended over the waters of the creek. Though the cockpit was crushed, the passenger cabin was largely undamaged and no fire resulted. Rescue personnel alerted by the tower immediately worked to evacuate passengers and rescue the three critically injured pilots in the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|Conventional geared {{aircraft}} {{are much more}} susceptible to ground looping. A <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> occurs when directional control is lost {{on the ground and}} the tail of the aircraft passes the nose, swapping ends, in some cases completing a full circle. This event can result in damage to the aircraft's undercarriage, tires, wingtips, propeller and engine. Ground-looping occurs because, whereas a nosewheel aircraft is steered from ahead of the center of gravity, a taildragger is steered from behind (much like driving a car backwards at high speed), so that on the ground a taildragger is inherently unstable, whereas a nosewheel aircraft will self-center if it swerves on landing. In addition, some tailwheel aircraft must transition from using the rudder to steer to using the tailwheel while passing through a speed range when neither is wholly effective due to the nose high angle of the aircraft and lack of airflow over the rudder. Avoiding ground loops requires more pilot training and skill.|$|E
25|$|On 30 January, Kepford led {{one of four}} VF-17 {{divisions}} flying {{cover for}} dive and torpedo bombers striking Simpson Harbor, New Britain. Enemy fighters from Rabaul circled the harbor to intercept the bombers. The roving high cover division led by Blackburn was able to operate with the altitude advantage against enemies, but Kepford's division at 15,000′ was attacked from above by around a dozen enemy fighters, including at least one Tony. Kepford waited until a Japanese plane broke formation to make a gunnery run on a nearby Corsair. When the lone Zero turned to trail the American plane, Kepford followed and riddled the enemy's engine and wing root from behind, causing the plane to catch fire. Kepford was forced to peel off quickly thereafter due {{to the number of}} enemy planes around him. One of these, a Tony, came at him front the front. The plane's guns—of a larger caliber than those typically found on the Zero—tore into Kepford's right wing and caused the ammunition within to explode. During all of this, Kepford continued firing with the guns in his left wing, leaving the Tony flaming as it passed him by. Kepford hastened back to base with a wrecked wing and damaged hydraulic system, forcing him to land on one wheel and leading the plane to <b>ground</b> <b>loop,</b> causing its loss. Kepford walked away from the crash landing unhurt.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ground</b> and <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> {{are also}} {{important}} in circuit design.

500|$|The 479th FG {{converted}} to the P-51 Mustang in mid-September. On his second transition flight, {{at the point}} of touchdown during landing, Olds learned a lesson in [...] "false confidence" [...] when the powerful torque of the single-engined fighter forced him to <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> after the Mustang veered off the runway. Olds shot down an Fw 190 in his new Scat IV on October 6 during a savage battle near Berlin in which he was nearly shot down by his own wingman. He completed his first combat tour on November 9, 1944, accruing 270 hours of combat time and six kills.|$|E
500|$|The Gemini program {{represented}} {{a string of}} firsts for NASA—the first flight with two astronauts, the first rendezvous in space, the first spacewalk—and Kraft was on duty during many of these historic events. America's first spacewalk happened during the Gemini 4 mission; Kraft, at his console, found {{that he had to}} force himself to concentrate on his work, distracted by Ed White's [...] "mesmerizing" [...] descriptions of the Earth below. He could easily understand the euphoria that White felt at the spectacle, yet he also was mindful of the discipline required to keep the flight safe. White delayed his return to the capsule, and a communication problem prevented capsule communicator Gus Grissom from getting the crew to hear the order to terminate the spacewalk. When contact was finally re-established, Kraft expressed his frustration on his <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> to Grissom: ...|$|E

500|$|... 0n 19 August 1940, Johnson flew a Spitfire for {{the first}} time. Over the next weeks he practised handling, {{formation}} flying, attacks, battle climbs, aerobatics and dogfighting. During his training flights, he stalled and crashed a Spitfire. Johnson had his harness straps on too loose, and wrenched his shoulders – revealing that his earlier rugby injury had not healed properly. The Spitfire did a <b>ground</b> <b>loop,</b> ripping {{off one of the}} undercarriage legs and forcing the other up through the port main plane. The commanding officer (CO) excused Johnson, for the [...] "short airfield" [...] was difficult to land on for an inexperienced pilot. Johnson got the impression, however, that he would be watched closely, and felt that if he made another mistake, he would be [...] "certainly washed out". Johnson tried to pack the injured shoulder with wool, held in place by adhesive tape. He also tightened the straps to reduce vibrations. Johnson found he had lost his [...] "feel" [...] in his right hand, and it became numb. When he practised dives, the pressure also aggravated his shoulder. He often tried to fly using his left hand only, but the Spitfire would have to be handled with both hands during anything other than simple manoeuvres. Despite the difficulties with his injuries, on 28 August 1940, the course was complete. Johnson had 205.25 hours on operational types including 23.50 on the Spitfire.|$|E

2500|$|When compared, {{groundwater}} {{heat pumps}} {{are generally more}} efficient than heat pumps using heat from the soil. Closed loop soil or ground heat exchangers tend to accumulate cold if the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> is undersized. This can be a significant problem if nearby ground water is stagnant or the soil lacks thermal conductivity, and the overall system {{has been designed to}} be just big enough to handle a [...] "typical worst case" [...] cold spell, or is simply undersized for the load. One way to fix cold accumulation in the ground heat exchanger loop, is to use ground water to cool the floors of the building on hot days, thereby transferring heat from the dwelling into the <b>ground</b> <b>loop.</b> There are several other methods for replenishing a low temperature ground loop; one way is to make large solar collectors, for instance by putting plastic pipes just under the roof, or by putting coils of black polyethylene pipes under glass on the roof, or by piping the tarmac of the parking lot. A further solution is to ensure ground collector arrays are correctly sized, by ensuring soil thermal properties and thermal conductivity are correctly measured and integrated into the design.|$|E

2500|$|In 1911, {{he set out}} {{to build}} his first {{airplane}}, an airplane he named [...] "Silverwing". His first design was a monoplane, constructed of spruce and linen and which took the form of an American version of the Bleriot XI. The engine was a modified Elbridge motorboat motor, dubbed the [...] "aero special", which was a 2-stroke, 4-cylinder engine with a maximum of [...] and 1,050rpm. Upon completion, he sought to test the aircraft at the Great Salt Plains (adjacent to the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge) in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma. His first attempt at flight ended in a <b>ground</b> <b>loop,</b> which required $100 to repair. After repairs, Cessna attempted flight 13 more times, each time ending in some sort of failure. Finally on his 13th attempt, Cessna got a glimpse of hope as his aircraft bounced up into the air for a short time before crashing into the trees as he attempted to turn it. After his crash, Cessna exclaimed in frustration, [...] "I'm going to fly this thing, then I'm going to set it afire and never have another thing to do with aeroplanes!". Finally, in June 1911 Cessna had his first successful flight. The crowds that had scoffed at his failures changed their tone and began calling him a [...] "daring hero" [...] and nicknamed him the [...] "Birdman of Enid". Cessna continued to teach himself how to fly {{over the next several months}} until December 1911, when he made a successful [...] flight and a successful landing at the point of departure. He was the first person to build and fly an airplane in the Heartland of the United States—between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.|$|E

25|$|The TS-1 was {{not universally}} liked by its crews. Positioning {{of the lower}} wing below the {{fuselage}} resulted in short wheel struts. This, and the wheel's placement {{close to each other}} caused considerable problems with <b>ground</b> <b>looping.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{a special}} {{application}} of an isolation transformer, and {{is often used to}} prevent <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> or earth loops, which cause humming or buzzing in audio circuits. It also prevents low direct current voltages from passing.|$|R
50|$|Where {{no power}} need be transmitted, only digital data, {{the use of}} fiber optics can remove many <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> problems, and {{sometimes}} safety problems too, but there are practical limitations.

5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Ground</b> <b>loop</b> current {{induced by}} stray AC {{magnetic}} fields (B, green) ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> will be {{carrying}} some current {{at the local}} supply frequency, typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz, due to electromagnetic induction from current-carrying conductors nearby. There is an AC magnetic field everywhere in developed areas; however, its magnitude and direction depend strongly on the local environment and arrangement of current-carrying wiring. This influences the current induced in the <b>ground</b> <b>loop,</b> which is also dependent on the area enclosed by the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> and its orientation. The impedance of the loop, basically just its resistance at low frequencies, also influences the induced current that will flow. It is important to realise that for a <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> to cause problems, {{there must be a}} local magnetic field produced by power frequency or other systems. It is the combination of radiated field and receptive <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> that causes problems, and the situation can be improved by attention to either one, or both of these. In effect, the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> is the secondary of a very loosely coupled transformer, the primary being the summation of all current carrying conductors nearby. Transformer action limits the induced voltage in the loop, and the weak coupling limits the maximum current that will flow, even if the loop resistance is very low. The maximum induced energy is normally quite small, and except in situations very close to a radiating loop carrying high current, there is no prospect of inducing sufficient energy to cause a hazard to humans.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{also allows}} for isolated transmitter ports. The standard allows for non-isolated receivers. The standard recommends that systems ground the signal common at only one point, {{in order to avoid}} the formation of disruptive <b>ground</b> <b>loops.</b>|$|R
