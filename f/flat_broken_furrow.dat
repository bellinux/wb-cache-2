Scarcely {{two weeks}} had elapsed {{since he had}} last visited it and sat beneath its roof with Jim, and already its few ruins had taken upon {{themselves}} the look of years of abandonment and decay. The wild land seemed to have thrown off its yoke of cultivation in a night, and nature rioted again with all its primal forces over the freed soil. Wild oats and mustard were springing already in the <b>broken</b> <b>furrows,</b> and lank vines were slimily spreading over a few scattered but still unseasoned and sappy shingles. Some battered tin cans and fragments of old clothing looked as remote {{as if they had}} been relics of the earliest immigration.|$|R

It has many variations around the world, such as pasteli in Greece, croquant in France, gozinaki in Georgia, gachak in Punjab (India), chikki in India and kotkoti in Bangladesh. In parts of the Middle East, brittle is made with pistachios, while many Asian countries use sesame seeds and peanuts. Peanut brittle is the most popular brittle recipe in the US.The term brittle first appears in print in 1892, though the candy itself has been around for much longer.|$|R

50|$|As the sun rose, Captain di Cola's battery {{opened fire}} with {{shrapnel}} from a height at 1,900 {{meters from the}} enemy camp. Baratieri and staff, with the banner of Italy, occupied the high conical hill. The irregulars on the wing, seeking high ground, moved too far towards {{the center of the}} line, leaving almost unguarded on their left the height and village of Adu Auei. General Baratieri describes his surprise attack: A great commotion is visible in the hostile camp. Notwithstanding the sudden surprise, rapidly increasing groups of warriors swarm out with great promptitude and dash, advancing through the winding paths and small gorges, crossing them with wonderful agility, concealing their numbers, making a shield of their obstacles. They offer us only a small mark as they disappear from time to time, and gather in greater numbers under the cover of the defenses.The rifle fire runs along the whole line of the 3rd and 4th battalions, which keep well under the control of their officers in spite of the elan of the attack; as is proved by the frequent volleys, and the bayonet charges of individual units, on that <b>broken,</b> <b>furrowed,</b> and thickly covered ground.|$|R

5000|$|The eastern {{portion of}} the {{district}} is generally <b>flat,</b> <b>broken</b> only by gentle undulations. The e western parts, from north-west to south-west, are intersected by the Aravalli Range. Many of the valleys in this region are sandy deserts, part of India's Thar Desert, with an occasional oasis of cultivation. Some fertile tracts are also present; among these is the plain on which lies the town of Ajmer. This valley has an artificial lake, and is protected by the massive walls of the Nagpathar range or Serpent rock, which forms a barrier against the sand. The only hills in the district are the Aravalli Range and its offshoots. Ajmer is almost totally devoid of rivers. The Banas River touches the south-eastern boundary of the district so as to irrigate the pargana of Samur. Four small streams—the Sagarmati, Saraswati, Khari and Dai—also intersect the district.|$|R
60|$|He had {{not made}} himself known to his fellow-passengers as they already knew him as a gambler, an outlaw, and a desperado; he deemed it unwise to present himself in a newer {{reputation}} {{of a man who}} had just slain a brother gambler in a quarrel, and for whom a reward was offered. He slipped from the axle as the stage-coach swirled past the brushing branches of fir, and for an instant lay unnoticed, a scarcely distinguishable mound of dust in the <b>broken</b> <b>furrows</b> of the road. Then, more like a beast than a man, he crept on his hands and knees into the steaming underbrush. Here he lay still until the clatter of harness and the sound of voices faded in the distance. Had he been followed, it would have been difficult to detect in that inert mass of rags any semblance to a known form or figure. A hideous reddish mask of dust and clay obliterated his face; his hands were shapeless stumps exaggerated in his trailing sleeves. And when he rose, staggering like a drunken man, and plunged wildly into the recesses of the wood, a cloud of dust followed him, and pieces and patches of his frayed and rotten garments clung to the impeding branches. Twice he fell, but, maddened and upheld by the smarting spices and stimulating aroma of the air, he kept on his course.|$|R

60|$|Such was {{the current}} {{comment on this}} vale of spices. Like most human {{criticism}} it was hasty and superficial. No one yet had been known to have penetrated deeply its mysterious recesses. It was still far below the summit and its wayside inn. It had escaped the intruding foot of hunter and prospector; and the inquisitive patrol of the county surveyor had only skirted its boundary. It remained for Mr. Lance Harriott to complete its exploration. His reasons for so doing were simple. He had made the journey thither underneath the stage-coach, and clinging to its axle. He had chosen this hazardous mode of conveyance at night, as the coach crept by his place of concealment in the wayside brush, to elude the sheriff of Monterey County and his posse, who were after him. He had not made himself known to his fellow-passengers, as they already knew him as a gambler, an outlaw, and a desperado; he deemed it unwise to present himself in his newer reputation {{of a man who}} had just slain a brother gambler in a quarrel, and for whom a reward was offered.

Fromelles is difficult to justify as the point for an attack, even a feint attack” as it was <b>flat</b> ground, <b>broken</b> up by water obstacles, and overlooked by Aubers Ridge. Fromelles lay near the boundary of Second and First Armies, opening the possibility of participation by Second Army, whose GOC Plumer was reluctant to mount a diversionary attack at Ypres or Messines.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we give the}} first attempt to model the {{evolution}} of the spectrum of PSR B 1259 − 63 radio Emission while the pulsar orbits the companion Be star. As suggested by Kijak et al. (Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 418 :L 114, 2011 a) this binary system can be useful in understanding the origin of the gigahertz-peaked spectrum of pulsars. The model explains, at least qualitatively, the observed alterations of the spectral shape depending on the orbital phases of this pulsar. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that the external factors {{have a significant impact on}} the observed radio Emission of a pulsar. The model can also contribute to our understanding of the origin of some non-typical spectral shapes (e. g. <b>flat</b> or <b>broken</b> spectra) ...|$|R
