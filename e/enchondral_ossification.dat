40|$|Distraction osteogenesis is {{currently}} a standard method of bone lengthening. It is a viable method {{for the treatment of}} short extremities as well as extensive bone defects, because large amounts of bone can be regenerated in the distraction gap. Mechanical stimulation by distraction induces biological responses of skeletal regeneration that is accomplished by a cascade of biologic processes that may include differentiation of pluripotential tissue, angiogenesis, mineralization, and remodeling. There are complex interactions between bone-forming osteoblasts and other cells present within the bone microenvironment, particularly vascular endothelial cells that may be pivotal members of a complex interactive communication network in bone. Regenerate bone forms by three modes of ossification, which include intramembranous, <b>enchondral,</b> and transchondroid <b>ossifications,</b> although intramembraneous bone formation is the predominant mechanism of ossification.

To investigate chm-I function in vivo, we generated transgenic mice lacking chm-I mRNA and protein. Null mice are viable and fertile and show no morphological changes. No abnor-malities in vascular invasion and cartilage development were detectable. No evidence was found for a com-pensating function of tendin, a recently published homologue highly expressed in tendons and also, at low levels, in cartilage. Furthermore, no differences in the expression of other angiogenic or antiangiogenic factors such as transforming growth factor 1 (TGF- 1), TGF- 2, TGF- 3, fibroblast growth factor 2, and vascular endothelial growth factor were found. The surprising lack of phenotype in the chm-I-deficient mice suggests either a different function for chm-I in vivo than has been proposed or compensatory changes in uninvestigated angiogenic or angiogenesis-inhibiting factors.

MethodTen Norwegian Fjord Pony foals were operated {{at the age of}} 13 – 15 days. Two vessels supplying the epiphyseal growth cartilage of the lateral trochlear ridge of the left distal femur were transected in each foal. Follow-up examination was carried out from 1 to 49 days post-operatively and included plain radiography, macroscopic and histological examination. ResultsTransection of blood vessels within epiphyseal cartilage canals resulted in necrosis of vessels and chondrocytes, i. e., ischaemic chondronecrosis, in foals. Areas of ischaemic chondronecrosis were associated with a focal delay in <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification</b> (OC) in foals examined 21 days or more after transection, and pathological cartilage fracture (OCD) in one foal examined 42 days after transection. ConclusionThe ischaemic hypothesis for the pathogenesis of OC has been reproduced experimentally in foals. There are several similarities between OCD in animals and JOCD in children. It should be investigated whether JOCD also occurs due to a focal failure in the cartilage canal blood supply, followed by ischaemic chondronecrosis...|$|E

We describe a 52 -year-old woman with intracapsular chon-droma that involved the left knee. Radiologically, the mass was multilobulated, cal-cified, and sharply circumscribed and was lying between the patella and the antero-lateral surface of the tibia. The peculiar histologic pattern of the tumor was composed of hyaline cartilage nodules with <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification</b> or calcification, in apparent transition with septa of connective and adipose tissue. The most common differential diagnoses for this tumor are primary synovial chondromatosis and chondrosarcoma. We emphasize a possible metaplastic origin of the chondromatous component due to some mechanical posttraumatic disturbance of the infrapatellar fat pad.

40|$|For {{more than}} 60 years, {{hyperbaric}} oxygen therapy is a lifesaving therapy for de-compression sickness and air embolism. Among other indications HBO 2 is useful for osteomyelitis and mandibular radiation necrosis (UHMS, 1998 and 2003; Moon et al., 1996; Frey et al., 1998). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy accelerates the healing of bone (Yablon and Cruess, 1968; Marx and Ames, 1982; Nilsson et al., 1988; Granström et al., 1992; Sawai et al., 1996; Larsen, 1997). This acceleration is mostly attributed to an angiogenesis during the therapy with HBO 2. For healing of bone the process of mineralization is necessary. At present {{it is not clear}} how HBO 2 influences the mineralization. This thesis analyses influences of HBO 2, O 2 and pressure in the enchondral and intramembranous mineralization. Organoid cultures of fetal mice calvaria and epiphyses were used for this examina-tion. The amount of mineralization was measured by calcium and the alkaline phos-phatase activity in the cultures. The results are showing that the intramembranous ossification in fetal mice calvarial cultures is increased by HBO 2, O 2 and pressure. The most significant mineralization was measured in the cultures that were only affected by O 2. A singular treatment with O 2 and HBO 2 initially induces a decrease in mineralization, probably by the develop-ment of damaging free radicals. After the singular treatment, the cells begin to gener-ate an oxidative defence (Gutteridge, 1994; Rothfuss et al., 1998). The mineralization in the <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification</b> was significantly increased by recur-rent pressure. A singular treatment or treatments for less than 5 days induced a de-crease in mineralization. Until now there is no rationale found for this observation. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy accelerates the healing of bone by inducing an angio-genesis, but the therapy additionally increases the mineralization in the intramem-banous and <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification</b> in fetal mice organoid cultures...|$|E

The most frequent site of this complication is the distal femur, whereas the arm is an extremely rare site, with only a few cases of pseudoaneurysm of the brachial artery reported in the literature [18 – 21]. Repair of the arterial injury is seldom possible. When an end-to-end anastomosis cannot be performed, graft replacement with the autologous saphenous vein or with a synthetic graft is preferred [17].

40|$|Achondroplasia, {{the most}} common and best known {{skeletal}} dysplasia, is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Like a number of other skeletal dysplasias, among which hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia, achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR 3) gene. FGFR 3 is a negative regulator of bone growth. Binding of fibroblast growth factors to the FGFR 3 receptor stimulates its tyrosine kinase activity in the cell. This activates a signal transduction pathway that regulates <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification</b> by inhibition of cell division and stimulation of cell maturation and differentiation. Mutations in the FGFR 3 gene give rise to activation of the receptor in the absence of growth factors, thus causing abnormal long bone development.

The early disturbance of <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification</b> progresses to inflammatory and healing process in older horses. Metabolic pathway analysis showed an obvious dysregulation of several signaling pathways related to cartilage formation and cartilage repair such as Wnt/β-catenin, Indian hedgehog and TGF-β signaling pathways. Other regulated genes appeared to be involved in high carbohydrate diet, abnormal insulin metabolism or inflammation. Sclerostin is an osteocyte-secreted soluble antagonist of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It is crucial for osteoblast development and activity and is increased in naturally occurring lesions of equine osteochondrosis. The aim of this study is to compare the circulating sclerostin levels between OC-affected (n = 20) and healthy horses (n = 19). A significant linear regression between plasma sclerostin and age is observed especially in the healthy young horses. The mean plasma sclerostin concentration is significantly higher in young horses suffering from osteochondrosis compared to the control horses. These results reinforce the possible role of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the OC pathogeny. The inhibition of this essential pathway could disturb the osteo-chondral differentiation.

The traction applied at the distraction cleft stimulates osteogenetic cells that accumulate on collagen fibers that are formed from a radiolucent fibrous interzone (FIZ). New vessels arise proximal and distal to the distraction cleft, and woven bone and bundle bone initially form around them before then being remodeled into finished lamellar bone. The most important characteristic of distraction osteogenesis is the absence (Ilizarov 1989 a; Shearer et al. 1992) of the “intermediate cartilaginous phase” that would take place during <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification</b> in fracture healing. This indicates that desmoid ossification (Ilizarov 1989 a, b; Aronson 1994; Aronson et al. 1989) takes place during distraction, as in an epiphysial plate.|$|E
40|$|Ossification of the {{posterior}} longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine (OPLL) {{is characterized by}} the replacement of ligament tissues with ectopic bone formation, and this result is strongly affected by genetic and local factors. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of rs 2273073 (T/G) and rs 235768 (A/T) of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP 2) gene which are associated with OPLL have been reported in our previous report. In this study, we confirmed the connection in 18 case samples analysis of BMP 2 gene in OPLL patients; additionally, it was also shown from the OPLL patients with ligament tissues that <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification</b> and expression of BMP 2 were significantly higher compared with the non-OPLL patients by histological examination, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we studied the effect of SNPs in cell model. The C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells with different BMP 2 gene variants were constructed and then subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretch (0. 5 Hz, 10 % stretch). In the presence of mechanical stress, the expression of BMP 2 protein in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells transfected by BMP 2 (rs 2273073 (T/G)) and BMP 2 (rs 2273073 (T/G), rs 235768 (A/T)) were significantly higher than the corresponding static groups (P, 0. 05). In conclusion, these results suggested that BMP 2 gene variant of rs 2273073 (T/G) could not only increase cell susceptibility to bone transformation similar to pre-OPL...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. Using Zucker fatty rats as {{an animal}} model, we {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate on ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament by histopathologically investigating the prodromal, early, and advanced stages of ossification of the spinal ligaments. METHODS. 73 Zucker fatty rats were allocated to the ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate group (n= 33) and the control group (n= 40). The former group was fed ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate daily. The feed was given starting 2 months after birth and continued until the rats were killed at 3 to 18 months later. Chemical analysis of the blood, radiographic tests, and histopathological examination were then conducted for both groups. RESULTS. The results showed that ossification of the spinal ligaments involved excessive cartilage cell proliferation around areas affected by enthesitis; enlargement of the fibrocartilage tissue layer; ligament thickening; calcification of the matrix around the cartilage cells; and ossification of the spinal ligaments through <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification.</b> Radiographic examinations showed that osteoproliferation in vertebral bodies in rats receiving ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate was generally suppressed compared with controls, whereas histopathological examinations found no clear difference in cartilage cell proliferation in areas affected by enthesitis between the two groups, indicating the absence of calcification or osteo-proliferation in areas affected by enthesitis for the rats receiving ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate. CONCLUSION. Ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate is effective in suppressing progressive ligament ossification...|$|E
40|$|Skeletal growth {{depends upon}} <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification</b> in growth plate cartilage, within which chondrocytes undergo well defined stages of maturation. We infused IGF-I or growth hormone (GH), two key {{regulators}} of skeletal growth, into hypophysectomized rats and compared {{their effects on}} growth plate chondrocyte differentiation using qualitative and quantitative autoradiography, stereology, and incident light fluorescence microscopy. Stem cell cycle time was shortened from 50 to 15 and 8 d after treatment with IGF-I and GH, respectively. Proliferating cell cycle time decreased from 11 to 4. 5 and 3 d, and duration of the hypertrophic phase decreased from 6 to 4 and 2. 8 d. Average matrix volume per cell at each differentiation stage was similar for normal, hormone-treated, and untreated hypophysectomized groups. Mean cell volume and cell height were significantly reduced by hypophysectomy at the proliferative and hypertrophic stages, but were restored to physiological values by IGF-I and GH. In contrast, cell productivity, i. e., increases in cell volume, height, and matrix production per unit of time, did not reach normal values with either IGF-I or GH, and this parameter was inversely proportional to cell cycle time or phase duration. IGF-I and GH are thus capable of stimulating growth plate chondrocytes at all stages of differentiation, albeit to variable degrees with respect to individual cell activities. Although it is generally accepted that GH acts at both the stem and proliferating phases of chondrocyte differentiation, our data represent the first evidence in vivo that IGF-I is also capable of stimulating stem cells...|$|E
40|$|Several studies {{indicated}} that a homeobox gene, Msx 2, is implicated in regulation of skeletal development by controlling <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification</b> as well as membranous ossification. However, the molecular basis by which Msx 2 conducts chondrogenesis is currently unclear. In this study, we examined the role of Msx 2 in chondrocyte differentiation using mouse primary chondrocytes and embryonic metatarsal explants. Treatment with BMP 2 up-regulated the expression of Msx 2 mRNA along with chondrocyte differentiation in murine primary chondrocytes. Overexpression of wild-type Msx 2 stimulated calcification of primary chondrocytes {{in the presence of}} BMP 2. We also found that constitutively active Msx 2 (caMsx 2) enhanced BMP 2 -dependent calcification more efficiently than wild-type Msx 2. Consistently, caMsx 2 overexpression up-regulated the expression of alkaline phosphatase and collagen type X induced by BMP 2. Furthermore, organ culture experiments using mouse embryonic metatarsals {{indicated that}} caMsx 2 clearly stimulated the maturation of chondrocytes into the prehypertrophic and hypertrophic stages in the presence of BMP 2. In contrast, knockdown of Msx 2 inhibited maturation of primary chondrocytes. The stimulatory effect of Msx 2 on chondrocyte maturation was enhanced by overexpression of Smad 1 and Smad 4 but inhibited by Smad 6, an inhibitory Smad for BMP 2 signaling. These data suggest that Msx 2 requires BMP 2 /Smad signaling for its chondrogenic action. In addition, caMsx 2 overexpression induced Ihh (Indian hedgehog) expression in mouse primary chondrocytes. Importantly, treatment with cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor for hedgehogs, blocked Msx 2 -induced chondrogenesis. Collectively, our results indicated that Msx 2 promotes the maturation of chondrocytes, at least in part, through up-regulating Ihh expression...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFractures to the {{osteoporotic}} bone {{feature a}} delay in callus formation and reduced <b>enchondral</b> <b>ossification.</b> Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), the cellular source of fracture healing, are recruited to the fracture site by cytokines, such as BMP- 2 and BMP- 7. Aim {{of the study was}} to scrutinize hMSC for osteoporosis associated alterations in BMP mediated migration and invasion as well as in extracellular matrix (ECM) binding integrin expression. HMSC were isolated from 18 healthy or osteoporotic donors. Migration was assessed using a collagen IV coated micro-slide linear gradient chamber and time-lapse microscopy. Invasion was analyzed utilizing an ECM coated transmembrane invasion assay. Quantitative real-time RT PCR was performed for the ECM binding integrins α 1, α 2, α 3, α 4, α 5, α 11, αv and β 1. HMSC from osteoporotic patients showed a significant increase of migration upon BMP- 2 or FCS stimulation, as well as a significant increase of invasion upon BMP- 2, BMP- 7 or FCS stimulation. Nevertheless, the migration and invasion capacity was significantly decreased compared to healthy controls. Out of all integrins analyzed, collagen binding integrin α 2 was significantly downregulated in hMSC from osteoporotic patients. In conclusion, we here demonstrate for the first time osteoporosis associated alterations in BMP mediated hMSC recruitment. These findings may underlie the reduced healing of osteoporotic fractures. Nevertheless, the maintained migration and invasion response upon BMP stimulation illustrates the therapeutic potential of these clinically approved substances in the treatment of osteoporotic fractures. Another therapeutic target may be the downregulation of the collagen binding integrin α 2 in hMSC from osteoporotic patients...|$|E
