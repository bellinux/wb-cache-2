In the next match against India {{he did not take}} a wicket but England won the game comfortably. He took two wickets in the next game against Australia, but England lost the match meaning they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> India to qualify for the final. They did so, with Woakes taking 2–47 and hitting the winning runs to set up and England versus Australia final. Woakes had a poor game in the final, finishing with figures of 0–89 and being dismissed for a duck.|$|E
25|$|Roast Beef's {{birthday}} is April 22. Some of his accomplishments include {{a program that}} determines how many eggs and how much milk you need to buy in a given week, and another that determines the amount of loose change lying around your house and makes a reservation at a restaurant accordingly. Roast Beef is partial to UNIX and his preferred programming language is Java. He likes Stella Artois beer and Guinness. He is perhaps the world's greatest historian of the Great Outdoor Fight, and drove Ray to compete (and win) in the 2006 Fight. He also managed {{to get into the}} Fight himself by hacking the Fight's database. He fully accepted the fact that Ray would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> him senseless in order to win, and was shocked beyond belief when Ray destroyed the Fight rather than fight him. He drives a 1965 Ford Galaxie (powered by Ford's rare 427 SOHC V8 engine) that was a gift from Ray. He has also gone to the moon, by stealing Pat's home-made rocket, and to the afterlife (both heaven and hell), via various methods including some of the aforementioned shooting incidents and vomiting into an electrical outlet. He has also produced his very own zine, titled Man Why You Even Got To Do A Thing.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{caught up}} with league leaders Manchester United by the time both clubs played each other at Old Trafford in March 1998. Overmars was a {{constant}} threat in the match and scored in the 80th minute. He received the ball from Nicolas Anelka and ran with it, before managing to flick it beyond the goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel. Arsenal went on to win, which put them six points behind Manchester United, with three games in hand. Overmars afterwards said, [...] "This was a great result for us. But you don't win the Premier League against Manchester United; you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the other clubs." [...] Arsenal overtook Manchester United in April 1998, and won the league after beating Everton on 3 May 1998; Overmars scored two goals in the match. The team later faced Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup Final and it was Overmars who scored the opening goal, in the 23rd minute. Anelka's goal {{in the second half}} ensured victory and completed a league and cup double for Arsenal. Wenger praised Overmars after the final: ...|$|E

500|$|During the Peloponnesian War, Pericles {{initiated}} a defensive [...] "grand strategy" [...] whose aim was the exhaustion {{of the enemy}} and {{the preservation of the}} status quo. According to Platias and Koliopoulos, Athens as the strongest party did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Sparta in military terms and [...] "chose to foil the Spartan plan for victory". The two basic principles of the [...] "Periclean Grand Strategy" [...] were the rejection of appeasement (in accordance with which he urged the Athenians not to revoke the Megarian Decree) and the avoidance of overextension. According to Kagan, Pericles' vehement insistence {{that there should be no}} diversionary expeditions may well have resulted from the bitter memory of the Egyptian campaign, which he had allegedly supported. His strategy is said to have been [...] "inherently unpopular", but Pericles managed to persuade the Athenian public to follow it. It is for that reason that Hans Delbrück called him one of the greatest statesmen and military leaders in history. Although his countrymen engaged in several aggressive actions soon after his death, Platias and Koliopoulos argue that the Athenians remained true to the larger Periclean strategy of seeking to preserve, not expand, the empire, and did not depart from it until the Sicilian Expedition. For his part, Ben X. de Wet concludes his strategy would have succeeded had he lived longer.|$|E
500|$|Paramount faced two {{obstacles}} {{in promoting the}} film: the unfamiliarity of the [...] "MySpace generation" [...] with the franchise and the relatively weak international performance of the previous films. Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Europe and North America with 25 minutes of footage. Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed him to show more completed scenes than normal. The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Treks stigma. Abrams would exaggerate his preference for other shows to Star Trek as a child to the press, with statements like [...] "I'm not a Star Trek fan" [...] and [...] "this movie is not made for Star Trek fans necessarily". Orci compared Abrams' approach to The Next Generation episode [...] "A Matter of Honor", where William Riker is stationed aboard a Klingon vessel. [...] "On that ship when someone talks back to you, you would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> them down or you lose the respect of your crew, which is protocol, whereas on a Federation ship {{that would be a}} crime. So we have to give [...] a little bit of leeway, when he is traveling the 'galaxy' over there where they don't know Trek, to say the {{things that need to be}} said in order to get people onto our side." ...|$|E

Since USA Wrestling's National Team Trials use a best two-out-of-three format for their finals, Snyder <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the returning Olympic gold medalist {{a total of four}} times, which he did with a cumulative score of 21-6 over the course of their matches.|$|R
2500|$|In December 2001, Davis {{traveled}} to Utah to race {{for a spot}} on the 2002 Winter Olympics short track team. Teammates Apolo Ohno and Rusty Smith already had slots on the six-man team due to points earned from earlier races, and Ron Biondo was a lock for the third spot. In order for Davis to qualify, he would have to win the final race. [...] As both Ohno and Smith were also participating, Davis would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> them both. [...] Since Ohno had been dominant in the meet to this point, winning every race he entered with ease, a win by Davis seemed to be a long shot.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 May 1965, Arneil {{became the}} first person to {{complete}} the 100-man kumite after Oyama himself. The 100-man kumite took him around 2 hours and 45 minutes to complete, with each round scheduled to take 1 minute and 30 seconds (but a round ended if he managed to knock down his opponent). In an interview in 2005, Arneil said, [...] "I did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> everyone I fought, that would have been ridiculous! I just had to keep going, I had to have the spirit not to give up, no matter what they threw at me." [...] On 10 July 1965, Arneil was promoted to 3rd dan.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1907, a [...] "close friend" [...] of Baird {{told the}} press that Baird found the Western Conference's new {{restrictions}} to be unacceptable and warned that Baird would resign unless the conference loosened up on the rules. [...] Nevertheless, a proposal to extend the football schedule to seven games and to eliminate the harsh effects of applying the three-year rule retroactively was rejected. [...] One of the most troubling rules going into effect in 1907 limited eligibility to three years. [...] The rule was applied retroactively so {{that many of the}} conference's best players, including Michigan's captain Germany Schulz, would be ineligible to play as seniors even though they had played as freshman when such play was within the rules. [...] Six of the University's eight regents favored withdrawal, and Regent Arthur Hill noted, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Pennsylvania, and we cannot [...] do it under conference rules." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. [...] "I'm {{really too}} old to be trying to outscore 18-year-olds", O'Neal said, {{referring}} to the then 23-year-old Howard. [...] "It's not really my role anymore." [...] O'Neal was double-teamed most of the night. [...] "I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it's cool", said O'Neal. During the game, O'Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O'Neal with the Heat, was [...] "very disappointed cause [...] knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight." [...] O'Neal responded, [...] "Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching." [...] Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since [...] "everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back." [...] In a 2006 interview in TIME, O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would [...] "Make a guy <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass." ...|$|E
