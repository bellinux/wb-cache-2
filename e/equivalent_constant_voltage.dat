40|$|In this paper, a new {{charging}} {{strategy of}} lithium-polymer batteries (LiPBs) {{has been proposed}} based on the integration of Taguchi method (TM) and state of charge estimation. The TM is applied to search an optimal charging current pattern. An adaptive switching gain sliding mode observer (ASGSMO) is adopted to estimate the SOC which controls and terminates the charging process. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed charging strategy can successfully charge {{the same types of}} LiPBs with different capacities and cycle life. The proposed charging strategy also provides much shorter charging time, narrower temperature variation and slightly higher energy efficiency than the <b>equivalent</b> <b>constant</b> current <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> charging method...|$|R

30|$|With {{respect to}} {{corrosion}} damage, {{it was observed}} that during the corrosion process, there were more longitudinal cracks in the constant current specimens than in the <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> specimens. Also, the maximum crack widths for the constant current specimens were greater than those of the <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> specimens. Furthermore, the constant current specimens also experienced greater circumferential expansion than the <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> specimens. Considering all of these visual indicators of damage, and considering that both methods produced similar steel loss, {{it can be said that}} the constant current specimens showed greater signs of damage than the <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> specimens. Hence, it can be concluded that accelerated corrosion using constant current is recommended over the <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> in studying the effectiveness of various materials, repair strategies and admixtures to resist corrosion damage.|$|R

40|$|Effects of field-aligned {{potential}} drops on the magnetosphere-ionosphere {{coupling in}} a steady state are studied on a global ionospheric scale. It is shown that a constant-current generator can support a larger field-aligned potential drop than a <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> generator under similar conditions. The magnetospheric convection pattern is distorted more in the constant current generator case than in the <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> generator case. The main difference between a constant current generator and a <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> generator is found to lie {{in their ability to}} adjust the vorticity of the magnetospheric convection. The results show that a constant current generator allows the vorticity of the magnetospheric convection to adjust so that the field-aligned current can be kept constant under the loading influence of the field-aligned potential.

The upper transistor has nearly <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> at its gate and source. Thus, the only nodes with significant voltage on them are the input and output, and these are separated by the central connection of nearly <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> and by the physical distance of two transistors. Thus in practice there is little feedback from the output to the input. Metal shielding is both effective and easy to provide between the two transistors for even greater isolation when required.
