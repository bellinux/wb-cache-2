5|$|The Brue Valley Living Landscape is an {{ecological}} conservation project {{based on the}} Somerset Levels and Moors and managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust. The valley includes several Sites of Special Scientific Interest including Westhay Moor, Shapwick Heath and Shapwick Moor. Much of the area {{has been at the}} centre of peat extraction on the Somerset Levels. The Brue Valley Living Landscape project commenced in January 2009 to restore and reconnect habitat that will support wildlife. The aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to sustain itself in the face of climate change while guaranteeing farmers and other landowners can continue to use their land profitably. It is one of an increasing number of landscape scale conservation projects in the UK.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{ultimate}} goals of psychology/neuroscience <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to explain the everyday experience of conscious life. Francis Crick and Christof Koch made some attempts to formulate a consistent framework for future work in neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), though {{much of the work}} in this field remains speculative.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge {{representation}} {{goes hand in}} {{hand with}} automated reasoning because one of the main purposes of explicitly representing knowledge <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to reason about that knowledge, to make inferences, assert new knowledge, etc. Virtually all knowledge representation languages have a reasoning or inference engine as part of the system.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to guarding the royal residences all the guards are trained and educated in challenging military combat mission – both {{as individuals and}} as part of the Infantry Division. This <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to attend His Majesty the King and his family's safety in a modern way in the event of crisis or war.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} of Byzantine fault tolerance <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to defend against}} Byzantine failures, in which components of a system fail with symptoms that prevent some components of the system from reaching agreement among themselves, where such agreement is needed for the correct operation of the system. Correctly functioning components of a Byzantine fault tolerant system {{will be able to}} provide the system's service, assuming there are not too many faulty components.|$|E
25|$|Wide midfielders/Wide PlaymakersThese are midfielders {{that have}} pace and/or {{dribbling}} {{ability to be}} able to beat defenders along the flank. They will have the habit of running wide whenever they get possession of the ball or when their team is attacking, to receive the ball. Their most important skill <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to cross the ball into the penalty box to create opportunities for strikers. Sometimes strikers will pull right or left as a tactic to draw a defender out of position or to get into unmarked space.|$|E
30|$|The main {{perspective}} would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> consider complex environments such as {{the presence}} of metros in the tunnel. In this case, we have to implement diffraction on edges by using Ray Launching and also diffraction on curved surfaces.|$|R
50|$|A recruit to the Imperial Guard {{had to pass}} {{a series}} of {{proficiency}} tests, varying in subjects and difficulty.

25|$|The {{predecessor}} of Type 10, the Type 90 main battle tank, {{was only}} deployed in Hokkaido {{due to the}} weight limit of roads and bridges {{in other parts of}} Japan. One of the primary purposes of Type 10 <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to deploy anywhere in Japan. Size and weight reductions have made Type 10 now 6 metric tonnes lighter than Type 90, only weighing 44 tonnes. 84% of Japan's 17920 bridges are passable for the Type 10, compared to only 65% of passability of Type 90 and 40% of mainstream western main battle tanks.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, “escape jumps” propel the ant {{vertically}} and are {{proved to be}} intentional because of the behaviors that precede the jump. Patek et al. observed that before an “escape jump,” the ant will orient its antennae and head perpendicularly to the intruder. Additionally it will sway its entire body and then lift one leg vertically. This is quite an elaborate routine to prepare to propel itself 7cm off of the ground. The reason behind this maneuver <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to grab onto vegetation usually located around their nests {{in order to provide}} a form of escape.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} been {{performed}} on {{the components of the}} DNA translation mechanism. One desire of scientists creating synthetic biological circuits <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to control the translation of synthetic DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. One study tested the adjustability of synthetic transcription factors (sTFs) in areas of transcription output and cooperative ability among multiple transcription factor complexes. Researchers were able to mutate zinc fingers, the DNA specific component of sTFs, to decrease their affinity for DNA, and thus decreasing the amount of translation. They were also able to use the zinc fingers as components of complex forming sTFs, which are the eukaryotic translation mechanisms.|$|E
30|$|Our {{research}} identified relevant {{predictors of}} reading attitudes of fourth-grade students across four European countries, considering gender differences.

25|$|PAYE (Pay As You Earn) is a {{significant}} contributor to tax being 45%. Given the high unemployment rate the tax is quite heavy. This of course captures those that pay and keep records properly. The average salary is probably $250. This is skewed downwards by {{the large number of}} government employees whose average salary is around there. At the top end salaries are quite competitive and this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to attract the right skills though the cost of living is high so it balances this out. A top-earning Zimbabwean spends a lot more money on necessities than say a South African top earner. This is more evident when a comparison with the United States or England is done. The need to have a generator, borehole or buy water or take care of the extended family since there is no welfare given the government's financial position.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} uses of weather radar <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to assess the amount of {{precipitations}} fallen over large basins for hydrological purposes. For instance, river flood control, sewer management and dam construction are all areas where planners use rainfall accumulation data. Radar-derived rainfall estimates compliment surface station data {{which can be used}} for calibration. To produce radar accumulations, rain rates over a point are estimated by using the value of reflectivity data at individual grid points. A radar equation is then used, which is, ...|$|E
500|$|On August 19, 2011, {{the first}} part of a concert's behind the scenes video was released. In the behind the scenes special, lead guitarist Bibi stated [...] "She's {{listening}} to her inner voice right now and doing what she wants to do. I think she took risks. I think she's being more authentic and doing what she wants to do instead of doing what people expect, which is good." [...] Kim, the show's musical director described the idea of the intimate concert, [...] "This project is the most mature project for Beyoncé, because {{to be able to be}} in an intimate setting like this like the Roseland, which is a historic place, it's an amazing thing. I think the challenge of it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to present your whole album as its own concept, as its own piece and it's a great way to educate the people about what this album means to her; It's for her, it's for the fans, it's for anybody." ...|$|E

50|$|BDS C was bundled with a {{significant}} subset of the Unix system written in about 1980, called MARC (Machine Assisted Resource Coordinator). This effort in some ways resembled GNU, though MARC <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> run CP/M software through emulation. Unfortunately MARCs author, Ed Ziemba, perished in a snorkeling accident before he could complete the project.|$|R
500|$|Bowie {{agreed to}} what {{at the time}} was {{considered}} a controversial commercial sponsorship agreement with PepsiCo, which was later seen as helping {{to pave the way for}} other big money tours by other artists. For his part, Bowie recorded a TV commercial with Tina Turner to the tune [...] "Modern Love" [...] in May 1987 while he was preparing for the tour. The commercial had a short run, as Pepsi withdrew the commercial after Bowie was accused of sexual assault during the tour. Of the sponsorship agreement, Bowie said, [...] "We did a commercial sponsorship thing only for North America with the Pepsi-Cola company. As far as I'm concerned, what it's allowed me to do, having them underwrite the tour, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to produce a far more extravagant show than if I were just doing it myself. It means that instead of just having 1 or 2 sets I can have 3 or 4 sets made, and they can travel independently and they can be far more complicated." ...|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{feature for}} [...] "Oathbreaker", showrunner Weiss stated of the Tower of Joy {{flashback}} that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about being able to go back with Bran and look at the past <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to see the discrepancy between the received history, the things that everybody knows about the things that happened, and what actually happened." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E
