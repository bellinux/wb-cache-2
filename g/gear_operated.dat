Unusually, these engines had three cylinders (2416.5in) each, on two sets of engine frames, thus creating a six-cylinder Garratt; they were the second and final Garratts to employ this arrangement, the other being the aforementioned LNER U1. They entered service in 1929. Walschaerts valve <b>gear</b> <b>operated</b> the outside cylinders with the inner third cylinder linked by a Gresley conjugated valve gear.

50|$|Walschaerts valve <b>gear</b> <b>operated</b> {{the outside}} {{cylinders}} with the inner third cylinder {{operated by a}} Gresley mechanism. The locomotives proved a disaster on the light NZR tracks. W. W. Stewart, in his book When Steam was King (pp. 98-104) suggested the most likely reason was because the engines were too powerful for the system and also the valve gear mechanisms were complicated. Stewart stated, and existing photos verify, that the design was most unusual in that the coal bunker was carried on an extension to the boiler frame rather than the normal Garratt positioning on the rear engine unit's frame. Unlike a Union Garratt, however, the rear water tank was still mounted on the rear engine unit.|$|E
40|$|Little {{has been}} {{published}} on the behaviour of polymer <b>gears</b> <b>operating</b> under lubricated conditions. An experimental and analytical programme was undertaken to classify the regimes of EHL under which polymer spur <b>gears</b> <b>operate.</b> In doing so theoretical film thicknesses were calculated and then used to classify the regime according to Johnson's Map. The effects of lubrication on the operating efficiencies of high-performance polymer gears were interpreted and from these results coefficients of friction were derived. In addition to this the effect of tooth geometry was investigated and the beneficial influence of high-pressure angle tooth geometry is demonstrated. At loads typically associated with polymer <b>gears</b> the <b>operating</b> regime is shown to be mixed film lubrication. When high-pressure angle gears were tested at high loads the operating regime became full film lubrication and relatively little tooth flank damage occurred...|$|R

50|$|Three six-cylinder G class Garratt {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1928. They were the only six-cylinder simplex Garratts ever used in New Zealand and used Walschaerts valve gear to operate the outside cylinders, while Gresley conjugated valve <b>gear</b> <b>operated</b> the inner third cylinders. The locomotive was equipped with a mechanical stoker and was of an unusual design, with the coal bunker mounted on an extension to the main frame behind the cab instead of being mounted as a coal-and-water bunker on the rear engine unit’s frame, as was the usual practice on Garratt locomotives. Unlike a Union Garratt, however, the rear water tank was still mounted on the rear engine unit.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a six-cylinder 1,692 cc engine: [...] maximum power was set at [...] at 3,200 rpm. The engine {{featured}} central lubrication and the water-based cooling system for the engine employed both a pump and a thermostat. Power was transmitted to the rear wheels via what was in effect a four-speed manual transmission, on which the top <b>gear</b> <b>operated</b> {{as a form of}} overdrive. Third gear used the 1 : 1 ratio conventionally used by a top gear, and there was a fourth gear with a ratio of 1 : 0.73. Fuel economy was quoted as 11 l/100 km and top speed 90 km/h (56 mph), which combined to represent a competitive level of performance in the passenger car market of that time.|$|E

50|$|In the 3 years {{leading up}} to 1913 William Brough had been {{developing}} a flat-twin engine in-line with the frame. It was very similar to the ABC engines of that period. This 497cc engine had overhead valves, 70mm bore and 64.5mm stroke, and had a magneto fitted above and a 2-speed gearbox below. By the end of 1914 it had replaced all other engines in the Brough range, and using it only 3-models were planned for 1915. The three models were the HS - which was fitted with a two-speed countershaft <b>gear</b> <b>operated</b> by dog clutches, with chain drive to the gearbox, and John Bull rubber belt drive to the rear wheel over an adjustable pulley allowing the top gear range to be varied. No clutch or kick-start was provided. The second model was the HB, which was fitted with a Sturmey-Archer 3-speed hub gearbox and handle starter. The third model was the HTT, which was very similar to the HS but fitted with a specially tuned engine with high-compression, lightweight steel pistons, different camshafts, and special front cylinder lubrication.|$|E
5000|$|The first Nelson-Bowlus glider was the Nelson Bumblebee with a pod-and-boom {{fuselage}} two-seat {{powered sailplane}} NX1955. The Bumblebee in 1945-46 was built with a Righter O-45 16-hp four-cylinder engine. The prototype Bumblebee had a fully retractable tricycle landing <b>gear,</b> <b>operated</b> manually by the pilot. The nose gear was steerable with miniature shimmy dampeners and a lock. The rear wheels {{had a special}} cam action {{so that they could}} be tucked away in the fuselage at the proper angle. The rear wheels also had independent internally expanding brakes, designed by Bowlus, which facilitated taxiing on the ground. The high pitch sound of the engine caused Bowlus and Nelson to name it the [...] "Bumblebee." [...] A three-gallon gas tank fed the pusher type engine allowing it to fly {{for an hour and a}} half under full throttle, cruising at 75 mph. Tests were made which determined the engine was under-powered, producing about 16 horsepower at 3500 rpm, not enough for adequate flight, although Bowlus claimed it would climb 300 feet per minute to an altitude suitable for soaring. The men decided to build a suitable engine of their own design from scratch that was used for the later production models. Their new motor generated 25 horsepower, just enough power for takeoff and a slow climb.|$|E
5000|$|The Jindivik was {{developed}} {{as a result of}} a bilateral agreement between Australia and the UK regarding guided missile testing. While the UK provided the missiles, Australia provided test facilities, such as the Woomera Test Range. As a result of the talks, Australia gained the contract for developing an unmanned target aircraft to Ministry of Supply specification E.7/48. The specification called for an aircraft capable of a 15-minute sortie at 40,000 ft (12 200 m). Development began in 1948, with the first flight of the Pika in 1950 and the first flight of the Jindivik Mk.1 in August 1952.The manned prototype, known as the Pika, had side air intakes to make room for the cockpit and because the small wheel landing <b>gear</b> <b>operated</b> from a pneumatic reservoir. The unmanned version, the Jindivik, followed the same basic form except that it had a single skid instead of an undercarriage and a dorsal air intake located where the Pika's cockpit was. The Jindivik Mk.1 was powered by an Armstrong Siddeley Adder (ASA.1) turbojet, which had been {{developed as a}} disposable engine for the project. Only 14 Mk.1s were ever made. The Mk.2 was powered by a 1,640 lb Armstrong Siddeley Viper engine.

5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} and built by the roads master mechanic, Andrew Jackson [...] "A.J" [...] Stevens at Sacramento Locomotive Works in 1882. The locomotive had two highly unusual features: the firebox shape and the steam distribution. [...] The rear end of the firebox was depressed so that the outer shell was below the water level, leaving no clear steam space. The roof was sloped down towards the back so that steam bubbles would flow forward till they reached the upper vertical part of the backplate which was in two pieces. The fire-hole door was in the lower backplate. The firebox was very long, [...] to the tubeplate, the grate being [...] long. It {{is not clear what}} object Stevens had in mind when having this abnormal construction, which must have been costly to build and maintain: it did give more room in the cab.The special valve <b>gear</b> <b>operated</b> four slide valves for each cylinder, two of which were worked by Stephenson valve gear, but used for reversing only, and two more, on top of the first two, for controlling the cutoff, these being operated by a third eccentric through a rocking lever with a sliding block on one arm. The use of a double valve gear is reminiscent of Centipede, but separate valves for each end of the cylinder were novel on a locomotive. This valve gear gave very good steam distribution even at short cut-offs; short as understood for a saturated-steam engine with a boiler pressure low by modern standards. At long cut-off and a speed of [...] the indicated mean effective pressure was , which is over 91 per cent of the boiler pressure of , that is to say more than the 85 per cent normally used to calculate the tractive effort at starting. [...] The only other locomotives to use such a valve gear were the 20 copies of Mastodon (see below) and CPR #237 El Gobernador. All other steam locomotives with slide valves had just a single valve in the center.|$|E
