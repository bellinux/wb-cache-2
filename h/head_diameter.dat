30|$|In summary, {{many studies}} show how large femoral <b>head</b> <b>diameters</b> and shorter {{trunnion}} lengths might affect component damage. More research is necessary, as results concerning {{the effects of}} trunnion design {{still have to be}} considered inconclusive at present.|$|R
50|$|For the 1962 and 1963 {{car model}} years, the valve <b>head</b> <b>diameters</b> {{remained}} {{the same as the}} 221, but for the 1964 car model year, they were enlarged to 1.67 in (42.4 mm) (intake) and 1.45 in (36.8 mm) (exhaust) - this was an economy measure so that both 260 and 289 engines could use the same valves.

2500|$|Valve lift can be {{expressed}} as an actual dimension in decimal inches or mm. It can also be specified as a ratio between a characteristic diameter and the lift L/D. Most often used is the valve <b>head</b> <b>diameter.</b> Normally engines have an L/D ratio from 0 up {{to a maximum of}} [...]35. For example, a [...] valve would be lifted a maximum of 0.350inch. During flow testing the valve would be set at L/D [...]05 [...]1 [...]15 [...]2 [...]25 [...]3 and readings taken successively. This allows the comparison of efficiencies of ports with other valve sizes, as the valve lift is proportional rather than absolute. For comparison with tests by others the characteristic diameter used to determine lift must be the same.|$|E
2500|$|Valve/port {{coefficient}} is non dimensional and {{is derived}} by multiplying a characteristic physical {{area of the}} port and by the bulk flow figures and comparing the result to an ideal orifice of the same area. It is here that air flow bench norms differ from fluid dynamics or aerodynamics at large. The coefficient may {{be based on the}} inner valve seat diameter, the outer valve <b>head</b> <b>diameter,</b> the port throat area or the valve open curtain area. Each of these methods are valid for some purpose but none of them represents the true minimum area for the valve/port in question and each results in a different flow coefficient. The great difficulty of measuring the actual minimum area at all the various valve lifts precludes using this as a characteristic measurement. This is due to the minimum area changing shape and location throughout the lift cycle. Because of this non standardization, port flow coefficients are not [...] "true" [...] flow coefficients, which would be based on the actual minimum area in the flow path. Which method to choose depends on what use is intended for the data. Engine simulation applications each require their own specification. If the result is to be compared to the work of others then the same method would have to be selected.|$|E

25|$|Surgeons {{who perform}} {{more of the}} {{operations}} each year tend to have fewer patients dislocate.

40|$|Abstract. The {{brittleness}} {{of ceramics}} has been their weak spot when considering them for total hip replacements. There are several situations from which concentrated stresses can develop and induce {{failure of the}} components. It {{is not a problem}} of the material’s properties in particular but also its design. This means that even proof tested-third generation-ISO obeying ceramics may fail if the incidence of the design parameters on them is not carefully evaluated. In this paper, the finite element analysis technique is used to show how the change of ball diameter can affect the Vonmises stress on the ball head component when it is subjected to a high (trauma-like) load. The analysis is nonlinear and was carefully tested for convergence. 3 D models of four different ball <b>head</b> <b>diameters</b> where constructed, two designs of the bore/cone interface with two sets of material properties (Alumina and Zirconia) were considered. The results from these analyses are given in the form of stress maps on the ball heads; such data may be useful for surgeons, patients, and designers because it shows a direct relationship between two important parameters on ball <b>head</b> design (<b>diameter</b> and bore) and material properties, on the stresses that can cause failure of the component when they are concentrated in small elements of volume...|$|R

5000|$|As a {{response}} to criticism by Dr Ferdinando Moroni, Dr Ghirotti from Padua vehemently defended Frari’s work in [...] "Giornale veneto di science mediche" [...] in 1868.

He concluded that Professor Michele Carlo Frari was a highly qualified obstetrician and skilled surgeon, reliable and extremely appreciated for his work, and that his textbook was “written according to true principals of the art, with the right criteria and argumentation, based on proper experience and on opinions of celebrated obstetricians of various nations” (20).|$|R

The relationship between taper wear rates and a number of variables, including bearing diameter and orientation of the acetabular component, was investigated. Results The measured rates of wear and distribution of material loss from the taper surfaces appeared to show that the primary factor leading to taper failure is the increased lever arm acting on this junction in contemporary large-diameter metal-on-metal hip replacements.
