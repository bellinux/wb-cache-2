2500|$|The relief {{operation}} {{began to be}} accused of [...] "feeding the killers", causing a crisis of conscience among the agencies, who began to leave what some have called [...] "the messiest humanitarian quagmire ever". [...] The first to leave was Médecins Sans Frontières, who stated that [...] "this <b>humanitarian</b> <b>operation</b> was a total ethical disaster" [...] as it rewarded those responsible for the genocide rather than punishing them. The International Rescue Committee, a long-standing implementing partner of the UNHCR, then left stating that [...] "humanitarianism has become a resource and people are manipulating it as never before. Sometimes we just shouldn’t show up for a disaster." [...] These two organizations were joined by Oxfam, Save the Children and CARE, completing the departure {{of the largest and most}} professional humanitarian aid organizations upon which UNHCR relied heavily. A secondary reason given by some of these organizations is that they hoped that this dramatic action would prompt the international community to disarm the camps.|$|E
