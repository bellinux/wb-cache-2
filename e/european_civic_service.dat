40|$|<b>Civic</b> <b>service</b> {{appears to}} be a global phenomenon. The growth of service may warrant a dis-tinct field of study in which a {{comparative}} knowledge base could inform development and implementation of policies and programs. In this article, the authors summarize results of a global assessment of <b>civic</b> <b>service.</b> Searching by country and using information from organizational memberships, publications, and the Internet, 210 <b>civic</b> <b>service</b> programs were identified in 57 countries. This study has many limitations, raising more questions than it answers. Nonetheless, it is the first worldwide empirical glimpse of service, shed-ding light on several key questions: What are the current status and forms of civic ser-vice? What are its structures, goals, and effects? This introductory article of the special issue frames these questions for consideration by the authors, who identify historical and cultural determinants, forms, and mediators of <b>civic</b> <b>service</b> in different regions of the world...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. It {{is argued}} {{in much of}} the functionalist and neofunctionalist {{literature}} that interest groups can contribute toward integration through encouraging transnational functional cooperation, but there has so far been little investigation of the potential contribution of group activity to integration through its role in the formation of a supranational <b>European</b> <b>civic</b> culture. This paper uses the example of environmental interest groups to argue that by helping fill the participatory vacuum, group activity may be helping strengthen the foundations of European integration, may be contributing {{to the development of a}} <b>European</b> <b>civic</b> culture, and may thus be helping define the character, nature, and parameters of the emerging European polity...|$|R
