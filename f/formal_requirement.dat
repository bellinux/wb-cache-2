25|$|Some countries, {{including}} the Czech Republic, require that an alien {{who needs a}} visa on entry be {{in possession of a}} valid visa upon exit. To satisfy this <b>formal</b> <b>requirement,</b> exit visas sometimes need to be issued. Russia requires an exit visa if a visitor stays past the expiration date of their visa. They must then extend their visa or apply for an exit visa and are not allowed to leave the country until they show a valid visa or have a permissible excuse for overstaying their visa (e.g., a note from a doctor or a hospital explaining an illness, missed flight, lost or stolen visa). In some cases, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can issue a Return-Home certificate that is valid for ten days from the embassy of the visitor's native country, thus eliminating the need for an exit visa.|$|E

They pressed for additional ships of this type as substitutes for the two other battleships originally programmed, but this was rejected by the Admiralty as there was no demand for additional second-class battleships.|$|E

[...] The article, Marriage and the Limits of Contract, argues that the definition proposed by same-sex marriage advocates changes the social importance of marriage from its natural function of reproduction into a mere legality or freedom to have sex. [...] Dennis Prager, in arguing that marriage should be defined exclusively as the union of one woman and one man, claims that families provide the procreative foundation that is the chief building block of civilization. [...] The focus of {{the argument is that}} relationships between same-sex couples should not be described as [...] "marriages," [...] and that a rationale for this is that the putative ability to have natural offspring should be a <b>formal</b> <b>requirement</b> for a couple to be able to marry.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was another}} member of the {{expedition}} whose presence conforms still less to this hypothesis: the Veedor ("Overseer" [...] or [...] "Supervisor") Bernardino Íñiguez. This public office had functions that we would now call fiscal and administrative. It was his job to count the treasure gathered by the expeditions, in metals and precious stones, in order to assure the correct allotment of the quinto real [...] the [...] "royal fifth": 20% of all treasure gained in the conquests was destined for the Spanish royal treasury, a fiscal norm that originated in the Reconquista, the re-conquest of Spain from the Muslims [...] and of other legal requisites, such as reading to the Indians, before attacking them, a declaration of intentions and a warning, to legalize the aggression in the face of possible future investigations. (Cortés was especially scrupulous with this <b>formal</b> <b>requirement,</b> useless when one lacked interpreters who could translate the message to the Indians). If the expedition went to Guanajes to kidnap Indians, the Veedors presence would have been downright inconvenient for them. Although, on the other hand, according to Bernal, Íñiguez was nothing but a soldier who carried out the role of veedor, his being so designated in advance indicates that there was at least some thought of the possibility of exploration.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the [...] "Ekho" [...] study {{conducted}} by the GosNIIAS institute concluded that it would be more effective to deploy lots of small, subsonic cruise missiles than the much more expensive supersonic missiles then in favour. Work started at the Raduga bureau on an air-launched cruise missile in 1971, with a first test flight in 1976. The appearance of the US Air Force's AGM-86 ALCM in that year gave further impetus to the programme, with the Soviet Air Force issuing a <b>formal</b> <b>requirement</b> for a new air-launched cruise [...] missile in December 1976. The longer-range Kh-55SM was developed a few years after the original went into service. In the late 1980s work began on a replacement missile with either conventional (Kh-101) or nuclear (Kh-102) warheads and greater stealth. It was designed by Igor Seleznyev of Raduga. The importance of advanced missiles as [...] "force multipliers" [...] increased as Russia's fleet of available cruise-missile bombers declined in the early 1990s. The cancellation of the ambitious Kh-90 ramjet missile due to INF treaty in 1987 led to a renewed emphasis on improving the Kh-55, in particular to achieve the <20 m accuracy required to hit infrastructure targets with conventional - as opposed to nuclear - warheads. First flight of the Kh-101 was in 1998, and evaluation trials started in 2000.|$|E

40|$|Requirements play an {{important}} role in software systems developments. The impact of errors in requirements is costly, especially for safety and critical systems.

2500|$|The word walk is {{descended from}} the Old English wealcan [...] "to roll". In humans and other bipeds, walking is {{generally}} distinguished from running in that only one foot at a time leaves contact with the ground {{and there is a}} period of double-support. In contrast, running begins when both feet are off the ground with each step. This distinction has the status of a <b>formal</b> <b>requirement</b> in competitive walking events. For quadrupedal species, there are numerous gaits which may be termed walking or running, and distinctions based upon {{the presence or absence of}} a suspended phase or the number of feet in contact any time do not yield mechanically correct classification. [...] The most effective method to distinguish walking from running is to measure the height of a person's centre of mass using motion capture or a force plate at midstance. During walking, the centre of mass reaches a maximum height at midstance, while during running, it is then at a minimum. This distinction, however, only holds true for locomotion over level or approximately level ground. For walking up grades above 9%, this distinction no longer holds for some individuals. Definitions based on the percentage of the stride during which a foot is in contact with the ground (averaged across all feet) of greater than 50% contact corresponds well with identification of 'inverted pendulum' mechanics and are indicative of walking for animals with any number of limbs, although this definition is incomplete. Running humans and animals may have contact periods greater than 50% of a gait cycle when rounding corners, running uphill or carrying loads.|$|E
2500|$|One common way of {{reconciling}} {{these two}} opposing forces {{is simply to}} exempt all gene and protein symbols from the glossing rule. This is certainly fast and easy to do, and in highly specialized journals, it is also justified because the entire target [...] has high subject matter expertise. (Experts are not confused {{by the presence of}} symbols (whether known or novel) and they know where to look them up online for further details if needed.) But for journals with broader and more general target readerships, this action leaves the readers without any explanatory annotation and can leave them wondering what the apparent-abbreviation stands for and why it was not explained. Therefore, a good alternative solution is simply to put either the official gene name or a suitable short description (gene alias/other designation) in parentheses after the first use of the official gene/protein symbol. This meets both the <b>formal</b> <b>requirement</b> (the presence of a gloss) and the functional requirement (helping the reader to know what the symbol refers to). The same guideline applies to shorthand names for sequence variations; AMA says, [...] "In general medical publications, textual explanations should accompany the shorthand terms at first mention." [...] Thus [...] "188del11" [...] is glossed as [...] "an 11-bp deletion at nucleotide 188." [...] This corollary rule (which forms an adjunct to the spell-everything-out rule) often also follows the [...] "abbreviation-leading" [...] style of expansion that is becoming more prevalent in recent years. Traditionally, the abbreviation always followed the fully expanded form in parentheses at first use. This is still the general rule. But for certain classes of abbreviations or acronyms (such as clinical trial acronyms [...] or standardized polychemotherapy regimens [...] ), this pattern may be reversed, because the short form is more widely used and the expansion is merely parenthetical to the discussion at hand. The same is true of gene/protein symbols.|$|E
