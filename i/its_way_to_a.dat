5|$|NY323 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY249 and CR9 {{north of the}} Cattaraugus Indian Reservation in Brant. The route headed northward as Brant–Angola Road through a rural area dominated by open fields and forests. It proceeded to the Brant–Evans town line, where it met Cain Road (CR491) a short distance south of the New York State Thruway (I-90). The highway progressed onward, passing over the Thruway on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> junction with Dunfee Road, a connector leading to US20. NY323 met US20 itself a short distance to the northwest.|$|E
5|$|NY38 {{continues}} {{north as}} an unnamed highway to the hamlet of Conquest, {{a small community}} built up around the intersection of NY38 and Fuller and Slayton Roads. It continues on into the town of Victory, where the undeveloped fields give way to cultivated fields used as farmland. The route heads through mostly desolate surroundings to the hamlet of Victory, a slightly larger community centered on NY38. The route proceeds through the hamlet, passing by several homes on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> junction with NY370 {{just north of the}} community. Past this point, the homes cease again as NY38 presses on through more fields and forests to the town of Sterling.|$|E

5|$|The route follows Eighteen Mile Creek {{northwest}} and west toward {{the village of}} Hamburg, where the amount of development along the highway increases significantly. At McKinley Parkway (County Route204), NY391 becomes East Main Street and begins {{to pass through the}} outskirts of the village. It officially enters Hamburg upon intersecting Sunnyside Drive two blocks to the west. The route continues into the village center, passing by commercial and residential buildings on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> roundabout at Buffalo Street, where it meets US62. At this point, NY391 comes to an end while US62 turns west onto Main Street from Buffalo Street.|$|E
5|$|While NY346 {{follows the}} {{southern}} {{bank of the}} Hoosick River, VT346 largely runs along the northern bank. The switch in positioning is made {{just east of the}} state line, where VT346 crosses over the waterway. The route continues eastward, intersecting Indian Massacre Road, the continuation of CR96, and crossing a Pan Am Railways-owned railroad line on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> junction with Lime Kiln Road, a local highway leading to the village of Pownal Center. At this point, VT346 turns southward into the village of North Pownal. The route heads generally north–south through the community, running alongside both the Hoosick River and the Pan Am Railways line.|$|E
5|$|MD 410 {{continues}} east between Hyattsville to {{the south}} and the town of University Park to the north; {{the south side of the}} six-lane divided highway becomes flanked by the town of Riverdale Park ahead of its intersection with US 1 (Baltimore Avenue). The highway fully enters Riverdale Park east of US 1, where it reduces to four lanes and crosses over CSX's Capital Subdivision, which carries MARC's Camden Line. The Camden Line is accessed by the Riverdale railroad station within the Riverdale Park Historic District {{to the south}}, which contains the Riversdale Mansion. A tributary of Northeast Branch Anacostia River briefly runs within the median of the highway shortly before the highway crosses over Northeast Branch. MD 410 intersects MD 201 (Kenilworth Avenue) and leaves the town of Riverdale Park. The highway continues as Riverdale Road, a four-lane road with center turn lane, through the unincorporated area of East Riverdale on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> diamond interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway (unsigned MD 295).|$|E

5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Wheatfield, NY429 heads across {{populated}} but less developed areas on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> junction with US62. North of this point, the closely spaced homes gradually give way to more isolated houses and, eventually, rural farmland. It continues on a north–south line to the town of Lewiston and the hamlet of Sanborn, located adjacent to the Lewiston–Cambria town line. In the small but developed community, NY429 follows Buffalo Street past three blocks of homes to a junction with NY31 (Saunders Settlement Road). Buffalo Street ends here; however, NY429 joins NY31 for two blocks east to Townline Road, a north–south highway delimiting the boundary between Lewiston and Cambria. NY429 continues north on Townline Road, passing the sprawling main campus of Niagara County Community College, a stark departure from the rural fields that NY429 traversed in Wheatfield.|$|E
5|$|Past the exit, NY264 turns northeastward {{away from}} the freeway to serve less {{developed}} areas of Schroeppel. The highway winds its way past a mixture of cultivated fields and forested areas, passing {{the south end of}} CR54 and crossing over Sixmile Creek on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small cluster of homes near the northern town line. Here, NY264 connects to Godfrey Road, a local highway leading southeast to CR54 in the hamlet of Pennellville. The route climbs a hill as it crosses into the town of Palermo and the hamlet of Suttons Corner, located at the junction of NY264 and NY49. From Suttons Corner, the route heads generally north-northeastward across along another sparsely populated stretch to a junction with NY3 south of the hamlet of Palermo. NY264 ends here while NY3 continues north on NY264's right-of-way toward Palermo.|$|E
5|$|During {{this second}} tour, Schwarzkopf noted two {{incidents}} which haunted him. On February 17, 1970, {{two men in}} C Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry were killed by friendly fire from an American artillery shell that had been ordered by Schwarzkopf, but which had struck a tree near their position on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> target. The parents of one soldier blamed him {{for the death of}} their son, a claim which Schwarzkopf strongly denied and termed an accident of war. On May 28, 1970, Schwarzkopf landed his helicopter when discovering troops of B Company who had stumbled into a minefield. Two company officers had been wounded and two soldiers were trapped, fearful of setting off more mines. Although a medevac was on its way, Schwarzkopf ordered his UH-1 Huey to remove the wounded. As he attempted to help the troops back out of the field, one soldier struck a landmine, breaking a leg, and began to panic. Fearing he would set off another landmine, Schwarzkopf pinned the soldier to the ground while another soldier put a splint on the wounded man's leg. In doing so, another mine was set off, killing three and wounding Schwarzkopf's artillery officer.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Krovanh, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Niña, was a {{moderate}} tropical cyclone that caused a swath of damage stretching from the Philippines to Vietnam in August2003. The fifteenth named storm and sixth typhoon in the western Pacific that year, Krovanh originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough on August13. Despite rather favorable conditions, the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August18. However, these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later. Intensification was rather rapid upon the storm's reformation– the depression reached tropical storm status on August20 and then typhoon intensity two days later. Shortly after, Krovanh made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120km/h (75mph). The typhoon emerged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm, though {{it was able to}} restrengthen over warm waters. Once again at typhoon intensity, Krovanh clipped Haiyan before moving over the Leizhou Peninsula on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> final landfall near Cẩm Phả, Vietnam on August25. Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as Krovanh moved across northern Vietnam, where the storm met its demise the following day.|$|E

The Amistad was later apprehended near Long Island, New York, by the United States Revenue Cutter Service and taken into custody. The widely publicized court cases in the United States federal district and Supreme Court, which addressed international issues, helped the abolitionist movement.|$|E
