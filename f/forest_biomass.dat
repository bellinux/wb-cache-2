5000|$|In general {{there are}} two types of feedstocks: forest (woody) Biomass and {{agricultural}} biomass. In the US, about 1.4 billion dry tons of biomass can be sustainably produced annually. About 370 million tons or 30% are <b>forest</b> <b>biomass.</b> [...] <b>Forest</b> <b>biomass</b> has higher cellulose and lignin content and lower hemicellulose and ash content than agricultural biomass. Because of the difficulties and low ethanol yield in fermenting pretreatment hydrolysate, especially those with very high 5 carbon hemicellulose sugars such as xylose, <b>forest</b> <b>biomass</b> has significant advantages over agricultural biomass. <b>Forest</b> <b>biomass</b> also has high density which significantly reduces transportation cost. It can be harvested year around which eliminates long term storage. The close to zero ash content of <b>forest</b> <b>biomass</b> significantly reduces dead load in transportation and processing. To meet the needs for biodiversity, <b>forest</b> <b>biomass</b> will be an important biomass feedstock supply mix in the future biobased economy. However, <b>forest</b> <b>biomass</b> is much more recalcitrant than agricultural biomass. Recently, the USDA Forest Products Laboratory together with the University of Wisconsin-Madison developed efficient technologies that can overcome the strong recalcitrance of forest (woody) biomass including those of softwood species that have low xylan content. Short-rotation intensive culture or tree farming can offer an almost unlimited opportunity for <b>forest</b> <b>biomass</b> production.|$|E

30|$|Forest {{management}} for climatic benefits, so-called carbon forestry, {{is currently a}} hot topic (Bellassen and Luyssaert 2014). Opinions about the overall role of forests in carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation vary widely as do opinions about climatically good forest management. The results of some studies indicate that {{a good way to}} mitigate climate change through forest management is to let the forests grow and accumulate carbon in living biomass and dead organic matter (Pukkala 2014; Heinonen et al. 2017). Other studies suggest that forests should be used to maximize their climatic benefit, because the use of wood products may reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels (Liu and Han 2009). Wood and other <b>forest</b> <b>biomasses</b> can be burned for energy, and sawn wood can be used for construction to reduce carbon releases from cement and steel industry.

This paper examines how payments to foresters for the carbon sequestered in their trees would affect harvesting decisions.

40|$|Abstract To {{understand}} {{carbon cycle}} and flows of forests, accurate information on tree-component-specific litter pro-duction of trees is needed. In the ecosystem models, the litterfall of living trees is usually {{predicted by the}} biomass component by average amounts corresponding to site con-ditions or by multiplying the biomass of the growing stock by the component-specific biomass turnover rate. In this study, the rates of needle biomass turnover of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were derived from the needle-shed dy-namics. When the rates for needle litter production were modelled, the weighting and yellowing effects were taken into account. The annual biomass turnover rates of needles for southern and northern Finland are 0. 21 and 0. 10, re-spectively. Species-specific estimation of litter production is essential for understanding the carbon cycle and flows of <b>forests.</b> <b>Biomass</b> turnover rates can provide useful litter production estimates for large areas with average biomass values {{as a source of}} data...|$|R
