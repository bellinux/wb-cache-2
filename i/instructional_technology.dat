Opportunities to build on classroom studies are offered through a range of extracurricular activities. Admission is competitive and an IQ score of at least 124 is required. ACS is notable for its record of success in academic competitions at the state and national levels in mathematics, science, geography, and other subjects. ACS was recognized as a Blue Ribbon School by the United States Department of Education in 1988.

40|$|This study {{originates}} from {{an interest}} in how students interpret scientific con-cepts demonstrated with animated <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies.</b> Currently, science education makes use of diverse kinds of instructional methods. For the ad-vancement of instruction, new technologies have continuously been employed. Such new <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies</b> have always been accompanied with expec-tations that they should reform teaching. The availability of IT in schools and the selection of animated displays for instructional purposes provide new op-portunities for education. This thesis accounts for three empirical studies of students’ collaborative work with <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies.</b> For the purpose of studying students’ scientific reasoning, two kinds of animated <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies</b> were designed. The three studies focused on designing and exploring the whole educational intervention and {{are located in the}} area of design-based research. They provide detailed analyses of secondary school students’ collaboration on an assignment of giving a joint written account of the instructed concept. Analytically, this is done within a socio-cultural framework that uses interaction analysis inspired by ideas from conversation analysis and ethnomethodology. Study I and Study II report observations from <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies</b> that deal with the flow of materials in the carbon cycle. The two studies were connected, as the outcomes from the first study informed the educational framing of the second study. Study III reports findings from a sub-study of a design experiment where students worked in a virtual laboratory to learn about the solubility of gas in water. The results from the studies show that students’ reasoning was influenced by several aspects, such as the characteristics of the animated display, language use, school cultural norms, the formulation of the assignment and the students’ pre-knowledge. The analyses also evinced that the students’ interpretation of a demonstrated concept often diverted from a canonical scientific one, which warns against assuming that the collaborative meaning-making of animated <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies</b> automatically leads to a creation of the desired scientific concept. These findings emphasise that when designing and applying animated <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies</b> in education, one has to consider a wider context where assignment formulation, teacher guidance, school culture and semiotic processes influence how students approach and frame their assignment...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Healthcare {{educators}} have {{a critical role}} in leading the integration of <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies</b> into <b>instructional</b> programs, not only to support students’ academic and professional success, but also to model eLeadership. PURPOSE: The purpose of this podium presentation is to examine strategies for healthcare educators to proactively participate and take leadership roles and functions in the realm of <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies</b> in learning environments and instructional programs. METHODOLOGY: From Open Educational Resources (OERs) to resources on their bookshelves, to reusable learning objects (RLOs), to working and teaching smarter, among other strategies, participants will discover how to become eLeaders and model eLeadership. Research informs practice and practice informs theory. Drawing from current research and practitioner literature, the session offers examples, techniques, case profiles, and guidelines on how eLeadership is linked to productivity, cost, creativity, and decision making. The session will include a presentation, guided discussion, and polling.

40|$|Recent {{technological}} developments have {{contributed significantly to}} the instructional equipment available for use by high school agriculture teachers. Microcomputers, printers, VCRs, camcorders, satellite receivers, and computer modems have become available for use in high school programs. Coinciding with the increased availability of instructional equipment, the extent to which <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies</b> are being used is of concern to agricultural educators. McCarney (1987) advocated shifting education from a labor-intensive emphasis to a capital-intensive emphasis. He indicated that this shift could best be accomplished by utilizing technologies such as computers and video cassette recorders for instructional purposes. Others have suggested that the use of <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies</b> should support and empower the learner. Wedman (cited in Mihalevich, 1989) suggested that the appropriate use of <b>instructional</b> <b>technologies</b> {{is one of the most}} important considerations educators will face in the 1990 s.
