5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Serbs and Bosniaks in the Battle of Kosovo on 15 June 1389, Ivan Shishman had to seek help from Hungary. During the winter of 1391–1392, he entered into secret {{negotiations}} with the King of Hungary Sigismund, who was planning a campaign against the Turks. The new Ottoman sultan Bayezid <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> to have peaceful intentions in order to cut off Ivan Shishman from his alliance with the Hungarians. However, in the spring of 1393 Bayezid gathered a large army from his dominions in the Balkans and Asia Minor and attacked Bulgaria. The Ottomans marched to the capital Tarnovo and besieged it. The defence of the capital was led by Patriarch Evtimiy because Ivan Shishman was located in Nikopol, presumably for better communication with Sigismund. After a three-month siege, Tarnovo fell on 17 July. According to the contemporary Bulgarian scholar and cleric Gregory Tsamblak, the city was not captured because of the Ottoman military strength but due to treason. The Ottoman campaign of 1393 devastated Bulgaria; in the wake of that invasion, the lands of Ivan Shishman were limited to Nikopol and several towns along the Danube. Upon his return from Wallachia after the Battle of Rovine in 1395, Bayezid I attacked and captured Nikopol and, according to the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle, murdered Ivan Shishman on 3 June 1395. A Byzantine chronicle gives the date as 29 October. However, some sources suggest that the Bulgarian ruler was captured and died in prison.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 February 2006, Pavarotti sang [...] "Nessun dorma" [...] at the 2006 Winter Olympics opening {{ceremony}} in Turin, Italy, at his final performance. In the last {{act of the}} {{opening ceremony}}, his performance received the longest and loudest ovation of the night from the international crowd. Leone Magiera, who directed the performance, revealed in his 2008 memoirs, Pavarotti Visto da Vicino, that the performance had been recorded weeks earlier. [...] "The orchestra pretended {{to play for the}} audience, <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> to conduct and Luciano pretended to sing. The effect was wonderful," [...] he wrote. Pavarotti's manager, Terri Robson, said that the tenor had turned the Winter Olympic Committee's invitation down several times because it would have been impossible to sing late at night in the subzero conditions of Turin in February. The committee eventually persuaded him to take part by prerecording the song.|$|E
2500|$|Sometime during August 2011, Parks was {{contacted}} by electronic musician Skrillex for orchestral arrangements. Parks elaborated in 2013, [...] "When Skrillex called me up, I'd {{never heard of}} him. <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> I knew who he was. [...] "'Send me the piece, and if I feel able, I'll do it.' I don't have any hobbies, you know. I love music; I do it [...] And he said, 'Oh, thank you, Mr. Parks. We will destroy the world.' I said, 'Okay...' I Google him and there he is, on YouTube, in front of 30,000 people, pouring beer onto a laptop computer, {{at which point the}} crowd jumps into the mosh pit and has an erection.…I have two things I can do: Run away from all this in horror because I’m so superior, or dig in and serve and try to bring hope to the hopeless. That can be done behind the curtain, and that’s where I’m very comfortable working.…I treat every job {{as if it were the}} very thing that will define me. Nothing is beneath me. I think that is evident to people who ask my best." [...] His arranging work was released in December 2011 as the iTunes-exclusive bonus track [...] "Skrillex Orchestral Suite by Varien" [...] on the Bangarang EP.|$|E
