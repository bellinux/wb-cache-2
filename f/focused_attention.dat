The province and the National Fire Protection Association denounced the cuts. The Canadian Centre for Emergency Preparedness suggested that such cuts would necessitate Canada asking for assistance from the United States in similar situations. Also cancelled by the Conservative federal government was the Canadian Emergency Management College, established in 1954 to train first responders. A spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews deflected criticism of the cuts, noting that 90 per cent of emergencies are managed municipally or provincially.|$|E

Wiens's trial for murder and attempted murder occurred under strict security measures and was observed by national and international media, diplomats and legal experts.|$|E

5|$|The {{emerging}} {{discipline of}} geology also brought {{natural history and}} natural philosophy closer together; {{the establishment of the}} stratigraphic column linked the spatial distribution of organisms to their temporal distribution, a key precursor to concepts of evolution. Georges Cuvier and others made great strides in comparative anatomy and paleontology in the late 1790s and early 19th century. In a series of lectures and papers that made detailed comparisons between living mammals and fossil remains Cuvier was able to establish that the fossils were remains of species that had become extinct—rather than being remains of species still alive elsewhere in the world, as had been widely believed. Fossils discovered and described by Gideon Mantell, William Buckland, Mary Anning, and Richard Owen among others helped establish that there had been an 'age of reptiles' that had preceded even the prehistoric mammals. These discoveries captured the public imagination and <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> on the history of life on earth. Most of these geologists held to catastrophism, but Charles Lyell's influential Principles of Geology (1830) popularised Hutton's uniformitarianism, a theory that explained the geological past and present on equal terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> {{on the fact}} that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women. Lung cancer {{is the leading cause of}} cancer death amongst women, but while the number of women enrolled in lung cancer studies is increasing, they are still far less likely to be enrolled than men.|$|E

Electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback may be efficiency device for clinical training which external <b>focus</b> of <b>attention.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore whether external (EEG biofeedback) and internal <b>foci</b> of <b>attention</b> with unstable surface would affect postural sway in chronic stroke. Twenty-one hospitalized people with stroke were participated. Postural sway was measured at three conditions randomly while participants stood on the force platform with unstable surface. The conditions were control (quiet stand), internal <b>focus</b> of <b>attention</b> (<b>focus</b> on the own body), and external <b>focus</b> of <b>attention</b> (<b>focus</b> on the outside of body by EEG biofeedback). The external <b>focus</b> of <b>attention</b> resulted in less postural sway relative to both the internal focusof attention and control conditions. There was no significant difference between the external and internal <b>foci</b> of <b>attention</b> on anteroposterior sway velocity. In conclusions, the results are suggested that external <b>focus</b> of <b>attention</b> better to postural control than internal <b>focus</b> of <b>attention</b> or control condition during standing for individuals with stroke.
