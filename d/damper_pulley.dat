5000|$|The update program {{commenced}} in late 2002 {{with production}} launch {{slated to be}} fall of 2004. The engineering team chose the engine variant out of the GMT560 truck (the C4500) because it packaged better into the H1 engine bay; however, 23 engine component changes were required and the team {{had to do a}} 2.0 in body lift to accommodate the taller engine and its turbo housing (a prior 0.5 in lift had been done for MY96 to accommodate the turbo on the 6.5L engine). The 8th digit of the VIN number is 3, setting this version of the 6.6L Duramax apart from the versions used in pickup trucks. The GMT560 engine calibration was used with minimal modification; engine output was [...] and 520 lbft Nm of torque. The Duramax engine was equipped with cooled exhaust gas recirculation and an internal engine oil cooler, thus, requiring a 40 percent heat rejection increase to engine coolant. Because space was limited between the air-lift brackets that protrude from the hood, the fan system was modified by putting it directly under the coolpack and driving it through a special gearbox directly off the crankshaft <b>damper</b> <b>pulley.</b> Several other cooling system modifications were required to assist with cold starting from [...]|$|E
5000|$|The Brabus K8 {{performance}} kit for the SL model (SL55) includes {{modifications to}} the supercharger incorporating a custom vibration <b>damper</b> and <b>pulley,</b> high-performance metal catalysts, and an auxiliary circulation pump with opposing radiator. Power is increased from a standard [...] to [...] at 6,200 rpm. The maximum torque is 780 Nm at 3,000 rpm. The roadster is claimed reach 60 mi/h km/h in 4.1 seconds, passes 120 mi/h km/h after 13.6 seconds and reaches an electronically limited top speed of 186 mi/h km/h.|$|R

40|$|To perform {{simulations}} of partial or microgravity environments on earth requires some method of {{compensation for the}} earth's gravitational field. This paper discusses an active compensation system that modulates the tension in a counterweight support cable {{in order to minimize}} state deviation between the compensated body and the ideal weightless body. The system effectively compensates for inertial effects of the counterweight mass, viscous <b>damping</b> of all <b>pulleys,</b> and static friction {{in all parts of the}} gravity compensation system using a hybrid PI(proportional plus integral) /fuzzy control algorithm. The dynamic compensation of inertia and viscous damping is performed by PI control, while static friction compensation is performed by the fuzzy system. The system provides a very precise gravity compensation force, and is capable of non-constant gravity force compensation in the case that the payload mass is not constant. The only additional hardware requirements needed for the implementation of this system on a passive counterweight balance system are: a strain gauge tension sensor, and a torque motor with encoder...|$|R
