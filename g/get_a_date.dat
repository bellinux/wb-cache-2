Darryl had recently manipulated the warehouse foreman Val (Ameenah Kaplan) into breaking up with him {{because he wanted to}} have a new start when he moves to Philadelphia for his job at Jim's new sports marketing company. Darryl tells the others about this so that they will be careful what they say to Val. Nellie, Phyllis, and Kevin confront Val and try to convince her to take Darryl back, to no avail. However, when Kevin then tries to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> with Val, she is so mortified at her apparent dating prospects that she decides to get back together with Darryl, much to his annoyance.|$|E
25|$|Ellis had exaggerated {{fears of}} {{speaking}} {{in public and}} during his adolescence, he was extremely shy around women. At age 19, already showing signs of thinking like a cognitive-behavioral therapist, {{he forced himself to}} talk to 100 women in the Bronx Botanical Gardens over a period of a month. Even though he did not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>date,</b> he reported that he desensitized himself to his fear of rejection by women.|$|E

After school, Peter and Gwen are offered an internship at Dr. Connor's lab, where the former was given his superpowers; both accept. Peter goes to Harry's apartment, where Norman congratulates him on his newfound career. Toomes, going by the name [...] "the Vulture," [...] breaks in wearing a suit with built-in metallic wings and talons, with his anti-gravity technology incorporated to it and kidnaps Norman. Peter slips out to don the Spider-Man costume and pursues Vulture. He succeeds in rescuing Norman but loses to Vulture in a fight.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{variously}} {{described his}} writing as [...] "forthright," [...] "chatty", and [...] "charming". In a review in The Globe and Mail Brian Brett admires [...] "Suzuki's disarming candour" [...] and labels it [...] "a strange, fascinating book". While Brett's review is positive, {{he calls it}} [...] "clunkily written" [...] and sometimes repetitive. The Edmonton Journal review notes that Suzuki could [...] "charm the socks off the most hardened soul", but {{that many of his}} stories fall flat. The review in the Quill & Quire notes Suzuki [...] "has not written an indulgent autobiography" [...] and that he [...] "is too polite to dish on his enemies". Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Robert Wiersema states that while [...] "his life is an open book... ou get the sense of meeting the real Suzuki for the first time." [...] Wiersema calls him [...] "a natural storyteller". The New Zealand Listener review states, [...] "as a writer, he has the charm of a high-school geek desperately trying to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>date...</b> but ultimately it's what allows his story to convince". Several critics find Suzuki's writing on death to be particularly well-done.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Confidence and Paranoia" [...] (1988), Lister {{believes}} {{that the only reason}} that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>date,</b> and he could never <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a concussion. Lister, {{with the help of a}} solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by Craig Ferguson), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski's box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer.|$|E

2500|$|Mantooth's Gage and Tighe's DeSoto {{appeared}} in the tenth episode of Sierra, another Webb/Cinader production centered around a pair of National Park Service rangers, which appeared for only a partial season in 1974. In that episode, [...] "The Urban Ranger", the two paramedics participate in mountain rescue training and get involved {{in many of the}} episode's subplots. Following recurring themes from Emergency!, Gage continues to fail in his attempts to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>date,</b> while DeSoto briefly considers changing careers to become a park ranger.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the gags {{focus on}} Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and {{any form of}} exertion; his {{constant}} shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon {{as well as his}} obsession with mailing Nermal to Abu Dhabi, or simply throwing through the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of raisins and spinach), Garfield is particularly fond of lasagna; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish). He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> with [...] "Nancy", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting [...] "shot down by three generations"). When he does <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>date,</b> it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.|$|E
2500|$|Jon loves (or {{occasionally}} hates) Garfield and all cats. Many gags {{focus on}} this; {{his inability to}} <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> is usually attributed to his lack of social skills, his poor taste in clothes (Garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that [...] "two hundred moths committed suicide"; in another, the [...] "geek police" [...] ordered Jon to [...] "throw out his tie"), and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with [...] "polka ninjas". Other strips portray him as lacking intelligence (he is seen reading a pop-up book in one strip).|$|E

50|$|This {{easy access}} to {{information}} via computer constitutes {{a serious threat to}} individuals' reputations, job applications, housing and even <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>date.</b> It has been used for identify theft, election mischief, and needs to be controlled. In a state which prides itself on access to information it is unlikely that anything will be done about this until a Supreme Court Justice or Governor is the victim of this insidious system.|$|R
2500|$|Gags in {{the strips}} {{commonly}} deal with Garfield's obesity (in one strip, Jon jokes, [...] "I wouldn't say Garfield is fat, {{but the last}} time he got on a Ferris wheel, the two guys on top starved to death"), and his disdain of any form of exertion or work. He is known for saying [...] "breathing is exercise". In addition to being portrayed as lazy and fat, Garfield is also pessimistic, narcissistic, sadistic, cynical, sarcastic, sardonic, negative and smug. He enjoys destroying things, mauling the mailman, tormenting Odie, and kicking Odie off the table; he also makes snide comments, usually about Jon's inability to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> (in one strip, when Jon bemoans the fact that no one will go out with him on New Year's Eve, Garfield replies, [...] "Don't feel bad Jon. They wouldn't go out with you even if it weren't New Year's").|$|E
60|$|With another labourer, one Bernard, Mirabel dug, found {{a packet}} of dirty linen, and, fearing that it might hold the {{infection}} of plague, dipped it in wine, for lack of vinegar. The parcel contained {{more than a thousand}} Portuguese gold coins. Bernard and his mistress were present {{at the opening of the}} parcel, but Mirabel managed to conceal from them the place where he hid it, not a very likely story. He was grateful enough to pay for the desired masses, and he had himself bled four times to relieve his agitation. Mirabel now consulted a merchant in Marseilles, one Auguier, who advised him to keep his old coins a mystery, as to put them into circulation would lead to inquiry and inconvenience. He lent Mirabel some ready money, and, finally, induced Mirabel to entrust the Portuguese hoard to his care. The money was in two bags, one fastened with gold-coloured ribbon, the other with linen thread. Auguier gave a receipt, and now we <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>date,</b> Marseilles, September 27, 1726. Later Auguier (it seems) tried to murder Mirabel, and refused to return the deposit. Mirabel went to law with him: Auguier admitted that Mirabel had spoken to him about having found a treasure which he would entrust to Auguier, but denied the rest. In his house was found a ribbon of a golden hue, such as Mirabel used to tie up his bag, and a little basket which has no obvious connection with the matter. The case was allowed to come on, there were sixteen witnesses. A woman named Caillot swore to Mirabel's having told her about the ghost: she saw the treasure excavated, saw the bags, and recognised the ribbon. A man had seen Mirabel on his way to give Auguier his bags, and, indeed, saw him do so, and receive a piece of paper. He also found, next day, a gold coin on the scene of the interview. A third witness, a woman, was shown the treasure by Mirabel.|$|E
