500|$|Benfica {{started their}} {{season with the}} third {{qualifying}} round of the Champions League, attempting to make their first presence in the group stage since 1998–99. On 10 August, Benfica beat Anderlecht 1–0 after Zlatko Zahovič scored in the 13th minute. When asked why Anderlecht had more goal opportunities than Benfica, Trapattoni said, [...] "Do you know international football? It is very balanced nowadays. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> more chances but our opponent was stronger." [...] Following the win, Benfica were due to meet Porto in the Supercup on 20 August. Ricardo Quaresma of Porto scored the only goal {{of the game in}} an individual effort. It was Benfica's tenth consencutive loss in the competition; the previous win occurred in 1989. Four days later, Benfica travelled to Belgium to play Anderlecht. The home team scored first by Aruna Dindane, who scored another on the hour-mark. Nenad Jestrović scored the last goal. Trapattoni blamed fatigue and anxiety for the defeat, saying, [...] "I said we would try to score, but lacked composure to do so. In the first half {{he spent a lot of}} energy. On the second, we tried to fight back, until he conceded a second goal, which killed us." [...] The fans insulted the team on their arrival in Lisbon. On 29 August, Benfica made their debut in the Primeira Liga by visiting Beira-Mar. Two goals in the first half and another within five minutes of the second, gave Benfica a lead that help them beat the locals.|$|E
500|$|As the Republican presidential {{nomination}} race {{went into the}} primaries season, Romney had not endorsed anyone but {{was one of the}} Republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of New York businessman Donald Trump. Romney publicly criticized Trump for not releasing his taxes, saying there might be a [...] "bombshell" [...] in them. Trump responded by calling Romney [...] "one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics." [...] Then Romney gave a speech on March 3, 2016, at the Hinckley Institute of Politics, that represented a scathing attack on Trump's personal behavior, business performance, and domestic and foreign policy stances. He said Trump was [...] "a phony, a fraud ... He's playing members of the American public for suckers" [...] and that [...] "If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished." [...] In response Trump dismissed Romney as a [...] "choke artist". [...] Romney's speech represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party's most recent presidential nominee against the party's current front-runner for the nomination. Romney encouraged Republicans to engage in tactical voting, by supporting whichever of the remaining rivals had the best chance to beat Trump in any given state, and as such Romney announced he was voting for, although not endorsing, Ted Cruz for president prior to the March 22 Utah caucus. [...] As the race went on, there was some evidence of tactical voting occurring, and some partial arrangements were formed among candidates, but by May 3 Trump had defeated all his opponents and became the party's presumptive nominee. [...] Romney then announced that he would not support Trump in the general election, saying, [...] "I am dismayed at where we are now, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better choices".|$|E

Only <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not got King Stork, instead of King Log, like the fabliau [fable] that the Clerk of Saint Lambert's used to read us out of Meister Aesop's book." ...|$|R

2500|$|Catchers of the Peitz kind are scarce. [...] I {{know he is}} not a Beaumont on his feet, but he is a corking {{good man}} for a team because he always knows what to do and how to do it, and what better do you want? A catcher of the Peitz kind runs the whole game from behind the bat. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> him, and if the Reds let him go it would be a serious mistake.|$|E
2500|$|It {{became a}} ballroom-sized {{room with a}} double-height ceiling full of Renaissance-type frescoes, with Baccarat crystal chandeliers. The carved marble {{fireplace}} was taken from an old Louisiana plantation home. Hill chose parquet flooring and a gold and white color scheme for the entire room. The pianos were placed at one end, with French provincial sofas cushioned by an oriental carpet at the other end. Gold and white silk wall panels concealed shelves for records, music-related books, and Hill's musical instruments. Hill had 108 speakers installed in the room, connected with four miles of wiring. He spent more than $20,000 on the room's sound system. Hill also added a hidden movie screen on which to project his collection of comedy films, which was also hidden {{behind one of the}} silk wall panels. [...] The room became a bone of contention; Joan was angry about the amount of money her husband had poured into realizing his dream. During their 1968 separation, she had confided in Patti Gordon, a friend who owned a restaurant, that the music room had been central to their troubles. [...] "He doesn't care about me or our son or anybody else. Only that god damned music room. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> never started building it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day, juror number three—Jennifer Ford, a 32-year-old nursing student—told ABC News, [...] "I {{did not say}} she was innocent" [...] and [...] "I {{just said}} {{there was not enough}} evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot {{determine}} what the punishment should be." [...] She added, [...] "I'm not saying that I believe the defense," [...] but that [...] "it's easier for me logically to get from point A to point B" [...] via the defense argument, as opposed to the prosecution argument. Ford believed George Anthony was [...] "dishonest." [...] She said the jury [...] "was sick to [...] stomachs to get [...] verdict" [...] and that the decision process overwhelmed them {{to the point where they}} did not want to talk to reporters afterwards. Juror number two, a 46-year-old male who requested to stay unidentified, told the St. Petersburg Times that [...] "everybody agreed if we were going fully on feelings and emotions, [...] was done". He stated that a lack of evidence was the reason for the not-guilty verdict: [...] "I just swear to God... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> more evidence to put her away. I truly do... But it wasn't there." [...] He also said that Anthony was [...] "not a good person in my opinion". Juror number six, identified by WTSP as Brian Berling, told gossip website TMZ.com that he was willing to be interviewed [...] "so long as the opportunities are paid".|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's a pity, though,' {{said the}} Bishop, 'because Norris is a ripping good sort of chap, really. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> hadn't <b>had</b> that bust-up last term.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It seems {{sad that}} such an event as a {{marriage}} should give rise to so much ill-feeling. <b>I</b> almost <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not meddled, Robert.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I don't say that. If {{they love}} one another {{of course it is}} right that they should marry. <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> known him longer." ...|$|R
60|$|DEARTH. We won't go into that. I {{have nothing}} to do with your past, but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> some food to offer you.|$|E
6000|$|... "A--Apple-pie," [...] {{repeated}} the sailor; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> him here, Master Pongo. And now, what's this here?" [...] He turned the page.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very well,' he said. 'I {{really think}} it is a good idea. There are great {{opportunities}} open to a barrister. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> thought of it before.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> some talks; I'm full to the eye-lids. Had a noble {{good one}} with Parker and Dunham--land, {{but we were}} {{grateful}} for that visit! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{would have}} it so. Oh, papa, you don't know what I've undergone. <b>I</b> wish,--I <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not come here. It {{would have been better}} {{anywhere}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, not Colonel Mannering; {{but what}} do you think of your acquaintance, Mr. Charles Hazlewood? He talks of taking his lessons here; <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> may <b>have</b> {{accommodation}} for him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A {{pleasant}} sort of face, I think; but I was so startled I don't {{quite know}} what it was like. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a curtain there,' said Tilly.|$|E
6000|$|... "A stout fellow," [...] replied Anderson, [...] "if all be {{good that}} is upcome. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> twenty such, {{to put our}} Teagues {{into some sort of}} discipline." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} been a good sort of fellow," [...] the captain said; [...] "though <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> caught him for all that. Well, good-by, and a {{pleasant}} voyage home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray {{remember}} me to your brother. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> seen him; I hope {{he has not}} been hurt by the--the bull." [...] And then Lady Julia went her way.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{the same}} thing with me, colonel," [...] the major said. [...] "I have noticed him several times on the march and, {{while the rest of the}} {{regiment}} were plodding on in silence, he always seemed the centre of a merry group. I have often said, to myself, <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a few more men in the regiment who could take the hardships they had to undergo as lightly and as merrily as he does. His face has also struck me as being somehow familiar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor thing!" [...] said Lady Jane. [...] "I {{always thought}} it was too much for her. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> made her more comfortable: it would have been such a thing for her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it's bad for you, and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{never seen}} those people," [...] said Mrs. March. [...] "I don't believe he'll {{want to talk}} with you; but if--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] I reply. [...] "We are all by ourselves, you know. Nearly {{everyone}} in the village is at the theatre, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> got a dog." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the {{old days}} back again," [...] exclaimed Jem. [...] "I'd love to be a soldier--a great, triumphant general. I'd give EVERYTHING to see a big battle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] said Mary Louise musingly, [...] "that is why {{the poor}} woman is glad to rent this house. <b>I</b> <b>wish,</b> however, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> gotten it for a more {{pleasant}} reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "I don't deny it, Clarence. You're {{perfectly}} right; <b>I</b> almost <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> put it. How {{it would}} have made them hop! But they'd have known it was just the way they felt themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not much}} fancy acting the moment these great churchmen have arrived, and with {{cardinals}} and bishops I {{would rather not}} have dances the first-night. <b>I</b> almost <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> kept the Hungarian lady for this evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has just}} come in," [...] said Rollo, [...] "I verily believe. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been here a little sooner, so as to have seen her come through the drawbridges." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like it," [...] Chris said, [...] "but I {{see that}} it would be the best thing. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> our farmer's suits with us, then I should not fear at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, at that rate, {{they may}} indeed grow {{too strong for}} us," [...] {{answered}} Sir Gervaise, with more coolness of manner; [...] "nineteen to nine are rather heavy odds. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> Bluewater here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{world is}} so lovely tonight," [...] said the Story Girl. [...] "I just hate {{the thought of}} going into the church and {{shutting}} all the sunlight and music outside. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> the service outside in summer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} they mean to do with us, Luka?" [...] Godfrey asked. [...] "Will they hand us over to the Russians, {{do you think}}? Cowardly blackguards. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> now <b>we</b> <b>had</b> fought at first." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is dreadful {{to see her}} suffer so! [Shutting the window.] If [...] {{the roads}} were not so bad I should not mind. <b>I</b> almost <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> [...] stayed; though when he arrives the cannonade will be terrible.|$|R
