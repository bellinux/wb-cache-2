5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and <b>democracy</b> <b>are</b> rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E

25|$|Socialist thought {{has several}} {{different}} views on democracy. Social democracy, democratic socialism, and the dictatorship of the proletariat (usually exercised through Soviet <b>democracy)</b> <b>are</b> some examples.

25|$|Some modern democracies {{that are}} {{predominantly}} representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic. These democracies, which combine elements of representative democracy and direct <b>democracy,</b> <b>are</b> termed hybrid democracies, semi-direct democracies or participatory democracies. Examples include Switzerland and some U.S. states, where frequent use {{is made of}} referendums and initiatives.|$|E
50|$|Plato {{rejected}} Athenian democracy on {{the basis}} that such <b>democracies</b> <b>were</b> anarchic societies without internal unity, that they followed citizens' impulses rather than pursuing the common good, that <b>democracies</b> <b>are</b> unable to allow a sufficient number of their citizens to have their voices heard, and that such <b>democracies</b> <b>were</b> typically run by fools. Plato attacked Athenian democracies for mistaking anarchy for freedom. The lack of coherent unity in Athenian democracy made Plato conclude that such <b>democracies</b> <b>were</b> a mere collection of individuals occupying a common space rather than a form of political organization.|$|R
50|$|<b>Democracies</b> <b>are</b> {{characterized}} as secular or religious. The definition of <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> disputed and interpreted differently amongst politicians and scholars. It {{could be argued}} if only liberal <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> true <b>democracy,</b> if religion can <b>be</b> incorporated into <b>democracy,</b> or if religion is a necessity for democracy. The religiosity of political leaders can also {{have an effect on}} the practice of democracy.|$|R

25|$|Some {{people in}} Muslim-majority {{countries}} also see Islam manifested politically as Islamism. Political Islam is powerful in some Muslim-majority countries. Islamic parties in Turkey, Pakistan and Algeria have taken {{power at the}} provincial level.

25|$|The U.S.-based Polity data {{series is}} a widely used data series in {{political}} science research. It contains coded annual information on regime authority characteristics and transitions for all independent states with greater than 500,000 total population and covers the years 1800–2006. Polity's conclusions about a state's level of <b>democracy</b> <b>are</b> based on an evaluation of that state's elections for competitiveness, openness and level of participation.

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the ideals}} of <b>democracy</b> <b>are</b> far from {{realised}} on the mainland. For example, former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao once {{said in a speech}} that without real democracy, there is no guarantee of economic and political rights; but he led a 2011 crackdown against the peaceful Chinese jasmine protests. Liu Xiaobo, a pro-democracy activist who received the global 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, died in prison. Others, such as Qin Yongmin (秦永敏) of the Democracy Party of China, who was only released from prison after twelve years, do not praise the Xinhai Revolution. Qin Yongmin said the revolution only replaced one dictator with another, that Mao Zedong was not an emperor, but he is worse than the emperor.|$|E

While <b>democracies</b> <b>are</b> more likely to float than autocracies <b>are,</b> established <b>democracies</b> <b>are</b> more likely to choose a fixed exchange rate regime because they are better able than transition democracies to make the credible commitments needed for a cooperative arrangement.

25|$|American {{political}} scientist Peter Roman’s {{work on the}} subject led him to believe that Cuba’s “grassroots democracy” goes beyond the power to vote freely for one of several candidates representing both pro or anti-socialist positions. He argues that at the “people level” democracy exists in Cuba today and that this democracy has been strengthened during the 1990s by conscious decisions made at the top. Roman also writes that the historical origins of contemporary Cuban <b>democracy</b> <b>are</b> {{the ideas of the}} centrality of unity and consensus, and the rejection of a distinction between political and civil society. Thus, unanimous votes in representative bodies do not represent, as critics charge, imposition by the PCC, but rather legitimate consensus worked out in lengthy discussion at several levels. British political professor Steve Ludlum wrote in his paper “Participation is key to Cuba’s democracy” that “Two models of democracy competed for support in nineteenth century Europe. The one we know is based on indirect representation by professional politicians controlled by party factions. The other model, associated with Rousseau’s concept of the ‘general will’ and made famous by the Paris Commune of 1870”. Ludlum likens Cuba’s local participation to the latter model.|$|E

Gambira stated {{in an interview that}} his imprisonment had left him with depression, frequent headaches, and failing memory; however, he said he had difficulty finding a doctor willing to treat him, for fear that it would draw government reprisals. He attempted to leave the country for treatment, but could not get the necessary paperwork.
