40|$|Extract] The {{notion of}} what {{constitutes}} <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> in the present knowledge economy is debated. Some view <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> as the set of skills needed to successfully engage with digital technologies. Others would argue they are the skills required to code software and the computational thinking skills of programming, designing, collecting, and analyzing data and the system-based literacy practices needed to communicate with simulations and games. New voices argue <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> encapsulate the proficiency to use digital technologies, {{as well as the}} soft skills needed to engage in co-creative endeavors, with humans and machines in creative, wise, and ethical ways. Regardless, Bill Green's " 3 D" (dimensional) model of literacy remains a salient point of reference to think about and understand the operational, cultural, and critical dimensions of <b>digital</b> <b>literacies.</b> The aim of this entry is to present an overview of the complexity of <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> in a future characterized by rapid and uncertain socio-technical change. It also explores how <b>digital</b> <b>literacies,</b> when viewed as anticipatory, can be leveraged to ensure children, young people, and adults engage in co-creative endeavors with each other and machine to maximize their potential for lifelong learning in ethically sound ways...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of English, Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} {{develops the}} concept of community-based <b>digital</b> <b>literacies,</b> a term that refers to the rhetorical, civic, and technological knowledge and literacy practices communities sponsor and employ for civic action. This concept builds off of, yet departs from, other literacy scholars’ work in that it pays {{special attention to the}} relationship between online communities and the <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> they sponsor and employ for civic action. As this project illustrates, literacy studies, feminist theory, and medical rhetorics lack scholarship that examines how and why communities sponsor and employ <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> and how this process can empower groups and individuals. Community-based <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> addresses this gap and offers a new lens for analyzing this complex relationship. Highlighting these connections helps illustrate how and why communities sponsor <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> that can change social and technological systems, thereby empowering individuals and their communities. To demonstrate this process, I argue that the online natural birthing community, Birth Without Fear, sponsors and employs community-based <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> to engage in cyberfeminist activism that empowers women within technical and medical systems and to rewrite rhetorics regarding women’s experiences with pregnancy and childbirth. I draw on literacy, feminist, and medical rhetorical theories and methodologies to investigate the diverse ways in which Birth Without Fear sponsors and employs community-based <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> for cyberfeminist activism. Ultimately, this dissertation argues that Birth Without Fear’s sponsorship of community-based <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> helps women engage in cyberfeminist activism that increases women’s health literacy and helps them create rhetorical agency within healthcare systems. Understanding this process is important as medical systems physically and discursively construct and mediate women’s bodies. It is therefore essential that women have access to and sponsor literacy practices that allow them to critically analyze, resist, and reform medical and cultural infrastructures that shape women’s experiences with pregnancy and childbirth.

Papert compared the old practice of putting computers in a computer lab to books chained to the walls in old libraries. Negroponte likened shared computers to shared pencils.

30|$|A {{majority}} of students indicated that they are using social media in their own learning, and developing students’ knowledge and skills with regard to wider <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> could foster their abilities for integrating beneficial aspects of social media that can help their learning, while also mitigating the drawbacks that can hinder learning (Smith, 2016 a; 2016 b). Recent ECAR findings show that students today do not feel better prepared to use technologies than in prior years. Rather, undergraduates reported that they could use technologies such as social media more effectively for learning if they were more skilled at their application and use (Dahlstrom et al., 2015). Reinforcing these results, {{students in this study}} also expressed their need to further understand why and how certain SMTs can be used for learning in meaningful ways. Several models for building <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> are evolving (e.g., Littlejohn, Beetham, & McGill, 2012; O’Neil, 2014), providing post-secondary institutions with frameworks to teach students the <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> needed for navigating social media in ways that can facilitate their learning even if SMTs are separate from the formal curriculum. Engaging with <b>digital</b> <b>literacies,</b> future research connected to practice can develop our understandings of meaningful use of SMTS and inform strategies to effectively teach undergraduates such cognitive and technical skills across the curriculum.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} five years young children’s access to and usage of the {{internet}} has burgeoned, mostly due to the availability of internet-enabled, touch-screen and mobile technologies. While this creates exciting learning opportunities for young children, internet activity in this age-bracket raises several issues of practical, research and pedagogical concern. Two of the most pertinent concerns outlined in the literature -conceptions of cyber-safety and <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> -are focused on in this chapter. We suggest that an understanding of young children’s thinking about the internet – their “internet cognition” – is a necessary precursor to learning about internet safety and <b>digital</b> <b>literacies.</b> Without such knowledge it is problematic to expect teachers to know how and what to teach in relation to both cyber-safety and <b>digital</b> <b>literacies.</b> The chapter concludes by proposing a research and pedagogical agenda for early childhood education in an effort to establish a knowledge base for the field regarding young children’s “internet cognition”...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are (i) to propose a {{relational}} concept of <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> {{as an alternative to}} the ones found in the current literature, (ii) to justify the need for such a conception on the grounds of a socio-historic analysis of the relations among literacy, technology and inclusion, and (iii) to illustrate the usefulness of such a conception for research on digital inclusion within the field of applied language studies. The theoretical foundations comprise studies in <b>digital</b> <b>literacies</b> and <b>digital</b> inclusion, sociocultural theories of literacy, and multicultural theories of social inclusion, all of which are brought to relate to the dialogic conception of language.
