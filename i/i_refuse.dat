500|$|Stephen Sondheim {{noted the}} duo's {{ability to take}} the {{innovations}} of Oklahoma! and apply them to a serious setting: [...] "Oklahoma! is about a picnic, Carousel is about life and death." [...] Critic Eric Bentley, on the other hand, wrote that [...] "the last scene of Carousel is an impertinence: [...] <b>I</b> <b>refuse</b> to be lectured to by a musical comedy scriptwriter on the education of children, {{the nature of the}} good life, and the contribution of the American small town to the salvation of souls." ...|$|E
500|$|Christopher Hitchens {{wrote that}} it is {{important}} to affirm [...] "the right to criticize not merely Islam but religion in general". He criticised media outlets which did not print the cartoons while covering the story. Ralf Dahrendorf wrote that the violent reaction to the cartoons constituted a sort of counter-enlightenment which must be defended against. Sonia Mikich wrote in Die Tageszeitung, [...] "I hereby refuse to feel badly for the chronically insulted. <b>I</b> <b>refuse</b> to argue politely why freedom of expression, reason and humour should be respected". She said that those things are part of a healthy society and that deeply held feelings or beliefs should not be exempt from commentary, and that those offended had the option of ignoring them.|$|E
500|$|Norton and Leterrier disputed {{with the}} {{producers}} {{over the final}} running time: they {{wanted it to be}} near 135 minutes, while the producers wanted the film to be under two hours. This was made public, and rumors spread that Norton [...] "made it clear he won't cooperate with publicity plans if he's not happy with the final product". Norton dismissed this, [...] "Our healthy process , which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted {{to such a degree that}} it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and <b>I</b> <b>refuse</b> to let happen. It has always been my firm conviction that films should speak for themselves and that knowing too much about how they are made diminishes the magic of watching them." ...|$|E

500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph was {{generally}} negative about the film, stating, [...] "The Human Centipede has its moments, but they're largely obscured by umpteen {{holes in the}} plot {{as well as by}} reams of exposition" [...] and that it was [...] "an ultimately underwhelming affair that's neither sick or repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves." [...] The New York Times review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that whether the film was [...] "a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint." [...] Writing in the Chicago Sun Times, Roger Ebert did not assign the film a star rating (not to be confused with awarding it zero stars), stating, [...] "I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, <b>I</b> <b>refuse</b> to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing his beliefs, in 2009 Ebert {{wrote that}} he did not [...] "want to provide a {{category}} for people to apply to [...] " [...] because he [...] "would not want [...] convictions reduced to a word", and stated, [...] "I have never said, although readers have freely informed me I am an atheist, an agnostic, {{or at the very least}} a secular humanist– which I am". In the same blog entry, he also said [...] "I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still awake at night, asking how? I am more content with the question than I would be with an answer." [...] In March 2013, he wrote: [...] "I support freedom of choice. My choice is to not support abortion, except in cases of a clear-cut choice between the lives of the mother and child. A child conceived through incest or rape is innocent and deserves the right to be born." [...] He also stated: [...] "I consider myself Catholic, lock, stock and barrel, with this technical loophole: I cannot believe in God. <b>I</b> <b>refuse</b> to call myself an atheist however, because that indicates too great a certainty about the unknowable." ...|$|E
500|$|Pelé {{is one of}} {{the most}} lauded players in history and is {{frequently}} ranked the best player ever. Among his contemporaries, Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated; [...] "Pelé was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries of logic." [...] Brazil's 1970 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined; [...] "His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did were in one moment. He had an extraordinary perception of the game." [...] Tostão, his strike partner at the 1970 World Cup; [...] "Pelé was the greatest – he was simply flawless. And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat. You never see him bad-tempered. He loves being Pelé." [...] His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed; [...] "In some countries they wanted to touch him, in some they wanted to kiss him. In others they even kissed the ground he walked on. I thought it was beautiful, just beautiful." [...] Former Real Madrid and Hungary star Ferenc Puskás stated; [...] "The greatest player in history was Di Stefano. <b>I</b> <b>refuse</b> to classify Pelé as a player. He was above that." ...|$|E

500|$|Cranmer {{was told}} that {{he would be able to}} make a final recantation but this time in public during a service at the University Church. He wrote and {{submitted}} the speech in advance and it was published after his death. At the pulpit on the day of his execution, he opened with a prayer and an exhortation to obey the king and queen, but he ended his sermon totally unexpectedly, deviating from the prepared script. He renounced the recantations that he had written or signed with his own hand since his degradation and as such he stated his hand would be punished by being burnt first. He then said, [...] "And as for the pope, <b>I</b> <b>refuse</b> him, as Christ's enemy, and Antichrist with all his false doctrine." [...] He was pulled from the pulpit and taken to where Latimer and Ridley had been burnt six months before. As the flames drew around him, he fulfilled his promise by placing his right hand into the heart of the fire while saying [...] "that unworthy hand" [...] and his dying words were, [...] "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit...I see the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{repeated}} racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. This attitude contributed to his legendarily bad rapport with fans and journalists. He alienated Celtics fans by saying, [...] "You owe the public the same it owes you, nothing! <b>I</b> <b>refuse</b> to smile and be nice to the kiddies." [...] This supported the opinion of many white fans that Russell (who was by then the highest-paid Celtic) was egotistical, paranoid and hypocritical. The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals broke into his house, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies and defecated in the beds. In response, Russell described Boston as a [...] "flea market of racism". In King Of The Court by Aram Goudsouzian, he was quoted saying, [...] "From my very first year I {{thought of myself as}} playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted." [...] Referring to a time when the Celtics could not sell out the Boston Garden despite hockey’s popularity in the same stadium, Russell recalled “We [...] did a survey about what we could do to improve attendance. Over 50 percent of responses said 'There’s too many black players.'” In retirement, Russell described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist.|$|E
500|$|Unfortunately, {{shortly before}} dawn on May 12, Union forces {{comprising}} three full divisions (Major General Winfield S. Hancock's II Corps) attacked the Mule Shoe through heavy fog, taking the Confederate forces by surprise. Exhaustion, inadequate food, lack of artillery support, and wet powder from the night's rain {{contributed to the}} collapse of the Confederate position as the Union forces swarmed out of the mist, overwhelming Steuart's men and effectively putting an end to the Virginia Brigade. Confederate muskets would not fire due to damp powder, and apart from two remaining artillery pieces, the Southerners were effectively without firearms. During the thick of the fierce hand-to-hand fighting that followed, Steuart was forced to surrender to Colonel James A. Beaver of the 148th Pennsylvania Infantry. Beaver asked Steuart [...] "Where is your sword, sir?", to which the general replied, with considerable sarcasm, [...] "Well, suh, you all waked us up so early this mawnin' that I didn't have time to get it on." [...] Steuart was brought to General Hancock, who had seen Steuart's wife Maria in Washington before the battle and wished to give her news of her husband. He extended his hand, asking [...] "how are you, Steuart?" [...] But Steuart refused to shake Hancock's hand; although the two men had been friends before the war, they were now enemies. Steuart said: [...] "Considering the circumstance, General, <b>I</b> <b>refuse</b> to take your hand", to which Hancock is said to have replied, [...] "And under any other circumstance, General, I would have refused to offer it." [...] After this episode, an offended Hancock then left Steuart to march to the Union rear with the other prisoners.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1880 and 1887, Heaviside {{developed}} the operational calculus using p for the differential operator, (which Boole had previously denoted by D), giving {{a method of}} solving differential equations by direct solution as algebraic equations. This later caused {{a great deal of}} controversy, owing to its lack of rigour. He famously said, [...] "Mathematics is an experimental science, and definitions do not come first, but later on." [...] On another occasion he asked somewhat more defensively, [...] "Shall <b>I</b> <b>refuse</b> my dinner because I do not fully understand the process of digestion?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Camus {{states in}} The Myth of Sisyphus: [...] "Thus I {{draw from the}} absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere {{activity}} of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death, and <b>I</b> <b>refuse</b> suicide." [...] "Revolt" [...] here refers to the refusal of suicide and search for meaning despite the revelation of the Absurd; [...] "Freedom" [...] refers {{to the lack of}} imprisonment by religious devotion or others' moral codes; [...] "Passion" [...] refers to the most wholehearted experiencing of life, since hope has been rejected, and so he concludes that every moment must be lived fully.|$|E
