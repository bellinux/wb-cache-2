5|$|Although Wakaw had a {{population}} of only 400, it sat {{at the heart of}} a densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E
5|$|An Italian volcanological mission {{analyzed}} gas {{samples from}} fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be {{a mixture of}} carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. Publishing a report for officials on October 22, 1985, the scientists determined that the risk of lahars was unusually high. To prepare for the eruption, the report gave several simple preparedness techniques to local authorities. Another team gave the local officials seismographs, but no instructions on how to operate them.|$|E
5|$|Stan and Kyle meet Wendy at Stark's Pond, {{where she}} {{suggests}} using the machine lodged inside Cartman {{to contact the}} visitors. To lure them back, the children tie Cartman to a tree and, {{the next time he}} farts, a massive satellite dish emerges from his anus. The alien spaceship arrives and Ike jumps to safety. In the meantime, the visitors communicate with the cows in the area, having <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be the most intelligent species on the planet. Cartman is again abducted by the aliens and returns to the bus stop the following day with pinkeye.|$|E

Along with highlighting the struggles of blue-collar America, the lyrics portray {{the idea that there is}} hope even when things appear to be bleak and that giving up is not an option. While there are Christian themes throughout the songs, neither Christian nor secular reviewers <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be preachy.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped {{the sea and}} its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays. Historically, mantas were {{feared for}} their size and power. Sailors {{believed}} that they ate fish and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors. This attitude changed around 1978 when divers around the Gulf of California <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be placid {{and that they could}} interact with the animals. Several divers photographed themselves with mantas, including Jaws author Peter Benchley.|$|E
5|$|Two other partial skeletons, with skull material, {{were named}} Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis by Fernando Novas in 1986, but this species too is now {{thought to be}} a synonym. Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis was {{discovered}} in 1975, and was described by Novas (1986) who considered it a primitive saurischian, and possibly a theropod. Novas (1992) and Sereno and Novas (1992) examined the Frenguellisaurus remains and found them referable to Herrerasaurus. Ischisaurus cattoi was discovered in 1960 and described by Reig in 1963. Novas (1992) and Sereno and Novas (1992) reviewed its remains and <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be referable to Herrerasaurus.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, a {{few people}} have {{questioned}} this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only {{that there had been}} a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be convincing. Research into shipping schedules has shown that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.|$|E
5|$|Sora was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura as the protagonist of Kingdom Hearts. However, he was not originally slated to be the protagonist as Disney wanted Donald Duck to fill the role, while Square wanted Mickey Mouse. Nomura designed Sora with the concepts of the Disney characters in mind, basing his outfit on Mickey Mouse's trademark white gloves, red shorts and giant yellow shoes. Sora originally wielded a weapon resembling a chainsaw; however, the weapon was not well received by Disney which led Nomura to redesign the weapon into a Keyblade. He was also designed with lion-like features, which were removed as the staff <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{be similar to the}} one of the Final Fantasy IX protagonist Zidane Tribal. After a talk with the Disney staff, the design was further reworked, and Nomura finished it after a night's work.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris is traded {{mainly for}} its purported {{medicinal}} properties, for the pet trade, or, {{to a lesser}} extent, as food for local consumption. According to a 2003 report, the animals were sold for 30,000–50,000 Vietnamese đồng (US$1.50–2.50 or €1.10–1.80). Other reports have <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> cost US$2–10. In Cambodia, the species is used in Traditional Khmer Medicine. Surveys conducted at Cambodian markets showed that the species was the third most common mammal for sale, offered at prices ranging from US$0.85–6.25 (€0.65–4.70). In Vietnam, the pygmy slow loris is used for food, medicine, and often as a pet and {{is among the most}} frequently sold species. Formerly, hundreds of pygmy lorises were traded monthly in major markets, but recently numbers seem to have decreased, due to shortages in supply. In southern Vietnam, lorises are among the most popular wildlife dishes in wildlife meat restaurants.|$|E

5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, but <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be illegible. He went on {{to create}} his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle {{in relation to the}} paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E
5|$|In August 1941, Panzergruppe Afrika was raised, and {{the newly}} {{promoted}} General der Panzertruppe Rommel was placed in command. The Afrikakorps was handed over to Generalleutnant Ludwig Crüwell. Soon after, Mickl followed the battalions of his regiment to North Africa, arriving there in early September 1941. He <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be under-equipped, having been furnished {{with only a few}} vehicles and only two 37mm anti-tank guns per battalion. He considered that this would be sufficient for an attack on defensive positions, but completely inadequate for mobile operations. On 6 September, his regiment joined the Siege of Tobruk taking up positions at Ras el Mdauuar until the end of October, when it became part of the composite Afrika (Special Purpose) Division and prepared for an attack on the fortress. When a strong British reconnaissance force was reported far to the south, moving west from the Egyptian border at Sidi Omar, Mickl was placed in command of a kampfgruppe which was sent to meet the British. The force consisted of Mickl's regiment, along with the 361st Afrika Regiment and the 605th Panzerjäger Battalion. The Afrika Regiment had only just arrived in theatre, and had no heavy weapons, insufficient ammunition and almost no vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, World War I broke out in Europe, though the Ottomans {{initially}} remained neutral. On 3 August 1914, Barbaros Hayreddin began a refit at Constantinople—German engineers inspected her and other Ottoman warships in the dockyard and <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be {{in a state of}} severe disrepair. Owing to the state of tension, repairs could not be effected, and only ammunition, coal, and other supplies were loaded. By early November, the actions of the German battlecruiser Goeben, which had been transferred to the Ottoman Navy, resulted in declarations of war by Russia, France, and Great Britain. Between 1914–15, some of the ship's guns were removed and employed as coastal guns to shore up the defenses protecting the Dardanelles. In the meantime, she was used as a floating artillery battery at the Nara naval base, along with her sister Turgut Reis. Early during this stint, the ships were immobilized, but as the threat from British submarines grew, steam was kept up in their boilers to allow them to move quickly.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} made {{by many of the}} same filmmakers {{involved}} in The Matrix series. In 1988, producer Joel Silver acquired the rights to two of Alan Moore's works: V for Vendetta and Watchmen. After the release and relative success of Road House, writer Hilary Henkin was brought on to flesh out the project with an initial draft – one that bears little, if any, relation to the finished product, with the inclusion of overtly satirical and surrealistic elements not present in the graphic novel, as well as the removal of much of the novel's ambiguity, especially in regard to V's identity. The Wachowskis were fans of V for Vendetta and in the mid-1990s, before working on The Matrix, wrote a draft screenplay that closely followed the graphic novel. During the post-production of the second and third The Matrix films, they revisited the screenplay and offered the director's role to James McTeigue. All three were intrigued by the original story's themes and <b>found</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be relevant to the current political landscape. Upon revisiting the screenplay, the Wachowskis set about making revisions to condense and modernise the story, {{while at the same time}} attempting to preserve its integrity and themes. James McTeigue cites the film The Battle of Algiers as his principal influence in preparing to film V for Vendetta.|$|E
