60|$|Slash! {{the whip}} <b>fell</b> among the <b>dogs</b> savagely, {{especially}} upon {{the one which}} had fallen.|$|R
60|$|A few words, {{the dull}} tread of swift horses, the rising of a silent train of dust, {{and then the}} wind wandered in the growing corn. The dust <b>fell,</b> a <b>dog</b> barked {{down the road and}} the {{katydids}} sang to the liquid contralto of the river in its shallows.|$|R
60|$|Mason was whipped off his feet; {{one of the}} <b>dogs</b> <b>fell</b> in the traces; and {{the sled}} toppled back, {{dragging}} everything to the bottom again.|$|R
60|$|A {{rattling}} volley followed, and at {{the same}} moment one of the <b>dogs</b> <b>fell</b> with a death-yell on the ice and dyed it with its blood.|$|R
60|$|All {{these things}} Wetherford did, {{and leaving the}} camp in ashes behind him, Cavanagh drove the sheep before him on his homeward way. As night <b>fell,</b> the <b>dog,</b> at his command, rounded them up and put them to bed, and the men went on down the valley, leaving the brave brute on guard, pathetic figure of {{faithful}} guardianship.|$|R
50|$|A {{man walking}} his <b>dog</b> <b>fell</b> into a pit while {{running in the}} Ramot Forest. This led to the {{discovery}} of a grape-pressing area from the First Temple period.|$|R
6000|$|When I heard this, I made {{a sudden}} bound back, and gave such a cry as any man might {{who was in}} such a way. The ferocious Jowler, {{thinking}} I was going to escape, flew at my throat; screaming furious, I flung out my arms in a kind of desperation,--and, to my wonder, down <b>fell</b> the <b>dog,</b> dead, and run through the body! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was thy shield that <b>fell,</b> thou awkward <b>dog.</b> Wilt thou {{make me a}} reproach in {{the eyes}} of these strangers from the Stars? What hast thou to say for thyself?" ...|$|R
50|$|White <b>Dog</b> <b>Fell</b> {{from the}} Sky is a 2012 fiction novel by Eleanor Morse. The book was {{published}} on January 3, 2013 through Viking Adult and is set in 1970s apartheid South Africa.|$|R
6000|$|Peter Drudgeit sympathized, for Peter had a son, who, {{reason or}} none, would needs {{exchange}} the torn and inky fustian sleeves {{for the blue}} jacket and white lapelle; and he suggested, as the reader knows, the engaging our friend Alan {{in the matter of}} Poor Peter Peebles, just opened by the desertion of young Dumtoustie, whose defection would be at the same time concealed; and this, Drudgeit said, 'would be <b>felling</b> two <b>dogs</b> with one stone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{his gaze}} <b>fell</b> on the <b>dog,</b> {{and the old}} light blazed back in his eyes. He touched the missionary lightly on the arm. [...] "Mon pere, dat is one beeg devil, dat Batard. You will bring me one pistol, so, dat Ah drink de sun in peace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Help me now, so that I {{may not be}} hanged!' {{cried the}} Soldier. And thereupon the <b>dogs</b> <b>fell</b> upon the judges and the whole council, seized some by the legs, others by the nose, and threw them so {{high into the air}} that they fell and were smashed into pieces.|$|R
60|$|The dog, with {{a ferocious}} bark, made one other {{struggle}} as Blandois vanished; then, {{in the moment}} of the dog's submission, the master, little less angry than the <b>dog,</b> <b>felled</b> him with a blow on the head, and standing over him, struck him many times severely with the heel of his boot, so that his mouth was presently bloody.|$|R
60|$|First {{she looked}} all round {{to see that}} no one was {{watching}} her, and then she set to work to peck at a piece of meat that lay {{on the edge of a}} shelf, till at last it <b>fell</b> down. The <b>dog</b> seized it ravenously, and ran with it to a dark corner where he gobbled it up in a very few minutes.|$|R
50|$|The cave {{was formed}} in the Triassic period and is about 710 m long. It was {{discovered}} in 1913. According to local legend, a <b>dog</b> <b>fell</b> into a 15-metre deep shaft, which was the cave's only natural opening. People found the cave when they rescued the dog. Cavers began to explore the cave in 1927. Another entrance was made for the tourists, and in 1931 the cave was opened to the public.|$|R
50|$|In January 2008, Wise {{and his dog}} {{were running}} along a frozen canal in Georgetown when his <b>dog</b> <b>fell</b> through the ice. Wise also fell through the ice trying to save his dog, and would have died if a {{stranger}} had not pulled him out. Wise later found the person, a George Washington University Law School student named Jason Coates, and wrote a story about their experiences in The Washington Post Magazine.|$|R
60|$|Again Hal's whip <b>fell</b> {{upon the}} <b>dogs.</b> They threw {{themselves}} against the breast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it, and put forth all their strength. The sled held {{as though it were}} an anchor. After two efforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was whistling savagely, when once more Mercedes interfered. She dropped on her knees before Buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around his neck.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for White <b>Dog</b> <b>Fell</b> from the Sky has been mostly positive, with Oprah.com listing {{it as one}} of their 16 Must-Read Books for January 2013. Common praise for the novel included the depictions of Botswana and for Morse's writing, while Kirkus Reviews criticized the book saying that the [...] "idealization of Isaac and all the black Africans as noble victims does them a disservice by making them two-dimensional in contrast to the three-dimensional whites".|$|R
60|$|Ah, reader, {{it would}} have touched your heart to have seen those eyes! They were so deep set, as if in dark caverns, and so unnaturally large. They gazed round in a vacant way for a few moments, until they <b>fell</b> on the <b>dog.</b> Then a gleam of fire shot through them, and their owner raised his large, gaunt, wasted frame on one elbow, while he gazed {{with a look of}} eagerness, which was {{perfectly}} awful, at his dumb companion.|$|R
60|$|Rob seldom commanded, {{but when}} he did Master Ted had to give in. His temper was up, and Rob's masterful tone made it {{impossible}} to resist one cut at the rebellious dog before he submitted. Only a single blow, but it was a costly one; for as it <b>fell,</b> the <b>dog</b> sprang at Ted with a snarl, and Rob, rushing between the two, felt the sharp teeth pierce his leg. A word made Don let go and drop remorsefully at Rob's feet, for he loved him and was evidently sorry to have hurt his friend by mistake. With a forgiving pat Rob left him, to limp to the barn followed by Ted, whose wrath was changed to shame and sorrow when he saw the red drops on Rob's sock and the little wounds in his leg.|$|R
60|$|There {{are some}} stories of wolves and bears in Ashtabula County which {{are by no}} means bad. Not the worst of these is told of Elijah Thompson, who was hunting in the woods near Geneva, when a pack of seven wolves <b>fell</b> upon his <b>dog.</b> He clubbed his rifle and beat them off; then when the last had slunk away, he {{gathered}} up his wounded dog under his arm, and walked away with the barrel, which was all that was left of his rifle, on his shoulder.|$|R
50|$|The {{dogs were}} {{considered}} valuable in Babylon, and are mentioned in cuneiform in the 4th century BC. A large Mastiff-like dog is {{shown on the}} ancient terra cotta by Birs Nimrud. The dog is 90 cm tall at the withers, has a stocky head and powerful hind quarters. The dogs were used for hunting in ancient Assyria. Archeological digs of the Ashurbanipal palace (7th century BC) revealed pictures of <b>dogs</b> <b>felling</b> wild horses and donkeys. Assyrian Mastiffs were also used for military purposes and for protection.|$|R
60|$|It {{jumped back}} and bayed, whereon I jumped {{out the other}} side. Tom made a rush at me and knocked the fat woman off the thing she was {{standing}} on, so that she <b>fell</b> among the <b>dogs,</b> which covered her {{up and began to}} sniff her all over. Flying from Tom I found myself in front of something filmy, beyond which I saw grass. It looked suspicious, but as nothing in the world could be so bad as Tom, no, not even his dogs, I jumped at it.|$|R
5000|$|Visitors may {{explore the}} caverns in a 45 minute guided tour. The caverns were found {{by a couple}} farm boys back in 1920 after their <b>dog</b> <b>fell</b> through a hole {{that led to the}} caves. They decided to name the caverns after their dog in honor of his discovery. Guided tours of the caverns were begun in 1923. The best known {{attraction}} is a bell-shaped flowstone formation known as the [...] "Wedding Bell". Weddings have been held under the Bell. The cave is located in a hill overlooking the surrounding region.|$|R
60|$|Now it so {{happened}} that, at {{this very}} time, the howl of the <b>dogs</b> <b>fell</b> upon the ears of two separate parties of travellers--the one was a band of Esquimaux who were moving about in search of seals and walrus, to which band this woman and her baby belonged; {{the other was a}} party of men under command of Buzzby, who were returning to the ship after an unsuccessful hunt. Neither party saw the other, for one approached from the east, the other from the west, and the ice-belt, on the point of which the woman stood, rose up between them.|$|R
60|$|The stoker {{held up the}} shovel. The body of Floppart was put thereon, {{after the}} removal of its collar. There was one good swing of the shovel, {{followed}} by a heave, and the little <b>dog</b> <b>fell</b> {{into the heart of}} the fiery furnace. The stoker shut the great iron door with a clang, and looked at the policeman solemnly. The policeman returned the look, thanked him, and retired. In less probably than three minutes Floppart's body was reduced to its gaseous elements, vomited forth from the furnace chimney, and finally dissipated by the winds of heaven.|$|R
50|$|The Mad <b>Dogs</b> <b>fell</b> to 39-45 in 1998 {{and they}} were next to last in attendance, drawing only 47,123 fans. In 1999, the Northeast League merged into the Northern League to form the Northern League East Division. The club was 41-45 in a tight division. They {{finished}} one game {{out in the first}} half; they tied for last place in the second half but were just 4 games back. Attendance fell to last in the Northern League's Eastern Division with 38,528. Following the 1999 season, the team suspended operations citing major issues with the team's home in Lynn, Fraser Field.|$|R
50|$|James 'Jamie' MacDonald is {{only ever}} seen in flashbacks and {{pictures}} in the series, and in the flashbacks he is played by an unknown actor. Jamie, eldest son of Hector MacDonald and Molly MacDonald, drowned as a teenager. Jamie and his brother Archie were playing with their dog on a boat in the loch when Archie started to rock the boat, the <b>dog</b> <b>fell</b> in and Jamie went in after it. The dog survived, but underwater Jamie got caught in reeds and eventually drowned. The police looked in the loch for six hours for him, and eventually found the dead teenager.|$|R
40|$|The urine-concentrating {{mechanism}} was {{studied in}} chronic hypokalemia (seven dogs given a low K+, high NaCl diet plus injections of deoxycorticosterone acetate [DOCA]) and chronic hypercalcemia (seven dogs given vitamin D). In the potassium-depleted dogs, muscle, serum, and urine K+ fell markedly, but glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and body weight varied little. Maximum urine osmolality <b>fell</b> in all <b>dogs</b> (mean decrease = 45 %); however, solute-free water reabsorption (TCH 2 O) at {{high rates of}} solute excretion remained normal in three of four dogs. Free water excretion (CH 2 O) increased normally or supranormally {{as a function of}} increasing Na+ delivery to Henle's loop in six dogs so tested...|$|R
50|$|White <b>Dog</b> <b>Fell</b> {{from the}} Sky {{is set in}} Botswana in the late 1970s and follows three {{characters}} as their lives interact with one another. Isaac Muthethe is from South Africa, still under apartheid. He had a promising future as a medical student until {{he was forced to}} flee to Botswana after watching the South African Defence Force kill someone. Once in Botswana, Isaac works as a gardener for Alice Mendelssohn, an American postgrad student who has left her studies behind in order to accompany her husband. The two strike up a friendship of sorts and when Isaac goes missing, Alice decides that she must find him.|$|R
60|$|Down {{the street}} went Calliope, {{shooting}} right and left. Glass <b>fell</b> like hail; <b>dogs</b> vamosed; chickens flew, squawking; feminine voices shrieked concernedly to youngsters at large. The din was perforated at intervals by the /staccato/ of the Terror's guns, and was drowned periodically by the brazen screech that Quicksand knew so well. The occasions of Calliope's low spirits were legal holidays in Quicksand. All {{along the main}} street in advance of his coming clerks were putting up shutters and closing doors. Business would languish for a space. The right of way was Calliope's, and as he advanced, observing the dearth of opposition and the few opportunities for distraction, his ennui perceptibly increased.|$|R
5000|$|A soldier who'd {{found it}} tough {{adjusting}} to mandatory military service, {{until he was}} assigned to train an army dog. They become the best of friends, with the dog defending him from bullies and Hyung-chul teaching the dog to dance to [...] "Nobody," [...] a song by his favorite girl group (Note: This part of episode, the music of Nobody of Wonder Girls changed to Haru by SHINee in the televised broadcast in the Philippines by GMA-7). After the <b>dog</b> <b>fell</b> ill, Hyung-chul is ordered to put down the animal, and the trauma drives him to go AWOL. His ghost dog appears before Gong-shil, and she and Joong-won prevent Hyung-chul from committing suicide.|$|R
5000|$|While it was {{determined}} in the intervening period that The Hogan Family had no future on its new home at CBS, the network felt willing to give The Family Man another chance. Originally, CBS was planning to return the series on a weeknight in March 1991, pairing it with the upcoming Steven Spielberg cartoon Family Dog, and collectively promoting the scheduling as [...] "The Family Hour". Family <b>Dog</b> <b>fell</b> behind in production, however (it remained shelved before finally having a short run on CBS {{in the summer of}} 1993), causing the network to delay The Family Man as well until they could find a [...] "protected time slot" [...] (i.e., one preceded by a hit lead-in) for the show.|$|R
60|$|Frank trod {{upon and}} <b>fell</b> over the <b>dog,</b> who {{fortunately}} {{was unable to}} see anything over the coaming. He scarcely heard it yelping as he scrambled along the steeply slanted deck dragging the heavy oar. They got it over and thrust upon it in desperate haste {{in an attempt to}} cant her bow off, but as the tide swung her farther around her side came up against the oar, threatening to break it or pitch the boys over the rail, and for a while they strained every muscle in vain. Then she suddenly swung back {{in the midst of a}} furious swirl, and Frank fell down on something that seemed unpleasantly hard. Harry, flinging the oar upon the deck, dropped close by, feeling for a rope.|$|R
2500|$|The trail down Dalzell Gorge {{from the}} divide is {{regarded}} as the worst stretch of the trail. Steep and straight, it drops [...] in elevation in just , and there is little traction so the teams are hard to control. Mushers have to ride the brake most of the way down and use a snow hook for traction. In 1988, rookie Peryll Kyzer fell through an ice bridge into a creek and spent the night wet. The route then follows Tatina River, which is also hazardous: in 1986 Butcher's lead <b>dogs</b> <b>fell</b> through the ice but landed on a second layer of ice instead of falling into the river. In 1997, Ramey Smyth lost the end of his pinkie when it hit an overhanging branch while negotiating the gorge.|$|R
5000|$|Sadie tells Jennifer {{the story}} of her {{childhood}} dog. She loved the dog but the <b>dog</b> <b>fell</b> in love with her sister, so Sadie drowned her sister. She adds that she never blamed the dog. Upstairs, she tells Kevin that they need to get rid of his wandering eye and partially blinds him. Sadie takes Jennifer to a boat, planning to drown her, but Jennifer escapes and intercept a car, only to find Sadie driving. Once caught and driving with Sadie, Jennifer falsely professes her love for Sadie, saying that the affair was to end their relationship so she could be with Sadie. Jennifer kisses Sadie and then rolls out of the car in an attempt to get away but hurts herself. Sadie {{gets out of the car}} and chokes Jennifer to death.|$|R
