5|$|A {{secretary}} at the FBI office, Dorothy Bahnsen (Jane Perry), helps Dales find a file that mentions Gissing, {{one of the}} two other men mentioned by Bill who had committed suicide. She explains that she files all the unsolved cases under X because there is more room under X than U. Gissing's body is still in the morgue and Dales convinces the technician to cut open the body where they find a strange creature has been sewn into Gissing's chest. Dales goes to Skur's wife and tells her what was done to her husband and that he wants to expose the experiments. Skur's wife goes down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> bomb shelter to tell Skur, but he is overcome by his parasite and kills her.|$|E

The page grew rapidly in popularity, receiving over 900 [...] "likes" [...] in under two weeks, and inspiring both a Twitter and Tumblr account for the newly proposed mascot. At the Commencement ceremony for the class of 2014, the moose mascot was mentioned by Biddy Martin in her address, and the Dining Hall served Moose Tracks ice cream in front of an ice sculpture of a moose.|$|E

Initially, the leading station in Detroit (WJR), Chicago (WLS), and Cincinnati (WLW) all competed for farmer listeners with agricultural reports. WOWO, almost equidistant between those three stations eventually captured that demographic, with the other three stations focusing on their urban and suburban areas. This benefitted WOWO as national advertisers saw WOWO as a regional station that would reach well <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyards</b> of those larger metropolises.|$|R
50|$|Centerville {{is known}} as the “City of Arches” due to the five main arches it has located on the Old National Road. The road used to be 100 feet wide, but was {{shortened}} to 65 feet due to the people of Centerville adding on {{to the front of the}} businesses and houses. The arches were used as a way to get behind <b>the</b> buildings and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyards</b> of <b>the</b> houses. The five arches that are located in Centerville are the Backenstoes Archway, Dill Archway, Shortridge Archway, Lantz Archway, and Malone Archway. They were all built between 1823 and 1836. They are all located on National Road in Centerville. In August, Centerville has Archway Days, which is held in celebration and honor of the historical archways. They have food, games, and prizes, which attracts people from all over the state.|$|R

The first HouseGuest to fill up their jar and claim the ball inside would be the winner of the competition. Zach was the winner. During the competition, Eric won a phone call from home, and chose to give it to Jessica. On Day 63, Zach chose to nominate Jameka and Jessica for eviction. On Day 64, former HouseGuest Janelle Pierzina returned to the house to host [...] "The Janelle-O-Vision" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to correctly identify which two HouseGuests' face made a mixed face swirl. The HouseGuest with the most correct answers would win the Power of Veto. Daniele was the winner of the Power of Veto. On Day 66, Daniele chose to leave the nominations the same. Despite being in an alliance and assuring her safety, Daniele and Dick debated turning on Eric and Jessica by evicting her from the house. Just before the eviction, the HouseGuests learned that it would be a Double Eviction night, and that a second HouseGuest would be evicted in a matter of minutes. On Day 69, Jessica became the ninth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of two to one. HouseGuests then {{competed in the}} [...] "Before or After" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to determine whether one event in the house occurred before or after, and the HouseGuest with the most points was the winner; Dick was the winner.

He became the fifth member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E

60|$|With this Mrs. Rachel {{stepped out}} of the lane <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> of Green Gables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies. Not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have seen it if there had been. Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla Cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house. One could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt.|$|E

40|$|As global populations grow, {{cities are}} {{stretching}} their urban boundaries into {{rural areas and}} bringing the challenges of biodiversity conservation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyards</b> of homeowners. Planning controls can attempt to regulate residents’ behaviours to support conservation actions for threatened species but need to consider whether community attitudes align with conservation objectives. This study investigated community attitudes towards planned management interventions in a new conservation strategy designed to protect endangered Southern Brown Bandicoots in new residential estates around Cranbourne, Australia. A survey (n =  318, response rate 15. 2 per cent) investigated current resident attitudes towards bandicoot conservation, cat ownership and effectiveness of current planning controls. Results indicate community support {{for a range of}} bandicoot conservation actions including confinement of domestic cats and non-lethal cat controls and for new developments being cat-free with bandicoot habitat corridors. Awareness of bandicoots correlated with higher support for conservation actions while cat owners were less supportive overall, particularly to limitations on cat ownership. Potential barriers to management interventions include inadequate knowledge, perceived associated risks and housing turnover. This information is valuable for conservation planning for new developments and to improve implementation of planning controls in existing residential areas for delivery of long-term protection for threatened species like Southern Brown Bandicoots...|$|R
