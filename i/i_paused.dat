25|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>paused</b> local {{development}} somewhat, and 300 men (66 {{of whom were}} officers) in the parish enlisted in the British Armed Forces. The village came to accommodate a number of Belgian refugees. In the Second World War, Kilmacolm was used to house evacuees from Glasgow and public buildings were used to house those made homeless by the Greenock Blitz in 1941. One bomb fell in Kilmacolm, causing minor damage and, following the war, the hydropathic hotel {{was used as a}} naval hospital until being returned to private ownership with its purchase by Stakis Hotels.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, <b>I</b> <b>paused</b> just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>paused.</b> They {{answered}} me by silence, by {{a thoughtful}} silence.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pause</b> again, {{for this}} is a strange expression; a broken metaphor, one might think, {{careless}} and unscholarly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{what does}} our young friend say?" [...] {{proceeded}} Mr. Kenge. [...] "Take time, take time! <b>I</b> <b>pause</b> for her reply. But take time!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Where the city's ceaseless crowd {{moves on}} the livelong day, [...] Withdrawn I join {{a group of}} {{children}} watching, <b>I</b> <b>pause</b> aside with them.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>paused.</b> There {{was some}} {{satisfaction}} in seeing Miss Thorn biting her lip.|$|E
60|$|We {{had reached}} the door of my house. <b>I</b> <b>paused</b> and turned to him.|$|E
60|$|More {{would have}} been added, but <b>I</b> <b>paused</b> for the effect of my exordium.|$|E
6000|$|... "In an emergency," [...] he announced, [...] "it {{is always}} a good thing to pause and reflect. Please excuse me while <b>I</b> <b>pause</b> and reflect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you came}} into the Temple last night--" [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>pausing</b> to wonder whether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long ago.|$|R
6000|$|But now <b>I</b> <b>pause</b> at whiles in what I do, [...] And {{count the}} bell, and tremble lest I hear [...] (My work untrimmed) the sunset gun too soon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good afternoon, Mr. Dubourg," [...] I said--and {{turned to}} the door. She heard me cross the room, and called to me to stop. <b>I</b> <b>paused.</b> There was a glass on the wall {{opposite}} to me. On {{the authority of the}} glass, I beg to mention that <b>I</b> <b>paused</b> in my most becoming manner. Grace tempered with dignity: dignity tempered with grace.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>paused</b> at {{the mouth}} of that black opening, and even as <b>I</b> <b>paused,</b> {{something}} hard that gave out a metallic sound fell {{at the far end of}} the church. Instinct told me it was the lock which those miscreants had cut from the door. I waited for no more, but like a beast scudding to cover I plunged into that black space.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>paused</b> at {{the foot}} of the stairs, expecting her to appear and come down.|$|E
6000|$|That I walk up my stoop, <b>I</b> <b>pause</b> to {{consider}} {{if it really}} be, [...] A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics [...] of books.|$|R
6000|$|And next I meet you, and <b>I</b> <b>pause,</b> And {{think that}} if mistake it were, As some have said, O then it was [...] One that I well can bear! ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet here <b>I</b> <b>pause,</b> {{look back}} across the threshold. [...] Cry to my brethren, though the world be old, [...] Prophets and sages, questioners and doubters, [...] O world, old world, the best hath ne'er been told! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>paused,</b> {{and there}} was a weak gust of cheering, and then a renewal of booing.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>paused</b> {{and glanced}} at Mr. Ravenor. He was looking a little puzzled, but not {{particularly}} interested.|$|E
60|$|Here <b>I</b> <b>paused,</b> and {{he seized}} the {{opportunity}} to curse me--briefly, with a wary eye on an incoming wavelet.|$|E
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>pause,</b> before ending my preface--thinking {{of one or}} {{two more}} points that are {{difficult}} to write of--I find a letter in 'The Times,' from a French lady, which says all I want so beautifully, that I will print it just as it stands:- ...|$|R
6000|$|The dead {{have been}} awakened—shall I sleep? [...] The world’s {{at war with}} tyrants—shall I crouch? [...] The harvest’s ripe—and shall <b>I</b> <b>pause</b> to reap? [...] I slumber not—the thorn is in my couch: [...] Each day a trumpet soundeth in mine ear, [...] Its echo in my heart.|$|R
6000|$|THE dead {{have been}} awakened--shall I sleep? [...] The World's {{at war with}} tyrants--shall I crouch? [...] The harvest's ripe--and shall <b>I</b> <b>pause</b> to reap?

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>paused</b> at {{the same}} moment, feeling that I could venture no further without the risk of {{offending}} him.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>paused,</b> and for {{a moment}} we were silent. Then {{suddenly}} she looked up; her fingers tightened upon mine.|$|E
60|$|The {{ground was}} {{as soft as}} velvet, and my {{footsteps}} gave forth no sound. When the wind lulled <b>I</b> <b>paused</b> behind a tree and waited for another gusty roar. I kept {{very close to the}} trail, for that was the only means by which I could return to my horses. I felt the skin tighten on my face. Suddenly, as <b>I</b> <b>paused,</b> I beard angry voices, pitched high. But I could not make out the words.|$|E
6000|$|... 16 [...] On my way {{a moment}} <b>I</b> <b>pause,</b> [...] Here for you! and here for America! [...] Still the present I raise aloft, still {{the future of}} the States I [...] harbinge glad and sublime, [...] And for the past I {{pronounce}} what the air holds of the red aborigines.|$|R
6000|$|The morning drum-call on my eager ear [...] Thrills unforgotten yet; {{the morning}} dew [...] Lies yet undried along my field of noon. [...] But now <b>I</b> <b>pause</b> at whiles in what I do, [...] And count the bell, and tremble lest I hear [...] (My work untrimmed) the sunset gun too soon.|$|R
60|$|I {{therefore}} wish {{to stop at}} this period, {{in which}} Mr. Hastings became active in the service, pretty near {{the time when he}} began his political career: and here, my Lords, <b>I</b> <b>pause,</b> wishing your indulgence at such time as will suit your convenience for pursuing the rest of this eventful history.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>paused</b> {{a moment}} for breath before I answered: [...] "He {{attended}} the rally at the dock himself, sir, and I believe enjoyed it." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>paused</b> a moment. Our {{horses were}} moving slowly, for the tale engrossed us both, {{me in the}} telling, her in the hearing. Presently-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>paused</b> for {{a moment}} to give some {{instructions}} about my own luggage. Then I stepped into the lift with the clerk and her.|$|E
6000|$|Stay--I {{am going}} too fast. That coiling is perhaps {{prepared}} {{for some kind}} of uncoiling; and I will try if I can't learn something about it from some other book--noticing, as <b>I</b> <b>pause</b> to think where to look, the advantage of our English tongue in its pithy Saxon word, 'pith,' separating all our ideas of vegetable structure clearly from animal; while the poor Latin and French must use the entirely inaccurate words 'medulla' and 'moelle'; all, however, concurring in their recognition of a vital power of some essential kind in this white cord of cells: [...] "Medulla, sive illa vitalis anima est, ante se tendit, longitudinem impellens." [...] (Pliny, 'Of the Vine,' liber X., cap. xxi.) 'Vitalis anima'--yes--that I accept; but 'longitudinem impellens,' <b>I</b> <b>pause</b> at; being not at all clear, yet, myself, about any impulsive power in the pith.[40] ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>pause</b> not now to {{consider}} ... whether the enterprise of John Brown {{and his associates}} in Virginiawas wise or foolish, right or wrong; I only know that, whether the enterprise itself was the one or the other, John Brown himself was right. [...] - Andrew, in his 1859 fund-raising appeal for John Brown's defense ...|$|R
6000|$|Or when, dim-shadowing o'er {{the face}} of day, [...] The {{mantling}} mists of even-tide rise slow, [...] As thro' the forest gloom I wend my way, [...] The minster curfew's sullen roar I know; [...] <b>I</b> <b>pause</b> and love its solemn toll to hear, As made by distance soft, it dies upon the ear.|$|R
