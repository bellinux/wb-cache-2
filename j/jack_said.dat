25|$|Cash {{was very}} close to his older brother, Jack. In May 1944, Jack was pulled into a {{whirling}} head saw in the mill where he worked and was almost cut in two. He suffered {{for more than a week}} before dying on May 20, 1944, at the age of 15. Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident. According to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but Johnny and his mother, and Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day. His mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother. Jack insisted on working since the family needed the money. On his deathbed, <b>Jack</b> <b>said</b> he had visions of Heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in Heaven.|$|E

500|$|In a 2014 interview, <b>Jack</b> <b>said</b> that Meg's lack {{of enthusiasm}} for the project contributed to the band's breakup.

500|$|The two {{brothers}} had often argued, and {{earlier in the}} decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, [...] "I'll get you for this, {{you son of a}} bitch" [...] and threatening to kill him. This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again. When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d'Antibes. [...] Asked to respond to his brother's death, <b>Jack</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I didn't give a shit about Harry." [...] At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.|$|E

Meg {{had come from a}} dead-halt for a year and went right back into that madness. Meg is a very shy girl, a very quiet and shy person.

500|$|Specifically, the band's most {{prominent}} influences include blues musicians such as Son House, Blind Willie McTell and Robert Johnson, garage rock bands such as The Gories and The Sonics, the Detroit protopunk sound of bands like the MC5 and The Stooges, {{in addition to}} groups like The Cramps, The Velvet Underground, and the early Los Angeles punk blues band The Gun Club. Jack has stated on numerous occasions that the blues is the dominant influence on his songwriting and {{the roots of the}} band's music, stating that he feels it is so sacred that playing it does not do it justice. Of The Gun Club's music in particular, <b>Jack</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "'Sex Beat', 'She's Like Heroin To Me', and 'For The Love Of Ivy'...why are these songs not taught in schools?" [...] Heavy blues rock bands such as the Rolling Stones and AC/DC have also influenced the band, particularly Led Zeppelin, as Jack has claimed that he [...] "can't trust anybody who doesn't like Led Zeppelin." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Malcolm Jack {{was less}} impressed; {{he stated that}} when Lewis tried to diversify the show by dancing or {{switching}} the arrangements, she risked becoming the British diva that pop music forgot. <b>Jack</b> <b>said</b> that during a [...] "sassy dance routine" [...] for [...] "Forgive Me" [...] Lewis came off as a [...] "budget Beyoncé", whilst on the [...] "cringey windin' and grindin' reggae take on 'Better in Time' song" [...] she comes across like a [...] "reasonably priced Rihanna". Jack concluded by saying the show {{was in need of}} a shot of [...] "adrenaline". In writing for the Nottingham Post, Paul Hindle agreed, saying that when the tempo increased and choreography was introduced [...] "Lewis looked endearingly uncomfortable"; however, Hindle was positive about Lewis' vocals, calling her vocal performance [...] "virtuoso". He concluded that Lewis' [...] "spellbinding rendition" [...] of [...] "Run" [...] was a highlight of the concert, and that fans should not have left disappointed.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{reception}} by reviewers {{was generally}} unfavorable. AllMusic reviewer Corey Apar {{wrote that the}} album [...] "is basically a vapid product of the MySpace generation ... The whole album just seems so contrived and pointless that any sporadic moment of disposable hooky bliss is quickly overshadowed by annoying wordplay." [...] Apar concluded by calling the album the musical equivalent of [...] "an ironic trucker hat: even if it catches on with the masses for a time, that doesn't make it right." [...] Ben Marwood of Drowned in Sound wrote that the album contained [...] "little substance of any kind – emotional or otherwise." [...] He went on to call the band [...] "a low-rent" [...] My Chemical Romance or [...] "a lesser" [...] Panic! at the Disco because of Hacikyan's vocals. FasterLouder writer Victoria Jack wrote that there were [...] "some unique moments" [...] on the record, noting the band's upbeat sound. Despite mentioning the group can be [...] "more insightful," [...] <b>Jack</b> <b>said</b> they [...] "usually lack depth in their typical commentary on 'scenes' and 'cliques' and being a 'sell out'." [...] Kate Parkin of Gigwise listed [...] "Newport Living" [...] and [...] "There's a Class for This" [...] as being [...] "songs built for The O.C." [...] Adding in songs about [...] "High School tribulations and illicit snogging ... something is lacking." [...] Parkin noted that the group was missing [...] "the arrogant defiance" [...] of My Chemical Romance and [...] "the relentlessly catchy choruses" [...] of Panic! at the Disco.|$|E

2500|$|During 2001, after a low key tour {{supporting}} Texas, {{they took}} a long summer break, in North Devon, to write new material for their fifth album. The self-financed sessions were deliberately performed at arms length from their record label and the music industry in general, and Reef enjoyed the opportunity {{to return to their}} earlier, more basic approach to making music. In an interview to the BBC <b>Jack</b> <b>said</b> [...] "It's a harder sound, like when we first came out - a deep sound, heavy, I really like that." [...] Whilst {{they had a lot of}} new material, Sony forced Reef to only use around a third of this material as part of a greatest hits offering entitled Together - The Best of Reef released in January 2003. Jack Bessant denounced the complete lack of support from Sony and Kenwyn House called the release [...] "a kiss of death." [...] Many fans felt the new material had been some of their best work for some time.|$|E
2500|$|The viewer {{thinks this}} is the end of the movie and that it has a happy ending. [...] But we then learn, in a final twist, the truth. [...] Amaya did not really kidnap Toby. [...] When Amaya {{explained}} to Toby who her father really was, Amaya was able to enlist Toby (using the magic of Santa Muerte) to help exact an even worse revenge on Jack/Roberto. [...] Amaya tells Toby that her father will kill her mother (which in fact happened earlier when Jack was duped by the assassin he tortured into killing Katie to find Toby). [...] Amaya told Toby that Santa Muerte magic would give her the strength to carry out a terrible revenge on her father for that murder. [...] So Amaya purposefully let Jack and Toby escape. [...] Her plan was for them to live happily for many years and then for Toby to kill her father. [...] In the final scene, we see Jack and Toby fleeing deeper into Mexico on an old bus. [...] As she sits and watches the countryside go by, we hear Toby reciting the same Santa Muerta chant for power that others (including <b>Jack)</b> <b>said</b> throughout the movie.|$|E

2500|$|After Badou Jack (21-1-2, 12 KOs) {{moved up}} to light heavyweight, on 19 June 2017, he {{revealed}} that his team were working towards a deal for him to fight Cleverly.

On 19 July, according to sources, a deal was being close to being agreed from sides. On 27 July, [...] the World Boxing Association ordered Cleverly for fight undefeated WBA interim champion Dmitry Bivol (11-0, 9 KOs), which would eventually establish a mandatory challenger for 'super' champion Andre Ward. Both camps were given 30 days or it would go to purse bids. On August 9, Eddie Hearn confirmed that terms had been agreed for a fight between Jack and Cleverly. It was also reported that whether the WBA 'regular' title would be at state at this point was uncertain, as mandatory challenger Bivol was yet to agree a step aside fee. On 12 August, the WBA's Championships Committee granted special permission for the fight to be contested for their light heavyweight title. They also {{made it clear that the}} winner would need to negotiate a deal to fight Bivol by 11 September 2017. Cleverly lost the bout via 5th round stoppage, losing his WBA title in the process. Cleverly had some success in round 2, throwing and landing continuously without hurting Jack. In round 4, Jack piled the pressure on Cleverly, who left himself open and ended up with a bloodied nose. The end came with Cleverly against the ropes and Jack pounding him with combinations. Referee stepped in and called an end to the fight at 2 minutes and 47 seconds of round 5. At the time of stoppage, Jack had landed 172 punches of 442 thrown (39%), while Cleverly, who threw 409, only landed 82 punches (20%).
