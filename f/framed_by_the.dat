5|$|Abdül Kadir was {{the first}} Ottoman pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} to be constructed. She was laid down in 1892 {{at the beginning of}} a small-scale expansion of the Ottoman Navy. Work slowed down considerably once she was <b>framed.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> early 1900s the only progress that had been made was the addition of armor plating around her keel. Once that was finished, work ceased. Construction was planned to resume in 1904 but by that time her keel blocks, which were used to prevent hogging and sagging, had shifted and the ship was considered a total loss. She was scrapped on the slipway in 1914. A model of this ship exists in the Constantinople Naval Museum.|$|E
5|$|After Flores' {{murder on}} 30 May 2010—five {{years to the}} day after Holloway's disappearance—Van der Sloot fled to Chile, where he was arrested and extradited back to Peru for {{questioning}} regarding the murder. On 7 June 2010, he confessed to bludgeoning Ramírez. He later tried to formally retract his confession, claiming that he had been intimidated by the National Police of Peru and <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> FBI. A Peruvian judge ruled on 25 June 2010 that the confession was valid and on 13 January 2012, Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment for Flores' murder.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) {{approved}} a follow-on {{class of the}} earlier Project 15 Delhi-class destroyers. The aim was that the follow-on class would incorporate {{a higher level of}} air-defence, land attack, anti-submarine and anti-ship capabilities than the preceding class. However, the Indian Navy did not initially take up the option. By the year 2000, the Indian Navy had redesigned the follow-on Kolkata class to incorporate even higher levels of technology (including modern stealth characteristics) and in May of that year, approval for the construction was given. Concept and function for Project 15A was <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> navy's Directorate of Naval Design, while the detailed design was developed by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL).|$|E

5|$|The Kolkata class (Project 15A) is a {{class of}} guided missile destroyers with stealth technology. By the year 2000, the Indian Navy had {{redesigned}} the follow-on Kolkata class to improve technology (including modern stealth characteristics) and in May of that year, approval for the construction was given. Concept and function for Project 15A was <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> navy's Directorate of Naval Design, while the detailed design was developed by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL). It consists of three ships (Kolkata, Kochi and Chennai), built by Mazagon Dock Limited, which are the navy's largest destroyers. Due to construction delays and a problem discovered during sea trials, the first ship's commission was postponed from 2010 to 2014.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{left ear}} is set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel {{to her eyes}} rather than to her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue {{the flow of the}} diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> headdress to draw attention to her beauty.|$|E
5|$|Although {{depicted}} {{with the}} tower in a Rand McNally map from 1893, later lithographs {{of the first}} 141 Jackson Street location display a red-roofed building without a tower. Memorabilia of the current building is abundant, with postcards of panoramic scenes from LaSalle Street, the clock, and lighted upper decks having been produced for decades. In views from the Museum Campus, the building's crown is <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> middle floors of the taller Sears Tower in the background. Photographer Andreas Gursky has used the location for still life prints such as 1997's Chicago Board of Trade, I and 1999's Chicago Board of Trade, II. A photograph of the exterior, from the Museum series by Thomas Struth, is {{in the collection of}} the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. An often-reproduced painting by Leslie Ragan for the New York Central Railroad depicts streamliner locomotives idling at LaSalle Street Station with the Board of Trade Building looming prominently in the background.|$|E
30|$|The wheeled shell, {{as shown}} in Fig. 3 c, is {{constructed}} from two annulus frames, eight shell pieces, and eight wheel-rim-hinges. The shells are fixed between <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> <b>by</b> stainless steel pins and bolts to form the wheel surface. The wheel-rim-hinges, which freely rotate around their central axis, are supported between <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bearings.

5|$|One of {{the castle}} meres can still be seen to the west {{of the castle}}, {{although}} in the 16th century there were two lakes, much larger than today, complete with a wharf. This dramatic use of water to reflect the image of the castle is similar to that used at several other castles of the period, including Bredwardine and Ravensworth Castle. Water castles such as Framlingham made greater use of water than was necessary for defence and enhanced the appearance of the castle. The view from the Great Hall in the Inner Court would originally have included the gardens of the Lower Court, and these would have then been <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mere and the Great Park beyond. The area around the castle today remains a designed and managed landscape; although the Great Park is now covered by fields, the view still gives a sense of how the castle and landscape was meant to appear to its late medieval owners.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{elements of the}} castle were also positioned for particular effect. Unusually, the huge Great Gatehouse faced south-east, away from the main road, hiding its extraordinary architectural features. This may have been because Thomas intended {{to establish a new}} settlement in front of it, but the gatehouse was also probably intended to be viewed from the harbour, where the most senior visitors were expected to arrive. The Lilburn Tower was positioned so as to be clearly - and provocatively - visible to Edward II's castle at Bamburgh, 9 miles (15km) away along the coast, and would have been elegantly <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entranceway to the Great Gatehouse for any visitors. It was also positioned on a set of natural basalt pillars, which - although inconvenient to build upon - would have enhanced its dramatic appearance and reflection in the meres.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
