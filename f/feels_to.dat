5|$|Rescued by Rover {{contains}} more than twenty shots; this is a considerable advance when compared with Hepworth's own How it <b>Feels</b> <b>to</b> be Run Over (1900), which contains a single shot. This not only made the film longer, but demonstrated that advances in film language could be made in editing as well as shooting. Additionally, the editing of Rescued by Rover is notable in its use of time contractions, which made Rover's journeys take considerably less time by portrayal {{than they would have}} in reality.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) gives Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) {{an offer to}} become his deputy. Later, Regina (Lana Parrilla) tells Emma that {{she is no longer}} afraid of her staying in the town, and cites Emma's mobile lifestyle. Emma {{encounters}} a 19-year-old pregnant maid named Ashley Boyd (Schram), crying about not having a future for both her and her baby. Emma tells Ashley that she knows how it <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> have a baby at a young age. She encourages Ashley to take charge and change her life. Later that evening, Ashley breaks into Mr. Gold's pawn shop and steals a contract from a safe. While there, she is confronted by Mr. Gold, who attempts to stop her. Ashley attacks him, leaving him unconscious on the floor of his shop.|$|E
5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E

In this chapter, we will attempt to provide some partial answers to those questions based on our experience with Philosophy for Chil-dren. The assumption behind this chapter is that experience may be held to yield some truth, facilitate some understanding, that escapes theory. As usual, we are taking William James seriously...|$|R

25|$|Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung {{argued that}} a father is very {{important}} to a boy's development of identity. In his book Absent Fathers, Lost Sons Canadian Jungian analyst Guy Corneau writes that the presence of the father's body during the son's developmental phases is integral in the son developing a positive sense of self as masculine. Corneau also argues that if the son does not develop positively towards the father's male body, then the son runs the risk of developing negatively towards all bodies. Jacques Lacan argued that in the son's mind, the father's body represents the law, and that the role of the father's body is to break the attachment the son <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> the mother and by extension his own.|$|E

500|$|In 1995, Kajol {{starred in}} two major {{commercial}} successes—Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge—both opposite Shah Rukh Khan.

The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. She justified playing a minor role in the film by saying, [...] "I did Karan Arjun because I wanted to know how it <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> be an ornament.

In particular, [...] "it's the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent, and fundamentally very responsible {{about the rest of the}} world", which connects Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes to Clarke's Jonathan Strange.|$|E

[...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?'

500|$|According to {{the digital}} sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, [...] "Love On Top" [...] is mainly {{written in the}} key of C major with a tempo of 94 beats per minute.

[...] "Love on Top" [...] is set as [...] "both a sweet love song and an expression of girl power" [...] as stated by Georgette Cline of AOL Music. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club and David Amidon of PopMatters noted that [...] "Love on Top" [...] features [...] "mature lyrics" [...] alongside Beyoncé [...] "sounding vocally giddy and aggressive while portraying the message." [...] Lyrically, the song finds Beyoncé as the female protagonist expressing the happiness she <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> have her love interest in her life. [...] "The languid, synth-soul smoocher allows for enjoyably euphoric tone" [...] before she chimes in with [...] "Bring the beat in!", introducing [...] "a mid-album interlude of mid-80s pop", as stated by Andy Gill of The Independent as well as Hamish MacBain of NME.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{are about a}} gender-swapping thought experiment, through which Beyoncé {{analyses}} the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do {{if she were a}} boy, Beyoncé highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During {{the first part of the}} ballad, Beyoncé alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the better man she would be. In the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that she would never be confronted for it. Beyoncé then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a better man, [...] "I think I could understand / How it <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> love a girl / I swear I'd be a better man", because she knows [...] "how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted / 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's mother-manager Tina Knowles {{said that}} Dangerously in Love showcases her musical roots. While Williams and Rowland were on gospel and {{alternative}} pop, respectively, Beyoncé focused on recording R songs. Songs in the album are varied: from mid-tempo and club-oriented {{tracks in the}} first half, and ballads in the second half. Beyoncé commented: [...] "My album is a good balance of... ballads and... mid-tempos with just ridin'-in-your-car <b>feels,</b> <b>to</b> a lot of... up-tempo club songs, to really sexy songs, to songs {{that make you feel}} emotional. It's a nice mixture of different types of tracks." [...] Although the album contains high-energy songs like [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Naughty Girl", the album's focal mode, however, is slow and moody. Beyoncé said that she had written lots of ballads for the album. According to Beyoncé, she wanted to be understood as an artist and showcase her range, and by doing so, she blended various genres and musical influences in the album. The album incorporates R, hip hop, soul and reggae influences. The album took hip hop influences from Jay-Z, Outkast, and Lil' Kim; the reggae is from Sean Paul; and courtesy of Storch, the album explores Arabic music. His personal study of that kind of music gave the album a Middle Eastern vibe. Beyoncé and the producers also used a wide array of instrumentations.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé resigns herself and {{continues}} to sing about cruelties that men often inflict on women. Still imagining herself impersonating {{the man who has}} wronged her, she highlights how some men switch off their phones to avoid ex-lovers after having found another girl. Beyoncé continues, [...] "I'd put myself first / And make the rules as I go / 'Cause I know that she'd be faithful / Waitin' for me to come home". She then repeats the chorus; the intensity with which she sings gradually increases until she hits her upper register and seems close to crying. During the bridge, Beyoncé stops singing about the male behaviors she would indulge in if she were a man and addresses her callous lover directly. As Beyoncé emphasizes how it <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> be cheated on, she sings her vocal lines an octave higher than she did {{in the rest of the}} song. She finally tells him that it is too late to come back and apologize. In the last verse, Beyoncé concludes, [...] "But you're just a boy". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music notes that she [...] " [...] her voice into a thin, pleading whine" [...] at this point. With a squeak in her voice, she repeats the chorus for the final time as she fights to remain strong, not allowing her agony to bring her down.|$|E
