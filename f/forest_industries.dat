The company represented a consortium of British Columbia forest companies, and the bid was accepted and the sale completed in December 1959. The four aircraft were flown to Fairey Aviation at Victoria, British Columbia, for conversion into water bombers. The conversion involved the installation of a tank in the cargo bay and retractable pick-up scoops to allow uploading of water while the aircraft was taxiing. The scoops allowed 30 tons of water to be taken on board in 22 seconds. Later some of the hull fuel tanks were replaced with water tanks.|$|E

40|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970 ’s <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> timberland gained the eye of {{financial}} investors. Diamond International and Crown Zellerbach were early firms that were purchased for the “break-up value” of their timberland. Timberland was perceived as undervalued by investors and made <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> firms attractive takeover targets. This started a process where <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> divested of its timberland. Some firms formed separate entities for its timberland base. Acquisitions and mergers became popular in the <b>industry.</b> Some <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> companies converted to real estate investment trusts, for tax and defensive reasons. Large institutional investors became interested in timberland as means to diversify their portfolios and increase financial performance.

On this foundation, in July 1996, the federal forests minister and his state and territory counterparts met and [...] "endorsed the plantation industry's target of trebling the plantation estate from 1.1 million hectares to 3million hectares by the year 2020".

40|$|Forestry, forest, {{pulp and}} paper {{industries}} provide important cases for environmental and ecological economics and for corporate environmental management, {{because of the large}} quantities of flows of material and energy that are derived from the natural ecosystem. Because of the natural capital intensive nature of its activity, the <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> also offers a fruitful case study for industrial ecology (IE), the practical concern of which is the comparison of material and energy flows of nature to these same flows in economic and industrial systems. In this paper, the concept of an industrial ecosystem is reflected in a typical local <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> system in Finland, known as 'a local <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> integrate'. We present a material and energy flow model {{that can be used to}} study <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> environmental management and for the planning of environmental policies directed to <b>forest</b> <b>industry.</b> Flows of matter (biomass), nutrients, energy and carbon are described, and the waste utilization possibilities are considered. A local <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> system can be a fruitful case for IE development as the cuttings of forests in Finland are below the renewal rate, material cycles, nutrient cycles and energy cascades are developed and the carbon dioxide (CO 2) binding capacity of the forest ecosystem is maintained. The difficulties and barriers in light of the industrial ecosystem vision of a materially closed local system include the high export rates of paper, energy intensive production and problem displacement in waste utilization efforts. The presented material and energy flow model of <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> environmental management is compared with a case of a local agricultural and food industry system. For agro-food sector applications, a different emphasis on the flows may have to be adopted than in a <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> application.
