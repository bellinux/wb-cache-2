40|$|The {{increased}} use of laparoscopy for treatment of reflux esophagitis {{has been associated with}} a 1 - 8 % complication rate. Perforation of the esophagus from bougie placement, wrap breakdown or too tight a wrap are some of the complications seen from this surgery. An <b>esophageal</b> <b>dilator</b> system was developed to overcome these problems. Thirty patients had an <b>esophageal</b> <b>dilator</b> system used whereby a 48 F or 58 F dilator was placed over a 18 F orogastric tube. Intraoperative gastroscopy documented a properly created wrap. There were no esophageal perforations or morbidity associated with the dilator. Key Words: Laparoscopy, Hiatal hernia, Bougie...|$|E
40|$|Bronchial {{dilation}} {{is usually}} required {{to treat a}} number of disorders; the most frequent are complications after airway surgery, including lung transplantation, stenosis after radiotherapy, and compression by an extraluminal mass. The procedure is performed by forcing {{the tip of a}} rigid bronchoscope through the stenosis using barrels of increasing size; however, when there is a clear discrepancy between the caliber of the rigid instrument and the stenosis, the first step may be difficult. In such cases, we have successfully employed two types of old-fashioned <b>esophageal</b> <b>dilators</b> rescued from the armamentarium of our endoscopy unit.
