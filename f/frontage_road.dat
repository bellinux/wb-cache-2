5|$|Upon {{exiting the}} mountains, Sierra Highway enters the Antelope Valley {{and serves as}} one of the main streets of Palmdale, Lancaster, and Rosamond. The highway runs {{parallel}} to the modern Route14 and the railroad, becoming a <b>frontage</b> <b>road.</b> Just shy of Mojave the freeway portion of Route14 ends, while the <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> becomes a dirt path and eventually terminates. From this point, the canonical route of Sierra Highway joins State Route 14, passing through downtown Mojave.|$|E
5|$|Route 124 {{crosses the}} Passaic River and {{runs along the}} border of Millburn, Essex County {{to the north and}} Summit, Union County, coming to a large {{interchange}} with the Route 24 freeway and CR649 (John F. Kennedy Parkway). Here, the route becomes a <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> for the Route 24 freeway that has two lanes in each direction. The road passes to the south of The Mall at Short Hills before running through the Canoe Brook Country Club. It heads southeast into wooded residential neighborhoods and intersects Union CR657, where the Route 124 <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> has ramps to Route 24. A short distance later, the route passes an overpass to nowhere that crosses over Route 24 at Brantwood Drive which was closed and walled off. The Route 124 <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> has since eliminated the intersection at Brantwood Drive. In 2013, City of Summit vacated the 50-foot public right of way of the old road section from Route 124 into the current Brantwood Drive. In a short distance, Route 124 intersects Essex CR608, at which point the route has an eastbound ramp to eastbound Route 24 and a westbound ramp from westbound Route 24. Past this intersection, the Route 124 <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> along Route 24 ends and the route becomes a two-lane undivided road called South Service Road that closely parallels the north side of Route 24, passing under the Morristown Line. The route heads past businesses and forms the border of Millburn to the north and Springfield Township, Union County to the south, coming to an intersection with CR512 near an interchange with Route 24. There is a direct ramp from westbound Route 124 to Route 24 a short distance to the northwest of this intersection.|$|E

5|$|Route 126 {{starts at}} the Kansas state line, where K-126 ends. The road travels east for around seven miles in a {{straight}} line, intersecting Route M and Route 43. Route 126 continues eastward, crossing through farmland and a few trees. After the route intersects Route J, it meets a <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> parallel to I-49/US 71. The road crosses over North Fork Spring River and continues east. Soon, Route 126 intersects I-49/US 71 at a diamond interchange, and intersects a <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> again. The route crosses a railroad owned by Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad, and intersects Routes JJ and T. Four miles later, the route enters Golden City and becomes Main Street. It becomes concurrent with Route 37. The routes goes through downtown Golden City, and turn slightly northeast. The two routes end at US 160 at a T-intersection. US 160 continues eastward toward Lockwood. In 2012, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated as many as 840 vehicles traveling east of I-49/US 71, and as few as 480 vehicles traveling west of I-49/US 71. This is {{expressed in terms of}} annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year.|$|E
5|$|In Flint Township, M-21 follows Corunna Road {{and meets}} I-75/US23 at exit118. The road crosses a former branch {{line of the}} Canadian National Railway (converted into a bicycle trail) east of the interchange. Corunna Road angles to the {{northeast}} near Bradley Avenue and terminates at Court Street. The trunkline turns east and follows Court over {{a tributary of the}} Flint River near Aldrich Park. Northeast of the stream, M-21 splits along a one-way pairing of Court and 5th streets. Eastbound traffic follows 5th Street past the city and county buildings in the area. The highway passes over I-475 and terminates at the east <b>frontage</b> <b>road.</b> Traffic connecting between M-21 and I-475 must use the frontage roads to make the connection.|$|E
50|$|Parts of Interstate 35 through Gainesville do {{not contain}} any <b>frontage</b> <b>roads.</b> <b>Frontage</b> <b>roads</b> {{approaching}} the U.S. 82 overpass were not added until 2012. During this time, the overpass was expanded {{to make room for}} U-turn lanes.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the Texas Department of Transportation {{proposed}} to discontinue building <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> on new freeways, citing studies that suggest <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> increase congestion. However, this proposal was widely ridiculed and criticized and was dropped later the same year.|$|R
50|$|From {{the state}} line with New Mexico (at Anthony) to State Highway 20 (SH 20) in west El Paso, I-10 is bordered by <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> South Desert for lanes along I-10 East (actually headed south) and North Desert for lanes along I-10 West (headed north). The interstate then has no <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> for 9 mi but regains them east of {{downtown}} and retains them to Clint. In this stretch, the <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> are Gateway East for the eastbound lanes and Gateway West for the westbound lanes. All four <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> are one-way streets. Gateway East and Gateway West are notable, in particular, for TxDOT's liberal usage of the Texas U-turn at most underpasses of I-10 on this stretch.|$|R
5|$|MT 48 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MT 1 as a two-lane, paved road. The highway proceeds northeastward through rural mining {{land for a}} short distance before intersecting S-273. The roadway continues northeast, running parallel to Spring Creek. After a short distance, the highway passes Bowman Field and several small reservoirs that were created for mining. The road proceeds northeastward through more rural mining land before slightly bending eastward. The highway continues in a slight northeastward direction {{near the town of}} Warm Springs, crossing the Montana Western Railway. The highway proceeds to its eastern terminus at an intersection with Interstate90's <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> near exit 201.|$|E
5|$|Two other roads {{have been}} {{numbered}} Utah SR-58 in the past. The first route designated SR-58 {{was formed in}} 1945 between SR-36 and Clover, but was ed in 1953. The second road to use the designation was formed in 1965 between I-15 in New Harmony back to I-15 via Kanarraville, but that road was decommissioned in 1969. The current SR-58 was codified into Utah law in 1969 between the state line and the junction with <b>Frontage</b> <b>Road,</b> which was formerly US40. Wendover Boulevard between US93Alt. and the state line was designated SR224 between July 1, 1976, and April 28, 1993, when the highway was transferred to Elko County.|$|E
5|$|US 113 closely {{parallels}} the railroad west of Friendship to north of its right-in/right-out junction with MD 575 (Worcester Highway), an interchange only {{accessible to the}} northbound U.S. Highway. The route leaves the railroad track and meets MD90 (Ocean City Expressway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange; MD90 connects {{the northern part of}} Ocean City with US50 west of Berlin. US113 continues north to its interchange with the northern end of MD575 and MD589 (Racetrack Road), which leads to Ocean Pines and Ocean Downs, a harness racing track with a slot machine casino. The exit ramp from northbound US113 intersects MD575 a short distance south of its intersection with MD 589, and the southbound ramps connect with West <b>Frontage</b> <b>Road</b> (unsigned MD 575A), which serves St. Martin's Episcopal Church.|$|E
50|$|In Texas, many stacks contain five levels. They {{usually have}} the same {{configuration}} as four-level stacks, but <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> add a fifth level. The <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> usually intersect with traffic lights and are similar to a grid of nearby one-way streets. A common setup is for one mainline to go below grade and another to go above grade. The intersection of the <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> is typically at grade or close to it.

5|$|A short {{distance}} past the city line, NY5 passes over the Union Ship Canal on {{a span of}} the elevated road known as the Father Baker Bridge. North of the waterway, the Skyway gains a <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> named Fuhrmann Boulevard. Both the service road and the Skyway run parallel to Lake Erie until {{the northern end of}} the Buffalo Outer Harbor. Here, the frontage roads end while NY5 turns to the northeast, crossing the Buffalo River and entering downtown. On the north bank, the Skyway returns to a northerly routing as it passes KeyBank Center, located directly to the east, and Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, situated to the west, and meets I-190 at exit7. Past the interchange, the Skyway ends and the route descends in elevation, becoming an at-grade roadway once more at Church Street in the shadow of Buffalo City Hall. NY384 begins here, following Delaware Avenue north into the heart of downtown, while NY5 turns east onto Church.|$|E
5|$|BL-80 {{continues}} {{to the east}} past Aria Boulevard, which to the north connects to I-80, and to the south leads to the historic Wendover Air Force Base, where the 509th Composite Group was stationed while it prepared to conduct atomic bomb attacks against Japan during 1944 and 1945. The highway briefly parallels the Shafter Subdivision of the Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor, which was formerly part of the Feather River Route of the Western Pacific Railroad. As the highway travels east towards a half trumpet interchange with I-80, the number of lanes drops from five to two. Traffic from BL-80 can access eastbound I-80 or turn off onto Frontage Road; however, to access westbound I-80, travelers must continue eastbound until the next exit and turn around. Traffic into Wendover can access BL-80 from both directions of I-80, and from <b>Frontage</b> <b>Road.</b>|$|E
5|$|Farm to Market Road1938 (FM1938) is a Farm to Market Road in the US {{state of}} Texas. The highway runs from State Highway26 (SH26) to FM1709, in Tarrant County. While located in Westlake, FM1938 is named Precinct Line Road. While located in Southlake, from the {{northern}} border of Southlake to its junction with FM1709, FM1938 is named Randol Mill Avenue, and from the FM1709 intersection to its southern terminus, the highway is named Davis Boulevard. FM1938 was designated in 1952, in Hockley County, but was cancelled and redesignated in 1955, at its modern location in Tarrant County. In 1995, the entire route of FM 1938 was redesignated as Urban Road 1938 (UR 1938) by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). FM 1938 passes through central North Richland Hills and Southlake, providing access to several businesses. As of 2012, FM 1938 {{is in the process}} of being extended from an intersection with FM1709 to the north <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> of SH114.|$|E

5|$|Located {{entirely in}} Salt Lake County, Utah, SR-202 begins at an {{intersection}} with SR-201 and 11500West northwest of Magna, Utah. The road travels northwesterly, bordered {{on the east}} by a large tailing pond owned by Kennecott Utah Copper {{and part of the}} former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad rail line, which is now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP). The parallel rail line intersects a pair of east–west rail lines, the southern line being UP main line, and the northern line being the Feather River Route of the former Western Pacific Railroad, which is now owned by UP. After crossing the rail lines, SR-202 intersects with I-80 near the Great Salt Lake State Park and comes to a terminus at the I-80 <b>frontage</b> <b>road,</b> which provides access to the Great Salt Lake State Park and to the Saltair resort. Kennecott Utah Copper owns all of the land surrounding SR-202, except for the right-of-way for the railroad, and the highway itself.|$|E
5|$|North of Artesia Boulevard, {{the rail}} line descends into the 10-mile (16km) Mid-Corridor Trench, with two streets {{straddling}} it at ground level: Alameda Street {{to the west}} and a local <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> to the east. All cross streets are thus grade-separated from the rail line while intersecting the streets at grade, except for Rosecrans Avenue, which bridges over all three. Crossings along this segment include the Century Freeway (I-105, no access), Imperial Highway, Firestone Boulevard (former SR 42), and Slauson Avenue. Just south of 25th Street, the rail line curves northeast out of the trench, and the two roadways join to become a single Alameda Street, which soon interchanges with the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10), {{at the north end of}} what is legislated as Route 47. The street continues north through the east side of downtown Los Angeles, crossing the Santa Ana Freeway (US 101) just west of Union Station, and ending soon after at Elmyra Street, where it becomes Spring Street.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{reaching}} Taylorsville, {{the highway}} intersects I-215. Shortly thereafter, the road passes Salt Lake Community College and enters West Valley City. It soon reaches a single-point urban interchange at SR-201 that {{lies on the}} border of West Valley City and Salt Lake City. The highway loses one lane in each direction past the <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> of SR-201. West of Salt Lake City, the highway passes over the surplus canal of the Jordan River as it goes through the neighborhoods of Glendale and Poplar Grove. It arrives at an interchange with I-80 east of Salt Lake City International Airport. The road loses one lane northbound beyond 1000 North as it proceeds through the neighborhood of Rose Park in the northwestern portion of the city; the second southbound lane is lost north of 1300 North. The highway crosses the Jordan River before exiting the county.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Frontage</b> <b>roads</b> {{are common}} in the Netherlands and {{detailed}} in the Dutch national Design manual for bicycle traffic as per pages 121 and 127 [...] where they {{are referred to as}} parallel roads. In the Netherlands, engineers have used <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> to benefit cyclists as well as automobiles. Because <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> only carry local traffic, the speed on these roads is low (their speed limit is 30 km/h), making them an ideal environment for bicyclists. Because the speed and volume is so low, no additional treatments are needed to make a service road a safe bike facility. In the Netherlands, service roads are often linked together with bike paths to help create a comprehensive bicycle route, with the bike path links serving as barriers to through motor traffic. Since service roads serve a dual purpose, they are an inexpensive way to create routes in cycling network, compared to cycletracks or stand-alone bike paths. Extensive amounts of information on <b>frontage</b> <b>roads</b> can be found on Northeastern's webpage.|$|R
5|$|The freeway {{exits the}} edges of the Grand Rapids urban area past the {{interchange}} with M-6, turning due east and paralleling the northern edge of Cascade Road. I-96 curves to the south of Pratt Lake near the county line, crossing into Ionia County. Grand River Avenue is the <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> as the freeway heads east through farm fields. South of Ionia, I-96 intersects M-66. Near Portland, the trunkline turns to the southeast to cross the Grand River again. On the east side of town, the freeway crosses Grand River Avenue, its former business spur into town. I-96 continues southeasterly, crossing into Clinton County, and passes the community of Eagle. Entering the western reaches of the Lansing metropolitan area, I-96 merges with I-69 and turns southward at an interchange in the southwestern corner of the county; this interchange also provides access to Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96, Grand River Avenue).|$|E
5|$|The freeway {{was built}} in phases with the {{frontage}} roads constructed first followed by the main lanes. The overpasses for Wiseman Boulevard, Westover Hills Boulevard and Military Drive between I-410 and Loop1604 were completed over the main lanes of SH151 in 1987. In 1988, the I-410 overpasses over the SH151 frontage roads were completed, as was the interchange with US90 at the eastern terminus. Also completed in 1988 were the <b>frontage</b> <b>road</b> bridges over Leon and Slick Ranch Creek, which enabled traffic to travel the entire corridor from Loop1604 to US90 {{by way of the}} frontage roads. The main lane overpasses at FM1957 (Potranco Road) and Ingram Road were completed in 1997. The overpasses at Pinn Road and Enrique M.
