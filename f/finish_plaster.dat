5000|$|The plaster veneer method {{begins with}} the hanging of {{specially}} designated drywall ("blueboard"), in the conventional manner., N.B. In North America, {{the color of the}} face paper of drywall indicates its intended application: white for standard, green for moisture resistance, etc. Plaster veneer wallboard is blue or gray http://www.foardpanel.com/index_files/drywall%20color.pdf. Plaster veneer may also be applied to ordinary drywall, or over existing walls, but this requires [...] "gluing" [...] the existing wall surface by painting on a special adhesive compound, and then applying a thin layer of [...] "base coat" [...] plaster. After the blueboard or base coat covers the interior of a room, the finishing plaster is mixed in batches (typically about 5 gallons), by blending plaster powder with water, to the ideal consistency. Working quickly, a thin layer (usually one to three millimeters) of <b>finish</b> <b>plaster</b> is applied over a wall face before the plaster begins to congeal in the bucket. Over a period of a few hours, as the plaster chemically sets on the wall, it is periodically smoothed or textured using hand trowels, until the desired finish is achieved. When a wall face has sufficiently set, an adjoining face can be safely applied. After the plaster has fully set, it is allowed to cure for a period of days to weeks, permitting excess moisture to escape into the air. If the plaster is no more than about three millimeters thick, two to three days' cure time is usually sufficient. A skilled eye can see areas where moisture is lingering until the curing is complete. After the walls are fully cured, they are ideal for painting or papering.|$|E

50|$|The favored {{design was}} rounded bricks, which are {{somewhat}} unstable, so Mesopotamian bricklayers would lay {{a row of}} bricks perpendicular to the rest every few rows. The advantages to plano-convex bricks were the speed of manufacture {{as well as the}} irregular surface which held the <b>finishing</b> <b>plaster</b> coat better than a smooth surface from other brick types.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>finishing</b> {{or setting}} <b>plaster</b> coat {{which is about}} 3/16 inches thick is worked with a hand trowel {{on the surface of}} the rendering, which must first be well wetted. The plaster is applied in two coats to slow the drying speed of the second coat and after drying must still be wetted and worked for a time to produce a thin film of watery plaster which has the effect of [...] "Polishing" [...] the {{finished}} surface. This <b>finishing</b> <b>plaster</b> is normally trowelled on two or three passes to achieve this.|$|R

Charmaine and Joe are to do the drywall, while Casey and Dez install the flooring. Tex is constantly having to stop Dez and Casey from installing the floors upside-down and backwards (i.e. tongue-on-tongue), while Charmaine and Joe install the drywall vertically instead of horizontally, leading to a structural weakness. Casey and Dez only manage some of the floor, while Charmaine and Joe do not manage to <b>finish</b> <b>plastering.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The judge {{found that}} all the plaster applied to {{concrete}} surfaces was defective because the sub-contractors, using a particular plaster then newly on the market called [...] "Gyplite," [...] had failed to follow the manufacturers' instructions. They should have applied one coat of bonding plaster and one coat of <b>finishing</b> <b>plaster,</b> but instead had interposed a coat of browning plaster (the older time consuming and less effective method due to the time required for drying) {{and it was this}} that in due course caused plaster, which should have remained sound for the lifetime of the building, to lose its key and require replacement. He said: in my judgment, a careful and competent plasterer would not have taken the risk of departing from what I find to be clear and unambiguous instructions to use bonding <b>plaster</b> followed by <b>finishing</b> <b>plaster</b> on concrete surfaces generally. In other words I consider that the plasterers were at fault. It was suggested on behalf of the plaintiffs that a reason why the plasterers did not follow the manufacturers' instructions was because it was more economical and easier to use undercoats of bonding plaster and browning plaster to achieve the desired thickness instead of a single undercoat of bonding plaster. I am not satisfied, having heard the evidence of Mr. Marshall about the cost of applying the different grades of plaster, that this is the correct explanation and it is not necessary for me to come to any conclusion about it. It is sufficient for me to say that in my judgment the plasterers did not exercise due care in that they failed to follow the manufacturers' instruction.|$|R
