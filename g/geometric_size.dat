40|$|An {{important}} reason to prepare magnetic nanoparticles of uniform {{size and shape}} is to ensure uniform magnetic properties. However, here, we demonstrate that magnetic iron oxide crystals of 20 nm or less with a low polydispersity of the <b>geometric</b> <b>size</b> can nevertheless have a strikingly broad distribution of the magnetic dipole moment. A comparative study was performed on nanoparticles with near-perfect crystallinity, twinning defects, or a high density of dislocations. Size, shape, and crystal defects were characterized with electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and magnetic dipole moments were determined from magnetization curves of dilute colloidal dispersions. The largest divergence was found for spherical particles with 3. 5 % <b>geometric</b> <b>size</b> polydispersity and 35 % magnetic size polydispersity due to crystal lattice defects that disrupt single-domain magnetic spin coupling. This is in stark contrast with the usual implicit assumption that uniform size and shape guarantee welldefined magnetic properties of the individual particles...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to compute low lying eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors for strongly correlated many-body systems. The method was inspired by the so-called Automated Multilevel Sub-structuring Method (AMLS). Originally, it relies on subdividing the physical space into several regions. In these sub-systems the eigenproblem is solved, and the regions are combined in an adequate way. We developed a method to partition the state space of a many-particle system in order to apply similar operations on the partitions. The tensorial structure of the Hamiltonian of many-body systems make them even more suitable for this approach. The method allows to break down the complexity of large many-body systems to the complexity of two spatial sub-systems having half the <b>geometric</b> <b>size.</b> Considering the exponential size of the Hilbert space with respect to the <b>geometric</b> <b>size</b> this represents a huge advantage. In this work, we present some benchmark computations for the method applied to the one-band Hubbard model. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} a Monte Carlo study of {{so-called}} two-choice-spiral self-avoiding walks on the square lattice. These have the property that their <b>geometric</b> <b>size</b> (such as {{is measured by the}} radius of gyration) scales anisotropically, with exponent values that seem to defy rational fraction conjectures. This polymer model was previously understood to be in a universality class different to ordinary self-avoiding walks, directed walks (which are also anisotropic), and symmetric spiral walks, in two dimensions. Our Monte Carlo study concurs with those previous exact enumeration studies in that respect. However, we estimate substantially different values for the scaling exponents associated with the <b>geometric</b> <b>size</b> of the walks. We give arguments that explain this difference in terms of {{a turning point in the}} local exponent values, and in turn explain this by arguing for the existence of probable logarithmic corrections. We also supply numerical evidence supporting a conjecture concerning the angle of anisotropy in the model. 1...|$|E
