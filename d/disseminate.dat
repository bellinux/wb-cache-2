40|$|To {{investigate}} the potential use of fluconazole for {{prevention and treatment}} of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis in granulocytopenic patients, its in vivoantifungal activity was studied in three models of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis in persistently granulocytopenic rabbits: acute, subacute, and chronic <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis. Fluconazole was compared with the combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine for preventive, early, and late treatment of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis, depending on the model. Fluconazole was most effective when used for preventive or early treatment of acute and subacute <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis. When compared with the combination of amphoteri-cin B plus flucytosine, fluconazole was similarly effective in early treatment of acute and sub-acute <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis. When treatment was delayed 6 days after established infection, fluconazole was less active in clearing tissues in comparison with its activity in preventive and early treatment. The combination of amphotericin B plus flucytosine, however,was significantly more active than fluconazole in treatment of chronic <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis in all tissues. In summary, fluconazole was most effective against <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis in persistently granulocytopenic rabbits when used for prevention or early treatment. <b>Disseminated</b> candidiasis {{is the most common}} systemic fun...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of extrapulmonary and <b>disseminated</b> tuberculosis (TB) cases is increasing worldwide, and this growth significantly impacts TB-related morbidity and mortality. Little {{is known about}} the host risk factors for extrapulmonary and <b>disseminated</b> TB. In this study, we examined those risk factors. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all TB cases admitted to Sultan Qaboos University Hospital from 2006 to 2015. We compared extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) cases with pulmonary and <b>disseminated</b> TB cases. We evaluated the risk factors associated with the development of extrapulmonary and <b>disseminated</b> TB using logistic regression analysis. Results: We reviewed 260 TB cases, of which EPTB comprised 37 %, PTB comprised 53 %, and <b>disseminated</b> TB comprised 10 %. The most common sites of infection in the EPTB group were the lymph nodes and the abdomen. <b>Disseminated</b> TB and TB meningitis were more common in expatriates than in Omanis. Patients with EPTB were less likely to smoke compared to a patient with PTB. Patients with <b>disseminated</b> TB had a higher mortality when compared to patients with EPTB (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0. 004; 95 % confidence intervals [CI]: 0. 001 – 0. 054;P = 0. 001) and PTB (adjusted OR, 0. 022; 95 % CI: 0. 004 – 0. 115;P = 0. 001). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was the main risk factor for patients with <b>disseminated</b> TB when compared to patients with extrapulmonary and PTB. Conclusion: The rates of extrapulmonary and <b>disseminated</b> TB in Oman are higher than what has been recognized. Expatriates, patients with HIV, and smokers are at high risk for <b>disseminated</b> TB. In these patients, suspected extrapulmonary sites should be evaluated and sampled to exclude <b>disseminated</b> TB...|$|R

5|$|Jan van Eyck's {{use of oil}} as {{a medium}} was a {{significant}} development, allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint. The 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint; a claim that, while exaggerated, indicates {{the extent to which}} van Eyck helped <b>disseminate</b> the technique. Van Eyck employed a new level of virtuosity, mainly from taking advantage of the fact that oil dries so slowly; this gave him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments, and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by both Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden. These three artists are considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters. Their influence was felt across northern Europe, from Bohemia and Poland in the east to Austria and Swabia in the south.|$|E
5|$|Much of the sunnah is {{recorded}} in the Hadith. Initially, Muhammad had instructed his followers not to write down his acts, so they may not confuse it with the Qur'an. However, he did ask his followers to <b>disseminate</b> his sayings orally. As {{long as he was}} alive, any doubtful record could be confirmed as true or false by simply asking him. His death, however, gave rise to confusion over Muhammad's conduct. Thus the Hadith were established. Due to problems of authenticity, the science of Hadith (Arabic: `Ulum al-hadith) is established. It is a method of textual criticism developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, and the individual narrators involved in its transmission. On the basis of these criteria, various Hadith classifications developed.|$|E

40|$|Candidiasis {{is defined}} as an {{infection}} or disease caused by a fungus of the genus Candida. Rate of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis increases {{with the growth of}} the number of immunocompromised patients. In the the last few decades the incidence of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis is in growth as well as the mortality rate. The aim of this survey is to show the importance of serological tests implemenation in <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis diagnose. This is a prospective study involving 60 patients with malign diseases with and without clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis and 30 healthy people who represent the control group. Apart from hemoculture, detection of circulating mannan antigen and adequate antibodies of Candida species applying comercial ELISA test was determined in each patient. This survey deals with relevant factors causing <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis. This survey showed that the group of patients with clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> canididiasis had more patients with positive hemoculture to Candida species, then the group of patients without clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis. The number of patients being examined and positive to antigens and antibodies was higher (p< 0. 01) in the group of patients with clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis (7 / 30; 23. 3 %), then in the group of patients without clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis (0 / 30; 0 %). Average value of titra antigen was statistically higher (p< 0. 001) in patients with Candida spp. positive hemocultures rather then in patients with Candida spp. negative hemocultures. In the group of patients with clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis 6 / 30 (20 %) of patients had Candida spp. positive hemocultures while in the group of patients without clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis 1 / 30 (3. 3 %) of patients had Candida spp. positive hemocultures, which was considerably higher (p< 0. 05). Correlation of results of hemoculture and mannan antigens and antibodies in patients with <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis were statistically significant, while correlation of results of hemoculture and antibodies was insignificant. Because of low sensitivity of hemoculture and time needed for isolation of Candida spp., introducing serological tests in regular procedures would speed <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis diagnose...|$|R

5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help <b>disseminate</b> spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment that is already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E
