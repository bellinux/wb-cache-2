This avoids the need to manage the revocation of the certificate in the ad hoc network. In the demo, the entity authentication solution is used by a buying/selling application defined in [2][3] that permits users, in ad hoc networks, to buy or/and sell digital multimedia resources anytime, anywhere and from anybody.

40|$|State {{securities}} laws—in particular, {{state laws}} requiring that securities offered by issuers be {{registered with the}} states—have been an impediment to the efficient movement of capital to its highest and best use. The pernicious effects of these laws—generally referred to as “blue sky laws”—have been felt most acutely by small businesses, a vital component of our national economy.

The Securities and Exchange Commission, on the other hand, has been reluctant to advocate for preemption and unwilling to exercise its delegated power to expand preemption by regulation. In recent years some progress has been made toward a more efficient regulation of capital formation, principally as a result of some congressional preemption of state registration authority. Nonetheless, state registration provisions continue to impede significantly businesses’—especially small businesses’—efficient access to external capital. Further gains in efficient regulation of capital formation can be achieved but require actions both by states and the federal government.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the national reports according EC Regulation 1452 / 2003 of the years 2004 and 2005, recording the number of authorisations permitted, the quantity of nonorganic seeds used and the main reasons for allowing derogation for each crop (species). The work was carried out as part of the “EEC 2092 / 91 (Organic) Revision” project (No. SSPE-CT- 2004 - 502397) within the EU 6 th Framework Programme. The main objective was to analyse national derogation reports with respect to total seed use of selected species/subspecies, and to analyse the feedback from expert interviews and meetings regarding the implementation of the new seed regulation, in order to provide recommendations for further improvement of the implementation of the organic seed regulation. The national annual organic seed reports 2004 and 2005 differ much in form and quality. The data show considerable differences in the offer of organic seeds and the use of non-organic seeds between the reporting states. Authorisations for the use of non-organic seeds or a general derogation mean a financial benefit for the respective farmers. Since the seed costs can not be neglected in calculating the whole sale product price, countries with high rates of non-organic seeds can take advantage of this situation on the European market. Harmonisation of the derogation policy on EU-level as well as on national level should therefore be of high importance for the authorities. To increase the use of organic seed we propose the following measures to be taken: Measures recommended on national level 1. Some national databases need technical improvement and more registered varieties to be a useful tool for organic farmers. International cooperation of the database managers should be enhanced. 2. A <b>registration</b> <b>duty</b> for farmers calling for a derogation of the acreage planted or the number of pot plants produced, in order to allow the evaluation of the acreage planted with non-organic seeds in the national organic seed reports. 3. Use of a standardised reporting scheme including a common species list, subtotals for crop groups (e. g. vegetables), species and subspecies to make reports comparable. Assembling of raw data versions according to a common template in order to allow a direct comparison in Pivot-tables. The reports should immediately be made publicly available, according to Art. 12 and 13 of the EC-Regulation 1452 / 2003. 4. Establishment at a national level of lists of equivalent varieties (useful for professional growers) for every subspecies (variety group) in order to facilitate the decision making of the control bodies and to make possible, that individual calls for derogation can be denied with respect to farmers needs. 5. Establish a fee system that balances the cost difference between organic and non-organic seed in order to avoid unfair competition. This money can be used to promote organic seed marketing, to support organic seed production and breeding projects as well as to reduce the price of organic seeds. 6. Introduction of national Annexes as preliminary stage to come to a common European one (Annex 1) with respect to the national organic seed offer. Making the organic seed use compulsory would give security for the seed companies to increase the organic seed production. 7. In order to grant fair conditions among EU producers, common Annexes with neighbour countries or countries with similar production systems and markets (especially export markets) should be favoured. Annexes on national or bilateral/regional level seem to be more realistic, than a common European Annex 1. The number of species/subspecies listed in the national Annex 1 has to increase annually. Measures recommended on EU-Commission level 1. In order to harmonize organic seed availability among EU Member States and facilitate seed companies in supplying their seeds wherever requested, it should be possible for all seed companies to enter the National database of all Members States where they have a local distributor. 2. To allow well supplied subspecies according to cultivation and use (crop types, variety groups, e. g. cherry tomatoes) to be listed on the Annex 1 instead of whole botanical species. In cases of unforeseen shortage of organic seed, national authorities should get the right to allow individual derogations according Article 5. 1 of the EC-Regulation 1452 / 2003. 3. Including the use of non-organic basic seed as reason in Article 5 (1) for derogation for Annex 1 species, to get more complete data in the seed reports, (in addition to already mentioned exemptions for conservation varieties and variety trials). 4.

Studies were undertook on the experimental facility, consists of registrating measuring cell, constructed from flat inductors system, formed in oscillatory circuit, herewith investigated biological tissue {{is the part of}} this oscillatory circuit. An excitation of oscillatory circuit fulfilled by means of exciter inductor which forms impulse complex modulated electromagnetic field (ICM EMF). The measurement process and visualizations provided by set of certificated instruments: a digital oscillograph AKTAKOM ADS- 2221 MV, a digital generator АКТАКОМ AWG- 4150 (both with software) and a gauge RLC E 7 - 22. Comparative dynamic studies of fixed volume and weight pig’s blood, adipose tissue, muscular tissue impedance were conducted by contact versus contactless methods. Contactless method in contrast to contact method gives opportunity to obtain the real morphological visualization of biological tissue irrespective of their nature. Results. Comparison of contact and contactless methods of impedance measurement shows that the inductance to capacitance ratio X(L) / X(C) was equal: 17 – for muscular tissue, 4 – for blood, 1 – for adipose tissue. It demonstrates the technical correspondence of both impedance registration methods.

40|$|International audienceDistance {{sampling}} (DS) and territory mapping (TM) are globally applied bird survey techniques. However, {{specifically designed}} studies comparing results of both methods in different habitats {{in the framework}} of a scientific experiment have rarely been conducted. To provide a more generalized guidance for the field surveyor, here we evaluated estimates of bird abundances and number of bird species in four different habitats (broad-leaved forest, coniferous forest, open woodland and farmland) in central Germany. Abundances were estimated in parallel by TM and DS in 2006 and 2008, following standard protocols. Detection probability differed significantly among habitats and species. Density estimates by DS were in total 24 % lower than those estimated by standardized TM. While the number of bird species detected with both methods was approximately the same, the estimated abundances of 15 bird species showed significant differences. Increasing the number from two to four and five registrations to count a territory by using TM decreased the density on average about 28 and 42 %, respectively. Using standardized TM resulted in an overestimation of abundances of species showing a high detection probability. In contrast, DS estimated very high densities for species that had a very low detection probability. In fact, a highly negative correlation was found between the density estimated by DS and the detection probability. Using standardized TM and setting a <b>fixed</b> number of <b>registrations</b> before a location qualifies for a bird territory cannot compensate for the large differences in species detectability. Instead, the number of registrations required to count a territory should be adjusted to differences in detection probabilities and seasonal activity. From our results we can recommend a mean of four registrations if eight visits were conducted to count a territory. However, the lack of any statistically-based quality assessment reduces the serious usability of TM for estimating densities for science-based management application, whereas, the clear advantage of DS is that it provides error estimates and considers differences in species detectability...|$|R

40|$|Background: Tanzania {{like many}} other {{developing}} countries is facing challenges in finding proper mechanism of health care financing that would ensure equitable {{access to health care}} for all her citizens especially those employed in non-formal sector. The government of Tanzania has initiated a number of prepayment schemes as an effort to provide health care financial protection for its citizen. Community Health Fund (CHF) is one of the schemes aimed for rural population. CHF have proved to provide well functioning health care financial protection to its members. However, its enrolment level in all districts has remained unexpectedly very low. Objectives: The main objective {{of this study was to}} identify household and health facility related factors that contribute to low enrolment to CHF scheme in Rombo District. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study which employed mixed methods of data collection. Both qualitative and quantitative data were concurrently collected. The study involved four samples: 144 household heads; 150 exit patients; 36 health staff and 3 CHF district officials. The four samples were included in order to obtain enough triangulation of information. Data from each method were analysed separately; Quantitative data ware entered and analysed in the SPSS computer program where descriptive statistics were derived; Qualitative data were analysed by generating themes according to the study objectives with the aid of ATLAS. ti 6 computer program. The generated themes were embedded in to the quantitative results to enrich where it fits. Results: Health staffs' practices were highly accepted by exit patients; also health staff had positive opinions on CHF usefulness. These were potential optimistic findings that were expected to attract more community members to join the scheme.
