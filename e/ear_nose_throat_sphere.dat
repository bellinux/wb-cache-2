40|$|Background: Chronic Otitis Media (COM) is {{a chronic}} {{infection}} (more than 3 months) of half or entire middle ear cleft mucoperiosteum within prolonged tympanic membrane perforation and {{with or without}} history of otorrhea. COM defined as active if a discharge found during an examination. Like the other otitis media, COM has a potential to become complicated. The most frequent complication is mastoiditis. Mastoiditis is a bone inflammation (osteitis) of antrum wall and cellulae mastoid. Diagnosis of Mastoiditis is based on <b>Ear</b> <b>Nose</b> <b>Throat</b> clinical examination and Radiologic examination. The purpose {{of this research is}} to compare between Radiologic examination result on active COM patients and its <b>Ear</b> <b>Nose</b> <b>Throat</b> clinical examination result. Methods: An observational analytic study with cross sectional approach, using 30 COM patients who fulfilled clinical criteria as a sample. Sample was taken from copying the medical record at Bagian Rekam Medik Instalasi Rawat Jalan RSUP Dr. Kariadi Semarang. The research was conducted from March until June 2008. The data was analyzed using Kappa statistic test to measure the agreement between two nominal variables (radiologic examination result and <b>Ear</b> <b>Nose</b> <b>Throat</b> clinical examination result). Result: According to Kappa statistic test analysis, the score of <b>Ear</b> <b>Nose</b> <b>Throat</b> clinical examination result and the Radiologic examination result produced value of 0. 039. Conclusion: <b>Ear</b> <b>Nose</b> <b>Throat</b> clinical examination result and Radiologic examination result on COM patients with or without mastoiditis had a bad agreement value.

40|$|Introduction This study {{investigated}} utilization of antibacterial agents at the <b>Ear,</b> <b>Nose</b> and <b>Throat</b> Department of the Outpatient Service of the Health Center Novi Sad - Liman {{and at the}} <b>Ear,</b> <b>Nose</b> and <b>Throat</b> Clinic of the Clinical Center Novi Sad, in the period February - March 2001. Material and methods All antibacterial agents were classified as group J, regarding Anatomic-Therapeutic-Chemical Classification. Data on drug utilization were presented in Defined Daily Doses (DDD). Patients who were under observation were all treated with antibiotics. Results In regard to prescribed treatment in the <b>Ear,</b> <b>Nose</b> and <b>Throat</b> Department of the Outpatient Service of the Health Center Novi Sad - Liman, most outpatients were treated with macrolide antibiotics - in 26. 21 %; combination of penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitors in 20. 83 % and pyranosides in 16. 12 %. At the <b>Ear,</b> <b>Nose</b> and <b>Throat</b> Clinic of the Clinical Center Novi Sad, macrolides and lincosamines were most frequently used - in 20. 46 %; cephalosporins in 19. 87 % and penicillins susceptible to beta-lactamase in 18. 85 %. It is extremely positive and in agreement with current pharmacotherapeutic principles that in both institutions peroral ampicillins have not been prescribed. Aminoglycosides have been prescribed in less than 1 % of patients of the <b>Ear,</b> <b>Nose</b> and <b>Throat</b> Department of the Outpatient Service of the Health Center Novi Sad - Liman, whereas they were much more frequently prescribed at the <b>Ear,</b> <b>Nose</b> and <b>Throat</b> Clinic of the Clinical Center Novi Sad - in 11. 25 %. Although {{there is a positive}} postantibiotic effect in regard to these antibiotics and it is recommended to use them once a day, in both examined institutions aminoglycosides were given twice a day. In regard to bacterial identification it was done in 80. 76 % of patients of the <b>Ear,</b> <b>Nose</b> and <b>Throat</b> Department of the Outpatient Service of the Health Center Novi Sad - Liman, while in the <b>Ear,</b> <b>Nose</b> and <b>Throat</b> Clinic of the Clinical Center Novi Sad it was done only in 32. 42 %. Conclusions Although treatment performed on empirical basis and clinical findings is usually correct, a greater percentage of antibiotic prescriptions should be confirmed by antibiograms providing optimal therapy and decreased degree of resistance...|$|R
