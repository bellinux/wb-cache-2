2500|$|The salvage team removed {{fuel from}} the ship by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} hull and pumping the fuel out. The process, known as [...] "hot tapping", was expected to take up to a week. A boom was placed around the ship, and <b>defuelling</b> commenced. 18 tonnes of fuel was removed on 11 February and 29 tonnes on 12 February. Temporary repairs were made to the hull in preparation for refloating. Sightseers continued to breach the exclusion zone, including two jet skiers who approached the ship from the sea. The refloating of the ship was scheduled to take place in the week commencing 18 February. Large crowds were expected to witness the event, which would have coincided with the half-term holiday. It was later estimated that the ship would not be refloated for at least another two weeks. All fuel was removed from the tanks, and work was done to ensure the hull was watertight and to reduce the list. Over the weekend of 23–24 February, the ship settled further onto its side, listing at 85 degrees. Officials had to prevent people from trying to board the ship. It was revealed that the operation to refloat the vessel could take weeks, although speculation that she would be cut up on site was refuted by Smit International, who said they needed only [...] of water to refloat the ship.

50|$|Russian Shipyard Number 10 (Shkval) {{is located}} in Polyarny, and in the West is more often {{referred}} to {{by the name of}} the town than by its official name. As the first nuclear-powered submarines were delivered to the Northern Fleet {{at the end of the}} 1950s, the yard was modified for docking and repair of these vessels. As Soviet (and now Russian) naval nuclear vessels are decommissioned, they are laid up at Polyarny to await <b>defuelling</b> and disposal.|$|E
50|$|Decommissioning {{options for}} a retired nuclear plant may be chosen based on {{availability}} of decommissioning funds, operation of other reactors {{at the same}} site, or availability of waste disposal facilities. In 2004, 11 reactors were planned for DECON and 9 for SAFSTOR. In 2008, 14 shutdown commercial power reactors were planned for or had completed DECON, 11 were in SAFSTOR, 3 were in ENTOMB and Three Mile Island unit 2 was <b>defuelled</b> and will be decontaminated when Unit 1 ceases operation.|$|R
50|$|The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is {{responsible}} for the decommissioning of the UK Magnox power plants, at an estimated cost of £12.6 billion. There is currently debate about whether a 25 or 100 year decommissioning strategy should be adopted. After 80 years short-lifetime radioactive material in the <b>defuelled</b> core would have decayed to the point that human access to the reactor structure would be possible, easing dismantling work. A shorter decommissioning strategy would require a fully robotic core dismantling technique.|$|R
5000|$|The 60 MWt WR-1 was {{designed}} and built by Canadian General Electric, and first achieved criticality on November 1, 1965. [...] The reactor was built {{at a cost of}} $14.5 Million CDN. The original purpose of the unit was as a test reactor for a proposed organic-cooled CANDU power reactor. When that program ceased in 1972, WR-1 was used for irradiation, experimentation and heating the WNRE site. WR-1 was shut down for the last time in 1985, was <b>defuelled,</b> and is now undergoing decommissioning.|$|R
50|$|The wharf can {{accommodate}} six vessels, berthed three abreast. Services such as fuel, electrical power, compressed air, sewerage out, oily waste suction, and <b>defuelling</b> {{is available at}} the berthing points. The facility has the capability to dock a vessel with a draught of up to 2 m at any tide, is capable of lifting or lowering a vessel up to 750 t at a rate of 420 mm per minute, and is designed to withstand cyclones.|$|E
50|$|In mid-May 2009 a {{heavy water}} leak {{at the base}} of the reactor vessel was {{detected}} prompting a temporary shutdown of the reactor. The leak was estimated to be 5 kg (<5 litres) per hour and determined to be due to corrosion. This was the second heavy water leak since late 2008. The reactor was defuelled and drained of all of its heavy water moderator. No administrative levels of radioactivity were exceeded, during the leak or <b>defuelling,</b> and all leaked water was contained and treated on site.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operation}} (from June 2013 onwards) was delineated by Costa's Cristiano De Musso, Head of Corporate Communications, {{according to}} the following plan:* Site inspections {{of the ship and}} its position;* Securing of the wreck to ensure on-going safety and stability;* Installation of sponsons on port side of vessel and construction of submarine platforms;* Parbuckling of the wreck, rotating it past a critical angle of about 24° from its resting position, beyond which the sponsons would be flooded and the ship would roll into a fully upright position on the underwater platforms;* Installation of sponsons on the starboard side of the ship;* Sponsons are dewatered to raise the ship from the bottom;* Ship delivered to an Italian port for processing according to regulations;* Cleaning and replanting of marine flora. By 20 February 2012, the tanks in the forward part of the ship, which had held about two-thirds of the fuel, had been emptied, but the following day <b>defuelling</b> was suspended because of poor weather conditions. On 3 March 2012, salvage workers cut a hole in the ship for access to the engine room, the location of the remaining fuel. On the morning of 12 March, <b>defuelling</b> operations resumed and were completed on 24 March.|$|E
50|$|This {{prototype}} {{nuclear reactor}} was constructed for the United States Department of Energy's Office of Naval Reactors {{as part of}} the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. The reactor was built by General Electric and operated by the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory at the Kesselring Site Operation in West Milton, New York. It was used for testing components and as a training tool for the Nuclear Power Training Unit. The reactor operated from 1962 to 1996, when it was shut down in March of that year. It was later <b>defuelled,</b> with the pressure vessel eventually removed in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|... 2007 - A bulk carrier, the , ran aground {{south of}} Europa Point in Gibraltar and broke {{up on the}} reef in August 2007, {{generating}} accusations of pollution in Spain and claims not only against the Government of Gibraltar but also against that of Spain. Its cargo was scrap metal and the vessel's fuel was promptly drained. The Government of Gibraltar claimed in December 2007 that the operation did not represent a material risk to the environment since the vessel had been <b>defuelled</b> and only small, remnant amounts of fuel remained in the engines themselves. The Spanish branch of Greenpeace claimed that, as late as February 2008, fuel spills from the New Flame had polluted Spanish beaches around the Bay of Gibraltar. Official Spanish sources played this down stating that the fuel reaching the beaches of Algeciras was in [...] "insignificant amounts".|$|R
50|$|In 1981, 14 former BA Super VC10s were {{purchased}} and stored for spare parts. In the early 1990s, {{to help the}} VC10 fleet replace the recently retired Handley Page Victor tankers, five of the stored aircraft were converted to VC10 K4 tankers. Shortly after entering service, extensive wing plank corrosion was discovered on the lower wing surfaces; this was attributed mainly to the storage method used prior to conversion, the wing tanks had been <b>defuelled</b> and filled with water as ballast. Extensive wing plank corrosion rectification work, including plank replacement, often took place during major services. The K4 conversions, as with the K2, lacked forward freight doors, thus {{it was decided that}} there would be no internal refuelling tanks fitted. The K4 has identical refuelling equipment to the K2 and K3, but lacks the extra fuselage fuel tanks and retains the same fuel capacity as a Super VC10.|$|R

5000|$|With <b>defuelling</b> complete, {{removal of}} the wreck began. On 3 February, Franco Gabrielli, {{the head of the}} Civil Protection Authority, told a meeting of {{residents}} of Giglio that the ship would be [...] "refloated and removed whole" [...] and not cut up for scrap on site. The CEO of Costa stated that after the breaches in the hull were sealed, the ship could be refloated, with difficulty, by giant inflatable buoys and then towed away. The company invited ten firms to bid for the contract to salvage the ship. Six bids were submitted in early March and the proposed removal plans were assessed jointly with the Civil Protection Scientific Committee. The salvage operation was expected to commence in the middle of May. [...] The operation, one of the largest ever ventured, was predicted to take from seven to ten months, depending on weather and sea conditions.|$|E
5000|$|All {{operations}} {{planned for}} the wreck, including <b>defuelling,</b> were conducted jointly by Costa Cruises and the Concordia Emergency Commissioner's Office. On 12 February 2012, after weeks of weather delays, Dutch salvage firm Smit Internationale, acting jointly with Italian company NERI SpA, started removing the vessel's 2,380 tonnes of heavy fuel oil. The 15 tanks that contained about 84% of the fuel in the vessel were emptied first and expected to take about 28 days. The second phase involved the engine room, which had [...] "nearly 350 cubic metres of diesel, fuel and other lubricants". The offloading process required fixing valves to the underwater fuel tanks, one on top, one on the bottom. Hoses were then attached to the valves and as the oil, warmed to make it less viscous, was pumped out of the upper hose and into a nearby ship, replacing it with sea water pumped in through the lower hose to fill the space, {{so as not to}} affect the ship's balance, a technique known as [...] "hot-tapping".|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The UK {{nuclear power}} {{industry}} is predominantly based on gas-cooled, graphite moderated reactors with their being 20 operating and 6 shutdown Magnox reactors. The radioactive graphite {{issues associated with}} the Magnox reactors relate mainly to the reactor core graphite but, at two of the stations, there is also another graphite waste stream which results from the handling of their particular design of fuel elements which incorporate graphite fittings. The decommissioning plan for the Magnox reactors is to apply the Safestore strategy in which the <b>defuelled</b> reactors will be maintained in a quiescent state, e. g. to gain benefit from radioactive decay, with their dismantling being deferred {{for a period of}} time. In preparing for and developing the decommissioning strategy detailed studies have been undertaken on all relevant aspects. These have resulted in, for example, extensive information on the graphite radioactive inventories, the condition of the graphite throughout the quiescent deferral period, safety assessment, and, dismantling, waste management and disposal plans. Significant work has also been undertaken on the management of the graphite fuel element debris that has accumulated at the two stations. For example, work is well advanced at one of the stations to install equipment to retrieve this waste and package it in a form suitable for eventual deep geological disposal. 1...|$|R
5000|$|On 20 July 2006 the NDA {{announced}} that the station would be shut down in 2010 to enable the closure and decommissioning of the Magnox spent fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield. Springfields Fuels Limited ended production of Magnox fuel elements in 2008 due to these plans. [...] However, in 2010 the NDA announced an extension to 2012, beyond Wylfa's 40th anniversary as a generating power station in January 2011, due to schedule slippage at Sellafield which would allow Wylfa additional time before final <b>defuelling.</b> [...] At this time, a strategy was also devised to maximise the generation from the remaining fuel stock given that new fuel {{could no longer be}} manufactured. This required a change in the distribution of fuel within the reactors, as well as the closure of Reactor 2 in 2012 to allow this fuel to be transferred into Reactor 1. [...] Reactor 2 ceased generating on 25 April 2012 at 19:02 BST, allowing Reactor 1 to continue to operate. A license extension to operate Reactor 1 until 31 December 2015 was granted in September 2014.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} flood extent maps have been {{generated}} {{to assess the}} long-term vulnerability of selected Magnox sites (Oldbury-on-Severn, Berkeley and Wylfa) to flooding. These flood extent maps have been computed using the LISFLOOD-FP inundation model. Additional boundary conditions to include wave overtopping rates from extreme waves at Wylfa have been provided by the SWAB wave model. Each flood extent map is based upon a combination of increasing mean sea level (0. 0 m to 1. 0 m in 0. 1 m increments) and extreme water levels (1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 5, 1 : 10, 1 : 20, 1 : 25, 1 : 50, 1 : 75, 1 : 100, 1 : 150, 1 : 200, 1 : 250, 1 : 300, 1 : 500, 1 : 1000 and 1 : 10000 years) due to combined tide and surge, and extreme waves heights (Wylfa only). When used individually, and within the ARCoES Decision-Support System, these maps provide additional detail to support of Magnox’s long-term resilience planning for the <b>defuelling,</b> decommissioning and management of these nuclear power stations...|$|E
40|$|Since 1953, {{hundreds}} of nuclear-powered submarines (NPS) {{have been produced}} all over the world. Nowadays, about 160 nuclear submarines are in operation. In particular, USSR (then Russia) built 248 NPS between in the last 50 years. Most of them are now not operating anymore and have been dismantled only partially. Nowadays, Russia and USA have 75 and 52 operating NPS, while UK has 16, France has 10, and China has 6. Naval reactors have been in most cases pressurised water types, which differ from commercial reactors producing electricity (PWR) in that: - they deliver {{a lot of power}} from a very small volume and therefore run on highly-enriched uranium (> 20 % U- 235, originally 93 % but apparently now 20 - 25 % in western vessels, and up to 45 % in later Russian ones). This nuclear material has also proliferation problems. - the fuel is not UO 2 but a U-Zr or U-Al alloy or a metal-ceramic. - they have long core lives, so that refuelling is needed only after 10 or more years, and new cores are designed to last 50 years in carriers and 30 - 40 years in submarines Decommissioning nuclear-powered submarines has become a major task for US and Russian navies. After <b>defuelling,</b> normal practice is to cut the reactor section from the vessel for disposal in shallow land burial as low-level waste. In Russia the whole vessels, or the sealed reactor sections, sometimes remain stored afloat indefinitely. Environmental consequences of such procedures may be very dangerous. Incidents and emergencies in atomic submarine fleet of USSR / RUSSIA have been many during their 50 years operational period of NPS: twelve nuclear and more 100 radiation emergencies have taken place. A nuclear emergency is such kind of emergency that concerns with the damage of fuel elements exceeding the established limits of safe operation, and/or irradiation of staff exceeding the permissible level for normal operation, caused by violation of control and managing of a chain nuclear reaction of fission in the reactor core, creation of a critical mass during reload, transportation and storage of fuel elements, or violation of heat elimination from fuel elements. Most of the emergencies were accompanied by serious radiological and ecological consequences. A relatively frequent event is the release of radioactive pollutants to the marine environment. In the Mediterranean sea, the effects of environmental marine pollution due to the presence of nuclear submarines has been recently studied. In particular, the most recent studies originated from the accident to the nuclear submarine "Hartford" that took place in 2003 close to the "La Maddalena" submarines base in Sardinia island (Italy). However it is not demonstrated that environmental release took place during the accident, findings about the presence of plutonium traces in certain types of algae close to the site have put into evidence the presence of artificial radioactive pollutants in that marine environment, a natural area of great ecological importance, designated by the Italian government as a natural marine park...|$|E
