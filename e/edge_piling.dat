Leningrad scientific school, where {{the formation of}} pile bearing capacity use {{as the basis of}} the thixotropic clay soils hardening and radial soil pressing around the pile shaft during the piles driving with pile-driving equipment for the exploitation period. 2. Odessa scientific school, in which the uplift soil formation from the <b>edge</b> <b>pile</b> use as the basis of the pile bearing capacity during the piles driving, the formation of the pressed zones (platform) in the <b>piles</b> <b>edge</b> plane, the gap formation around the pile shaft during its diving by ground pushed moving with the <b>pile</b> <b>edge.</b> 3. Preconditions of the pile bearing capacity formation of the pile by the thixotropic soil hardening in time and the radial soil pressing around the pile shaft can not give an answer to the following questions: 1) Why during the pile driving is formed the gap around the trunk of dived piles, when by condition there is a radial soil hardening around the trunk? 2) Why in the interpiled space is formed the lune (deflection), not the soil mass swelling (due to the radial hardening) ? 3) By what is formed the calculated soil resistance under the lower end (<b>edge)</b> of the <b>pile?</b> which is about 10 times higher than the calculated soil resistance in the edge plane, according to the Building Code V. 2. 1 - 10. 2009 ?

30|$|With {{the cutting}} {{direction}} of { 110 }< 001 >, {{as shown in}} Fig.  5 a, the shearing plane where displacement vectors of atoms change abruptly is TB on the { 111 } plane. It expands beneath the cutting edge and segments by Shockley partial dislocations into two or more parts. During the cutting process, the Shockley partial dislocations move along the TB and making the segmented TB move forward. Beneath the tool edge, a triangular shearing zone ABC bounded by the tool edge profile, TB, ISF, and shearing boundary changes the displacement vector of atoms under the tool edge as shown in Fig.  5 b. Stagnation region forms above the triangular zone, and stacking fault boundary expands {{at the tip of}} the stagnation region causing the second shearing of atoms on the boundary. At the cutting direction of { 110 }< 001 >, the primary shearing plane is the TB and the shearing angle is about 35 ° which is the included angle between the { 111 } plane and cutting direction. Due to the TB that does not start from the tip of the stagnation region and has several nanometer distances to the tool edge, the material in front of the cutting <b>edge</b> is <b>pile</b> up by the shearing at TB. Then, they separate at the stagnation region. Therefore, thicker materials are removed compared to the uncut chip thickness.|$|R

The {{composite}} foundation with sparse piles {{to control}} settlement {{has been used}} to rapid construction and strict deformation of the structure widely currently, which can enhance the efficient of load transfer and decrease the differential settlement used with the geosynthetic. Considering the confine of analytical solution and the traditional method with a changeless modulus of geosynthetic and pile, the effects of the height of fill, the elastic modulus of geosynthetic and pile material on the differential settlement, embankment soil arching effect and tensioned membrane effect etc. are investigated using the computer code ABAQUS in this paper. The results indicate that the modulus of geosynthetic and pile has a notable influence on the differential settlement and the arching effect, which should be considered in the design.

50|$|Crannogs took on many {{different}} forms {{and methods of}} construction based on what was available in the immediate landscape. The classic image of a prehistoric crannog stems from both post-medieval illustrations and highly influential excavations such as Milton Loch in Scotland by C.M. Piggot after World War II. The Milton Loch interpretation is of a small islet surrounded or defined at its <b>edges</b> by timber <b>piles</b> and a gangway, topped by a typical Iron Age roundhouse. The choice of a small islet as a home may seem odd today, yet waterways were the main channels for both communication and travel until the 19th century in much of Ireland and especially Highland Scotland. Crannogs are traditionally interpreted as simple prehistorical farmsteads. They are also interpreted as boltholes in times of danger, as status symbols with limited access and as inherited locations of power that imply a sense of legitimacy and ancestry towards ownership of the surrounding landscape.|$|R

The analysis results show that the maximum value of displacement will not occur at the <b>edge</b> of the <b>pile</b> and the assumption that pile cross section remains unchanged is no longer applicable, if the value of one dimensionless quantity, reflecting the angular frequency of the rotation, radius, and material properties of the pile, is larger than 1. 84.

40|$|Wind-felled Norway spruce trees {{left for}} {{conservation}} purposes and spruce stems stored as forest fuel may be colonised by the bark beetles Ips typographus and Pityogenes chalcographus (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). The risk of nearby living trees being attacked {{and killed by}} these species was experimentally investigated at stand edges bordering fresh clearcuts. Attack by I. typographus was studied at edges of mature spruce with one, five or no cut trees. Attack by P. chalcographus was studied within plots on edges of young spruce. The plots contained piles of cut young trees, or no piles. Number of trees killed by I. typographus did not differ between edges with and without cut trees, or between edges with one and five cut trees. Tree-killing was more frequent close (< 20 m) to felled trees than elsewhere on the edges, suggesting that felled trees provide focal points for attacks within <b>edges.</b> The <b>piles</b> increased the risk of P. chalcographus attack, but almost no attacked tree was killed. Attacks were associated with pile colonisation, whereas emergence by the new generation beetles did not {{increase the risk of}} attack. Previous studies have shown a high reproductive success of I. typographus in felled trees after storms and a low success in standing trees killed during outbreaks. Here, the success was compared in pairs of colonised cut trees and standing killed trees at a time with no outbreak and relatively few felled trees available in the landscape. The success in killed standing trees was (a) significantly higher than in cut trees, and (b) high enough to suggest that killed standing trees can contribute substantially to the area-wide production of beetles. The ability of P. chalcographus to kill trees and reproduce in them has previously been little studied. Here, attacks on living trees were induced by baiting trees with pheromone dispensers. The tree-killing ability was low. Reproductive success in killed trees was generally low, but was significantly higher in trees also attacked by I. typographus...|$|R

Persistence of moderate and higher soil water repellency was greatest below large-wood piles, and increased beneath all pile types as the soil dried below about 7 % to 10 % SMC through the summer season. Water repellency and reduced soil porosity contributed to a considerable decline in water infiltration rate. Despite post-fire increases in repellency and decreases in surface water infiltration, runoff and subsurface flow concentrations of NO 3, PO 4, and SO 4 exhibited little change from the <b>pile</b> <b>edge</b> to 7 m downslope for the three pile types. It appeared that litter and plant cover surrounding the piles were important in taking up and filtering out nutrients as they moved downslope from the burn pile. In all cases, runoff and subsurface flow concentrations of NO 3 and PO 4 remained below EPA water quality standards for lakes and rivers.

40|$|Scour control {{downstream}} of hydraulic structures is {{an important}} topic in hydraulic engineering. Block ramps or rock chutes are often used to control scour downstream of hydraulic structures and have the peculiarity to be ecofriendly. Although these structures assure great energy dissipation, the rapid passage from supercritical to subcritical flow at the toe results in a scour hole with geometric parameters {{that have to be}} evaluated in order to avoid foundation problems. For this reason, the analysis of the scour process and the comprehension of the hydrodynamic mechanisms on which it is based are extremely important. In this paper, the results of systematic experimental tests are shown that analyze both the influence of the stilling basin tailwater depth and the ramp toe stabilizing structures, for both uniform and nonuniform channel bed materials. In fact, block ramps are generally stabilized by inserting piles or micropiles at the toe. The upper <b>edge</b> level of <b>piles</b> or micropiles was found a relevant parameter for the scour hole geometry. Simple novel relationships that account for tailwater depth, pile position, and bed material gradation are developed to evaluate the main lengths of the scour hole, in the case in which a free hydraulic jump in a mobile bed occurs. These simple relationships give engineers helpful instruments in block ramp design...|$|R
30|$|When {{the cutting}} {{direction}} is { 100 }< 001 >, no shearing plane is formed {{in front of}} the tool edge. For the UCT of 0.45 and 0.7  nm which is {{less than or equal to}} separation height, workpiece surface is firstly pressed down by the tool edge in elastic deformation. Then, the upper layer, usually the first layer, of the workpiece material is removed by the cutting tool in an extrusion way. The rest part of the materials flow to the flank face of the cutting tool experience the elastic-plastic deformation and form the machined surface. For the UCT of 0.95  nm which is larger than separation height, more materials are removed to form the chip. However, no shearing plane forms {{in front of the}} tool edge and the materials are still removed by extruding. Similar results obtain at cutting direction of { 100 }< 011 >{ 110 }< 1 - 10 > and { 111 } < 11 - 2 >. Minor difference in the cutting processes is that the cutting tool edge rubs on the workpiece material surface and almost no materials are removed, when the UCT is less than the separation height at these three cutting directions. In rubbing mechanism, the workpiece material experiences elastic-plastic deformation due to the interaction with the tool edge and flank face, which, to some extent, affects the generated surface. For the cutting direction of { 110 }< 001 > whose separation height is negative, the upper layer materials could be removed even the UCT is 0.1  nm. This is because the materials in front of the tool <b>edge</b> firstly <b>pile</b> up by shearing mechanism and then are extruded or secondly sheared by the cutting tool edge. The material could also be removed when the UCT is 0.25  nm for the cutting direction of { 111 }< 1 - 10 >, as shown in Fig.  13. Materials are extruded up at a distance of several nanometers away from the cutting tool edge. The distance of the materials starting to be extruded increases with the cutting distance.|$|R
