5|$|At higher altitudes {{the trees}} {{gradually}} thin out {{and there are}} alpine pastures. These pastures are rich in flowers in the late spring. The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, gentians, martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine plants <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots. About 1,500 plant species {{can be seen at}} Paradisia Pyromaniacle Garden near Cogne inside the park.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government. The {{plan called for}} major cleanup of the lower river {{in order to protect}} salmon from phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> some of these issues. Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> fill many open {{ecological}} niches since {{making their}} way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30g (1.1oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200kg (350–440lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other land}} animals that <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> {{life in a}} marine environment, sea snakes ingest {{considerably}} more salt than their terrestrial relatives through their diets, and when seawater is inadvertently swallowed. This meant they had to evolve a more effective means of regulating the salt concentration of their blood. In sea snakes, the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved {{to allow them to}} expel salt with their tongue action.|$|E
5|$|Most Hydrophiinae are {{completely}} aquatic and <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> their environments in many ways, the most characteristic {{of which is}} a paddle-like tail that has improved their swimming ability. To a varying degree, the bodies of many species are laterally compressed, especially in the pelagic species. This has often caused the ventral scales to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. Their lack of ventral scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, but as they live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|Most nuthatches {{breed in}} the {{temperate}} or montane woodlands of the Northern Hemisphere, although two species <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> rocky habitats in the warmer and drier regions of Eurasia. However, the greatest diversity is in Southern Asia, and {{similarities between the}} species have {{made it difficult to}} identify distinct species. All members of this genus nest in holes or crevices. Most species are non-migratory and live in their habitat year-round, although the North American red-breasted nuthatch migrates to warmer regions during the winter. A few nuthatch species have restricted ranges and face threats from deforestation.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{widespread}} groups of mammals, rodents {{can be found on}} every continent except Antarctica. They are the only terrestrial placental mammals to have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention. Humans have also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands (e.g., the Polynesian rat). Rodents <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> almost every terrestrial habitat, from cold tundra (where they can live under snow) to hot deserts.|$|E
5|$|The {{closely related}} simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) {{has evolved into}} many strains, classified by the natural host species. SIV strains of the African green monkey (SIVagm) and sooty mangabey (SIVsmm) {{are thought to have}} a long evolutionary history with their hosts. These hosts <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> the presence of the virus, which is present at high levels in the host's blood but evokes only a mild immune response, does not cause the development of simian AIDS, and does not undergo the extensive mutation and recombination typical of HIV infection in humans.|$|E
5|$|The genus, though, is very {{variable}} {{in terms of}} habitat. Individual sundew species <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> {{a wide variety of}} environments, including atypical habitats, such as rainforests, deserts (D. burmannii and D. indica), and even highly shaded environments (Queensland sundews). The temperate species, which form hibernacula in the winter, are examples of such adaptation to habitats; in general, sundews tend to inhabit warm climates, and are only moderately frost-resistant.|$|E

5|$|The island's {{vegetation}} consists exclusively of {{mosses and lichens}} which <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> {{the extreme}} Antarctic climate. The island has a very harsh climate with strong winds and freezing temperatures. The steady snowfall keeps vegetation to a minimum. The island is {{a breeding ground for}} a few seabirds, particularly southern fulmars, but also Wilson's storm petrels and Antarctic terns. Penguins, including Adélie and chinstrap penguins, visit the island infrequently. There are numerous seals, particularly crabeater seals, leopard seals and smaller numbers of southern elephant seals.|$|E
5|$|Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{is thought}} to <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> a mixed diet. Its diet {{consists}} of nectar, pollen, fruit, seeds, honeydew, and insects. It is arboreal, foraging primarily among the foliage and flowers of trees, shrubs, and mistletoes, less often on branches and tree trunk, and rarely on the ground. Yellow-faced honeyeaters feed on nectar around 40% of the time, and on insects around 60% of the time. The yellow-faced honeyeater feeds on insects by gleaning, and by sallying or catching insects in flight or probing in bark crevices. The insects eaten are primarily Diptera (flies, mosquitoes, maggots, gnats, and midges), beetles and spiders. A study of the pollen on the bills and foreheads of captured birds found that 70% carried pollen from silver banksia (Banksia marginata), 61% from heath-leaved banksia (Banksia ericifolia), and 22% carried pollen from other plants in the area including fern-leaved banksia (Banksia oblongifolia), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa) and green spider flower (Grevillea mucronulata).|$|E
5|$|In {{high-duty}} cycle echolocation, bats emit {{a continuous}} call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply tuned {{to a specific}} frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. They then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range {{by taking advantage of}} the Doppler shift of their motion in flight. The Doppler shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the Doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed. They <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.|$|E

5|$|Males within Palaeognathae (with the {{exception}} of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with {{the exception}} of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.|$|E
5|$|Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, {{including}} B.aemula, have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. A study of six wallum species, including B.aemula, found they <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> very low levels of phosphorus and are highly sensitive to increased levels of the element, leading to phosphorus toxicity. Some evidence suggests they are efficient at using potassium, and sensitive to calcium toxicity as well. A field study on North Stradbroke Island noted increased root growth in autumn (around April), but that overall root growth was more constant than other species looked at, possibly because its deeper roots had more regular access to groundwater.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, several {{woodpeckers}} {{are under}} threat as their habitats are destroyed. Being woodland birds, deforestation and clearance {{of land for}} agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically. Some species adapt to living in plantations and secondary growth, or to open countryside with forest remnants and scattered trees, but some do not. A few species have even flourished when they <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> man-made habitats. There are few conservation projects directed primarily at woodpeckers, but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved. The red-cockaded woodpecker {{has been the focus}} of much conservation effort in the southeastern United States, with artificial cavities being constructed in the longleaf pines they favour as nesting sites.|$|E

50|$|Their {{habitat is}} dense tangled scrub of forest edges, on or {{relatively}} near the coast. It <b>has</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> non-native bramble thickets and colonised suburban riparian woodland, though without any marked range expansion.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 {{the synagogue}} was awarded over £33,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund {{for a project}} showing how Reform Jews, some of who had fled from central Europe, <b>had</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> life in Wales.|$|R
5|$|The Klamath is {{the most}} {{important}} North American river south of the Columbia River for anadromous fish migration. Its salmon, steelhead and rainbow trout <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> unusually high water temperatures and acidity levels relative to other rivers in the Pacific Northwest. The numerous fish were a major source of food for Native Americans, who have inhabited the basin for at least 7,000years. The first Europeans to enter the Klamath River basin were fur trappers for the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1820s; they established the Siskiyou Trail along the Klamath and Trinity rivers into the Sacramento Valley. Within several decades of white settlement, native peoples were forced into reservations. During the latter days of the California Gold Rush, increasing numbers of miners began working the Klamath River and its tributaries, causing considerable harm to the environment. Conflict and introduced diseases left indigenous tribes with only 10% of their original population.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcap}} breeds {{in much of}} Europe, western Asia and northwestern Africa, and its preferred {{habitat is}} mature deciduous woodland. The male holds a territory when breeding, which is defended against garden warblers {{as well as other}} blackcaps. The nest is a neat cup, built low in brambles or scrub, and the clutch is typically 4–6 mainly buff eggs, which hatch in about 11days. The chicks fledge in 11–12days, but are cared for by both adults for some time after leaving the nest. The blackcap is a partial migrant; birds from the colder areas of its range winter in scrub or trees in northwestern Europe, around the Mediterranean and in tropical Africa. Some German birds <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> spending the winter in gardens in Great Britain and Ireland. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, but, {{for the rest of the}} year, blackcaps survive primarily on small fruit. Garden birds also eat bread, fat and peanuts in winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants and}} animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist {{plants and animals}}, {{some of which are}} rare species, <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is {{one of a series of}} flower-rich habitats, which Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|E
