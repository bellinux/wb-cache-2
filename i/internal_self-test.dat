INTRODUCTION Data Encryption based on asymmetric key exchange algorithms and symmetric block encryption {{has been used in}} data communications for many years. These systems usually consist of general purpose processor and some additional logic to speed up modular calculations. As the key generation for RSA [RSA 78] is complicated and time-consuming most hardware implementations use externally generated keys. This presents serious security problem connected with the possibility to access sensitive data. If the key generation, inversion and the key exchange field handling can be done in a single tamper-proof device, {{there is no need to}} enable user access to these procedur [...] ...|$|E
