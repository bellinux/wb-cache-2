500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> any member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours.... It was no accident that the Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That took a lot of hard work".|$|E

During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the Wood Nymphs Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, {{he wrote to his}} Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You know what a dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> about such things, all the people are mad with [...] Thalberg and [...] Strauss , and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June.

40|$|SpeechWeb {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} hyperlinked natural-language interfaces to applications which can be accessed through the Internet from speech browsers running on PCs. The applications contain hyperlinks which the browser uses to navigate SpeechWeb. The natural-language interfaces have been constructed as executable specifications of at-tribute grammars using a domain–specific programming lan-guage built for this purpose. The approach to natural-language processing is based on a new efficient com-positional semantics that accommodates arbitrarily-nested quantification and negation. The user-independent speech browser is grammar based, and novel techniques have been developed to improve recognition accuracy. SpeechWeb SpeechWeb currently {{consists of}} several hyperlinked appli-cations, including “solar man ” who can answer questions about the solar system, “Judy ” who knows some poems, and “Monty ” who claims to be a student at the University of Windsor in Ontario.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the world is disconnected. Most people don’t use a telephone more than rarely and hardly anyone uses the internet. If you believe in the importance that the developed nations place on Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), then there is a huge potential to improve standards of living worldwide by increasing their effective use. However, by studying activities aimed at increasing access to these technologies {{it can be seen that}} their impact is not always positive. There is thus a need for further research and debate on the positive and negative impacts of Information and Communication Technologies. This research and debate will hopefully lead to socially responsible programs for increasing the effective use of ICTs. Such programs have the potential to improve the standard of living for much of humanity. THE WORLD IS DISCONNECTED! We hear day after day about how Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are revolutionising the world, bringing the world together, and making it a better place.
