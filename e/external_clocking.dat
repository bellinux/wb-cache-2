Our approach is natural for nanophotonic implementations in which each qubit can be coupled to its own optical resonator, and our design for a memory cell based on the quantum bit-flip or phase-flip code requires only five qubit-cavities (three for the register and two for the controller) connected by wave-guides.

30|$|The FGM- 3 and FGM- 3 h sensors both produce TTL pulse streams with {{frequencies}} {{ranging from}} the 10 s to 100 s of kHz. We {{have found that the}} 8 -bit “PIC” series of microcontrollers from Microchip, Inc. are ideal high-speed pulse counters, because, unlike many similar microcontrollers, PIC microcontrollers allow <b>external</b> <b>clocking</b> of some of their internal 16 -bit registers, which can thus act as counters. The NPM uses twin PIC 18 F 252 microcontrollers (Microchip Technology Inc., 2006), each having two externally clocked 16 -bit counters. Because the output frequency of the magnetic sensors is sufficiently high to overflow the counters over the course of one second, frequency is measured by reading the stored counts added to the counter range multiplied by the number of timer overflows that occurred over the course of 1 second. The PIC counters return the resulting frequency measurement over a 9600 -baud TTL-level serial data stream, which is easily read by the control microcontroller. As each PIC is able to count two pulse streams, one of the PICs returns the frequencies of sensors X and Y, while the second PIC returns the frequency of sensor Z, leaving a spare channel.|$|E

40|$|This {{application}} note delivers {{a system that}} is designed to replace external voltage-controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO) circuits by utilizing functionality within each serial gigabit transceiver. Note: In this {{application note}}, transceiver refers to these types of transceivers: A common design requirement is to frequency or phase lock a transceiver output to an input source (known as loop, recovered, or slave timing). Traditionally, an <b>external</b> <b>clock</b> cleaning device or VCXO and PLL components are used to provide a high-quality clock reference for the transceiver, since FPGA logic-based clocks are generally too noisy. While effective, <b>external</b> <b>clock</b> components carry a power and cost penalty that is additive as each individual clock channel is generated. When using many channels or in low-cost systems, the cost can be signif icant. Additionally, adding many <b>external</b> <b>clock</b> sources provides more opportunity for crosstalk and interference at the board level. The system described in this application note provides a method to effectively replace these <b>external</b> <b>clock</b> components using a combination of unique Xilinx transceiver features in conjunction with a high-performance FPGA logic based digital PLL (DPLL).

40|$|The {{switching}} {{dynamics of}} a multiferroic nanomagnetic NAND gate with fan-in/fan-out is simulated by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation while neglecting thermal fluctuation effects. The gate and logic wires are implemented with dipole-coupled 2 -phase (magnetostrictive/piezoelectric) multiferroic {{elements that are}} clocked with electrostatic potentials of ~ 50 mV applied to the piezoelectric layer generating 10 MPa stress in the magnetostrictive layers for switching. We show that a pipeline bit throughput rate of ~ 0. 5 GHz is achievable with proper magnet layout and sinusoidal four-phase clocking. The gate operation is completed in 2 ns with a latency of 4 ns. The total (internal + external) energy dissipated for a single gate operation at this throughput rate {{is found to be}} only ~ 1000 kT in the gate and ~ 3000 kT in the 12 -magnet array comprising two input and two output wires for fan-in and fan-out. This makes it respectively 3 and 5 orders of magnitude more energy-efficient than complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor-transistor (CMOS) based and spin-transfer-torque-driven nanomagnet based NAND gates. Finally, we show that the dissipation in the <b>external</b> <b>clocking</b> circuit can always be reduced asymptotically to zero using increasingly slow adiabatic clocking, such as by designing the RC time constant to be 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the clocking period. However, the internal dissipation in the device must remain and cannot be eliminated if we want to perform fault-tolerant classical computing.

40|$|Abstract A {{combined}} {{hardware and}} software system for the debugging of FPGA designs is designed. It provides a powerful logic analyzer implemented as a fully parameterized VHDL description. The system can insert the analyzer into a user design without manual labor required from the user. All processing is done on the VHDL-level, facilitating vendor-independent, source-level hardware debugging. The system also allows multiple independent FPGA-systems to be debugged in a single framework. Logic signal analyzers are very essential instrument for digital circuit or board debugging. The existing market solutions offer several features, {{but the cost of}} such instruments is very high {{and most of the time}} we don’t need that much capable instruments. A low cost logic signal analyzer is implemented around the Spartan- 3 FPGA.

40|$|Electronics {{capable of}} {{operation}} under extreme temperatures are required {{in many of}} NASA space exploration missions. Aerospace and military applications, {{as well as some}} terrestrial industries constitute environments where electronic systems are anticipated to be exposed to extreme temperatures and wide-range thermal swings. Electronics that are able to withstand and operate efficiently in such harsh environments would simplify, if not eliminate, traditional thermal control elements and their associated structures for proper ambient operation. As a result, overall system mass would be reduced, design would be simplified, and reliability would be improved. Electronic parts that are built utilizing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology are known to offer better radiation-tolerance compared to their conventional silicon counterparts, provide faster switching, and consume less power. They also exhibit reduced leakage current and, thus, they are often tailored for high temperature operation. These attributes make SOI-based devices suitable for use in harsh environments where extreme temperatures and wide thermal swings are anticipated. A new operational amplifier, based on silicon-on-insulator technology and geared for high temperature well-logging applications, was recently introduced by Honeywell Corporation. This HTOP- 01 dual precision operational amplifier is a low power device, operates on a single supply, and has an internal oscillator and an <b>external</b> <b>clocking</b> option [1].

One area of current research in this field is on the solid-state Si:P-based quantum computer (QC). In this machine, each qubit requires an individually addressed fast control-pulse for non-adiabatic drive and measure operations. Additionally, it is increasingly becoming important to be able to interface nanoelectronics with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. In this work, I have designed and demonstrated full-custom mixed-mode and full-digital fast control-pulse generators fabricated in a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) CMOS commercial foundry process  a radio-frequency (RF) CMOS technology. These circuits are, fundamentally, fast monostable multivibrators. Initially, after the design specifications were decided upon, I characterized NFET and PFET devices and a n+-diffusion resistor from 500 nm and 250 nm commercial SOS-CMOS processes. Measuring their conductance curves at 300 300 K, 4. 2 2 K, and sub-K (30 30 mK base to 1000 1000 mK) showed that they function with desirable behaviour although exhibiting some deviations from their 300 300 K characteristics. The mixed-mode first generation control-pulse generator was demonstrated showing that it produced dwell-time adjustable pulses with 100 100 ps rise-times at 300 K, 4. 2 2 K, and sub-K with a power dissipation of 12 12 uW at 100 100 MHz.
