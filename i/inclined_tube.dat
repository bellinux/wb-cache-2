However, few studies are available on diabatic two-phase flows in <b>inclined</b> <b>tubes.</b> The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to review two-phase flow in <b>inclined</b> <b>tubes,</b> with specific reference to condensation.

The heat transfer coefficient can be increased or decreased depending on the experimental conditions, and especially the flow pattern. Under certain conditions, an inclination angle may exist, which leads to an optimum heat transfer coefficient.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} the role of noncondensable gases during condensation of steam inside <b>inclined</b> <b>tubes</b> is presented. In a condenser, noncondensable gases flowing with steam cause reduction of condenser performance and efficiency. Many researchers have investigated in-tube condensation for vertical heat exchangers, but very few works have been performed to study condensation in <b>inclined</b> <b>tubes</b> with noncondensable gases. In the paper, experiments dedicated to this situation are described, with reference to the following conditions: tube internal diameter: 12. 6 mm, 20 mm and 26. 8 mm; tube inclination: 7 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees and 45 degrees; inlet noncondensable gas mass fraction omega(in) = 2 %- 42 %; inlet mixture Reynolds number Re-m,Re-in = 5000 - 20000; local noncondensable gas mass fraction omega = 2 %- 70 %; local mixture Reynolds number Re-m = 400 - 21000; local condensate Reynolds number Re-l = 10 - 290; saturated steam at atmospheric pressure; and gravity controlled flow regime. A limited influence of the inclination angle on heat transfer coefficient has been observed. Correlations to evaluate the local heat transfer coefficient along <b>inclined</b> <b>tubes,</b> in a gravity controlled flow regime, have been developed and they are in good agreement with the experimental results.

40|$|KERENA is an {{innovative}} {{boiling water reactor}} concept equipped with several passive safety systems. For the experimental verification of performance of the systems and for codes validation, the Integral Test Stand Karlstein (INKA) was built in Karlstein, Germany. The emergency condenser (EC) system transfers heat from the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) to the core flooding pool in case of water level decrease in the RPV. EC is composed {{of a large number}} of slightly <b>inclined</b> <b>tubes.</b> During accident conditions, steam enters into the tubes and condenses due to the contact of the tubes with cold water at the secondary side. The condensed water flows then back to the RPV due to gravity. In this paper two approaches for modeling of condensation in slightly <b>inclined</b> <b>tubes</b> are compared and verified against experiments. The first approach is based on the flow regime map. Depending on the regime, heat transfer coefficient is calculated according to specific semi-empirical correlation. The second approach uses a general, fully-empirical correlation. The models are developed with utilization of the object-oriented Modelica language and the open-source OpenModelica environment. The results are compared with data obtained during a large scale integral test, simulating loss of coolant accident performed at Integral Test Stand Karlstein (INKA). The comparison shows a good agreement. Due to the modularity of models, both of them may be used in the future in systems incorporating condensation in horizontal or slightly <b>inclined</b> <b>tubes.</b> Depending on his preferences, the modeller may choose one-equation based approach or more sophisticated model composed of several exchangeable semi-empirical correlations...|$|R

The average solar energy {{reaching}} the earth in the tropical zone is about 1 kWh/m 2 giving approximately 5 to 10 kWh/m 2 per day. Increased utilization of solar energy in India would result in all around benefits, both in term of cleaner environment and monetary gain. The energy from the sun can be used for various purposes such as water heating, water distillation, refrigeration, drying, power generation etc. The present work deals with solar water heating system in particular. Performance of the solar collectors can be determined using the famous Hottel-Whillier-Bliss equation [1]. The analysis is simple for the forced convection situation, where the flow rate is artificially maintained constant to a desired value and the heat transfer coefficient can easily be predicted using the information available in the literature. However the natural convection situation {{it is very difficult to}} analyze as appropriate correlations for predicting the values of induced mass flow rate due to thermosiphon effect and the associated heat transfer coefficient are not available.

Experimental+ facilities were set up to test full-scale units of an <b>inclined</b> <b>tube</b> settler and a Discostrainer in an environment approximating that in the field. These units were tested for removal efficiencies of inorganic solids with sizes less than 100 ~ and influent concentrations of about 2000 mg/l.

Results indicated that the installation of an <b>inclined</b> <b>tube</b> settler improved the efficiency of a sedimentation. ta' 2 k by about 20 percent at the highest overflow rate tested of about 200 lpm/m (Sgpm/ft) for an average removal efficiency of about 60 percent. the <b>inclined</b> <b>tube</b> settler also reduced the sensivity of the overflow rate on the efficiency of sediment removal. Limited tests with alum added to the influent to increase flocculation indicated about a 6 percent improvement in removal efficiency. The Discostrainer was found to be extremely sensitive to influent solids concentration. thirty percent solids removal was the maximum attained for the tests conducted. Higher removal percentages may possibly be obtained by reducing the flow rate or influent concentration.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{experimental results}} for shell-side transfer coefficients and pressure drops across four different tube banks, using small-scale models, with yawed tubes, {{as found in}} many types of heat exchangers, boilers and nuclear reactors. The tube banks investigated have a staggered tube layout on a rotated square pitch, with a 1. 25 pitch-to-diameter ratio. The angle of attack was varied between 45 o and 90 o. An extensive range of Reynolds number, i. e. 0. 5. to 12, 600, covering so-called laminar, transition and turbulent flows, was investigated. A diffusion-controlled electrochemical mass transfer technique has been employed to measure mass transfer coefficients. The heat transfer coefficients may be then readily obtained from the mass transfer values by applying the well-established Chilton-Colburn analogy. The results for the normal tube bank, which forms the base case for the study on <b>inclined</b> <b>tube</b> banks, show close agreement with previous work.
