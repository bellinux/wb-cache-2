This film is a police drama based around the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Indigenous man in police custody.

The comte, the boy's great-grandfather, enrolled the boy in a program to train future Musketeers. Lafayette's mother and great-grandfather died, on 3 and 24 April 1770 respectively, leaving Lafayette an income of 25,000livres.

5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested {{that there may have}} been only a small amount of sewage released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2).

However, a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began hearing from witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man.

5|$|The Government may ask for {{the flag}} to be lowered to half-mast {{in the event of}} the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} person or for national mourning. No person is permitted to use the flag at any private funeral ceremony. However, the national flag can be draped on a coffin during a military or state funeral.

Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the death of any individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|E

5|$|As chief {{financial}} administrator, he bore {{the brunt of}} the chronicler's condemnations for extortion and efforts to increase royal revenues. Besides attempts to increase the efficiency of collection and the rate of taxation, Ranulf created new methods of raising money. One of his new measures in revenue collection came in 1094, when the fyrd, or English militia, was assembled to fight in Normandy against the king's brother Robert Curthose. When all the men had assembled, instead of sending them to Normandy, Ranulf dismissed them, after collecting the 10 shillings that each man had been given by their district for maintenance. Ranulf then spent the money on mercenaries. Ranulf also actively pressed lawsuits, including bringing suit against Anselm on the day of Anselm's consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury. Another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief, much like the relief due from vassals at the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> overlord, from the under-tenants of church lands when the church office changed hands. This attempt came at the death of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester in 1095, when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop, setting the amount of relief owed to the king. This attempt was not repeated, however.|$|E
5|$|From 1999 to 2001 a 40-year-old {{homemaker}} named Debbie Swenson perpetrated a ruse {{under the}} identity Kaycee Nicole, a 19-year-old woman in Kansas who shared {{the details of}} her battles with leukemia online. The Guardian newspaper reported that millions of Internet users read the fictional blog, as well as Swenson's own blog, in which she posed as Kaycee Nicole's mother, describing the trials of living with an intelligent and optimistic daughter who was dying. On May 16, 2001, Kaycee Nicole's <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aneurysm was announced, shocking her readers and causing them intense grief. Soon however, Swenson caused skepticism in online communities. Although many cards and gifts had been previously sent, she refused to accept more. People began to learn that no one named Kaycee Nicole lived in Kansas, had been enrolled in schools, or admitted to local hospitals, and no obituary had been printed. The photo representing the girl was found to be that of a basketball player from Gracemont, Oklahoma, who was alive. After repeated questioning, Swenson posted that she had woven the stories of three cancer patients to create the character of Kaycee Nicole, who had never existed.|$|E

5|$|Rajoelina faced {{significant}} {{challenges in}} {{his tenure as}} mayor. Upon taking office, he was confronted with redressing the city's treasury, which had accumulated 8.2 billion Malagasy Ariary (approximately 4.6 million U.S. dollars) in debts under previous mayors, including Ravalomanana himself. Beginning 4 January 2008, Ravalomanana ordered water cutoffs at public pumps and brownouts of Antananarivo's street lights run by the state utilities company Jirama, due to 3.3 million ariary of unpaid debts to Jirama by the City of Antananarivo. Rajoelina responded by condemning the move as political and proceeded to undertake an audit that identified and addressed long-standing procedural irregularities and issues of corruption within the city's administration. Following a series of crimes against members of Rajoelina's inner circle in 2008 that comprised the burgling of his cabinet director's car, the kidnapping and ransoming {{of one of his}} special advisers, and the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> assistant under mysterious circumstances, rumors spread that the Rajoelina administration was being deliberately intimidated by supporters of the president.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{source of}} an emperor's {{power and authority}} was the military. The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor (sacramentum). The <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emperor led to a crucial period of uncertainty and crisis. Most emperors indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or adopted heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive, much less to reign, without the allegiance and loyalty of the Praetorian Guard and of the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the donativum, a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the hypothetical docudrama <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> President (2006). While sharing <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> its sister Wall-to-Wall texts’ narrative and generic features, <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> President focuses more strongly {{on the war}} on terror. The paper {{examines the}} nature of this focus – {{the way in which the}} war on terror is treated aesthetically and ideologically by <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> President. Two sequences in particular are examined in detail: the opening parts of the docudrama, and its final 16 minutes. These sequences, along with other parts of the text, show that, ultimately, <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> President is a familiar and conservative text. After opening up <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> important questions regarding security, guilt and the politics <b>of</b> fear, <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> President chooses to make sense of these complex areas via trauma, memory and victimhood – in particular via the idea of the US veteran as <b>a</b> victim <b>of</b> war...|$|R
