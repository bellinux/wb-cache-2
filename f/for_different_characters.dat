Pre-processing stages includes removal of noise, binarization, re-scaling and finding the skeleton of an image. Skew correction is also used <b>for</b> segmenting the <b>different</b> <b>characters</b> in an image. In training stage we have used back propagation technique <b>for</b> recognizing <b>different</b> numeral <b>characters.</b> <b>Different</b> hidden layers are used while training to have better accuracy.
