5|$|The Church of Scientology depicts Hubbard in hagiographic {{terms and}} draws on his legacy as its {{ultimate}} source of doctrine and legitimacy. The Danish historian of religions Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that {{many aspects of}} the official version of Hubbard's early life parallel more conventional religious narratives, notably the life of Jesus. Many details of Hubbard's early life remain disputed; critics of Scientology cast doubt on whether he had the educational and personal background claimed by the Church. According to James R. Lewis and Olav Hammer, in Scientology, this hagiographic “construction of Hubbard as a religious ideal implies the construction of Scientology’s texts as humanity’s most important treasure and vice versa.” Religious tradition in Scientology is based on two <b>essential</b> <b>things,</b> Hubbard’s individuality and texts written by him.|$|E
25|$|There were motives {{behind the}} aristocratic {{officials}} and later scholar-officials' classifying of certain {{groups in the}} hierarchy and leaving others out. The scholar-officials placed farmers as the second most prestigious group because the aristocratic officials and scholar-officials were landholders themselves, much like farmers (the ones who weren't tenant farmers or serfs). Both farmers and artisans were placed on a higher tier than merchants because the two former groups produced crops and manufactured goods, <b>essential</b> <b>things</b> needed by the whole of society. The merchants were seen as merely talented at business and trading, and were often seen as greedy and even parasitic {{to the needs of}} all other groups.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, the Simpsons {{walk out}} of the church and notice that the Apocalypse has begun. While the other family members are left on earth, Lisa at first starts {{ascending}} into Heaven, but Homer stops her by grabbing her leg and says [...] "Where do you think you're going, missy?" [...] The gag was written by staff writer George Meyer, and is series creator Matt Groening's favorite joke of the series. While the episode's ending is one of Groening's favorites, fans were uneasy with it. Selman stated that the ending [...] "drives them [...] crazy", since they do not know whether or not the episode is canonical. In 2007, Homer's line [...] "Oh, I smell barbeque!" [...] was included in Bobby Bryant of The States list [...] "20 <b>Essential</b> <b>Things</b> I've Learned From Homer Simpson". The same year, the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, unveiled a new exhibit which galleried Biblical images in art and pop culture, including a promotional poster for [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories".|$|E

60|$|In some respects, Harding was primitive; but this, perhaps, {{tended to}} give him a clearer {{understanding}} of <b>essential</b> <b>things,</b> and he had a vague belief that he would some day meet the woman who was destined to be his true mate. What was more, he would recognize her when he saw her.|$|E
60|$|Young as Ida was, {{she had a}} grip of <b>essential</b> <b>things,</b> and a {{dislike of}} shams. It {{generally}} happened, too, that, when she felt strongly on any subject, she sooner or later expressed her thoughts in forcible words; and before that afternoon was over she and Arabella Kinnaird between them disturbed the composure {{of more than one}} of Mrs. Kinnaird's guests.|$|E
60|$|In {{another moment}} Acton swung round, {{and stepped back}} through an open window. He {{generally}} moved abruptly, and was now and then painfully direct in conversation, but Nasmyth had been long enough in that country to understand and to like him.

60|$|We had won. That was the <b>essential</b> <b>thing.</b> And my legal {{experience}} {{had taught me}} that victory counts; defeat is soon forgotten. Even the discontented, half-baked and heterogeneous element from which the Pilot got its circulation had short memories.|$|R
5000|$|The Resistance Party {{believes}} that the <b>essential</b> <b>thing</b> has been accomplished with the Charter of 1830. The party thinks that the July Revolution is only a parenthesis made to restore order and legality after the [...] "coup d'état" [...] of Charles X.|$|R
6000|$|Carrie made {{a little}} half-wistful gesture, {{though there was a}} faint glow in her eyes. [...] "Yes, I did what I could, and now I shall not rest until he comes back again. Still, I think I deserve it, and I'm not sure that I would have him different. I think nothing would change Charley. I used to wonder more than I do now how he, who was born on the prairie, came to have all the real <b>essential</b> <b>things</b> which were not in any of us at Barrock-holme." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{he should}} have got married," [...] she said snappishly. [...] "I {{am not going to}} worry because he is a lonely old {{bachelor}} when all these years I have supposed him a comfy Benedict. Why doesn't he hire him a housekeeper, at least? He can afford it; the place looks prosperous. Ugh! I've a fat bank account, and I've seen almost everything in the world worth seeing; but I've got several carefully hidden gray hairs and a horrible conviction that grammar isn't one of the <b>essential</b> <b>things</b> in life after all. Well, I'm not going to moon out here in the dew any longer. I'm going in to read the smartest, frilliest, frothiest society novel in my trunk." ...|$|E
60|$|On the whole, I was {{not much}} hurt at being taken for a pedlar. I might think that I ate with greater delicacy, or that my {{mistakes}} in French belonged to a different order; but it was plain that these distinctions would be thrown away upon the landlady and the two labourers. In all <b>essential</b> <b>things</b> we and the Gilliards cut {{very much the same}} figure in the ale-house kitchen. M. Hector was more at home, indeed, and took a higher tone with the world; but that was explicable on the ground of his driving a donkey-cart, while we poor bodies tramped afoot. I daresay, the rest of the company thought us dying with envy, though in no ill sense, to be as far up in the profession as the new arrival.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the {{most important}} thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The <b>essential</b> <b>thing</b> is not to have conquered but to have fought well.|$|R

60|$|We shall then realise {{that the}} actual naval weapons are these smaller weapons, and {{especially}} the destroyer, the submarine, and the waterplane--the waterplane most of all, because of its possibilities of a comparative bigness--in the hands of competent and daring men. And I find myself, as a patriotic Englishman, more and more troubled by doubts whether we are as certainly superior to any possible adversary in these <b>essential</b> <b>things</b> as {{we are in the}} matter of Dreadnoughts. I find myself awake at nights, after a day much agitated by a belligerent Press, wondering whether the real Empire of the Sea may not even now have slipped out of our hands while our attention has been fixed on our stately procession of giant warships, while our country has been in a dream, hypnotised by the Dreadnought idea.|$|E
60|$|Walthew {{recognized}} {{the truth of}} this. It was not that in facing danger and hardship he had gained steadiness and self-control, because he had never lacked courage, but he had acquired a clearer conception of <b>essential</b> <b>things.</b> He {{would no longer be}} content to accept thoughtlessly the conventional view. His comrade had taught him much by his coolness in time of strain and his stubborn tenacity when things went wrong. It was not for nothing that Grahame had hawk-like eyes: he had the gift of seeing what must be done. But, after all, it was from hardship itself that Walthew had learned most, and in the light of that knowledge he determined to go home. The work he was best fitted for was waiting in the smoky, industrial town; it was not the task he had longed for, but it was his, and he would be content now.|$|E
60|$|Time {{will test}} these hopes, but {{certainly}} we, the innumerable democracy of individually unimportant men, {{have felt the}} need for such a Prince. Our consciousness of defects, of fields of effort untilled, of vast possibilities neglected and slipping away from us for ever, has never really slumbered again since the chastening experiences of the Boer War. Since then the national spirit, hampered though it is by the traditions of party government and a legacy of intellectual and social heaviness, has been in uneasy and ineffectual revolt against deadness, against stupidity and slackness, against waste and hypocrisy in every department of life. We have come to see more and more clearly how little we can hope for from politicians, societies and organised movements in these <b>essential</b> <b>things.</b> It is this that has invested the energy and manhood, the untried possibilities of the new King with so radiant a light of hope for us.|$|E
5000|$|Ethelbert Talbot (October 9, 1848 - February 27, 1928) was {{the fifteenth}} {{presiding}} {{bishop of the}} Episcopal Church. He is credited with inspiring Pierre de Coubertin to coin the phrase, [...] "The important thing in the Olympic Games {{is not so much}} the winning but taking part, for the <b>essential</b> <b>thing</b> in life is not conquering but fighting well." ...|$|R
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. People {{nowadays}} are so absolutely superficial {{that they}} don't understand {{the philosophy of}} the superficial. By the way, Gerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better. Sentiment is all very well for the button-hole. But the <b>essential</b> <b>thing</b> for a necktie is style. A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's obvious," [...] he said, [...] "that there's {{very little}} {{to be made by}} waiting until any {{particular}} stock becomes a popular favorite--the premium equalizes the profit and sometimes does away with it. The <b>essential</b> <b>thing</b> is to take hold at the beginning, when the shares are more or less in disfavor and can be picked up cheap." ...|$|R
60|$|Winston {{understood}} that while Courthorne's iniquities {{were not to}} be brought up against him, the little gentle-voiced lady had but taken him on trial; but, perhaps because it was so long since any woman had spoken kindly words to him, his heart went out towards her, and he felt a curious desire to compel her good opinion. Then he found himself seated near the head of the long table, with Maud Barrington on his other hand, and had an uncomfortable feeling that most of the faces were turned somewhat frequently in his direction. It is also possible that he would have betrayed himself, had he been burdened with self-consciousness, but the long, bitter struggle he had fought alone, had purged him of petty weaknesses and left him the closer grasp of <b>essential</b> <b>things,</b> with the strength of character which is one and the same in all men who possess it, whatever may be their upbringing.|$|E
6000|$|Much {{has been}} said, and said truly, of the monkish morbidity, of the {{hysteria}} which as often {{gone with the}} visions of hermits or nuns. But let us never forget that this visionary religion is, in one sense, necessarily more wholesome than our modern and reasonable morality. It is more wholesome for this reason, that it can contemplate the idea of success or triumph in the hopeless fight towards the ethical ideal, in what Stevenson called, with his usual startling felicity, [...] "the lost fight of virtue." [...] A modern morality, on the other hand, can only point with absolute conviction to the horrors that follow breaches of law; its only certainty is a certainty of ill. It can only point to imperfection. It has no perfection to point to. But the monk meditating upon Christ or Buddha has in his mind an image of perfect health, a thing of clear colours and clean air. He may contemplate this ideal wholeness and happiness far more than he ought; he may contemplate it {{to the neglect of}} exclusion of <b>essential</b> <b>THINGS</b> he may contemplate it until he has become a dreamer or a driveller; but still it is wholeness and happiness that he is contemplating. He may even go mad; but he is going mad for the love of sanity. But the modern student of ethics, even if he remains sane, remains sane from an insane dread of insanity.|$|E
60|$|Christ, it is manifest, was of {{the modern}} faith in these matters, he welcomed the Magdalen, neither would he condemn the woman taken in adultery. Manifestly {{corruption}} and disease were not to stand between him and those who sought God in him. But the Christianity of the creeds, in this as in so many respects, does not {{rise to the level}} of its founder, and it is as necessary to repeat to-day as though the name of Christ had not been ascendant for nineteen centuries, that sex is a secondary thing to religion, and sexual status of no account in the presence of God. It follows quite logically that God does not discriminate between man and woman in any <b>essential</b> <b>things.</b> We leave our individuality behind us when we come into the presence of God. Sex is not disavowed but forgotten. Just as one's last meal is forgotten--which also is a difference between the religious moment of modern faith and certain Christian sacraments. You are a believer and God is at hand to you; heed not your state; reach out to him and he is there. In the moment of religion you are human; it matters not what else you are, male or female, clean or unclean, Hebrew or Gentile, bond or free. It is AFTER the moment of religion that we become concerned about our state and the manner in which we use ourselves.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} also a {{critical}} success in France, being lauded as [...] "a complete success, a chef-d'œuvre", although François Truffaut did not share this enthusiasm, accusing Clément of directing [...] "his career". He added that [...] "For Clément, the <b>essential</b> <b>thing</b> is that the film he is making costs more than the last one and less than the next." ...|$|R
5000|$|With {{a playful}} cynicism he remarked of his {{popularity}} as a portraitist with high society women, [...] "The <b>essential</b> <b>thing</b> is to elongate {{the women and}} especially to make them slim. After that it just remains to enlarge their jewels. They are ravished." [...] This remark is reminiscent of another of his sayings: [...] "Painting {{is the most beautiful}} of lies".|$|R
60|$|Neither her ladyship nor the {{contractor}} liked the idea. The latter in particular had {{looked forward to}} a big function, chronicled at length in all the newspapers. But after all, the marriage was the <b>essential</b> <b>thing,</b> and perhaps, having regard to some foolish love passages that had happened between Clementina and a certain penniless naval lieutenant, ostentation might be out of place.|$|R
