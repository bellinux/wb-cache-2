60|$|The state-room {{was truly}} rather {{subterranean}} and stuffy, {{with nothing but}} a long table and an uncanny company of screw-pin chairs seated thereat, and no outlet to the air at all, {{but it was not}} so bad otherwise, to me who have never been out of Europe. Those maple-wood panels and ebony curves--and those Hygeias! They went all round, even round the curve at the dim, distant end, and back up the near side. Yet how beautiful old, gold-coloured maple-wood is! how very lovely, with the ebony curves of the door arch! There was a wonderful old-fashioned, Victorian glow in it, and a certain splendour. Even one could bear the Hygeias let in under glass--the colour was right, that wedge-wood and white, in such lovely <b>gold</b> <b>lustre.</b> There was a certain homely grandeur still in the days when this ship was built: a richness of choice material. And health-salts Hygeias, wedge-wood Greek goddesses on advertisement placards! Yet they weren't advertisements. That was what really worried me. They never had been. Perhaps Weego's Health Salts stole her later.|$|E

50|$|Lustreware {{became popular}} in Staffordshire during the 19th century, {{where it was}} also used by Josiah Wedgwood, who {{introduced}} pink and white lustreware simulating mother o' pearl effects in dishes and bowls cast in the shapes of shells, and silver lustre, introduced at Wedgwood in 1805. In 1810 Peter Warburton of New Hall patented a method of transfer-printing in <b>gold</b> and silver <b>lustre.</b> Sunderland Lustreware in the North East is renowned for its mottled pink lustreware, and lustreware was also produced in Leeds, Yorkshire, where the technique may have been introduced by Thomas Lakin.|$|R

50|$|Platinum {{produced}} {{the appearance of}} solid silver, and was employed {{for the middle class}} in shapes identical to those uses for silver tea services, ca. 1810-1840. Depending on the concentration of gold in the lustring compound and the under slip on which it was applied, a range of colours could be achieved, from pale rose and lavender, to copper and gold. The <b>gold</b> <b>lustre</b> could be painted or stenciled on the ware, or it could be applied in the resist technique, in which the background was solidly lustred, and the design remained in the body color. In the resist technique, similar to batik, the design was painted in glue and size in a glycerin or honey compound, the lustre applied by dipping, and the resist washed off before the piece was fired.|$|E

5000|$|The tour Maubergeon was reconstructed {{on three}} floors with ogival vaulting, {{illuminated}} by glazed windows and topped by nineteen statues. Of these, only sixteen pieces survive: {{they represent the}} duke's counsellors in clerical habits, while the statues of the duke {{and his wife are}} missing. In its unfinished state, the tower has neither machicolations nor canopies above the statues.At the behest of Guy de Dammartin, three monumental stoves were installed in the grand hall; they were decorated with Gothic Flamboyant statuary and surmounted by a gallery. The southern wall of the hall was also overhauled: it was pierced by great bays which masked the pipes from outside view. The exterior of this wall was decorated with flamboyant ogives. The floor was tiled by Jehan de Valence, called [...] "the Saracen" [...] in the accounts, with green and <b>gold</b> circular <b>lustred</b> maiolica tiles. When the project was complete, Jehan de Valence returned home to Valencia, and no further lustred tin-glazed faience was produced in France ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLustre {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fascinating}} surface decorative effects produced on glazed ceramics. This technique seems to have been born in the ninth century in factories created by the Arabs during their conquests in the Orient (Mesopotamia, Egypt and Persia). Arab potters spread their knowhow all over the Mediterranean basin, especially Spain. Italian Renaissance potters succeeded in applying it to their production. The technique is based on a specific firing of the glazed pottery in a reducing atmosphere in the presence of metallic salts. The result is a surface layer with a metallic appearance, exhibiting various colours, from gold to brown or red. This paper provides the chemical nature and the physical structure of ancient <b>gold</b> like <b>lustre</b> layers and compares them with contemporary lustres produced by a Spanish craftsman reproducing the traditional Islamic techniques. Various analytical investigations (atomic force microscopy, high resolution SEM, particle induced X-ray emission, Rutherford backscattering, TEM, X-ray induced photoelectron spectroscopy, time of flight SIMS and grazing X-ray diffraction) were carried out as well as investigations into the coloured appearance by spectrophotometry. The results show that the lustre layer consists of silver and copper particles of nanometric dimensions dispersed in a glassy matrix. A model of the lustre formation is proposed wherein the development of a new superficial glaze is described. Comparison between ancient and modern production shows how the techniques have varied through the ages...|$|R
40|$|Mica based {{pearlescent}} pigments {{are widely}} applied in plastics, cosmetics, automobiles coatings among others, {{but they seem}} not explored by the ceramic industry. In this work, the potential of two commercial special effect pigments (with <b>gold</b> and silver <b>lustre</b> respectively) in the decoration of ceramic tiles was appraised by testing them dispersed into several ceramic coatings fired {{in a wide range}} of temperatures (700 - 1150 ?C). The pigments were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, XRF and PSD, while their technological behavior was assessed determining phase composition (XRD) and colorimetric parameters (DRS) of ceramic materials, including a pearlescence index. Results indicate that titania mica pigments are stable into glassy coatings up to 900 ?C, being any deterioration of their optical properties due to anatase-to-rutile and muscovite-to-feldspar transformations occurring at higher temperatures or after long firing times. The pigment type with a gold shine is particularly suitable for third fire decoration of ceramic tiles, involving low temperatures and fast firing schedules, where it can replace expensive precious metals lustres. Moreover, a certain satin effect was appreciable in porcelain stoneware tiles, unexpectedly persistant after firing at 1200 ?...|$|R

40|$|Lustre {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} decorative techniques of the Medieval and Renaissance pottery of the Mediterranean basin, capable of producing brilliant metallic reflections and iridescence. Following the recent finding that the colour of lustre decorations is mainly determined by copper and silver nanoclusters dispersed in the glaze layer, the local environment of copper and silver atoms has been studied by extended X- ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy on original samples of gold and red lustre. It has been found that, in <b>gold</b> <b>lustre,</b> whose colour is attributed mainly to the silver nano- cluster dispersion, silver is only partially present in the metallic form and copper is almost completely oxidised. In the red lustre, whose colour is attributed mainly to the copper nanocluster dis- persion, only a fraction of copper is present in the metallic form. EXAFS measurements on red lustre, carried out in the total elec- tron yield mode to probe only the first 150 nm of the glaze layer, indicated that in some cases lustre nanoclusters may be confined in a very thin layer close to the surface...|$|E
40|$|The English Scene' is {{a social}} {{commentary}} that simultaneously reinforces both contemporary and historical locations. The use of the familiar plate titled 'The English Scene' constructs a narrative that acknowledges contemporary observations surrounding the issue of immigration. The work also frames an historical connection to the import of china ware into Europe. The figures contain a duel representation where they project an association to both the import of cargoes of china {{in the past and}} also the mimetic representation of the human figure through the porcelain figurine. Reference is made to the anonymous containers that covertly carry immigrants - these are offered as glass vitrine - visible and exposed to view. 'Booze Britain' Porcelain, decal and <b>gold</b> <b>lustre</b> From high fashion to high street consumerism, cheeky ceramics to controversial chairs, provocative lamps to ‘rubbish’ jewellery, this major exhibition subverts your preconceptions and challenges your relationship with objects you use on a daily basis. Subversive Design explores how designers, makers and manufacturers react to the world around them, playing with form, function and materials to create objects that provoke and amuse. For over 200 years craft and design have been used to engage and challenge political and social issues in both obvious and more hidden ways. The exhibition includes work by a wide range of designers and makers, including Alexander McQueen, David Shrigley, Studio Job, Philippe Starck, Grayson Perry, Richard Slee, Campana Brothers, Vivienne Westwood and Leigh Bowery...|$|E
60|$|This outward {{mutability}} indicated, and did {{not more}} than fairly express, the various properties of her inner life. Her nature appeared to possess depth, too, as well as variety; but--or else Hester's fears deceived her--it lacked reference and adaptation to the world into which she was born. The child could not be made amenable to rules. In giving her existence a great law had been broken; {{and the result was}} a being whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant, but all in disorder, or with an order peculiar to themselves, amidst which the point of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered. Hester could only account for the child's character--and even then most vaguely and imperfectly--by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while Pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world, and her bodily frame from its material of earth. The mother's impassioned state had been the medium through which were transmitted to the unborn infant the rays of its moral life; and, however white and clear originally, they had taken the deep stains of crimson and <b>gold,</b> the fiery <b>lustre,</b> the black shadow, and the untempered light of the intervening substance. Above all, the warfare of Hester's spirit at that epoch was perpetuated in Pearl. She could recognize her wild, desperate, defiant mood, the flightiness of her temper, and even some of the very cloud-shapes of gloom and despondency that had brooded in her heart. They were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition, but, later in the day of earthly existence, might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind.|$|R
