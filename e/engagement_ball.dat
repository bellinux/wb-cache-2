25|$|Though Catherine's {{life and}} reign {{included}} remarkable personal successes, they ended with two failures. Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King Gustav IV Adolph, visited her in September 1796, the Empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become Queen of Sweden by marriage. A ball was {{given at the}} imperial court on 11 September, when the engagement {{was supposed to be}} announced. Gustav Adolph felt pressured {{to accept the fact that}} Alexandra would not be converting to Lutheranism, and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for Stockholm. Catherine was so irritated at this, her health was affected. She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony where a favourite grandson would supersede her difficult son on the throne, but she died of a stroke before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the <b>engagement</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, Sir Edward Pelham (Francis), who has married a Russian Gypsy named Nada (Swanson), fears that his daughter Nadine (Swanson) will follow in her mother's footsteps and arranges a marriage with her cousin Eustace (Butler), whom she does not love. Her father takes her and Eustace {{on a trip to}} America to look over some mines in Nevada. During the journey she meets Bayard Delaval (Sills), a young engineer in her father's employ, and a warm friendship grows between them. While returning with Bayard to the hotel from the mine she is bitten on her breast by a rattlesnake. Bayard uses his pocketknife to open the wound and sucks out the poison. He takes her to his nearby shack and makes her drink some whiskey. Her father finds her with Bayard in his cabin and demands Bayard marry her at once. After the ceremony, Nadine is taken to the hotel and placed under the care of a physician. The father, disregarding all explanations, leaves for home. Recovering from the effects of the liquor, Nadine upbraids Bayard. Believing that Nadine does not love him, Bayard leaves her and prepares to sue for divorce. Sometime later in Washington, Bayard and Nadine meet again on the night of her <b>engagement</b> <b>ball.</b> Nadine has reconciled with her father and has agrees to marry Howard Hopper (Hull), a millionaire who is a cad and the talk of Washington society. Her father arrives and seeing Bayard and Nadine together and told that she loves him, does not {{stand in the way of}} their reunion.|$|E
50|$|Lieutenant Harry Faversham (Beau Bridges) is {{the latest}} scion of a {{prominent}} military family. A deeply sensitive boy, he is much traumatised by the early death of his kind-hearted mother. Though he never {{wants to be a}} soldier, he feels obliged to join the army. Though no coward (as he will later show), he has no interest in an army career. Having met and become engaged to Ethne, he decides to resign his commission. The fact that war in the Sudan is coming is irrelevant to this decision. During their <b>engagement</b> <b>ball</b> {{on the final day of}} his army career, Faversham receives telegrammes summoning him and three of his brother officers (Durrance, Willoughby and Trench) back to the regiment prior to being sent to the Sudan. As determined as ever to leave the army, Faversham burns the telegrammes so that he can pretend not to have been summoned back to the regiment before his commission expires. Willoughby sees him burning papers and notices that he is embarrassed to have been taken by surprise in doing so. On later realising that Faversham was burning the telegrammes from the army, Willoughby assumes that Faversham has done so because he is afraid of going to the Sudan. Durrance, Willoughby and Trench then send Faversham three white feathers, betokening cowardice, and turn their backs on him. When Faversham tries to explain to Eithne what has happened, she also reaches the same mistaken conclusion and gives him a fourth white feather. Following his regiment's deployment, Faversham realizes he has made a grave mistake and, having toyed with suicide, finally resolves to redeem his honour.|$|E
40|$|Acceptance {{testing of}} the SNF Fuel Basket Lift Grapple was {{accomplished}} to verify the design adequacy. This report shows the results affirming the design. The test was successful in demonstrating {{the adequacy of the}} grapple assembly's inconel actuator shaft and <b>engagement</b> <b>balls</b> for in loads excess of design basis loads (3200 pounds), 3 X design basis loads (9600 pounds), and 5 X design basis loads (16, 000 pounds). The test data showed that no appreciable yielding for the inconel actuator shaft and <b>engagement</b> <b>balls</b> at loads in excess of 5 X Design Basis loads. The test data also showed the grapple assembly and components to be fully functional after loads in excess of 5 X Design Basis were applied and maintained for over 10 minutes. Following testing, each actuator shaft (Item 7) was liquid penetrant inspected per ASME Section 111, Division 1 1989 and accepted per requirements of NF- 5350. This examination was performed to insure that no cracking had occurred. The test indicated that no cracking had occurred. The examination reports are included as Appendix C to this document. From this test, it is concluded that the design configuration meets or exceeds the requirements specified in ANSI N 14 6 for Special Lifting Devices for Shipping Containers Weighing 10, 000 Pounds (4500 kg) or More...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} {{presented}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} context and significance of changes in attitudes and levels of <b>engagement</b> in <b>Ball</b> State University’s BIO 100 class which is taught using the blended learning method. The evidence suggests that this method exhibits no significant overall change in attitudes or levels of engagement {{over the course of}} the semester. Several individual question couplets exhibited positive change. The combination of no significant overall change and positive couplet changes suggests that this method is a viable alternative to more traditional methods. In addition students overwhelmingly agree that this method of education should be used in other classes. Future research is needed to confirm the effects of this method. It is also paramount that as this method becomes implemented on larger scale training and coaching be available for students and faculty members. These services are necessary in order to achieve maximum method effectiveness. Thesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{remotely}} operable {{pressure regulator}} and shutoff valve particularly suited for achieving high resolution and flow control, and positive shutoff is described. The valve {{is characterized by}} a spring-loaded ball coaxially aligned with a fluid port to be sealed, a spring-loaded pintle extended through the port into <b>engagement</b> with the <b>ball,</b> for controlling the position, a spring-loaded diaphragm for controlling the position of the pintle, and an axially displaceable spring supported by a movable stop which, in turn, is repositioned by a selectively operable stepper motor. Thus, the pressure-response characteristics for the valve can be varied through a selective repositioning of the stop...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 5 -axis {{sculptured}} surface milling {{is a difficult}} machining process to model due to the complex geometrical engagement between the workpiece and the cutter. Due {{to the complexity of}} the process, the engagement cannot be found analytically with conventional methods. Therefore, solid modeler based simulations are utilized to compute the engagement map. This paper presents a comprehensive and efficient strategy for <b>engagement</b> modeling of <b>ball</b> end milling using a solid modeler kernel, namely Parasolid. Accuracy of the model is validated by simulating the cutting forces based on the calculated engagements and compare it with experimentally measured cutting forces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Clutch {{shift control}} is {{critical}} for the performance and fuel economy of automotive transmission, including both automatic and hybrid transmissions. Among all {{the factors that influence}} clutch shift control, clutch fill and clutch engagement are crucial to realize a fast and smooth clutch shift. When the clutch is not engaged, the fluid held by the centrifugal force inside of the clutch chamber, which introduces additional pressure that will affect the subsequent clutch fill and engagement processes, should be released. To realize this function, a ball capsule system is introduced and mounted on the clutch chamber. When the clutch is ready to be filled for <b>engagement,</b> the <b>ball</b> capsule needs to close quickly and remain closed until the clutch is disengaged. It’s also desirable to have appropriate closing velocity for the ball capsule to minimize noise and wear. In this paper, we will model the ball capsule dynamics and reveal its intrinsic positive feedback structure, which is considered to be the key to realize a fast response, and design the optimal shape of the capsule to achieve the desired performance.
