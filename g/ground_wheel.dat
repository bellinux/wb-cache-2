60|$|Every bit of {{flatland}} {{was cleared}} {{and used as}} rice-fields, and on the lower slopes {{of many of the}} hills tobacco and vegetables were grown. Most of the slopes are covered with huge blocks of rock, very fatiguing to scramble over, while a number of the hills are so precipitous as to be quite inaccessible. These circumstances, combined with the excessive drought, were very unfavourable for my pursuits. Birds were scarce, and I got but few new to me. Insects were tolerably plentiful, but unequal. Beetles, usually so numerous and interesting, were exceedingly scarce, some of the families being quite absent and others only represented by very minute species. The Flies and Bees, on the other hand, were abundant, and of these I daily obtained new and interesting species. The rare and beautiful Butterflies of Celebes were the chief object of my search, and I found many species altogether new to me, but they were generally so active and shy as to render their capture a matter of great difficulty. Almost the only good place for them was in the dry beds of the streams in the forest, where, at damp places, muddy pools, or even on the dry rocks, all sorts of insects could be found. In these rocky forests dwell some of the finest butterflies in the world.

40|$|To {{increase}} the productivity {{per unit area}} of small land holdings and considering the economic condition of Indian farmers, it is quite necessary to have suitable agricultural implements which farmers can use and also allow them to use for custom hiring. Weeding is an important agricultural unit operation. Delay and negligence in weeding operation affect the crop yield up to 30 to 60 per cent. With regard this, a manually operated weeder was developed and tested ergonomically. Various parameters such as speed of travel, time of operation, field capacity, weeding efficiency and horse power requirement were considered during the testing. The <b>ground</b> <b>wheel</b> of weeder (390 mm Ф) was fabricated from mild steel flat of 52 x 3 mm. The weeding blades were made from steel flat to impart enough strength to sustain the prevailing forces acting on it. V-shape support made of mild steel was directly welded to the handle to join the <b>ground</b> <b>wheel</b> with the main frame. The arrangement was also made to adjust the height and angle of the handle as per the need and posture of the operator.

40|$|AbstractA new {{controlled}} seed {{metering unit}} {{was designed and}} mounted on a common grain drill for direct seeding of wheat (DSW). It comprised the following main parts: (a) a variable-rate controlled direct current motor (DCM) as seed metering shaft driver, (b) two digital encoders for sensing the rotational speed of supplemental <b>ground</b> <b>wheel</b> (SGW) and seed metering shaft and (c) a control box to handle and process the data of the unit. According to the considered closed-loop control system, the designed control box regularly checked the revolution per minute (RPM) of seed metering shaft, as operation feedback, using its digital encoder output. The seeding rate was determined based on the calculated error signal and output signal of the digital encoder of the SGW. A field with four different levels of wheat stubble coverage (10 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %) was selected for evaluation of the fabricated seed metering unit (FSMU). The dynamic tests were conducted to compare the performance of installed FSMU on the grain drill and equipped grain drill with common seed metering unit (CSMU) at three forward speeds of 4, 6 and 8 (Km/h) for DSW. Results of the FSMU assessment demonstrated that an increase in forward speed of grain drill (FSGD) and stubble coverage did not significantly affect the seeding rate in the grain drill for DSW. Using the FSMU reduced the coefficient of variation (CV) by approximately 50 %. Consequently, applying the FSMU on the common grain drill led to a desirable seeding rate at different forward speeds of the grain drill and stubble existence...|$|E

The equipment had the option to place fertilizers up to a 500 mm soil depth by the main winged tine and delivering fertilizer up to 250 mm deep using the leading tines, thereby helping place fertilizer at different depths in vertical soil profile in a single pass. All three tines had independent metering systems. Options were provided to meter and deliver either 33. 3 % or 25. 0 % or 20. 0 % of the total recommended fertilizers with the main tine and the remaining amount through two shallow leading tines.

As the operator pulls the sprayer he does not walk into the spray. The <b>ground</b> <b>wheel</b> drive mechanism ensures that the output of the sprayer is proportional to forward movement; variation in walking speed does not affect the rate of application. Both spray band width and droplet size are adjustable, enabling efficient application of the herbicide and reducing drift.

40|$|Introduction: In {{conventional}} farming, {{the soil}} and crop are considered uniform in different locations of the farm and the fertilizers are applied according to the average of soil needs with an additional percentage for safety (Loghavi, 2003). Non-essential chemical fertilizers in the field have harmful effects and social, economic and environmental concerns will increase. Many fertilizers go into the surface waters and ground waters and cause poisoning and environmental pollution without being absorbed by the plants. In variable rate technology, the soil fertilizer needs a map of {{all parts of the}} farm which is prepared with the GIS system. This map is uploaded on the computer before variable rate fertilizer machine starts. The computer continually controls the fertilizing rate for each part of the farm using a fertilizing map and global positioning system. The {{purpose of this study is}} to construct and evaluate a map-based variable rate fertilizer system that can be installed on a common fertilizer in Iran to be used as a variable rate system. Materials and methods: In common variable rate fertilizers, the rotational speed change of the distributor shaft is used to apply fertilizers. In this way, a DC motor is assembled on the main shaft of all distributors, which reduces the fertilizing accuracy. The reason for this is that there is no separation for units along the width of the fertilizer. Therefore, we used one DC motor for each distributor and another motor to rotate the agitator in the tank. System Set up: To design and select a suitable engine, the required torque for the rotation distributor shaft was measured by a torque meter and the amount of 2. 1 Nm was acquired for that. With regard to the maximum rate of nitrogen fertilizer for land and tractor speed at the time of fertilizing, the order of 350 kg per hectare and 8 km per hour, the maximum distributor shaft speed and power required to rotate distributor shaft were calculated to be 55 rpm and 6. 9 watts, respectively. The selected motor was rated 27. 5 watts, 24 volts and 7. 5 amperes (Since there were no 6. 9 watts motors in the market, a more powerful motor was selected). According to the gear ratio and motor speed, the speed of the distributor shaft was adjustable in the range of 0 to 65 rpm. To determine the speed and position with respect to the direction, a central encoder (E 50 S 8 - 600 - 6 -L- 5 model manufactured by Autonix Korea) was used on the <b>ground</b> <b>wheel.</b> The encoder had 600 pulses per revolution of the axis. Performance evaluation of the system: Performance evaluation of the system consists of two parts; static and moving tests. In static tests, the purpose was the determination of the fertilizer loss (in grams), due to changes in distributor speed as well as the accuracy of the electromechanical control system according to the command values sent to the device. Results of this part were used for the calibration of the device. In motion tests: In motion tests, the assessment of fertilizer loss was due to values set in a given situation and the accuracy of planted fertilizer in place (delay and acceleration) is reviewed. The delay is found by the determination of the distance that the fertilizer was placed after the desired location on the ground and the acceleration is found by the determination of the distance that the fertilizer is placed before the desired location on the ground. Results and discussion: The distributor flow rate on F 0 valve position was measured for different rotation speeds. The correlation (linear regression) between the planted fertilizer and rotation speed of distributor shaft (rpm) were 0. 99 for y= 71. 636 x+ 75. 182. So, it can be deduced that these two parameters have a good linear correlation. The results achieved from diagrams and regression model were used in the programming of the system control unit. Thus, by reading the distributors motor speed, the amount of fertilizer can be calculated and the amount of used fertilizer according to the need of the farm in each part is controlled. The effect of plot length on the amount of fertilizing on 25...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{reproduce}} driving techniques to mimic expert race drivers and obtain the open-loop control signals {{that may be}} used by auto-pilot agents driving autonomous <b>ground</b> <b>wheeled</b> vehicles. Race drivers operate their vehicles at the limits of the acceleration envelope. An accurate characterization of the acceleration capacity of the vehicle is required. Understanding and reproduction of such complex maneuvers also require a physics-based mathematical description of the vehicle dynamics. While most of the modeling issues of ground-vehicles/automobiles are already well established in the literature, lack of understanding of the physics associated with friction generation results in ad-hoc approaches to tire friction modeling. In this work we revisit this aspect of the overall vehicle modeling and develop a tire friction model that provides physical interpretation of the tire forces. The new model is free of those singularities at low vehicle speed and wheel angular rate that are inherent in the widely used empirical static models. In addition, the dynamic nature of the tire model proposed herein allows the study of dynamic effects such as transients and hysteresis. The trajectory-planning problem for an autonomous <b>ground</b> <b>wheeled</b> vehicle is formulated in an optimal control framework aiming to minimize the time of travel and maximize the use of the available acceleration capacity. The first approach to solve the optimal control problem is using numerical techniques. Numerical optimization allows incorporation of a vehicle model of high fidelity and generates realistic solutions. Such an optimization scheme provides an ideal platform to study the limit operation of the vehicle, which would not be possible via straightforward simulation. In this work we emphasize the importance of online applicability of the proposed methodologies. This underlines the need for optimal solutions that require little computational cost and are able to incorporate real, unpredictable environments. A semi-analytic methodology is developed to generate the optimal velocity profile for minimum time travel along a prescribed path. The semi-analytic nature ensures minimal computational cost while a receding horizon implementation allows application of the methodology in uncertain environments. Extensions to increase fidelity of the vehicle model are finally provided. Ph. D.
