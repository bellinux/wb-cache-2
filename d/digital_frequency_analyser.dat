40|$|Abstract — This paper gives a {{description}} of a modulator for burst-by-burst carrier frequency hopping in time-division multiple-access (TDMA) systems. The architecture consists of a <b>digital</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesizer/modulator for continuousphase modulations (CPM’s) and a fast frequency settling RF synthesizer consisting of one phase-locked loop (PLL). The performance of the <b>digital</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesizer/CPM modulator has been analyzed theoretically and simulated by a computer program. The analyses show that the proposed <b>digital</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesizer/CPM modulator achieves 2. 5 -W lower power consumption and 18 -dB lower spurious levels than the fast frequency hopping systems synthesizing digitally a full frequency band. In the computer simulations the effect of the <b>digital</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesizer/CPM modulator parameters on the power spectrum and the phase error is investigated.

The QLIP method is a hybrid polynomial interpolation in which {{the first quarter of}} a cosine function is approximated by two sets of linear and parabolic polynomials. The section of the cosine function that is closer to its peak is interpolated by parabolic polynomials, due to its resemblance to a parabola. The rest of the function, which is closer to where it approaches zero, is interpolated by linear polynomials. The paper describes the proposed interpolation method and its VLSI implementation. The performance of the proposed implementations is compared to several state-of-the-art DDFS designs.
