40|$|Genomic segment 4 of the porcine Gottfried strain (serotype 4) of porcine rotavirus, which encodes {{the outer}} capsid protein VP 4, was {{sequence}}s, and its deduced {{amino acid sequence}} was analyzed. Amino acid homology of the porcine rotavirus VP 4 to the corresponding protein of asymptomatic or symptomatic <b>human</b> <b>rotaviruses</b> representing serotypes 1 to 4 ranged from 87. 1 to 88. 1 % for asymptomatic strains and from 77. 5 to 77. 8 % for symptomatic strains. Amino acid homology of the Gottfried strain to simian rhesus rotavirus, simian SA 11 virus, bovine Nebraska calf diarrhea virus, and porcine OSU strains ranged from 71. 5 to 74. 3 %. Antigenic similarities of VP 4 epitopes between the Gottfried strain and <b>human</b> <b>rotaviruses</b> were detected by a plaque reduction neutralization test with hyperimmune antisera produced against the Gottfried strain or a Gottfried (10 genes) x <b>human</b> DS- 1 <b>rotavirus</b> (VP 7 gene) reassortant which exhibited serotype 2 neutralization specificity. In addition, a panel of six anti-VP 4 monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing <b>human</b> <b>rotaviruses</b> belonging to serotype 1, 3, or 4 was able to neutralize the Gottfried strain.

40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> was {{detected}} by electron microscopic examination of the stools of 320 (63 %) of 506 infants and young children hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis between December 1974 and March 1977. Serologic responses to infection with the ro-tavirus were revealed by the complement-fixation test in 130 (70 %) of 185 patients ex-amined. During the study period three epidemics of <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> infection oc-curred during the winter months. The peak incidences occurred in January 1975 (88 % of patients positive by serologic analysis or electron microscopy of stools), Jan-uary 1976 (92 %), and February 1977 (96 %). Rotavirus {{was detected}} in the stools of 288 (79 %) of 365 patients tested during the cooler months (December to March) and 35 (25 %) of 141 {{during the rest of}} the year. In the summer (June to August), rotavi-rus infection occurred rarely. The frequency of <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> infection was high-est among patients aged six to II months. These results indicate that <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> can be regarded as a major etiologic agent of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children, of which wintertime epidemics are common in Japan. The <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> (reovirus-like agent) has been established as a major etiologic agent of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young chil-dren in many parts of the world [1, 2].

By the hemagglutination of SRBC-antiWa and SRBC-antiNCDV (reverse passive hemagglutination [RPHA]), titration of rotavirus in extracts from feces of children suffering from diarrhea (61 specimens) was carried out. We found that the ratio of titers determined with SRBC-antiWa and SRBC-antiNCDV varied remarkably from specimen to specimen.

To express the cross-reactivity of <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> with antibodies to NCDV, we propose a Wa/NCDV rotavirus index which can be calculated from the RPHA titer with SRBC-antiWa and SRBC-antiNCDV as follows: Wa/NCDV rotavirus index = (antiWa-RPHA titer of specimen/antiWa-RPHA titer of NCDV) /(antiNCDV-RPHA titer of specimen/antiNCDV-RPHA titer of NCDV) ...|$|E

40|$|Serotyping of <b>human</b> <b>rotaviruses</b> (HRVs) by {{neutralization}} {{requires the}} previous adapta-tion of strains to growth in cell cultures, {{which is often}} unsuccessful. By using the solid-phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM) technique with protein A and type-specific, cross-adsorbed, polyclonal immune sera, we divided 40 previously typed culture-adapted strains into the same four serotypes distinguished by neutralization, but HRV strains could also be typed directly on stool extracts, Of 171 HRV strains tested by SPIEM, 163 were typed as a single serotype, two were shown to be mixed serotypes, three could not be typed since they were partially antibody-coated, and three were lacking the common group anti-gen (atypical rotaviruses or pararotaviruses), In addition, strains of serotype 4 could be classified by SPIEM into two subtypes, 4 A and 4 B. Overall, strains of serotype 1 were detected in nearly 50070 of the 171 HRV-positive stools examined by SPIEM, strains of either serotype 2 or 4 in about 20070, and strains of serotype 3 in nearly 10070.

40|$|Thirteen hybridomas {{secreting}} VP 4 -specific monoclonal antibodies {{against the}} Gottfried strain of porcine rotavirus (serotype 4) were produced and characterized.

Group I N-MAbs (n = 3) were cross-reactive with five different serotypes of <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> examined by a plaque reduction virus neutralization test. Group II N-MAbs (n = 3) neutralized all symptomatic <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> serotypes tested and asymptomatic <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> serotype 4 to a low titer. The single group III N-MAb neutralized mainly symptomatic <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> serotypes 2 and 9 {{and none of the}} asymptomatic <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> serotypes. The one N-MAb in group IV reacted at low titers with only asymptomatic <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> serotypes 1 through 4.

None of the N-MAbs recognized any animal rotaviruses tested (SA- 11, RRV, OSU, NCDV, and B 223), except for the Gottfried and SB- 2 rotaviruses. The failure of N-MAbs (groups I to IV) to react with any animal rotaviruses tested but their ability to react variably with all human rotaviruses tested suggest that neutralizing epitopes on the VP 4 protein are highly conserved between the Gottfried porcine and human rotaviruses.

40|$|AbstractRotaviruses are {{the leading}} cause of severe {{diarrhea}} in infants and young children worldwide. Thus, the development of an effective rotavirus vaccine is a major public health goal. This study was performed to identify the gene or genes responsible for rotavirus virulence or host range restriction and attenuation in a natural host. Such knowledge could have an important bearing on the selection of candidate live vaccine strains. We addressed this issue by analyzing the response of gnotobiotic piglets to orally administered porcine × <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> reassortants. It was possible to determine (i) which porcine rotavirus genes were required for the induction of diarrhea, and (ii) which <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> genes are associated with the host range restriction because the parental porcine rotavirus (SB- 1 A strain) caused diarrhea in piglets, whereas the parental <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> (DS- 1 strain) was attenuated in piglets. Substitution of the 3 rd (VP 3) or 4 th (VP 4) or 9 th (VP 7) or 10 th (NS 28 (NSP 4)) gene of the avirulent human strain for the corresponding gene of porcine rotavirus that was virulent for gnotobiotic piglets yielded viral reassortants that failed to induce diarrhea. Further analysis indicated that reassortants which possessed only one, two, or three of these porcine rotavirus genes on a background of <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> genes also failed to induce diarrhea. However, diarrhea was induced when all four of these porcine rotavirus genes were included in a reassortant in which the remaining seven genes were derived from the <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus.</b> These observations suggest that {{it may be possible to}} attenuate wild-type <b>human</b> <b>rotavirus</b> strains that are virulent for humans by selective genetic reassortment with an animal rotavirus strain that is attenuated for humans...|$|E
