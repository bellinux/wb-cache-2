25|$|The Barbera grape is {{the most}} widely planted variety {{in all of the}} Piedmont and makes a juicy, muscular red wine that is not as tannic as Barolo and Barbaresco. It is grown in nearly every major wine making region of the Piedmont but seems to <b>do</b> <b>best</b> in the {{southern}} part of the province of Asti in the Nizza DOCG zone. Some producers are experimenting with blending Barbera with Nebbiolo to combine the former's fruitiness with the later's structure. The light fruitiness of wines from the Dolcetto grape has caused some wine writers to describe it as the Italian version of Beaujolais. The wines have a sense of spiciness to them with little acid and tannins. They are able to be drunk relatively young and tend to be the every day drinking wines of the Piedmontese.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} is to empirically assess and compare the impact of the three components of customer-equity on consumers' loyalty-intentions for the top three firms in the Australian supermarket industry. A study of an online sample of 888 supermarket consumers is conducted to test a number of hypotheses. The results show that all three equities contribute to loyalty-intentions, with value-equity dominant. Woolworths <b>does</b> <b>best</b> in leveraging value-equity, Coles <b>does</b> <b>best</b> in leveraging brand-equity while IGA <b>does</b> <b>best</b> in leveraging relationship-equity. Additionally, value-equity especially, and relationship-equity to a lesser extent, contributes to brand-equity. This study pioneers the cross-analysis of customer-equity by retailer. 9 page(s...|$|R

B.dentata {{is vulnerable to}} cold winters in cultivation in Melbourne and recovers over the hotter months of summer.

Plants can be pruned hard, and <b>do</b> <b>best</b> on a sandy slightly acid soil of pH 5.5–6.5. They can be vulnerable to borers.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{advances}} the emergent literature {{pertaining to the}} impacts of brand, value and relationship equities on consumer loyalty-intentions along three major fronts. First, key inter-relationships among the equities are examined; thus advancing theory. Second, procedural advancement occurs via examining the hypothesised effects after controlling for several demographic covariates. Third, the current study presents an aggregate level and a firm level analysis, providing additional insight. The chosen supermarket scenario also adds value to the study. A large national survey of supermarket consumers supports the hypotheses. Micro level analysis reveals that Woolworths <b>does</b> <b>best</b> in leveraging value-equity, Coles <b>does</b> <b>best</b> in leveraging brand-equity, while IGA <b>does</b> <b>best</b> in leveraging relationship-equity.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Times of India, Karan Johar explained that he harboured intentions of remaking the original Agneepath ever since the film released in 1990. Though the film had received critical acclaim over the years, its commercial failure had devastated his father, producer Yash Johar. The idea of a possible remake materialised on the sets of Johar's directorial My Name Is Khan, in which Karan Malhotra was an assistant director. Johar told Malhotra of his desire to remake the original film {{and asked him to}} revisit it again. On not directing the film himself, Johar commented, [...] "I am happy directing films on love, romance and drama. That's what I <b>do</b> <b>best.</b> I don't think I will be good at an action film.

However, The Guardian stated that [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] "is the sort of music [...] <b>do</b> <b>best</b> - hazy, lazy sunshine pop".

The Songs of Ascent project ultimately did not come to fruition and has not been released; its evolution and apparent abandonment are examined in the book The Greatest Albums You'll Never Hear. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material." [...] The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said, [...] "The work we did with RedOne was very, very exciting.

Unshackled by a struggling console platform, this platoon of world-class software developers can do what they <b>do</b> <b>best</b> for any machine on the market". Rosen predicted [...] "they have the potential to catch Electronic Arts".

A 2014 Rolling Stone article ranks [...] "I'm Goin' Down" [...] as the 52nd best Bruce Springsteen song ever. In the book Counting Down Bruce Springsteen: His 100 Finest Songs, writer Jim Beviglia puts [...] "I'm Goin' Down" [...] as the 131st best Springsteen track, calling it [...] "a fun but relatively minor" [...] work. Critic Bruce Pollock lists it and several other Born in the U.S.A. tracks in Rock Song Index: The 7500 Most Important Songs for the Rock and Roll Era.

500|$|Horses {{can become}} anxious or {{stressed}} {{if there are}} {{long periods of time}} between meals. They also <b>do</b> <b>best</b> when they are fed on a regular schedule; they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine. [...] When horses are in a herd, their behavior is hierarchical; the higher-ranked animals in the herd eat and drink first. [...] Low-status animals, who eat last, may not get enough food, and if there is little available feed, higher-ranking horses may keep lower-ranking ones from eating at all. [...] Therefore, unless a herd is on pasture that meets the nutritional needs of all individuals, it is important to either feed horses separately, or spread [...] feed out in separate areas to be sure all animals get roughly equal amounts of food to eat. [...] In some situations where horses are kept together, they may still be placed into separate herds, depending on nutritional needs; overweight horses are kept separate from thin horses so that rations may be adjusted accordingly. [...] Horses may also eat in undesirable ways, such as bolting their feed, or eating too fast. [...] This can lead to either choke or colic under some circumstances.|$|E

In court, Coke was insulting to the parties, disrespectful to the judges and [...] "rough, blustering, overbearing"; a rival once wrote to him saying [...] "in your pleadings you were wont to insult over misery and to inveigh bitterly at the persons, which bred you many enemies". Coke was pedantic and technical, something which saw him win many cases as a barrister, but when he became Attorney General [...] "he showed the same qualities in a less pleasing form...

500|$|However, {{some critics}} {{felt that the}} album was overly ambitious and that the band's musical {{departure}} may alienate listeners.

[...] Scott Shetler of Slant disliked the [...] "melodramatic" [...] undertones of [...] "I've Got All This Ringing in My Ears and None on My Fingers" [...] and [...] "Golden", writing [...] "they don't handle that style quite as well as Panic! at the Disco". Cory Apar of AllMusic opined that the album's pop direction contradicts the band's lyrical claims of wishing to stick to their roots. He called the album's various styles [...] "hit and miss", yet commented that [...] "Once Infinity on High sinks in, it's indeed a fun record. But for a band that was once so self-assured and able to utilize its talents so compellingly, the album is regrettably haphazard." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian believed that the album was overly sullen, but noted that [...] "They may not be happy, but they haven't forgotten to be catchy." [...] Barry Nicholson of NME found the amount of guest producers to be unnecessary and disliked some of the songs, but admired the album's [...] "infectious" [...] nature.|$|E
