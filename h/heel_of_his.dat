25|$|Benteen {{displayed}} calmness {{and courage}} by exposing himself to Indian fire and {{was hit in}} the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot by an Indian bullet. At one point, he personally led a counterattack to push back Indians who had continued to crawl through the grass closer to the soldier's positions.|$|E
25|$|On August 21, Marquis took a comebacker off the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> glove hand, {{breaking}} his wrist. Although Marquis continued {{to pitch in}} the game, the broken wrist ended his 2012 season. Marquis finished with a 6–7 record and 4.04 ERA in 15 starts for the Padres, with 79 strikeouts and 29 walks. Marquis also upheld {{his reputation as a}} good hitter in 2012, collecting 9 hits, including 3 doubles, in 32 at-bats.|$|E
25|$|But his {{untapped}} {{talent was}} volcanic: In 1990, Johnson {{became the first}} left-hander to strike out Wade Boggs three times in one game, and a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers attested to his potential. Johnson credits a session with Nolan Ryan late in the 1992 season with helping him take his career to the next level; Ryan {{has said that he}} appreciated Johnson's talent {{and did not want to}} see him take as long to figure certain things out as he had taken. Ryan recommended a slight change in his delivery; before the meeting, Johnson would land on the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> foot after delivering a pitch, and he therefore usually landed offline from home plate. Ryan suggested that he land on the ball of his foot, and almost immediately, he began finding the strike zone more consistently. In a September 27, 1992 game against the Texas Rangers, with Ryan the opposing starting pitcher, Johnson struck out 18 batters in eight innings while throwing 160 pitches, a pitch count that has not been reached in an MLB game since.|$|E
50|$|On the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{first round}} {{submission}} victory over Jose Carbajal in September 2014, Salazar {{signed with the}} Ultimate Fighting Championship.|$|R
60|$|Scundoo smiled {{yet more}} wan and gray, {{closed the door}} on the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> departing visitor, and barred and double-barred it.|$|R
60|$|Malone did {{not seem}} {{prepared}} to carry on briskly a conversation of this sort. He began to knock the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boots together, and to yawn.|$|R
500|$|Mucho Macho Man {{began his}} second year of racing by {{finishing}} fourth behind winner Dialed In in the Grade III Holy Bull Stakes at Gulfstream Park, and once again finished behind Gourmet Dinner, who was third. Mucho Macho Man was then sent to New Orleans for the Risen Star Stakes at the Fair Grounds Race Course. Ridden by Rajiv Maragh, he recorded his first graded stakes win, prevailing by {{one and a half}} lengths over Santiva. Ritvo took away the blinkers for a workout prior to the race and kept them off, stating that the colt had matured and was more at ease without them. [...] At the Risen Star, he first came to the notice of one of his future jockeys, Gary Stevens, then a sports analyst, who noted the colt's calm demeanor, describing him as [...] "a chilled out customer... very relaxed". [...] The next race was the Louisiana Derby, a major preparatory race for the Kentucky Derby. [...] In that race, he lost his right front horseshoe at the start [...] when he [...] "grabbed a quarter"—tearing off the shoe and a bit of his hoof when he stepped on the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> front foot with one of his back feet. [...] He finished third behind Pants on Fire and Nehro.|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, {{the term}} 'flipper' {{has been used}} to {{describe}} other types of deliveries. The Australian leg spinner Bob Holland employed a back spinning ball that he simply pushed backwards with the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> palm. Sometimes this form of front-hand flipper is called a [...] "zooter". It is easier to bowl but not as effective as the amount of backspin is much less.|$|E
2500|$|Upon further {{investigation}} into {{the true nature of}} character, double meaning can be derived from the Montresor crest. It is the position of Montresor to view himself as the owner of the righteous boot that is crushing the insolent Fortunato serpent and his [...] "thousand injuries" [...] that progress into insult. A more allegoric meaning of Poe's places the actors in reverse. The blind oaf Fortunato has unintentionally stepped upon the snake in the grass – the sneaky and cunning Montresor – who, as a reward for this accidental bruising, sinks his fangs deep into the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> offender, forever linking them in a form of mutual existence.|$|E
5000|$|On the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Broadway hits The Pajama Game and Damn Yankees, Richard Adler {{composed}} the opening Sunday Showcase theme music, titled [...] "Sunday Drive" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "Sunday Showcase Theme").|$|R
50|$|The Anniversary is John Campea's {{first feature}} film, {{following}} closely on the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> documentary, Prince <b>of</b> Peace, God of War, which explored {{the relationship between}} Christianity and the theology of war.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! the traitor! the traitor!" [...] she mumbled, almost inaudibly. [...] "Now we {{are going}} to be burnt; and I bent my knee to him. No! he must run at the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> English." ...|$|R
2500|$|United States {{prosecutors}} said {{the device was}} a [...] "Mark II" [...] "microbomb" [...] constructed using Casio digital watches as described in Phase I of the Bojinka plot, for which this was a test. On Flight 434, Yousef used one tenth of the explosive power he planned to use on eleven U.S. airliners in January 1995. The bomb was, or at least all of its components were, designed to slip through airport security checks undetected. The explosive used was liquid nitroglycerin, which was disguised as a bottle of contact lens fluid. Other ingredients included glycerin, nitrate, sulfuric acid, and minute concentrations of nitrobenzene, silver azide, and liquid acetone. The wires he used were hidden in the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoe, below the detectable range of the metal detectors used by airports of the day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sooner shall it perish!" [...] said Balfour; and, {{casting the}} deed into the heap of red {{charcoal}} beside him, pressed {{it down with}} the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot.|$|E
60|$|And {{with his}} face full of passion Uncle Felix bore down upon me, as if ready to crush me beneath the iron <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wrath once and forever.|$|E
60|$|He then ordered {{holes to}} be made through the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> unhappy captive, and, passing a rope through them, had the body {{fastened}} to a chariot, and dragged about the city till no life remained.|$|R
50|$|Buckwild Presents EP is {{a limited}} EP by Buckwild, {{following}} on the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> collaboration with Celph Titled, Nineteen Ninety Now. The EP was also released via No Sleep Recordings and is limited to 200 copies.|$|R
5000|$|Dixon {{suffered}} {{his first}} {{heart attack in}} 1970, shortly after his son Greg {{was killed in a}} car accident. On the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son's death, a grieving Dixon had to be helped on stage to do his show one day.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} {{expect me to}} look surprised, Deronda," [...] said Hans, who had changed his attitude, laying one leg across the other and {{examining}} the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> slipper.|$|E
6000|$|... "No I don't. I {{know people}} I don't like." [...] Will Belton {{as he said}} this was {{thinking}} of Captain Aylmer, and he pressed the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot hard against the floor.|$|E
60|$|Jonas {{then took}} a piece of turf from the field, and put it before the hole, and crowded it in hard with the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot. Rollo {{observed}} that the fire was almost immediately deadened.|$|E
5000|$|The Door Behind is the 38th release by avant-folk/blues singer/songwriter Jandek, {{released}} {{by his own}} Corwood Industries label (#0776). It was <b>his</b> third release <b>of</b> 2004 and {{came out on the}} <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> debut live performance in Scotland on October 17, 2004.|$|R
50|$|Yousef got {{batteries}} past {{airport security}} during his December 11 test bombing of Philippine Airlines Flight 434 by hiding them in hollowed-out <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoes. Yousef smuggled the nitroglycerin on board by putting it inside a small container, reputedly containing contact lens cleaning solution.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear! Hear!" [...] cried Steve, {{looking more}} than ever like a cheerful young cockerel trying to crow as he stood upon the hearth rug with his hands under his coat tails, rising and falling {{alternately}} upon the toes and <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> neat little boots.|$|R
60|$|Getting up {{once more}} {{he began to}} kick upon {{one of the doors}} with the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoe. He kicked as loudly and as long as he could, but no one came to answer his summons.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Zooks! what a fire-eater you are, Johnson!' {{returned}} Mr Folair, {{pulling up}} the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dancing shoe. 'I'm only talking {{of the natural}} curiosity of the people here, {{to know what he}} has been about all his life.' ...|$|E
60|$|Smoke kept himself warm by {{kicking a}} channel through the rim with the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoe. By {{the time he}} had drained off the last of the water, a faint call from Carson {{announced}} that he had reached the top.|$|E
60|$|The priest {{nodded and}} turned on the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> square-toed shoes with big steel buckles. Again, with his hands clasped behind his back, he paced to and fro, {{planting}} his feet firmly. When he swung about, the skirt <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soutane was inflated slightly by the brusqueness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> movements.|$|R
50|$|In early 2011 Netzer {{launched}} a campaign, Save the Comics, to bring public {{attention to the}} undercurrents of a decades-long sales slump for printed comic books. The initiative came on the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> participation in an industry-wide debate on a revolution in creator owned properties.|$|R
50|$|On August 9, 2010, {{following}} the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> release with jazz master Paul Hardcastle, Farish digitally released a tune with Paul’s son on RYTONE Entertainment. Called “Sunset Sky,” the number features Paul Hardcastle Jr. on the saxophone {{mixed with a}} twist on Ryan’s signature melodies.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Benjamin Allen {{deliberately}} crushed his spectacles {{beneath the}} <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot, and having {{picked up the}} pieces, {{and put them into}} three separate pockets, folded his arms, bit his lips, and looked in a threatening manner at the bland features of Mr. Pickwick.|$|E
6000|$|But Fortune La Pearle {{drove the}} <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{moccasin}} {{into the snow}} and attested by his various deities to the madness of Uri Bram. [...] "Who are you," [...] he perorated, [...] "and what am I, that I should put my neck into the rope at your bidding?" ...|$|E
60|$|Strickland {{sat with}} his chin in the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fist, {{watching}} the beast as it wriggled on the ground, but saying nothing. The shirt had been torn open in the scuffle and showed the black rosette mark on the left breast. It stood out like a blister.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Leavenworth {{brought the}} <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{varnished}} boots {{together with a}} click, and executed the latest bow imported, then stuck his glass in his eye and stared till it fell out, (the glass, not the eye,) upon which he fell into step with them, remarking,-- ...|$|R
60|$|The girl's pony, {{squealing}} in terror, reared {{and plunged}} upon the <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mate. The lion was close upon him.

50|$|This {{election}} solidified Colorado's {{transformation from}} a historically Republican-leaning state into a Democratic-leaning swing state.
