40|$|The {{control of}} <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> {{is one of}} the key issues in grasping. When the robotic hand is compliant, for {{instance}} with passive springs at the joints, and the number of controlled variables is low, as shown in recent works for underactuated hands, it is possible that the control of <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> implies the motion of the manipulated object. This paper deals with this issue and studies the structural conditions for the control of <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> which do not involve any motion of the grasped object. The analysis is constructive and a controller of <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> is proposed.

40|$|Compliance in multifingered hand {{improves}} grasp {{stability and}} effectiveness of the manipulation tasks. Compliance of robotic hands depends mainly on the joint control parameters, on the mechanical design of the hand, as joint passive springs, and on the contact properties. In object grasping the primary task of the robotic hand is the control of <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> which allows to satisfy the contact constraints and consequently to guarantee a stable grasp of the object. When compliance is {{an essential element of}} the multifingered hand, and the control of the <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> is not designed to be decoupled from the object motion, it happens that a change in the <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> causes the object trajectory to deviate from the planned path with consequent performance degradation. This paper studies the structural conditions to design an <b>internal</b> <b>force</b> controller decoupled from object motions. The analysis is constructive and a controller of <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> is proposed. We will refer to this controller as object motion-decoupled control of <b>internal</b> <b>forces.</b> The force controller has been successfully tested on a realistic model of the DLR Hand II. This controller provides a trajectory interface allowing to vary the <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> (and to specify object motions) of an underactuated hand, which can be used by higher-level modules, e. g. planning tools...|$|R

Ignoring the {{deformation}} effect, {{the original}} size principle is normally {{used to calculate}} the <b>internal</b> <b>force</b> and deformations of the bars in Mechanics of Materials, the calculation error is not discussed in the textbooks, however. In order to show the adaptability of the original size principle to calculate the <b>internal</b> <b>force</b> of plane statically determinate truss, a case of the two-bar statically determinate truss was also given. The calculation error of the <b>internal</b> <b>force</b> and the angle deformations are quantitatively studied to make a comparison between the actual <b>internal</b> <b>force</b> and that calculated by the original size principle. The research showed that the relative error of angle deformations and the <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> of the two rods are nonlinear dependent on the external forces (the given force), tensile stiffness and the initial angle of the plane truss.
