5|$|Bohemond {{decided to}} recover Anazarbus and other territories {{which had been}} lost to the Cilician Armenia. He invaded Cilicia in February 1130, {{traveling}} along the Ceyhan River. Leo I of Cilicia sought assistance from the Danishmend Emir Gazi Gümüshtigin who made a surprise attack on Bohemond's army. Bohemond and his soldiers were massacred in the battle. According to Michael the Syrian, the Turks killed Bohemond {{because they did not}} recognize him; had they recognized him, they would have saved him so they could <b>demand</b> <b>a</b> ransom from him. Gümüshtigin had Bohemond's head embalmed and sent to Al-Mustarshid, the Abbasid Caliph.|$|E

Negotiations under US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23March 1999, and he handed the matter to NATO, which started a 78-day bombing campaign on 24March 1999. Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of {{what was then the}} Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the crisis, NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces, the ACE Mobile Force (Land), to Albania as the Albania Force (AFOR), to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo.|$|E

5|$|The route {{was noted}} {{to appeal to}} many types of riders, be they climbers, sprinters, or time trialists. The race had seven flat stages which figured into end in mass sprints, and the hilly mixed stages were {{inviting}} for breakaways. Sastre, {{one of the first}} riders to announce he would ride the Giro, commented that the route was much harder than that of the 2009 Giro, and would <b>demand</b> <b>a</b> very strong climber to be its champion. Zomegnan concurred that the route favored climbers, noting that the distance spent time trialing was not great and that it would take errors from climbing specialists to allow a rider better suited for time trialing to be Giro champion.|$|E
5|$|According to e-mails {{released}} in the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, Millionaire narrowly avoided cancellation after the 2014–15 season. The show's declining ratings prompted DADT to <b>demand</b> <b>a</b> dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The series was nonetheless renewed for the 2015–16 season, with various cuts to the show's production budget {{and a return to}} the original format (but with only 14 questions). Had the show not been renewed, SPE would have placed the show on extended hiatus for three years, reclaimed full rights to the show (without the innovations and format added in the syndicated run, to which DADT owns intellectual property rights), and shopped the revived show to another network or syndicator. In January 2017, it was announced that Millionaire has been renewed through 2018.|$|E

5|$|Also on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition was released, {{containing}} Superman, Superman II, , Superman III, Superman IV, Superman Returns, and , {{among other}} releases. All {{contents of the}} set were housed within a tin case. The set was valued at US$99.92, and received extremely positive reviews when first released. However, after only {{a day on the}} market, Warner Bros. announced that there were two errors discovered within the set. The first was that the 2.0 audio track on Superman, was instead the 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second was that the Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a toll-free number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set. Due to popular <b>demand,</b> <b>a</b> corrected set was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E
5|$|As a joke {{mirroring}} Cartman's, one of {{the girls}} at school queefs on Butters' face, causing him to run screaming and crying out of the school building. The other boys are shocked and their fathers, outraged, go to the Colorado General Assembly and <b>demand</b> <b>a</b> law banning queefing, much to the anger of the town's women. Meanwhile, the Queef Sisters appear on Regis and Kelly to promote their book Eat, Pray, Queef, and Terrance and Philip's show gets canceled due to the rising popularity of the Queef Sisters. Terrance and Philip attempt to kill the Queef Sisters, but the plan backfires when they end up becoming attracted to them after the Queef Sisters mention that Terrence and Phillip are the sisters' idols. They pair off into couples and travel the Canadian Wine Country together. Meanwhile, after Stan's mother Sharon queefs, she and Stan's sister, Shelley, start laughing at the dinner table, causing Stan and his father Randy to leave.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{events can}} take place while {{managing}} the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player {{to let them know}} that they have hidden a bomb in the building, and that they <b>demand</b> <b>a</b> ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player a significant amount of funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have any impact on the tower, at the end of the fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across the tower.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can <b>demand</b> <b>a</b> great deal of attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given {{a steady supply of}} objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, as {{a general}} strike was {{underway}} {{in the country to}} <b>demand</b> <b>a</b> renegotiation of the French role in Syria, Quwatli was appointed the Bloc's vice president of internal affairs, but {{was not part of the}} treaty negotiation committee which led talks with the French in Paris in March. A new treaty was established by the end of the month, although the French did not ratify it. Between then and fall, Quwatli spearheaded efforts to unify nationalists ranks in Syria, convincing LNA leader Sabri al-Asali to join the Bloc's highest governing body. By enlisting the support of many prominent pan-Arabists like himself, Quwatli strengthened his position within the Bloc, particularly in regards to his chief nationalist rival Jamil Mardam Bey.|$|E

At Riverrun, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) unsuccessfully negotiates Sansa's request for help from the Blackfish (Clive Russell), and Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) returns Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) to the castle, with Edmure commanding they throw down their arms and surrender to the Lannisters.
