40|$|A {{description}} of the turbulent diffusion <b>flame</b> is proposed in which the <b>flame</b> structure is composed of a distribution of laminar diffusion <b>flame</b> elements, whose thickness is small {{in comparison with the}} large eddies. These elements retain their identity during the <b>flame</b> development; they are strained in their own plane by the gas motion, a process that not only extends their surface area, but also establishes the rate at which a <b>flame</b> element consumes the reactants. Where this <b>flame</b> stretching process has produced a high <b>flame</b> surface density, the <b>flame</b> area per unit volume, adjacent <b>flame</b> elements may consume the intervening reactant, thereby annihilating both <b>flame</b> segments. This is the <b>flame</b> shortening mechanism which, in balance with the <b>flame</b> stretching process, establishes the local level of the <b>flame</b> density. The consumption rate of reactant is then given simply by the product of the local <b>flame</b> density and the reactang consumption rate per unit area of <b>flame</b> surface. The proposed description permits a rather complete separation of the turbulent flow structure, on one hand, and the <b>flame</b> structure, on the other, and in this manner permits the treatment of reactions with complex chemistry with a minimum of added labor. The structure of the strained laminar diffusion <b>flame</b> may be determined by analysis, numerical computation, and by experiment without significant change to the model. ...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{confined}} spaces on <b>flame</b> {{spread over}} thin solid fuels in a low-speed opposing flow is investigated by combined use of microgravity experiments and computations. The <b>flame</b> behaviors are observed to depend strongly on {{the height of}} the flow tunnel. In particular, a non-monotonic trend of <b>flame</b> spread rate versus tunnel height is found, with the fastest <b>flame</b> occurring in the 3 cm high tunnel. The <b>flame</b> length and the total heat release rate from the <b>flame</b> also change with tunnel height, and a faster <b>flame</b> has a larger length and a higher heat release rate. The computation analyses indicate that a confined space modifies the flow around the spreading <b>flame.</b> The confinement restricts the thermal expansion and accelerates the flow in the streamwise direction. Above the <b>flame,</b> the flow deflects back from the tunnel wall. This inward flow pushes the <b>flame</b> towards the fuel surface, and increases oxygen transport into the <b>flame.</b> Such a flow modification explains the variations of <b>flame</b> spread rate and <b>flame</b> length with tunnel height.
