5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly <b>from</b> <b>top</b> to bottom of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc {{is close to the}} boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|Alonso and Arteta were {{ambitious and}} dreamed of playing {{alongside}} each other for Real Sociedad when they were older. Though they attended different schools, the two young players joined forces at the local youth side Antiguoko, playing games at the weekend.

Alonso's move to Real Sociedad, however, was not a companionless one, as his older brother Mikel, who had also become an adept player, had joined the club one year earlier.|$|E

5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{conform to}} a roughly square frame {{and are not}} usually linked to one another, so {{do not have a}} preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read <b>from</b> <b>top</b> to bottom, right-to-left; the first column being {{on the right side of}} the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. <b>From</b> <b>top</b> to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E

5|$|In his {{documentary}} The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, Slavoj Žižek {{remarks that}} Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the {{three levels of}} the human mind that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: the top floor would be the superego, where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ego, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' id. Žižek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse <b>from</b> <b>top</b> floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow <b>from</b> <b>top</b> to bottom so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the {{sole of the foot}} venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the candle <b>from</b> <b>top</b> to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E

50|$|The term super (the terms diving, avalanche, and top-rope {{are also}} used) is placed before any move (normally {{performed}} on the mat) which is being performed off the top- or second rope. For example, if a Samoan drop was performed <b>from</b> the <b>top</b> turnbuckle it would be called an Avalanche Samoan drop. Many move variations performed off the top rope use the term avalanche instead of super, especially in Japan. Suplexes performed <b>from</b> the <b>top</b> or second rope {{are referred to as}} superplexes; while powerbombs performed <b>from</b> the <b>top</b> or second rope are referred to as superbombs, and powerslams <b>from</b> the <b>top</b> or second rope are referred to as avalanche powerslams, or cutters and stunners <b>from</b> the <b>top</b> or second rope are referred to as elevated cutters and elevated stunners, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Smythe {{continued}} to own horses through the 1930s, but he sold them in 1940, {{when he made}} plans {{to fight in the}} Second World War. He did not re-enter the racing business until 1954. In 1951, Smythe bought land for a farm in Caledon, Ontario, originally looking for a new location for a gravel pit. At first he kept only cattle, but in 1954 he decided to get back into owning race horses, in partnership with Larkin Maloney, and an area was set aside to keep horses. Smythe learned about the business and went into breeding, buying mares in foal <b>from</b> <b>top</b> thoroughbred lines, and hiring future Hall of Fame trainer Yonnie Starr.|$|E

5|$|The pupal {{transformation}} into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings {{visible on the}} outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed <b>from</b> <b>top</b> to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.|$|E
5|$|There are 34 known {{vertebrae}} of Plesiorycteropus. The animal had {{at least}} seven sacral and five or six lumbar vertebrae. A find of associated caudal vertebrae {{from the base of}} the tail, which diminish in size only slowly from front to back, suggests that the tail was long. There is no evidence for the additional joints between the vertebrae that are characteristic of xenarthrans. In the seven known thoracic (chest) vertebrae, the articulations with the intervertebral disks are bean-shaped and much wider from side to side than <b>from</b> <b>top</b> to bottom. In the back thoracics and all lumbars, a longitudinal transarcual canal is present in the neural arch.|$|E
5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (<b>from</b> <b>top</b> to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E
