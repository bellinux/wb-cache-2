5|$|A Turkish <b>kilim</b> is a flat-woven rug from Anatolia. Although {{the name}} <b>kilim</b> is {{sometimes}} used loosely in the West {{to include all}} type of rug such as cicim, palaz, soumak and zili, in fact any type other than pile carpets, the name <b>kilim</b> properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, soumak and zili are made using three groups of threads, namely longitudinal warps, crossing wefts, and wrapping coloured threads. The wrapping threads give these rugs additional thickness and strength. <b>Kilim</b> in contrast are woven flat, using only warp and weft threads. <b>Kilim</b> patterns are created by winding the weft threads, which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs of warp threads, leaving the resulting weave completely flat. <b>Kilim</b> are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.|$|E
5|$|A <b>kilim</b> is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over the warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. <b>Kilim</b> patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. <b>Kilim</b> motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Geometric {{patterns}} {{occur in}} a variety of forms in Islamic art and architecture including <b>kilim</b> carpets, Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, muqarnas decorative vaulting, jali pierced stone screens, ceramics, leather, stained glass, woodwork, and metalwork.|$|E
5000|$|Rah Rah (...) : These <b>kilims</b> (or, more precisely, soumak rugs) are woven {{mostly in}} the Sirjan region and are also called khatti design <b>kilims.</b> Ardebil and Moghan are woven in the same design but in lower qualities.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kilims</b> and Navajo rugs {{are also}} types of {{tapestry}} work.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known and most highly regarded, these <b>kilims</b> (or kelims) are {{traditionally}} distinguished by the areas, villages or cities {{in which they are}} produced, such as Konya, Malatya, Karapinar and Hotamis. Most Anatolian <b>kilims</b> are slit woven. Larger antique <b>kilims</b> were woven in two to three separate sections on small nomadic horizontal floor looms in three feet wide long strips, then carefully sewn together matching the patterns edges to create an ultimately wider rug. These pieces are still being produced in very limited quantities by nomadic tribes for their personal use and are commonly known as cicims.|$|R
5|$|In tribal societies, <b>kilim</b> were woven {{by women}} at {{different}} stages of their lives: before marriage, in readiness for married life; while married, for her children; and finally, <b>kilim</b> for her own funeral, to be given to the mosque. Kilims thus had strong personal and social significance in tribal and village cultures, being made for personal and family use. Feelings of happiness or sorrow, hopes and fears were expressed in the weaving motifs. Many of these represent familiar household and personal objects, such as a hairband, a comb, an earring, a trousseau chest, a jug, a hook.|$|E
5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the evil eye. These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of <b>kilim</b> patterns has faded also.|$|E
5|$|Navajo {{textiles}} {{were originally}} utilitarian blankets {{for use as}} cloaks, dresses, saddle blankets, and similar purposes. Toward {{the end of the}} 19th century, weavers began to make rugs for tourism and export. Typical Navajo textiles have strong geometric patterns. They are a flat tapestry-woven textile produced in a fashion similar to kilims of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, but with some notable differences. In Navajo weaving, the slit weave technique common in kilims is not used, and the warp is one continuous length of yarn, not extending beyond the weaving as fringe. Traders from the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged adoption of some <b>kilim</b> motifs into Navajo designs.|$|E

5|$|On December 22, 1990, {{the last}} Polish president-in-exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, handed the presidential insignia, {{including}} one of the banners rescued by Mościcki in 1939, to Lech Wałęsa, the first democratically elected president of post-war Poland. The ceremony, held at the Royal Castle in Warsaw {{was seen as a}} symbol of the Third Republic's continuity with the pre-war Second Republic. However, since legal regulations on national symbols did not recognize a national banner at that time, the banner brought by Kaczorowski did not become the presidential insignia again but was instead donated to the Royal Castle museum where it is now on display. The other of the two banners remains in the Sikorski Institute in London. Today, a <b>kilim</b> embroidered with the design of the pre-war Banner of the Republic is hanging in the Senate chamber, above the chair reserved for the President of Poland.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} of flat-weaves {{is called the}} <b>Kilim.</b> <b>Kilim</b> rugs (along with jewellery, {{clothing}} and animals) are important for the identity and wealth of nomadic tribes-people. In their traditional setting Kilims are used as floor and wall coverings, horse-saddles, storage bags, bedding and cushion covers.|$|E
25|$|Textiles {{were not}} only worn by the mummies, they were also {{scattered}} about the cave. Their robes, made from heavy cotton, are embroidered with squares and diamonds of crosses and flowers, which strongly resemble <b>kilim</b> patterns of Turkish nomads.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>kilims</b> {{are often}} cheaper than pile rugs, {{beginning}} carpet collectors often start with them. Despite what many perceive as their secondary (or inferior) status to pile carpets, <b>kilims</b> {{have become increasingly}} collectible in themselves in recent years, with quality pieces now commanding high prices. What some sensed as inferiority was actually a different nature of rugs woven for indigenous use as opposed to rugs woven on a strictly commercial basis. Because <b>kilims</b> were not a major export commodity, there were no foreign market pressures changing the designs, as happened with pile carpets. Once collectors began to value authentic village weaving, <b>kilims</b> became popular. Three factors then combined to reduce {{the quality of the}} West's newly discovered <b>kilims.</b> The first was a development in industrial chemistry. An important element in the attractiveness of traditional rugs is abrash, the dappled appearance resulting from variation in shade of each colour caused by hand-dyeing of the yarn. The synthetic (aniline-derived) dyes introduced late in the Victorian era abolished abrash, giving brilliant colours which however often faded with time. A second factor was the loss of the nomadic way of life across Central Asia. Once people had settled, the tribal character of their weavings faded. A third factor was a direct consequence of the <b>kilim's</b> new-found marketability. As rugs began to be made for export and money rather than personal use, the local style and social significance of each type of carpet was lost. Patterns and colours were chosen to suit the market, rather than woven according to tradition and to suit the needs of the weaver's family and the weaver's own hopes and fears.|$|R

25|$|A flatweave carpet {{is created}} by {{interlocking}} warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads. Types of oriental flatwoven carpet include <b>kilim,</b> soumak, plain weave, and tapestry weave. Types of European flatwoven carpets include Venetian, Dutch, damask, list, haircloth, and ingrain (aka double cloth, two-ply, triple cloth, or three-ply).|$|E
25|$|Village rugs {{are more}} apt to have warps of wool rather than of cotton. Their designs are not as {{elaborate}} and ornate than the curvilinear patterns of city rugs. They are more likely to display abrash and conspicuous mistakes in detail. On simple vertical looms, the correct tension of the warps is difficult to maintain during the entire weaving process. So, village rugs tend to vary in width from end to end, have irregular sides, and may not lay entirely flat. In contrast to manufactory rugs, there is considerable variety in treating the selvedges and fringes. Village rugs are less likely to present depressed warps, as compared to manufactory rugs. They tend to make less use of flat woven <b>kilim</b> ends to finish off the ends of the rug, as compared to tribal rugs. The variation in treatment of fringes and ends, and the way the selvedges are treated, provide clues as to place of origin.|$|E
25|$|Shiraz {{is known}} as the city of poets, literature, wine (despite Iran being an Islamic republic), and flowers. It is also {{considered}} by many Iranians to be the city of gardens, due to the many gardens and fruit trees that {{can be seen in the}} city, for example Eram Garden. Shiraz has had major Jewish and Christian communities. The crafts of Shiraz consist of inlaid mosaic work of triangular design; silver-ware; pile carpet-weaving and weaving of <b>kilim,</b> called gilim and jajim in the villages and among the tribes. In Shiraz industries such as cement production, sugar, fertilizers, textile products, wood products, metalwork and rugs dominate. Shirāz also has a major oil refinery and is also a major center for Iran's electronic industries: 53% of Iran's electronic investment has been centered in Shiraz. Shiraz is home to Iran's first solar power plant. Recently the city's first wind turbine has been installed above Babakoohi mountain near the city.|$|E

50|$|Powell {{relocated}} to Istanbul in 1975. After getting an assignment from Thames & Hudson for a proposed book on Turkish <b>kilims,</b> Powell immersed herself in Anatolian <b>kilims</b> {{and the people}} who made them. For years, she followed semi-nomadic Anatolians in her VW Caravan, documenting their daily lives, with especial attention to their manufacture of textiles. She also documented <b>kilims</b> and other textiles she found in villages and village mosques. She also, with Harald Böhmer, researched and studied the natural dyes used to produce the colors in antique textiles. Together, in Turkey's Aegean region, they set up the DOBAG Carpet Initiative of weavers, using natural dyes and traditional weaving techniques to produce new carpets, engaging a younger generation in the traditions of carpet weaving, and opening markets for their work.|$|R

25|$|Pirot carpet (Serbian: Пиротски ћилим, Pirotski ćilim) to {{a variety}} of flat tapestry-woven carpets or rugs {{traditionally}} produced in Pirot, a town in southeastern Serbia. Pirot kilims with some 122 ornaments and 96 different types have been protected by geographical indication in 2002. They {{are one of the most}} important traditional handicrafts in Serbia. In the late 19th century and up to the Second World War, Pirot kilims have been frequently used as insignia of Serbian and Yugoslav royalty. This tradition was revived in 2011 when Pirot kilims were reintroduced for state ceremonies in Serbia. Carpet weaving in Pirot dates back to the Middle Ages. One of the first mentions of the Pirot <b>kilim</b> in written sources date to 1565, when it was said that the šajkaši boats on the Danube and Drava were covered with Pirot kilims. Pirot was once the most important rug-making centre in the Balkans. Pirot is located on the historical main highway which linked central Europe with Constantinople.Pirot was also known as Şarköy in Turkish. The Pirot carpet varieties are also found in Bulgaria and Turkey, and in many other international collections. One of the chief qualities are the colour effects achieved through the choice and arrangement of colours.|$|E
500|$|The carpet (<b>kilim)</b> {{industry}} remains {{dominant in}} the town. Carpets have been crafted according to traditional designs, {{but in recent years}} {{it is up to the}} customers to decide the pattern of the carpet they have ordered. The production of a single [...] carpet takes about 50 days; primarily women engage in carpet weaving. Work is entirely manual and all used materials are natural; the primary material is wool, coloured using plant or mineral dyes. The local carpets have been prized at exhibitions in London, Paris, Liège and Brussels. The municipality has also invested in the development of tourism and many private houses have been turned into small family hotels or guesthouses. In 2004, 65 people were engaged in the tourism industry; in the same year, the municipality was visited by 2,350 tourists, of whom were 254 foreigners. In terms of economic indicators, the municipality ranks around the high average: it is 113th of 264 municipalities in Bulgaria by GDP per capita and 67th by Human Development Index.|$|E
500|$|Mathematics and art {{have a long}} {{historical}} relationship. Artists {{have used}} mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made {{for the use of}} the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De Divina Proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on [...] perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of [...] tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesberg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as <b>kilim.</b> In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jaali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.|$|E

5|$|Many {{traditional}} rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave <b>kilims,</b> {{are divided}} into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver. In <b>kilims</b> from Anatolia, the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of frieze group pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian <b>kilims</b> often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.|$|R
