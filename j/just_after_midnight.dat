5|$|Hale {{had spent}} many {{hundreds}} of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp <b>just</b> <b>after</b> <b>midnight.</b> The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius. Hale first established {{that there was no}} other deep-sky object near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky.

40|$|A new all-sky imaging, {{wavelength}} scanning Fabry-Perot spectrometer (FPS) {{has been}} developed to spatially resolve horizontal vector wind fields in the thermosphere approximately 240 km above Poker Flat, Alaska. Collocated with this instrument are a narrow field Fabry-Perot spectrometer, a 30 frame/s white light all-sky video camera (ASC) and a 4 -channel meridian scanning photometer (MSP). The narrow field FPS is normally used for vertical wind measurements, whereas the latter two instruments are used to monitor auroral activity. We present an example of data from this set of instruments from one night, November 15, 1996. In particular, we focus on a three hour period, ending <b>just</b> <b>after</b> magnetic <b>midnight,</b> during which time an auroral breakup was observed. Strong curvature and shear of the horizontal wind field developed prior to the breakup, apparently associated with stable aurora lying north of Poker Flat. The curved and sheared flow configuration collapsed within 45 min of the breakup, leaving the thermospheric wind almost stagnant. Following this, the observatory moved under the thermospheric cross-polar jet, so that uniform southeastward wind gradually covered our visible sky. The vertical wind speed remained within a few tens of ms^ 1 of zero throughout this period, apart from an isolated value of 82 ms^ 1 downward, recorded about 50 min prior to the breakup. Mechanisms for possible associations between thermospheric vertical winds, horizontal winds, and the aurora are discussed...|$|R
40|$|On 14 July 1974 the Atmosphere Explorer-C {{satellite}} {{flew through}} an aurora at F-region altitudes <b>just</b> <b>after</b> local <b>midnight.</b> The {{effects of the}} particle influx are clearly evident in the ion densities, the 6300 A airglow, and the electron and ion temperatures. This event provided an opportunity to study the agreement between the observed ion densities and those calculated from photochemical theory using in situ measurements of such atmospheric parameters as the neutral densities and the differential electron energy spectra obtained along the satellite track. Good agreement is obtained for the ions O 2 +, NO+ and N 2 + using photochemical theory and measured rate constants and electron impact cross sections. Atomic nitrogen densities are calculated from the observed [NO+]/[O 2 +] ratio. In the region of most intense electron fluxes (20 erg cm- 2 sec- 1) at ~ 280 km, the N density {{is found to be}} between 2 and 7 x 107 cm- 3. The resulting N densities are found to account for approx. 60 % of the production of N+ through electron impact on N and the resonant charge exchange of O+(2 P) with N(4 S). This reaction also provides a significant source of O(1 S) in the aurora at F-region altitudes. In the region of intense fast electron influx, the reaction with atomic nitrogen is found to be the main loss of O+(2 P) ...|$|R

MacArthur responded by assigning the 17th Infantry Regiment, and later the 65th Infantry Regiment, would be added to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter {{at a time when it}} was unclear if it would hold.|$|E
5|$|After {{approximately}} three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was withheld. That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries. Additional police and wardens arrived at 5 pm, but took seven hours to subdue the prisoners, {{with the last}} of them locked in their cells <b>just</b> <b>after</b> <b>midnight.</b> The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, Karnet, and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the state government, which did not consider prison reform a priority.|$|E

30|$|Because of {{the unique}} {{geometry}} of the magnetic field near equatorial and low-latitude regions such as Ethiopia, the trans-ionospheric satellite communication system {{is affected by the}} accumulation of electrons in the upper atmosphere. In this paper, observed VTEC variations and the capacity of the IRI- 2012 model to estimate diurnal, monthly, and seasonal VTEC variations over Ethiopian regions during the rising phase of solar cycle 24 (2009 – 2011) were discussed in detail. The results reveal that the highest diurnal VTEC peak values are generally observed during equinoctial months, while the lowest peak values are observed during the June solstice months. In addition, the highest and the lowest monthly VTEC values are observed during the equinoctial and the June solstice months, respectively. Although the model overestimates VTEC values for most hours, it generally performs well in estimating diurnal VTEC values, especially <b>just</b> <b>after</b> the <b>midnight</b> hours (0000 – 0300 UT, 0300 – 0600 LT). The monthly and seasonal modeled VTEC values are larger than the corresponding measured values for 2009 and 2010 when all topside options are used. However, as the Sun transitions from very low to high solar activity, overestimation of the monthly and seasonal VTEC values by the model decreases. This may be due to a misrepresentation of solar activity trends in the IRI hmF 2 model. Consequently, the performance of the model in estimating the monthly and seasonal mean VTEC values improves with the change from relatively low (2009) to high (2011) solar activity. The overall results show that using the IRI- 2012 model with the NeQuick option for the topside electron density is generally better in estimating diurnal, monthly, and seasonal VTEC variations.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Darby was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone which affected Hawaii as a tropical storm. The fifth named storm of the busy 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Darby originated from a low pressure area that developed in the Eastern Pacific well southwest of Mexico during July2016.

Further intensification ensued, and Darby became a hurricane on July13. Over the next three days, Darby slowly strengthened to Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson scale, becoming a major hurricane. Cool waters and dry air caused Darby to weaken {{over the next three}} days, although Darby managed to restrengthen slightly on July21 before weakening once again as the storm neared Hawaii. <b>Just</b> <b>after</b> <b>midnight</b> on July24 (UTC; 2:00p.m. on July23 HST), Darby made landfall on the Big Island, and weakened into a remnant low two days later.|$|E
60|$|They {{changed their}} time, now, {{from what is}} called sea-time to that which we follow on land. That is to say, they {{reckoned}} the day to commence <b>just</b> <b>after</b> twelve, <b>midnight,</b> instead of dividing it into watches, as they were wont to do at sea. Journals were begun, and careful notes made of everything that occurred, or that might in any way further the object for which they had gone there. Every man in the ship had his appointed duty and his post. If the native Eskimos should arrive in a warlike temper, each man had his cutlass and pistols in readiness. If a bear should pay them a visit, each could lay hands on his musket in an instant; and if a fire should break out on board, every man had his bucket ready and his particular post fixed. Some were {{to run to the}} water-hole, which it was the duty of one man to keep open. Others were to station themselves from the hole to the ship to pass the buckets, while the rest were to remain on board to convey them to the point of danger. Captain Harvey fixed all the arrangements, and superintended the carrying out of his orders in a general way, making his two officers and the young doctor responsible for the overseeing of details. Each of these foremen furnished him with a report every night of what had been done during the day, and the result was noted down by himself in a journal. Thus everything went smoothly and pleasantly along during the first weeks of their sojourn in their frozen home.|$|R

In the invasion, the division's two parachute brigades would land <b>just</b> <b>after</b> <b>midnight</b> on 6June, while the 6th Airlanding Brigade arrived later in the day just before dark.
