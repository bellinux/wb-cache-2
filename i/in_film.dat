40|$|Abstract. The thermal {{transportation}} {{caused by}} absorbing inclusions <b>in</b> optical <b>films</b> under the radiation of laser pulse is unsteady heat conduction. The temperature distribution <b>in</b> <b>films</b> is ununiform and time-dependent. Considering {{the small size}} of inclusions, the absorbing inclusions were treaded as dot-heat sources. Based on this assumption, the unsteady heat conduction model was brought out and the temperature distribution <b>in</b> <b>films</b> was figured out and discussed, the mechanism that the catastrophic damage may avoid with micro-damage or micro-deformation <b>in</b> <b>films</b> through the release of stress concentration is presented. By comparing the thermal effects caused respectively by single inclusion and assembling ones, the effect of inclusion size on thermal damage <b>in</b> <b>films</b> was discussed...|$|R
