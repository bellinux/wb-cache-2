5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand <b>for</b> <b>reprints</b> of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now in a poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{paperback}} houses {{that contributed to}} the decline of the genre–Ace, Dell, Avon, among others–were actually started by pulp magazine publishers. They had the presses, the expertise, and the newsstand distribution networks which made the success of the mass-market paperback possible. These pulp-oriented paperback houses mined the old magazines <b>for</b> <b>reprints.</b> This kept pulp literature, if not pulp magazines, alive. The Return of the Continental Op reprints material first published in Black Mask; Five Sinister Characters contains stories first published in Dime Detective; and The Pocket Book of Science Fiction collects material from Thrilling Wonder Stories, Astounding Science Fiction and Amazing Stories. But note that mass market paperbacks are not pulps.|$|E

500|$|The first American edition was {{published}} by Alfred A. Knopf in 1958, after much argument between {{the head of the}} company, Alfred Knopf, and the author. Knopf wanted to drop the Guttuso illustrations and rewrite the text for an American audience; David refused, and Knopf eventually gave way. David revised the book for its first Penguin edition in 1963, made further minor revisions <b>for</b> <b>reprints</b> in 1969 and 1977 and revised it again, more extensively, for the 1987 edition, published in hardback by Barrie and Jenkins and, in 1989, by Penguin in paperback. In 2009, the Folio Society published an edition with new illustrations by [...] Sophie MacCarthy and an introduction by Sir Terence Conran.|$|E
500|$|Potter's {{publisher}} wanted Mr. Tod to be {{the first}} in a new series of Peter Rabbit tales in larger formats with elaborate bindings, but Potter disliked the idea. Nonetheless, Mr. Tod and its 1913 follower, The Tale of Pigling Bland, were published in the new formats, but the idea was eventually dropped and the ordinary bindings were adopted <b>for</b> <b>reprints.</b> [...] The two tales were the last completely original productions by Potter. She continued to publish sporadically but used decades-old concepts and sketches rather than new images and ideas. In 1995, an animated film adaptation of the tale was featured on the BBC television anthology series The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.|$|E
500|$|The {{new title}} {{immediately}} became successful, and demand <b>for</b> <b>reprints</b> of old favorites {{was such that}} Munsey decided to launch an additional magazine, Fantastic Novels, in July 1940, edited, like Famous Fantastic Mysteries, by Mary Gnaedinger. The two magazines were placed on bimonthly schedules, arranged to alternate with each other, though the schedule slipped slightly with the fifth issue of Fantastic Novels, dated April 1941 but following the January 1941 issue. [...] Fantastic Novels was suspended after that issue and merged with Famous Fantastic Mysteries. [...] The stated reason was that Famous Fantastic Mysteries [...] "is apparently the favorite title", but {{it seems likely that}} production difficulties caused by World War II played a part. [...] The June 1941 and August 1941 issues of Famous Fantastic Mysteries both carried the slogan [...] "Combined with Fantastic Novels Magazine" [...] on the cover.|$|E

500|$|During {{the course}} of the tale's development, Warne {{proposed}} launching Mr. Tod as the first in a new series of tales in slightly larger formats with elaborate bindings to accommodate wider spines. Potter objected. She did not want to become involved in a new series; her eyesight was failing, and she had grown weary of writing. She complained of having difficulty in producing [...] "fresh short stories", and believed children preferred little change in the books. Nonetheless, Mr. Tod, and the next book, The Tale of Pigling Bland were published in a larger format with elaborate bindings as [...] "Series II, New Style". Potter disliked the new endpaper depicting Samuel Whiskers sticking up a giant poster while watched by other animal characters, thinking it too like a railway advertisement. Eventually, the larger format and new designation were dropped, and the ordinary binding adopted <b>for</b> <b>reprints.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} was dated September/October 1939, and was edited by Mary Gnaedinger. [...] The {{magazine}} immediately became successful {{and went to}} a monthly schedule starting in November 1939. [...] Demand <b>for</b> <b>reprints</b> of old favorites was so strong that Munsey decided to launch an additional magazine, Fantastic Novels, in July 1940. The two magazines were placed on alternating bimonthly schedules, but when Fantastic Novels ceased publication in early 1941 Famous Fantastic Mysteries remained bimonthly until June 1942. [...] Munsey sold Famous Fantastic Mysteries to Popular Publications, a major pulp publisher, at the end of 1942; it {{appears to have been a}} sudden decision, since the editorial in the December 1942 issue discusses a planned February issue that never materialized, and mentions forthcoming reprints that did not appear. [...] The first issue from Popular appeared in March 1943, and only two more issues appeared that year; the September 1943 issue marked the beginning of a regular quarterly schedule. [...] It returned to a bimonthly schedule in 1946 which it maintained with only slight deviations until the end of its run.|$|E
500|$|In May 1951 Weird Tales {{once again}} began to include reprints, {{in an attempt}} to reduce costs, but by that time the earlier issues of Weird Tales had been {{extensively}} mined <b>for</b> <b>reprints</b> by August Derleth's publishing venture, Arkham House, and as a result McIlwraith often reprinted lesser-known stories. [...] They were not advertised as reprints, which led in a couple of cases to letters from readers asking for more stories from H. P. Lovecraft, whom they believed to be a new author.In Weinberg's opinion, the magazine lost variety under McIlwraith's editorship, and [...] "much of the uniqueness of the magazine was gone". [...] In Ashley's view, the magazine became more consistent in quality, rather than worse; Ashley comments that though the issues edited by McIlwraith [...] "seldom attain Wright's highpoints, they also omitted the lows". [...] L. Sprague de Camp, towards the end of McIlwraith's time as editor, agreed that the 1930s were the magazine's heyday, citing Wright's death and the departure for other, better-paying, markets of several of its contributors as factors in the magazine's decline.|$|E

2500|$|The Journal of the American Medical Association {{referred}} to Stevenson’s Cases of the Reincarnation Type (1975) as a [...] "painstaking and unemotional" [...] collection {{of cases that}} were [...] "difficult to explain on any assumption other than reincarnation." [...] In September 1977, the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease devoted most of one issue to Stevenson's research. Writing in the journal, the psychiatrist Harold Lief described Stevenson as a methodical investigator and added, [...] "Either he is making a colossal mistake, or he will be known (I have said as much to him) as 'the Galileo of the 20th century'." [...] The issue proved popular: the journal's editor, the psychiatrist Eugene Brody, said he had received 300–400 requests <b>for</b> <b>reprints.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 3 February 2010, the Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) in Munich {{announced}} plans to republish an annotated version of the text, for educational purposes in schools and universities, in 2015, when the copyright currently held by the Bavarian state government expires (2016). The book had last been published in Germany in 1945. A group of German historians argued that a republication was necessary to get an authoritative annotated edition {{by the time the}} copyright runs out, which might open the way for neo-Nazi groups to publish their own versions. [...] "Once Bavaria's copyright expires, there is the danger of charlatans and neo-Nazis appropriating this infamous book for themselves," [...] Wolfgang Heubisch said. The Bavarian government opposed the plan, citing respect for victims of the Holocaust. Its Finance Ministry said that permits <b>for</b> <b>reprints</b> would not be issued, at home or abroad. This would also apply to a new annotated edition. The republished book might be banned as Nazi propaganda. Even after expiration of the copyright, the Bavarian government emphasised that [...] "the dissemination of Nazi ideologies will remain prohibited in Germany and is punishable under the penal code".|$|E

2500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of their new-found success and status, the couple formed a production company, [...] "Gloria Films", producing the comedy Three Husbands with Eve Arden and Ruth Warwick, and the film noir the Scarf starring John Ireland and Mercedes McCambridge. [...] Unfortunately, Caspary and Igee forgot {{the first rule of}} finance, [...] "never use your own money", and had put all their own funds and savings into the company. [...] Their films were contracted to United Artists, and when United Artists went into bankruptcy and restructuring in 1950, the films of Gloria Films were tied up in litigation and the couple lost everything. [...] Many small production companies went bankrupt as a result of United Artists' troubles – Caspary could not afford to, as she would have lost future royalties for works she had already written and any payments <b>for</b> <b>reprints</b> of her books. [...] Igee was devastated at the loss, he would never get to be the bread winner of the couple. [...] In December, Caspary drove to MGM and sold them a story treatment for $50,000 dollars, with a 50% advance. [...] In January she sold them another for $45,000 and in February sold one to Paramount for $35,000.
