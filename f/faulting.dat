5|$|Pensford Colliery, {{which opened}} in 1909, had the latest {{equipment}} at the time including coal cutters. It had a red brick winding house, pithead baths and a coal washery. <b>Faulting</b> made coal production expensive and it closed in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Surface scarps due to <b>faulting</b> {{are rarely}} {{observed}} {{in this area}} (due to topography, vegetation, and urbanization); a rare exception {{can be seen at}} Mee Kwa Mooks Park south of Alki Point. This is the site of the West Seattle Fault; the prominent rise there is due to uplift {{on the north side of}} the fault.|$|E
50|$|Major <b>faults</b> {{that may}} result in {{significant}} earthquakes in the Wellington region include the Alpine <b>Fault,</b> and the Marlborough <b>fault</b> system in the South Island, and the Ohariu <b>Fault,</b> Wellington <b>Fault,</b> Wairarapa <b>Fault,</b> Reikorangi <b>Fault,</b> Otaki Forks <b>Fault,</b> and Wairangi <b>Fault</b> in the North Island.|$|R
30|$|According to its <b>fault</b> character, DC microgrids <b>fault</b> {{types are}} pole-to-pole <b>fault</b> and pole-to-ground <b>fault.</b> The pole-to-ground <b>faults</b> {{are the most}} common in {{industrial}} systems [23]. Generally, the <b>fault</b> impedance of pole-to-pole <b>faults</b> is low. However, the <b>fault</b> impedance of pole-to-ground <b>faults</b> can be either low or high. On the other hand, the <b>fault</b> types can be bus <b>fault</b> and feeder <b>fault</b> based on the <b>fault</b> location. As mentioned, the electronic equipment is vulnerable and the tolerance of the over current is finite. The <b>fault</b> would be much severer when the <b>fault</b> location is closer to the energy sources; therefore the bus <b>fault</b> is critical for the whole system. <b>Faults</b> inside VSCs and batteries may cause a pole-to-pole short-circuit <b>fault</b> and these are terminal <b>faults</b> that generally cannot be quickly cleared. In these cases, the devices have to be replaced and using fuses could be a proper choice.|$|R
5000|$|The Kneža <b>Fault</b> ( [...] ; Kneški prelom) is a <b>fault</b> in Slovenia. It strikes NW-SE {{and lies}} {{southwest}} of the Ravne <b>Fault</b> and northwest of the Idrija <b>Fault.</b> Movements along the <b>fault</b> can be constrained to dextral strike-slip.

5|$|The Carnegie Ridge is sliding under Ecuadorian land, causing coastal uplift and volcanism. The ridge's {{movement}} {{may also}} have changed the type of <b>faulting</b> along the coast, causing strike-slip faults (faults that move horizontally past each other). Evidence of this subduction altering the course of <b>faulting</b> is found at the Yaquina fault, which, {{unlike the rest of}} the Panama Basin faults, trends to the west instead of north-south, indicating that the Carnegie Ridge may be colliding with the continental mass of Ecuador. This collision created northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest-trending faults in the region, and with that, caused strong earthquakes in Riobamba in 1797 and Alausi in 1961. Several of the northwest-southeast-trending faults converge in the Inter-Andean Valley where the 1949 Ambato earthquake took place.|$|E
5|$|The Pichilemu {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by the change in regional stress from the 27February earthquake. Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the 11March earthquake locations and seismic-wave radiation patterns suggested that the event resulted from normal <b>faulting</b> within the subducting Nazca plate or the overriding South America plate, unlike the 27 February earthquake, which occurred as thrust <b>faulting</b> on the interface between the two plates. Later in 2010, University of Chile Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the earthquake was produced inside the South American plate. While news media reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake in Chile, a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered it to be an independent earthquake, a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University of Chile also reached.|$|E
5|$|The {{area where}} Armenia lies is of {{interest}} to seismologists and geologists because of the relatively early stage of continental collision occurring there and because the earthquake's strong aftershock sequence and significant surface <b>faulting</b> presented scientists with an environment to study reverse <b>faulting.</b> Twelve days after the mainshock a French-Soviet team installed a temporary seismic network in the epicentral area to record aftershock activity (a separate expedition from the United States also visited the site). The initial portion of work included nearly a full week setting up the seismometers and optimizing their operation and, with that complete, two full weeks of continuous operation was then completed with twenty six seismometers covering an area over 1500 square kilometers. The final stage concluded with seven weeks (through the end of February 1989) of continued monitoring with a reduced capacity of twenty units.|$|E
5000|$|Transform <b>faults</b> {{are closely}} related to transcurrent <b>faults,</b> and are {{commonly}} confused. Both types of <b>faults</b> are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement; however, transform <b>faults</b> end at the junction of another plate boundary or <b>fault</b> type, while transcurrent <b>faults</b> die out without a junction. In addition, transform <b>faults</b> have equal deformation across the entire <b>fault</b> line, while transcurrent <b>faults</b> have greater displacement {{in the middle of the}} <b>fault</b> zone and less on the margins. Finally, transform <b>faults</b> can form a tectonic plate boundary, while transcurrent <b>faults</b> cannot.|$|R
50|$|The {{valley is}} an active {{earthquake}} zone crossed by multiple <b>fault</b> and thrust lines. These include the 20 mi long Frenchman Mountain <b>Fault</b> capable of a magnitude 7 event, Whitney Mesa <b>Fault,</b> Cashman <b>Fault,</b> Valley View <b>Fault,</b> Decatur <b>Fault,</b> Eglington <b>Fault</b> and the West Charleston <b>Fault.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} that two or more <b>faults</b> produce same faulty behavior for all input patterns. These <b>faults</b> are called equivalent <b>faults.</b> Any single <b>fault</b> from the set of equivalent <b>faults</b> can represent the whole set. In this case, much less than k×n <b>fault</b> tests are required for a circuit with n signal line. removing equivalent <b>faults</b> from entire set of <b>faults</b> is called <b>fault</b> collapsing. <b>fault</b> collapsing significantly decreases the number of <b>faults</b> to check.|$|R
5|$|A focal {{mechanism}} {{solution of}} the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes both striking north-south and dipping approximately 45degrees {{to the east and}} to the west. This <b>faulting</b> suggests dip slip reverse motion, and to a horizontal east-west axis of confining stress. The rupture also occurred partially on the New Madrid Fault, responsible for the great New Madrid earthquakes in 1812, consisting of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States.|$|E
5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All <b>faulting</b> in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica is geologically varied, {{dating from}} the Precambrian era, with some rocks formed more than 3billion years ago.

In coastal areas such as Shackleton Range and Victoria Land some <b>faulting</b> has occurred.|$|E
30|$|The <b>fault</b> {{disturbance}} {{scenario is}} conducted by simulating <b>fault</b> occurring {{on the location}} shown in Fig.  2.

The strong ground movements triggered the reactivation of a nearby geological fault, prompting researchers to conduct extensive surveys in the region.|$|E
