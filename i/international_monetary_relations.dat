This relatively new field has moved through a stage of paradigmatic conflict to a largely consensual approach to analysis. The biggest challenge facing the field is understanding the simultaneous interaction of domestic and international factors in determining foreign economic policies and international economic outcomes.

Though the United States military was {{cut to a}} small fraction of its wartime size, America's military-industrial complex that was created during the Second World War was not eliminated. Pressures to [...] "get back to normal" [...] were intense. Congress wanted a return to low, balanced budgets, and families clamored to see the soldiers sent back home. The Truman administration worried first about a postwar slump, then about the inflationary consequences of pent-up consumer demand. The G.I. Bill, adopted in 1944, was one answer: subsidizing veterans to complete their education rather than flood the job market and probably boost the unemployment figures. In the end, the postwar U.S. government strongly resembled the wartime government, with the military establishmentalong with military-security industriesheavily funded.

40|$|In This Article, It Is Argued That the Long International, Financial and Economic Cycle (50 - 60 Years) Is More Than a Statistical Aberration, and Is the Result of Institutional Political, Financial and Economic Conditions Which Are Recurrent.

Such a Breakdown Starts a Process of Unexpected Inflation, of Balance of Payments Imbalances and of International Indebtedness in a Key-Currency. the Last Stage of This Process Is Characterized by Disinflation, a Speculative Stock Market Boom and a Period of Debt-Liquidation Which Negatively Affect the Real Side of the Economy. Without an International and Automatic Mechanism to Correct the Financial and Economic International Imbalances, the World Economy Runs the Risk of Getting More and More Unstable Until the Turning Point.

40|$|Money {{has always}} been a {{difficult}} and complex concept and the views about what money actually is could hardly be more diverse. This is all the more true in the times of completely manipulated irredeemable paper currencies, the functioning of which is based almost completely {{on the extent to which}} people believe in its trustworthiness. The final abolition of Gold as a universal standard of currencies in the early 1970 s at first glance seems to have strengthened the grip of governments on money. Nevertheless, it is often argued that "national currencies" are under threat. According to this view, "monetary sovereignty" is waning, as is sovereignty as a whole. The present paper takes a different view. It argues that "monetary sovereignty" understood as a legal concept remains intact and is not even significantly limited by obligations under public international law. This leaves governments significant leeway in taking decisions regarding the setup of their monetary regime ("sovereignty games") and empirical evidence shows the large number of different options that are actually chosen.
