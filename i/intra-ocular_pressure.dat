40|$|Background: Summarised retinal vessel diameters {{are linked}} to {{systemic}} vascular pathology. Monochromatic images provide best contrast to measure vessel calibres. However, when obtaining images with a dual wavelength oximeter the red-free image can be extracted as the green channel information only which in turn will {{reduce the number of}} photographs taken at a given time. This will reduce patient exposure to the camera flash and could provide sufficient quality images to reliably measure vessel calibres. Methods: We obtained retinal images of one eye of 45 healthy participants.

Early reports stated that <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressures</b> remained low after cataract surgery, but these statements were based on measurements made several days (Hilding, I 955) or weeks after surgery (Miller, Keskey, and Becker, 1957). Applanation measurements made I 2 hours after surgery were reported at or below the preoperative level (Galin, Baras, and Perry, I 96 I). Gormaz (i 962, 1973) first reported ocular hypertension one day after cataract surgery and did not use oc-chymo-trypsin. Giardini and Paliaga (I 964) reported ocular hypertension 8 hours after cataract surgery with a technique which included the use of oc-chymotrypsin.

METHODS: Retrospective review of 93 eyes of 93 patients with medically uncontrolled open-angle glaucoma who underwent NPDS without (n= 69, group 1) or with (n= 24, group 2) autologous scleral implant. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 16 months (range 5 - 36) in group 1 and 15 months (range 4 - 28) in group 2. The mean <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressures</b> (IOP) pre- and postoperatively were, respectively, 23. 8 and 16. 1 mmHg in group 1, and 25. 6 and 15. 8 mmHg in group 2. The absolute success rate was 41 % in group 1 and 54 % in group 2. The qualitative success rate was 83 % in group 1 and 75 % in group 2. An IOP lower than 16 mmHg was obtained in 51 % {{of patients in}} group 1 and 58 % of patients in group 2. A Nd:YAG laser goniopuncture was performed in 30 % of patients in group 1 and 50 % of patients in group 2, and resulted in a better controlled IOP.

Low dose oral prednisolone has not been evaluated in GO. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low dose oral prednisolone in GO. Materials and Methods: A total of 114 consecutive GO patients were screened of which 65 patients with previously untreated moderate-severe GO, clinical activity score (CAS) > 2, without co-morbid states were randomized into treatment Group-A (iv methylprednisolone 0. 5 g for 3 days/month for 4 months) and Group-B (oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks then tapered stopped), and followed-up. Thirty-one patients in each group with at least 1 -year follow-up were analyzed. Responders were defined as improvement in ≥ 1 major response criteria or ≥ 2 minor response criteria. The trial is registered at ctri. nic. in (CTRI/ 2013 / 12 / 004264). Results: At 1 -year, 27 / 31 (87. 10 %) patients were responders in Group-A compared to 17 / 31 (54. 84 %) in Group-B (P = 0. 005). There was a greater improvement in CAS score in patients of Group-A as compared to Group-B (P < 0. 001). Responders (n = 44) had significantly higher baseline <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressures</b> and left eye proptosis as compared to nonresponders.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Valsalva {{retinopathy}} is {{a unilateral}} or bilateral condition {{that occurs when}} increased intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal pressure transmitted to the eye causes a sharp rise in the <b>intra-ocular</b> venous <b>pressure,</b> and rupture of superficial retinal capillaries. The patient often gives a history of a recent strenuous physical act, which could have increased the intra-thoracic pressure. Pregnancy {{is known to be}} a risk factor for Valsalva retinopathy. Case presentation A 23 -year-old woman in her seventh month of pregnancy presented with a history of decreased vision in her left eye of one-week duration. Examination of the affected eye showed best corrected visual acuity of 20 / 50, and fundus examination revealed a pre-retinal hemorrhage located in the macula. Based on clinical findings, the diagnosis of Valsalva retinopathy was made. Conclusion Retinal hemorrhages can be generated by Valsalva maneuvers. Pregnancy is a known risk factor for Valsalva retinopathy; however, the diagnosis should be made only after excluding other causes of retinal hemorrhages. It is a self-limited event. We report a case of Valsalva retinopathy complicating normal pregnancy and confirm that, to date, {{there is no evidence to}} indicate that there is a risk of recurrence following spontaneous vaginal delivery. </p...|$|R

Naito : Acta Societatis Ophthalmologicae Japonicae, 61; 2006 〜 2016, 1957. A Summary of the Whole Series. Influences of various drugs on intra-ocular as well as blood pressure were studied by injecting them into the recessus infundibulum in the hypothalamus in toads. The investigations produced some evidences which suggested that a change of the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> might occure secondarily following a change of the blood pressure. But it also revealed evidences which indicated that the center which exerts control over intraocular pressure {{might not be the}} same as the one which regulates blood pressure. In view of these observations, it would seem that such center might be situated in the hypothalamus, and that <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> might be controlled by this center situated in the diencephalon. It was suggested that the mechanism of function of this center is believed to be as follows: Impulses generated at the center controlling <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> by the injection of drugs into the hypothalamus are transmitted through the autonomic nervous system (chiefly parasympathetic nerve) to the eye; excitation of the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> control center tends to raise <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure,</b> while its depression tends to lower <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure.</b> It was revealed that the telencephalon (the cerebrum) and the pituitary gland, as well as blood pressure, {{play an important role in}} the control of <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure.</b> Report II Investigation on the relationship between the autonomic system and the intra-ocular and blood pressures revealed the following results : A. Electrical Stimulation of the Cervical Sympathetic Nerve 1. A weak electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerve caused a rise in both intra-ocular and blood pressures; the change of the blood pressure occurred immediately after the stimulation, while the rise in the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> slightly lagged behind it. 2. Section of the cardiac branches of the autonomic nervous system Cthe vagosympa thetic nerve) caused slight rise in the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> and fall in the blood pressure. A weak electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerve after the section of the cardiac branches of the autonomic nervous system caused no changes in both intraocular and blood pressures. 3. A powerful electrical stimulation produced a sudden, though temporary rise in the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> immediately after the stimulation, while it raised blood pressure in some toads and lowered it in others. It also caused moderate exophthalmus in all the toads. 4. In toads which had had the cardiac branches of the autonomic nervous system excised, a powerful electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerve produced a marked, though transient rise in <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> with exophthalmus, but produced no marked changes in blood pressure. 5. These observations would suggest that a rise in the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> produced by a weak electrical stimulation caused secondarily to a rise in the blood pressure, and that a rise in <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> occurring upon a powerful electrical stimulation was due to the contraction of the smooth muscle in the eye.

The efficacy of this drug is independent of the aetiology of the glaucomatous condition, a fact which suggests that it interferes with a basic mechanism concerned with the maintenance of <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure,</b> and which has prompted investigations of its action on the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> in normal animals.

40|$|HYPERTONIC {{solutions}} {{have been}} used to reduce the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> in glaucoma since Cantonnet (1904) first used hypertonic salt solution. The effect of different substances was extensively studied by Hertel (1914), who administered many different solutions, including urea, to rabbits, and measured the resulting fall in <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure.</b> Substances used in clinical practice include sucrose, dextrose, and sorbitol, which act by in-creasing the osmotic pressure of the blood; hence it is their concentration in molecules and not their weight in grammes that is significant. The dis-advantages of sucrose are that it has a large molecular weight so that large amounts of it have to be given to exert sufficient osmotic pressure, and that it is also nephrotoxic and diffuses rapidly in the tissues. Dextrose and saline also diffuse in the tissues too rapidly to produce an effect of sufficent duration so that a rebound of <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> quickly occurs. The efficiency of sorbitol is doubtful and it is also said to be nephrotoxic. Bellows, Puntenney, and Cowen (1938) found its effect to be greatest 24 hours after administration, which could not have been due to its osmotic effect. Urea {{has been used as a}} diuretic in cases of oedema and also for reducing the intracranial pressure from various causes (Stubbs and Pennybacker, 1960). The need for an osmotic agent for reducing <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> has been much less since the introduction of carbonic anhydrase inhibitory drugs, but a few patients become resistant or intolerant to these drugs.

40|$|TiE {{relationship}} between changes in pressure {{and changes in}} volume within the eye is of practical importance in the calibration of tonometers and in tonographic calculations, and the coefficient of ocular rigidity, K, proposed by Friedenwald (1937) has been employed generally for these purposes. Contrary to Friedenwald's assertion, {{it has been found}} that this coefficient is not a constant, but varies with <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> in the eyes of rabbits (Perkins and Gloster, 1957 a, b) and of cats (Macri, Wanko, Grimes, and von Sallmann, 1957). In both species, the values of K increased markedly as the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> increased. In view of these findings, it is of considerable importance to determine whether the coefficient of rigidity of human eyes is similarly dependent upon the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure.</b> Little attention has been given to this matter, although MacDonald (1955) produced some tonometric evidence which suggested that scleral rigidity was inversely related to <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> in living human eyes, and McBain (1957) reported that the rigidity of enucleated human eyes decreased as the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> increased. Our observations, which have already been described briefly (Gloster, 1957), are in general agreement with the above findings and this paper gives a fuller account of our results. Methods Two methods for determining ocular rigidity were used-the "volumetric" method (Perkins and Gloster, 1957 a) and the tonometric method (Perkins and Gloster, 1957 b), the latter being quite distinct from the usual differential tono-metric method using two weights, which was found to be completely unreliable. Only dead human eyes have been studied, as both methods necessitate the intro-duction of a needle into the anterior chamber. Some of the measurements were made on eyes which had been rejected for use in corneal grafting and stored at 4 ° C. for 5 to 15 days after enucleation. Other determinations were carried out on cadaver eyes, in situ, between 8 and 14 hours after death. The experiments may be divided into three groups: (A) Enucleated eyes (three); studied by the volumetric method. (B) Enucleated eyes (four); rigidity determined by the tonometric method. (C) Dead eyes in situ (four); studied by the tonometric method...|$|E

In spite of the numerous drugs available, search is continuing for the least toxic and also for one requiring less frequent administration. The present study was carried out to evaluate the action of sustained-release Diamox Sequel (Lederle), produced in a 500 -mg. capsule containing 125 mg. ordinary acetazolamide and 375 mg. sustained-release acetazola-mide, and to compare it with a single dose of ordinary acetazolamide which starts to reduce <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> after 30 to 90 minutes and reaches its maximum in 1 to 5 hours, the duration of action being somewhere between 8 and 12 hours (Leydhecker, 1960). NORMAL EYES (A) Investigation. -The action of a single dose of 500 mg. Diamox Sequel was studied in ten eyes of six patients. This group consisted of patients who were admitted to the eye department and in whom glaucoma was excluded by diurnal ocular tension curves, tonographic studies, visual fields, and a normal appearance of the optic nervehead. Diurnal ocular tension curves were carried out for 48 hours, the <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> being taken first at 6 a. m. (on waking) and then at 3 -hrly intervals during the day until 10 p. m. The patient was then given a test dose of 500 mg. Diamox Sequel and the ocular tension curve was continued for the next 24 hours. The changes in <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> were compared with the pressure before the administration of Diamox at the same time of day. (B) Results. -In all the ten normal eyes tested a fall in <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>pressure</b> * Received for publication November 7, 1960...|$|E
