40|$|This {{volume is}} based on a {{selection}} of papers originally presented at a research conference held 15 - 19 August 1992 to coincide with the National <b>Housing</b> <b>Fair</b> - "Bo 92 " - in Örebro, Sweden. The fair was concentrated on a neighborhood with a newly built housing estate including multi-family housing blocks of different tenures: private, cooperative, and social rented housing. With the reputation of being a forerunner of good multi-family housing, Örebro's showcase estate attracted lively attention as a possible continuation of this record. However, as shown by the introductory chapter, the aim of the research conference was broader than indicated by its spectacular framework. By illuminating crucial dimensions of social rented housing and involving experienced scholars from different countries, it was hoped that the conference would contribute to both the academic and the political debate on the future of social rented housing in Europe. Reflecting the multidisciplinary approach of the conference, the sponsors represent a broad spectrum of interests: the National Association of Housing Companies (SABO), the National <b>Housing</b> <b>Fair</b> B 092 AB (Bomässan B 092), the Swedish Federation of Tenants' Associations (Hyresgästernas Riksförbund), the SwedishCouncil for Building Research (Byggforskningsrädet), and the Swedish Federation of Property Owners (Fastighetsägarförbundet). Maybe this constellation ofpartly mutual, partly conflicting interests in housing also indicates something of the renowned Swedish model of welfare state policy, cautiously maneuvering between the Scylla of state socialism and the Charybdis of neo-classical liberalism.

40|$|Bo 92 - an Investment for the Future. Experience from a Building Exhibition For the 1992 <b>Housing</b> <b>Fair</b> (Bo 92), one of Sweden's housing manufacturers, Boro AB, {{wanted to}} exhibit {{different}} types of houses for different requirements. 28 houses were erected in the area. The main goals {{set up by the}} company for the exhibition were to develop and demonstrate energy efficient, healthy and beautiful manufactured wood-frame houses. Unfortunately, while the houses were being erected, Boro AB went into liquidation, and a new company had to complete the houses in a very short time. The result was that much information was lost, and the ideas and knowledge of the initiators were not fully exploited. Experience from planning, design, construction and use of the 28 detached houses is mixed. Several positive results have been obtained in respect of moisture resistance and healthy houses, although performance has been poorer than planned in respect of energy use. This is due primarily to poor quality control of the construction stage, resulting in turn from the liquidation of the intended manufacturer. Nevertheless, all experience (both positive and negative) that can be drawn, can be seen as an investment for the future. The main factor in ensuring healthy buildings is quality assurance of the entire building process. Good designs need to be correctly built to ensure a successful end result...|$|E

40|$|Mid-century city {{planners}} {{often made}} the ultimate decision {{to determine which}} areas were too "sick" to save, who was allowed access to the new spaces, and who was not. The bias against minorities and anyone who was not considered the perfect tenant {{is evident in the}} three types of documents analyzed in this paper: books on urban planning, city plans and reports, and federal government housing policies. Planners would often use the metaphor of the human body and disease when discussing the "cancerous" slum areas in the city whose only treatment was swift extraction. This very narrow focus of mid-century city planners made them unwilling to see the city as many connecting parts that relied on each other for success. This was especially true in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin as developers quickly removed families out of the East Side neighborhood between Lake Michigan and the downtown area in order to build new, modern office space and residential buildings. However, the East Side plan was only part of the problem concerning discrimination against minorities. Civil rights protests regarding issues like opening <b>housing,</b> <b>fair</b> employment, and neighborhood support played a large role in Milwaukee politics during the 1950 s and 1960 s but many demonstrations were met with violence from opposing white homeowners. When city planners established which neighborhoods were worth treating for urban decay and which would be ignored or removed, they did not consider the ramifications of their actions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{develops}} {{our understanding of}} consumers’ emerging interest in novel mobile services by adopting two approaches. First, structural equation modeling {{is used as a}} statistical tool to create a context-sensitive model for consumer acceptance of novel mobile services. Secondly, the study creates an interpretive framework of contemporary consumer culture to help understand how consumers construct their emerging practices in novel mobile services based on their actual experiences. The empirical data was gathered at a <b>Housing</b> <b>Fair,</b> where a Mobile Fair Diary was piloted, and it is that Mobile Fair Diary application that provides the selected tool of the empirical study. Therefore, real user experience {{played a significant role in}} how our consumers perceived mobile services and the way the cultural discourse was produced. The model developed indicates that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, anxiety, trust and attitude have an impact on consumers’ intention to use mobile services. Furthermore, the various representations related to mobile services were identified in order to understand emerging practices. Consumers are likely to change the routines involved in the management of information if useful alternatives are available to them. An ongoing insecurity emerging from technology change is often a characteristic of the contemporary life of consumers. On the one hand, consumers are dependent on technology, but on the other hand, do not fully understand it. Therefore, consumers have to be active to keep up with the continuous changes going on around them. Furthermore, consumers need support from the service provider and their social context. Consumers should also believe in their own capability to learn and their power to make choices, which will result in changes to their practices...|$|E
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of affordable gesture recognition technology, such as the Microsoft Kinect, interactive displays are making their way toin the wildsetting, or public spaces, largely as information systems. It then becomes essential to delve deeper into users perception of these systems and study the aspects that contribute to a rich and pleasant user experience. In addition to the general principles of interaction design, development and installation of such systems requires an understanding of social affordances or social dynamics between an actor and an audience {{as well as the}} role of an individual within a group. Interaction affordances or, hints and clues about ways to interact with the system, and technology affordances or, capabilities of current technology, also help build a smooth interaction and rich user experience. The system needs to be exciting and enticing for users to initiate interaction yet simple enough to allow fluent interaction without any prior experience. This thesis explores the opportunities and challenges introduced by interactive public displays systems in the wild by presenting a case study of a gesture-based system, Energyland, which was installed at the month long annual Finnish <b>Housing</b> <b>Fair</b> in the summer of 2012, in Vuores, Finland. By analyzing the data collected from the user experience questionnaire, system logs, informal user interviews and observations made by researchers, I discuss my findings and compare them to previous work in this area. Overall, users responded very positively to the system experience as evident from the questionnaire consisting of seven factors: individuality, authenticity, story, contract, interaction, sound and pleasantness of the system. Users also stated their interests towards using similar systems in the future. Based on the system logs and researcher observations, social, interaction and technology affordances are the building blocks of user experience for in the wild systems, and there should be mechanisms to help users overcome an initial reluctance to interact by presenting interesting and intriguing interactive content. A key finding was the user s attitude towards interaction, namely as a risk into the known, which dictates that installation spaces must provide for a quick and easy escape route. The end result of this thesis is a set of guidelines covering the design, implementation and installation process for similar systems involving interactive public displays...|$|E
40|$|Meta Isæus-Berlin at Skissernas museum Many {{visitors}} will surely remember Ett vattenhem (A Water Home), five strikingly ambiguous furnished rooms {{set out on}} a low podium {{in the middle of the}} main walkway at the Bo 01 <b>Housing</b> <b>Fair</b> in Malmö in 2001. The Hall and the Bathroom, at opposite ends of the long and narrow, windowless pavilion, were open to the world and visible from outside. The Bathroom was probably the part of the installation that received most attention; an open room like a life-size doll’s house. The tiled but roofless room contained all the usual bathroom fittings including a mirror, hooks, toilet-paper holder, lamps. There was water here too, far too much of it in fact, though it did not come just from the taps but seemed to be pushed up from below, from the drains, and to run in all directions from the overflowing vessels: the toilet, the basin and the bathtub. It fizzed and foamed and bubbled up as though from a volcanic spring and heaved itself, indeed it poured itself over everything, just as thick and wet as when one spills a bucket of water onto the floor. Like a torrential flood it hurried across the tiled floor and down over a gently rounded step out into a channel that ended in an opening leading to the depths of the earth. The viewers’smiles of recognition assumed a lingering undertone: what was it that one was really witnessing? The Dining Room, a windowless space in the depths of the installation, was a singularly chilly and dismal room with a lean and lonely, dimly illuminated chandelier above a dreary, oval dining table veneered in some dark wood with a cold chair at each end of the table and the ceiling as oppressively low as in a caravan. The tabletop was covered with something that might have been a sunken sheet of glass but was, in fact, ice. Two dinner settings were frozen solidly into the tabletop. The dark, heavy and wet carpet gave off puffs of frozen breath, a white fuzz that swept slowly across the floor down there in the darkness. There was a tall, fateful looking cupboard in the background, broody with aggression and guilt like a Kienholz tableau. Here there is a painful contrast, depicted in the state of the furniture, between the concept of the Swedish word 'hem' (home) as a metaphor for security and the total negation of this security expressed in the substantivized adjective of this word, 'hemsk' (terrific). Like looking into a hellish relationship where everything is reflected in the state of the furniture. In the Living Room the velvet upholstery was seething. Above the soft pile of the velvet, little clouds of cold steam sailed through the atmosphere like an elfish dance at dawn. Perhaps the furniture was giving off this cold, humid mist because it was so replete; a mist that was like old tobacco smoke in a smoking carriage on a train, or some sort of foam from a fire extinguisher that covered everything like a psychoactive drug, threatening to suffocate or drown it. Perhaps it was merely an abandoned summer room in a garden cottage where the furniture was sweating cold humidity as the snow melted outside. And a rug that was as saturated as only a Wilton rug can be. * Characteristic of several of Meta Isæus-Berlin’s installations is the fact that it is sometimes only after a while that one becomes aware that they are not a part of the room’s ‘normal’ furnishings. It appears as though she has taken something that already exists; which is not the case at all. She has produced a highly conscious stage set but a stage set that seems ‘real’. As public art this has a particularly powerful effect. In Meta Isæus-Berlin’s installations the mental expression of everyday objects – something often overlooked – and the social masque that they form part of emerge clearly alongside their trivial and more practically oriented existence. These intense emotional characteristics can seem like the visual, intricate remains of diffuse memories or else they are the heralds of dark experiences: the items were present themselves, they have been shaped, permeated and animated by a social and mental cosmos (or chaos) which, in due course, has sunk into these things where they continue their lives. Whatever it is, henceforth, that they express and hand on can consist of an entire instrumentarium of items that, quite simply, is experienced as the present, physical ‘reality’. Meta Isæus-Berlin employs these objects as a rich, artistic language with deep roots accumulated in many layers down in our consciousness and our memory. The visual language of the objects is recognizable in our own bodily experiences and it immediately strikes us since the objects speak the same wordless language as that of our bodies. The objects in the installations are, like so-called ‘ordinary’ objects, simultaneously active on a number of different levels. This may be a matter of furnishing items that, in everyday life, are often enslaved by being required to be practical or serviceable aids that are subservient to the arbitrariness of the commissioner and constructor. Such objects can have become fully incorporated into their task and have become deformed accordingly and can, over time, almost completely have lost their memory, that is, other memories. What is specific to her artistic use is that these levels can be presented as simultaneous, indistinguishable. They express, illuminate and reinforce each other. In an everyday context our consciousness of the technical functions often displaces the object’s visual expression so that, on many occasions, we are not conscious of the enormous, latent, visual, expressive force that the objects, as materialized language, can have in our day-dreaming memory and consciousness. The exhibition includes a number of sketches and models for Ett vattenhem and for Återblickens transparens (2004), an installation of delicately transparent furniture made of the thinnest organza; hardly materialized at all. The furniture is suspended on thin wires and it moves in slow motion like gentle sounds, diaphanous clouds; yet with slightly threatening unpredictability. The solidity of the furniture has been dissolved. The items are transparent and weightless like certain very old people whose bodies consist mainly of memories and traces of experience. Meta Isæus-Berlin’s sketches, in their intense simplicity, are as expressive as comic strips. The furniture exhibits a forceful integrity and is animated to such an extent that it becomes almost like pictures of people, of human individuals. Some of these characteristics are also apparent in the large paintings that Meta Isæus-Berlin has produced in the last few years. In several ways they would seem to mark a turning point in her art. A characteristic difference is that while the installations work in the public sphere, the paintings inescapably refer to more private contexts. There is often an obvious narrative and dramatic aspect with human figures that interact very expressively; which may well remind one of Munch’s figures though viewed, perhaps, through the freer composition and use of colour typical of the sixties. I find myself most strongly moved by those aspects of the paintings that have most in common with the installations. Where people, temporarily or permanently, have gone from the room but have left behind them a forceful impression in the objects; these human casts for charged memories that then continue to act out human distress on their own. Consider, for example, the painting Implosion with a room whose narrow set has been taken over by so-called "white goods" to such an extent that there is no floor left. Or the hotel beds all pushed together in some petit-bourgeois logistics in front of an overwhelming arrangement of curtains in Varför gjorde de så? [Why did they do that?] Or the row of furniture covered with cloth like an anaesthetic mask in Förberedelse [Preparations] while the walls and the carpet are drowned by slow trickles of diluted paint...|$|E
