5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness {{is that there}} is no generally agreed definition of giftedness. Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants in school gifted education programs. In practice, many school districts in the United States use an IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion in school <b>gifted</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|E

25|$|Measures {{of general}} {{intelligence}} also remain controversial. Early IQ tests were notorious for producing higher IQ scores for privileged races and classes and lower scores for disadvantaged subgroups. Although IQ tests have changed substantially {{over the past}} half century, and many objections to the early tests have been addressed by 'culture neutral' tests (such as the Raven test), IQ testing remains controversial. Regardless of the tests used to identify children for <b>gifted</b> <b>programs,</b> many {{school districts in the}} United States still have disproportionately more White and Asian American students enrolled in their <b>gifted</b> <b>programs,</b> while Hispanic and African American students are usually underrepresented. However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the achievement gap in the United States.|$|E

Intellectually- gifted former participants were compared on academic achievement and extracurricular participation to a comparable group of students who did not participate in any <b>gifted</b> <b>program.</b> No {{significant differences were found between}} the two groups. It was found that former {{participants of}} the <b>gifted</b> <b>program</b> were participating in their areas of giftedness as well as other areas of extracurricular activity. A substantial percentage of former participants were found to be excelling in their participation in extracurricular activities.

A pool of the students that participated in the TEAM program in 2003 - 2004 in the 18 schools selected were identified as the TEAM Sample students. A matching sample was created from 18 public schools in Miami-Dade County that did not implement the TEAM program in 2003 - 2004. The Matching Sample created a match for 806 students in the TEAM sample, for a total of 1612 subjects for the study. ^ This study used a logistical regression design to analyze the relationships of multiple independent variables, including: ethnicity, limited English proficiency, gender, free/reduced lunch status, grade level, reading achievement, mathematics achievement, and participation TEAM on the dependent variables of referral for the <b>gifted</b> <b>program</b> and eligibility into the <b>gifted</b> <b>program.</b> The first analysis found the variables of grade level, participation in TEAM, reading achievement, and mathematics achievement were all significant variables in determining if a student was referred for the <b>gifted</b> <b>program.</b> The second analysis found the variables of grade level, gender, free/reduced lunch status, reading achievement, and mathematics achievement were all significant variables in determining if a student was eligible for the <b>gifted</b> <b>program.</b> ^ Recommendations {{based on the results of}} this study include the expansion of the TEAM program in M-DCPS to include additional grade levels and schools. Additionally, adopting a broadened definition of giftedness and reviewing the screening and placement policies for potentially gifted students is recommended. Adopting multicultural and broader definitions of giftedness and constructing better tools and programs, such as TEAM, for assessing and identifying potential gifted students, represent small steps towards creating equitable education for all students. ...|$|R
