Arabs {{were said to}} use blades which were flexible enough to wrap around the waist and yet hard and sharp so that a falling silk scarf could be cut by an unmoving damask blade.|$|E
50|$|Ahsikent {{occupies}} {{an area of}} {{more than}} 25 hectares. The city was founded between the 3rd - 2nd centuries B.C., and functioned up to 1219 A.D. It has been completely destroyed by Mongolian forces. The city structure consisted of the citadel, Shakhristan - the city itself and the rabad (suburb) of the city. All three {{parts of the city}} have been enclosed by the fortification. The palace of governors and zindan (prison) were situated in the arc. There was a city market, cathedral mosque, and a khouz, erected from baked brick in Shahristan. The craftsmen's area was located in the rabad. Metallurgical production in Ahsiket was known far beyond Central Asia. It was the only place in Central Asia where very high-quality steel - known as Damascus or <b>Damask</b> <b>steel</b> - has been produced. At Ahsikent there was discovered a bath constructed in the 2nd century A.D. After the Mongolian invasion, new Ahsikent arose 5-6 km {{to the west of the}} ancient city. According to historical data, the known poet and historian - Babur, grandson of Amir Temur, was born here.|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{identifying}} attributes of layered steel materials (<b>damask</b> <b>steel)</b> {{with the help}} of mechanical tests. Experimentally verify basic mechanical properties of layered steel and subsequently assessed it in comparison with the values obtained for the classic steel materials. In conclusion, there are listed the possibilities of using multilayer steel materials in technical practice, depending on the economics of production. The <b>damask</b> <b>steel</b> was prepared by forge welding from a packet consisting of 17 layers (9 layers of tool steel 19   133 (ČSN) with the thickness of 6 [*]mm and 8 layers 80 NiCr 11 steel in the form of saw bands with the thickness of 1. 2 [*]mm. The packet was cut into 8 parts, folded 3 times and forged together, which provided <b>damask</b> <b>steel</b> with 136 layers. The resulting steel bars were used to make semi-finished products with the approximate dimensions of the test specimens. For evaluation of mechanical properties were applied the following tests: tensile test, Charpy impact test, hardness and microhardness measurementsThe results of tests proved that the properties of <b>damask</b> <b>steel</b> are dependent not only on the direction led impact quality forge weld layers and content iof nhomogeneities in the place of discord, but also on the quenching and tempering temperature, resp. on the choice of quenching bath, which determine the final structure of steel and the resulting hardness, respectively microhardness...|$|E
6000|$|This was to his son, who, {{with a short}} abrupt {{reply to}} the good-natured {{greeting}} of Sir Reginald, had scrambled down from his saddle, and stood fixing his large gray eyes upon Gaston, whose tall active figure and lively dark countenance seemed to afford him an inexhaustible subject of study. The Squire was presented by name to Sir Philip, received a polite compliment, and replying with a bow, turned to the youth with the ready courtesy of one willing to relieve the shyness of an awkward stranger. [...] "We were but now discussing the merit between <b>damasked</b> <b>steel</b> and chain mail, what opinion do you bring to aid us?" [...] A renewed stare, an inarticulate muttering, and Master Leonard turned away and almost hid {{his face in the}} mane of his horse, whilst his father attempted to make up for his incivility by a whole torrent of opinions, to which Gaston listened with the outward submission due from a Squire, but with frequent glances, accompanied by a tendency to elevate shoulder or eyebrow, which Eustace understood full well to convey that the old gentleman knew nothing whatever on the subject.|$|R
40|$|The work {{deals with}} {{original}} measurement of fatigue properties of formed layered steel material – <b>damask</b> <b>steel.</b> This is a material that exhibits a fine micro-structure {{as well as}} a regular composition of many material layers with complementary properties. The article experimentally verifies high-cycle fatigue properties of layered steel and evaluates them {{from the point of view}} of fatigue tests of conventional steel materials and a parallel application of a non-destructive – acoustic emission – testing. Finally, it discusses the influence of production on fatigue strength and the possibilities of using multi-layered steel materials in technological practice. A serious result of this pilot experiment is the fact documented no only by the fractographic observation, but mainly by the AE records that the fatigue service life of this material is high if it its not stressed by tension approximating the yield point Re. However, such stress is not common in practical use of tools made of <b>damask</b> <b>steel</b> and thus under common bending stress an exceptionally long service life of tools made of this type of material is demonstrable. The fact that <b>damask</b> <b>steel</b> behaves like a homogeneous material is mainly confirmed by the records of the AE signal at lower values of stress σa. When stressed by higher amplitudes of tension σa damask responds in AE records similarly to a laminate material that is stressed by bending...|$|E
