5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} to generally positive reviews. Several writers praised {{it as the}} band's finest work, and multiple publications ranked {{it as one of}} the best albums of 2000. British rock magazine Kerrang! went on to include it on its list of the best albums of the decade. In the US, <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> was not as commercially successful as the band's preceding records, debuting at number 13 on the Billboard 200. However, it became their most successful album internationally, debuting in the top twenty of numerous national charts. It was certified gold in several countries, including Canada, Japan, Switzerland and the UK.|$|E
5|$|The {{tolerance}} of violence within mainstream American {{culture is the}} central theme of the record, which takes a critical look at the roles gun culture, conservative American Christianity, and traditional family values play in the glorification of violence. A substantive portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view {{that the image of}} his crucifixion became the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against the credibility of the Bible's content, for the purpose of <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood,</b> he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain by entities such as the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|Industry forecasters {{predicted}} that The Golden Age of Grotesque was on course {{to become the}} band's second number one album on the Billboard 200, following 1998's Mechanical Animals, with estimated first-week sales of around 150,000 copies. The album debuted at number one with first week sales of over 118,000 copies, {{at the time the}} lowest opening week total for a number one-debuting studio album since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data in 1991. This figure was just 1,000 copies more than the first week sales of <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood,</b> which debuted at number thirteen in November 2000. Sales of the album dipped to 45,000 copies on its second week, resulting in a positional drop on the Billboard 200 to number 21. This broke the record previously held by Nine Inch Nails' 1999 album The Fragile for the largest drop from number one in the chart's history. The Golden Age of Grotesque held this record until Incubus' Light Grenades dropped to number 37 in December 2006. As of November 2008, the album has sold 526,000 copies in the US, making it the lowest-selling number one-debuting studio album of 2003. This was the second year the band achieved this, after Mechanical Animals became the lowest-selling number one-debuting studio album of 1998. It also entered the Canadian Albums Chart at number one, selling 11,500 copies on its first week.|$|E

500|$|<b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was {{released}} on November 11, 2000 by Nothing and Interscope Records. [...] A rock opera concept album, it is the final installment of a triptych which also included Antichrist Superstar (1996), and marked {{a return to the}} industrial metal style of the band's earlier work, after the glam rock-influenced production of Mechanical Animals (1998). After its release, the band's eponymous vocalist said that the overarching story within the trilogy is presented in reverse chronological order: <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood,</b> therefore, begins the narrative.|$|E
6000|$|Rumours {{had reached}} them {{that someone had}} escaped from Bonsa Town; {{they thought it was}} the Mungana. Fahni asked who had brought the rumour, whereon the headman {{answered}} that it came [...] "in a dream," [...] and would say no more. Then he demanded the canoe which had been promised to him and his people, and the headman admitted that it was ready in accordance with orders received from the Asika, but demurred to letting him have it. A long argument followed, in the midst of which Fahni and his men got into the canoe, the headman apparently not daring to use force to prevent him. Just as they were pushing off a messenger arrived from Bonsa Town, reeling with exhaustion and his tongue hanging from his jaws, who called out that it was the white man who had escaped with his servant and the Mungana, and that although they were believed to be still hidden in the <b>holy</b> <b>woods</b> near Bonsa Town, none were to be allowed to leave the bay. So the headman shouted to Fahni to return, but he pretended not to hear and rowed away, nor did anyone attempt to follow him. Still it was only after nightfall that he dared to put the boat about and return to the headland to pick up Alan and the others as he had promised. That was all he had to say.|$|R
50|$|Returning to the {{branching}} story line, a party {{allied with}} the Queen is forced to fight the King, and on the more difficult game settings, his lover Rebecca. As vampires, {{the two of them}} may only be damaged by <b>holy</b> stakes of <b>wood</b> and <b>holy</b> water. After his death, the spirit of the King relates his struggle, and then disappears.|$|R
50|$|During prayer, {{it is the}} Jaʻfarī {{view that}} it is {{preferable}} to prostrate on earth, leaves that are not edible or wood, as these three things are considered purest by Muhammad in hadith specifically mentioning Tayammum. Hence many Shīʻa use a turbah, a small tablet of soil, often taken from the ground of a <b>holy</b> site, or <b>wood</b> during their daily prayers upon which they prostrate.|$|R
500|$|Retrospective {{commentary}} on the album has been highly positive. In November 2010, Kerrang! published a tenth-anniversary commemorative issue dedicated to <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> titled Screaming For Vengeance, calling it [...] "Manson's finest hour". In 2014, Metal Hammer identified the album as a modern classic, calling it the band's [...] "creative zenith". Manson said in a June 2015 Reddit AMA that he considered the record to be his best work, and, that same month, NME {{referred to it as}} the band's best album. A 2016 feature in Houston Press called <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> [...] "the album that really cemented the band as more than just shock-rockers, but true musical mavericks with an intelligent perspective on social issues." [...] Metal Hammer referred to the record as [...] "perfect", saying: [...] "Manson has yet to better <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> and that's fine—nobody's really bettered it. The flow of the record, the delivery of its concept, the clarity with which it strikes its opponents. A gargantuan artistic feat that will {{go down in history as}} Manson's defining statement." ...|$|E
500|$|Abandoning {{his attempt}} to bring <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> to the screen, Manson {{announced}} plans to publish two books accompanying the album. The first was a [...] "graphic and phantasmagoric" [...] novel intended for release shortly after the album by ReganBooks (a division of HarperCollins). The novel's style was inspired by William S. Burroughs, Kurt Vonnegut, Aldous Huxley and Philip K. Dick, and would {{be followed by a}} coffee table book of images created for the project. In a December 2000 interview with Manson, novelist Chuck Palahniuk mentioned the <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> novel (due for release in spring 2001) and complimented its style. Neither book has been released, reportedly due to a publishing dispute.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, mainstream media widely reported that its perpetrators were wearing the band's T-shirts during the rampage, and had been influenced by their music. As their first release after the massacre, the record was Manson's rebuttal to the accusations leveled against him and the group, and was described by the vocalist as a [...] "declaration of war". It was written in the singer's former home in the Hollywood Hills and recorded in several undisclosed locations, including Death Valley and Laurel Canyon. His ambitions for <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> initially included an eponymous film exploring its backstory—a project which has since been abandoned and was modified into the as-yet-unreleased <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> novel.|$|E
5000|$|Wood {{has become}} {{well known for}} her {{patented}} invention of spray-on skin for burn victims, a treatment which is being continually developed. Where previous techniques of skin culturing required 21 days to produce enough cells to cover major burns, Wood has reduced the period to five days. Through research, she found that scarring is greatly reduced if replacement skin could be provided within 10 days. As a burns specialist the <b>Holy</b> Grail for <b>Wood</b> is [...] "scarless woundless healing".|$|R
50|$|After {{eliminating}} the physical form of Xorphitus, they enter a final {{meeting with the}} King. If the party disbelieved the Queen and discarded the cross, the King relates to the party his struggles with a life of no emotion, and then kills himself by thrusting a <b>holy</b> stake of <b>wood</b> into his own heart. Rebecca appears afterward, and asks the party {{to take care of}} both the Cosmic Forge and her half-brother, the dragon Bela, who was born of an affair between the Queen and the Vicar.|$|R
50|$|Today, the art {{continues}} to be a major source of income for Bethlehem's Palestinian Christian residents and is the most profitable tourist product in the city with the main purchasers being Christian pilgrims visiting in Christmas time.

Olive <b>wood</b> branches are supplied by olive groves in nearby villages {{as well as from the}} Nablus and Tulkarm region, despite the difficulty of transportation in the West Bank.|$|R
500|$|The {{record is}} {{primarily}} an industrial metal album, {{although it has}} also been described as hard rock, and gothic rock. The vocalist claimed in a pre-release interview with Kerrang! that the album would contain some of the heaviest material the band had recorded to date. <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> combines the glam rock-influenced production of Mechanical Animals with the industrial rock soundscape of the band's earlier work. He also called the record [...] "arrogant, in an art rock sense" [...] and said that, {{as a result of the}} lyrical content, most of the songs contained three or four distinct parts, although the band took great care to avoid being [...] "self-indulgent". He also said that the record was intended to be the [...] "industrial White Album", and that he wrote <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> in the same house where The Rolling Stones wrote their 1970 single [...] "Let It Bleed"—another source of inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Antichrist Superstar {{features}} elaborate artwork. Images in {{the booklet}} consist of various medical diagrams and Kabbalah symbols, a visual worm-to-angel metamorphosis, {{as well as}} references to verses one through five of Revelation 12, and liner notes—a note found under the lyrics of [...] "Irresponsible Hate Anthem" [...] claim the song was recorded live on February 14, 1997, despite the album being released in October 1996. After the release of <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) in 2000, Manson revealed that Antichrist Superstar formed a conceptual trilogy alongside both the aforementioned album and 1998's Mechanical Animals. He explained that the trilogy was an autobiographical story told in a reverse timeline (chronologically reverse from their release dates), with the storyline beginning on <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood,</b> followed by Mechanical Animals, and Antichrist Superstar acting as its conclusion. Furthermore, although Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals made sense as individual concept albums, there was an overarching story running through each release.|$|E
500|$|Like Antichrist Superstar before it, <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> uses a song cycle structure, {{dividing}} the album into four movements. These movements are titled A: In the Shadow, D: The Androgyne, A: Of Red Earth, and M: The Fallen. Manson described the record as [...] "the final {{piece of a}} triptych that I began with Antichrist Superstar." [...] Despite being {{the last of the}} three albums to be released, Manson explained that the triptych's storyline takes place in reverse chronological order; <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> began the story, and Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar were sequels. The storyline unfolds in a multi-tiered series of metaphors and allusions; for example, the album's title refers not only to the Hollywood Sign, but also to [...] "the tree of knowledge that Adam took the first fruit from when he fell out of paradise, the wood that Christ was crucified on, the wood that [...] Oswald's rifle is made from, and the wood that so many coffins are made of." ...|$|E
5000|$|Since {{at least}} the late 19th century, it has been {{attributed}} with a supernatural ability to heal those who drink from it and traditionally believed to be fashioned from {{a piece of the}} True Cross. By the early 20th century, it had become a candidate - one of at least 200 in Europe - for the <b>Holy</b> Grail. Juliette <b>Wood,</b> a folklorist specialising in medieval folklore and Celtic mythology, has stated that there is [...] "no credible reference" [...] to the cup prior {{to the end of the}} 19th century and [...] "no mention of possible connections to the Grail until 1905." ...|$|R

50|$|Ryan, JD, and Mike {{formed the}} band with their friend Mark in 2000. In their early days, {{the band played}} clubs such as Piezano's Pizza, St. Margaret's Church, and the Crabcake Factory in Annapolis, Maryland, <b>Wood's</b> <b>Holy</b> Grounds in Severna Park, Maryland, and My Brother's Place in Waldorf, Maryland. In 2001 they {{supported}} Good Charlotte at a show sponsored by 99.1 WHFS. It took place at Arundel High School {{as a reward for}} the amount of canned food the students (headed by the Arundel Key Club) had collected for the needy in Maryland. Often plagued by comparisons to Good Charlotte's sound (and hooks) when Good Charlotte was signed in 2001 the pressure was on for Wakefield to get a deal. The final push came when Good Charlotte's original drummer Aaron Escolopio, fired from Good Charlotte to play with his brother, singer Ryan Escolopio in Wakefield. The band played their first show with Aaron on the drums at the famous club CBGB in New York on June 6, 2001. During their early years, the band toured with Catch 22 and Mighty Mighty Bosstones.|$|R
500|$|A rock {{opera and}} a concept album, {{it was the}} first {{installment}} in a trilogy which included succeeding releases Mechanical Animals (1998) and <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) (2000). The band supported the album with the controversial [...] "Dead to the World Tour", which was heavily criticized by elements of the Christian right. Nearly every North American venue the band visited during the tour was picketed by religious organizations, mainly as a result of unfounded, exaggerated claims of onstage drug abuse, bestiality, and satanic rituals including animal and human sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|The band {{received}} acclaim for {{the quality}} of their songwriting. Daniel Durchholz of Wall of Sound called <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> their most ambitious and musically accomplished record to date. LA Weekly said that [...] "almost all [...] contain a double-take chord change or a textural overdose or a mind-blowing bridge, and they'll be terroristic in concert." [...] Hot Press praised the band for their inventive musical arrangements, and said that [...] "Holy Wood is a far better record than many would have dared to expect." [...] Drowned in Sound rated the album 10 out of 10 and praised the band's performance, saying that they [...] "play tighter than [...] before (looking at the credits show it to be much more of a team effort)... and, musically, it has a lot more variation and scope than the Limp Bizkits of the world." [...] The band's vocalist was also applauded for his lyricism; Barry Walters of Rolling Stone commended him for [...] "addressing real-life issues with a theatrical verve and genuine vitriol that no other mainstream act can match." [...] Billboard magazine was similarly impressed, calling Manson one of the most skilled lyricists of his generation. Revolver editor Christopher Scapelliti compared his lyrics to those of John Lennon's, writing: [...] "What comes across loudest on the album is not the music, but the sense of injury expressed in Manson's lyrics. Like Plastic Ono Band, <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> screams with a primal fury that's evident even in its quietest moments." ...|$|E
500|$|Andy Gill of The Independent awarded Born Villain {{their lowest}} rating of one star out of five. He criticized Manson's lyrics as being hate-filled and suggested: [...] "If {{he tried to}} find {{something}} he liked, he might actually make something worth listening to." [...] Conversely, a review by Simon Price for that publication's sister edition, The Independent on Sunday, gave the album their top score of five stars, saying that it [...] "features some of his finest lyrics yet and, musically, it often approaches the heyday of <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> and Mechanical Animals. It is, then, something approaching the 'stunning return to form' of rock-crit cliché." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} Germanic {{places of worship}} {{has long been a}} subject of {{scholarly}} debate. Tacitus famously wrote in Germania:The Germans do not think it in keeping with the divine majesty to confine gods within walls or to portray them in the likeness of any human countenance. Their <b>holy</b> places are <b>woods</b> and groves, and they apply the names of deities to that hidden presence which is seen only by the eye of reverence. There are in fact several sites in the historical period at which heathen rites apparently took place in the open, including Hove in Trøndelag, Norway, where offerings were apparently brought to images of the gods on a row of ten posts, but no trace of buildings was found. Yet Tacitus himself wrote of an image of Nerthus. And in his Annals he refers to a temple of Tanfana. Most older scholars considered that a hof would be a dedicated temple: an independent sacred place, built specifically for ritual proceedings, comparable to a Christian church. By extension, it was also commonly believed that the hofs had been located on the same sites as the churches that had superseded them.|$|R
500|$|The central {{character}} is the ill-fated protagonist Adam Kadmon—a name {{derived from the}} Kabbalah which means [...] "original man". Adam travels from Death Valley to <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood.</b> Idealistic and naive, he attempts a revolution, which is usurped and consumed by Holy Wood's ideology of [...] "guns, God and government", {{as well as its}} culture of perpetual violence: whereby fame is the primary moral value of a religion deeply rooted in celebrity worship and martyrdom. In this religion, known as [...] "Celebritarianism", dead celebrities are revered as saints, and John F. Kennedy is idolized as a modern Jesus Christ. Holy Wood's religion parallels Christianity, in that it juxtaposes the dead-celebrity phenomenon in American culture with the crucifixion of Jesus.|$|E
500|$|Eschewing the lyrical {{depth and}} volume of {{symbolism}} found on <b>Holy</b> <b>Wood</b> (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) (2000), {{the album is}} relatively straightforward: its lyrical content primarily deals with relationships, and, in an extended metaphor, Manson compares his own often-criticized work to the Entartete Kunst banned by the Nazi regime. The record utilizes the narrative mode of stream of consciousness as Manson attempts to examine {{the response of the}} human psyche during times of crisis, particularly focusing on the mindset of lunatics and children. These were of particular interest to the vocalist, as [...] "they don't follow the rules [...]" [...] Several songs incorporate elements commonly found in playground chants and nursery rhymes, which Manson would [...] "pervert into something ugly and lurid." ...|$|E
