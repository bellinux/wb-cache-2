500|$|The album's artwork is a computer-generated {{collage of}} images and text created by Stanley Donwood and Yorke, the latter {{credited}} under the pseudonym [...] "The White Chocolate Farm". Yorke commissioned Donwood {{to work on a}} visual diary alongside the recording sessions. Yorke explained, [...] "If I'm shown some kind of visual representation of the music, only then do I feel confident. Up until that point, I'm a bit of a whirlwind." [...] The blue-and-white palette was, according to Donwood, the result of [...] "trying to make something the color of bleached bone." [...] The image of two stick figures shaking hands appears in the booklet and on the compact disc itself. Yorke explained the image as emblematic of exploitation: [...] "Someone's being sold something they don't really want, and someone's being friendly because they're trying to sell something. That's what it means to me." [...] Explaining the artwork's themes, Yorke said, [...] "It's quite sad, and quite funny as well.

500|$|... "Bedtime Story" [...] is an {{electronic}} song, a notable {{departure from the}} other tracks on its parent album, which are more R and new jack swing-driven. Unlike Madonna's more up-tempo, melodic work, the song is slower and has less melody but a more complex rhythmic structure. It has an ambient-influenced tone, with a [...] "pulsating" [...] and a [...] "deep, bubbling" [...] house beat. There are stylistic comparisons to acid house music with its [...] "skeletal" [...] synth arrangement, influences of minimal trance, as well as techno. The song's instrumentation is synthesized, consisting of drum machine loops, organs, strings, gurgles, handclaps, {{as well as a}} digitally-altered [...] "homophonic" [...] choir. According to sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] is written in the key of G minor and has a moderate tempo of 108 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals span from the nodes of A3 to G5 and follows a basic sequence of Gm9–Dm–E–A–G as its chord progression. The song is linked to the ending of the previous album track, [...] "Sanctuary", and starts with its chords. The ending of the track has a pulsating beat and a mix of the lead synth, with Madonna's voice whimpering and uttering [...] "Ha-ha-aahs". It ends abruptly saying [...] "And all that you've ever learned, try to forget, I'll never explain again" [...] making the listener believe that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> part of a dream.|$|E

The history of this schism and the reconstruction of the ideological collisions that made such a catastrophe possible became the subject matter of her memoirs The Living Faces (Живые лица, 1925). While Blok (the man whom she famously refused her hand in 1918) saw the Revolution as a 'purifying storm', Gippius was appalled by the 'suffocating dourness' of the whole thing, seeing it as one huge monstrosity [...] "leaving one with just one wish: to go blind and deaf."

[...] "I {{thought it would}} be interesting to play a gangster, maybe for the first time in the movies, who wasn't like those bad guys Edward G.

[...] Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but he declined it, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (after George C. Scott for Patton). He boycotted the award ceremony, instead sending American Indian rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who appeared in full Apache attire, to state Brando's reasons, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} season, Henry continued featuring predominantly at full-back, but {{appeared to}} {{have a much more}} attacking role in the side. He scored his third ever goal for Stevenage in a 2–0 win over Eastbourne Borough in September 2009, lashing the ball high into the net after good work on the overlap. The season proved to be a successful one for Henry, playing 48 times in total, scoring once – as Stevenage won promotion to the Football League {{for the first time in}} the club's history. At the end of the season, Henry signed a new two–year contract with the Hertfordshire club. At the Football Conference's Annual Presentation Dinner, he was named in the Conference Premier Team of the Year, alongside fellow Stevenage defenders Scott Laird and Mark Roberts. Henry made his 250th appearance in all competitions for Stevenage during the club's 0–0 draw at home to Torquay United, Stevenage's first clean sheet of the 2010–11 season. Manager Graham Westley said [...] "he's a stalwart. He's been a tremendous servant for the club over the years. He's helped the club from where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way in to the Football League". Henry played a total of 51 games during the club's first ever season in the Football League, a season that witnessed Stevenage earn promotion to League One via the 2010–11 League Two play-offs. He was almost ever present at right-back during the campaign, playing a key role in the club having the best defensive record in the division.|$|E
2500|$|New South Wales had won 10 Sheffield Shields on the trot - {{though they}} would be ousted by Victoria {{by the end of}} the season - and had a team that was {{stronger}} than most Test sides; captain Richie Benaud, vice-captain Neil Harvey, Bobby Simpson, Grahame Thomas, Norm O'Neill, Brian Booth, Alan Davidson, Ray Flockton, Johnny Martin and Frank Misson. Ted Dexter won the toss and batted of course, but the MCC innings hinged on Geoff Pullar's 132. Even that was lucky as the Lancashire opener edged the ball to Simpson in the first over who dropped it, just to show that even the best slip fielders are not infallible. Pullar continued to struggle and give other chances, but he put this behind him and stuck to his work, which was just as well as only Dexter (42) and Cowdrey (50) stayed to help him out. 180/2 sank to 303/9 thanks to Benaud (3/61) and Martin (4/122), but tailend [...] "George" [...] thumped 30 to bring the total up to 348 a few minutes before stumps. Thomas survived one ball from Fred Trueman, successfully appealed for light and they all trooped back to the pavilion. On the second day Dexter resorted to his negative tactics of bowling on the leg stump with an on-side field, which was meant to restrict strokeplay. In this he failed as New South Wales rattled up 408/5 in the day, causing Benaud the remark that he had better change his way of thinking. Grahame Thomas was quickly bowled by Trueman (1/45), who then left the field with fibrositis and the MCC bowling attack lost all its bite. Simpson made 110 – his fourth hundred in four matches – and added 234 for the second wicket with Norm O'Neill, who had lost a few pounds and overcame his bad form to make 143 like a man on a mission. Booth (41), Harvey (63), Davidson (55), Flockton (62 not out) and Benaud (40 not out) kept the scoreboard moving at a fair rate and Benaud declared during the lunch break on the third day having made 124 runs in that morning to bring the total to 532/6. Davidson (1/11) removed David Sheppard for 7 and then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> spinners. Benaud took his best first class innings haul of 18-10-18-7 and Martin (2/32) picked up the wickets of Dexter and Cowdrey as the tourists crumbled to 104 all out to lose by an innings and 80 runs. It was New South Wales first innings victory over the MCC, and by definition their greatest victory over the English tourists.|$|E
