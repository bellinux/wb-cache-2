5|$|Major Hans-Günther von Kornatzki {{had formed}} an <b>experimental</b> <b>unit</b> to {{evaluate}} {{new methods of}} bomber attack. Sturmstaffel 1 consisted entirely of volunteers trained to engage the enemy bombers in extremely close quarters, utilising specially armed and up-armored Fw 190's (so-called Sturmböcke) or Battering Rams). These were intended to attack the bombers from the rear in tight arrowhead formations, closing to extreme close range, as replacements for the formerly-dedicated Zerstörer twin-engined heavy fighters, which themselves were being shot down in ever-increasing numbers by Allied escort fighters. In January 1944, the 18 Staffel unit was transferred to Dortmund where they were subordinated to Major Rudolf-Emil Schnoor and his I./JG 1.|$|E

Initially they were engaged in moderately high level (about 10 000ft.) night bombing, with 67 trips during that summer, mainly to Berlin. Soon after, Nos. 105 and 139 Squadron bombers were widely used by the RAF Pathfinder Force, marking targets for the main night-time strategic bombing force.|$|E

25|$|The week-long Battle of Hamburg in July 1943 proved {{disastrous}} for the Luftwaffe, {{when the first}} use of Window by Bomber Command knocked out the Himmelbett radar defence system. Window jammed the GCI system, airborne radar sets, gun-laying radar and searchlight controls and British losses to Flak and night-fighters declined. The raids were aided by fortunate weather conditions resulting in a firestorm. As a result, every other promising measure of preventing such a recurrence was considered and Hermann's proposal was put into effect. His original <b>experimental</b> <b>unit</b> was rapidly expanded into Jagdgeschwader 300.

He became Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance on 2 May 1854 and in that capacity was responsible for checking the artillery component sent {{to take part in the}} Crimean War under Lord Raglan personally ensuring that every battery was despatched from the United Kingdom to the front in a high state of efficiency. He also founded the facility that was to become the Royal Artillery <b>Experimental</b> <b>Unit</b> at Shoeburyness.

500|$|The Comet 3, which flew for {{the first}} time on 19 July 1954, was a Comet 2 {{lengthened}} by [...] and powered by Avon M502 engines developing [...] The variant added wing pinion tanks, and offered greater capacity and range. The Comet 3 was destined to remain a development series since it did not incorporate the fuselage-strengthening modifications of the later series aircraft, and was not able to be fully pressurised. Only two Comet 3s began construction with G-ANLO, the only airworthy Comet 3, demonstrated at the Farnborough SBAC Show in September 1954. The other Comet 3 airframe was not completed to production standard and was used primarily for ground-based structural and technology testing during development of the similarly sized Comet 4. Nine additional Comet 3 airframes were not completed and their construction was abandoned at Hatfield. In BOAC colours, G-ANLO was flown by John Cunningham in a marathon round-the-world promotional tour in December 1955. As a flying testbed, it was later modified with Avon RA29 engines fitted, as well as replacing the original long-span wings with reduced span wings as the Comet 3B and demonstrated in British European Airways (BEA) livery at the Farnborough Airshow in September 1958. Assigned in 1961 to the Blind Landing <b>Experimental</b> <b>Unit</b> (BLEU) at RAE Bedford, the final testbed role played by G–ANLO was in automatic landing system experiments. When retired in 1973, the airframe was used for foam arrester trials before the fuselage was salvaged at BAE Woodford, to serve as the mock-up for the Nimrod.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the uniformity trial size for estimating the optimum plot size in order to evaluate the fruit mass of tomato, snap-beans and zucchini. The mass of fruits was evaluated in uniformity trials with tomato grown in plastic tunnel in spring-summer and autumn-winter seasons, with snap-beans in plastic greenhouse in autumn-winter season and, with zucchini in plastic greenhouse in summer-autumn and winter-spring seasons. These data were used for planning different sizes of uniformity trials and resampling with replacement was used to estimate the optimum plot size by the method of maximum curvature of the coefficient of variation model. The size of uniformity trials influences the estimation of the optimum plot size for evaluating the mass of fruits of tomato, snap-beans and zucchini. Uniformity trials with tomato with 12 basic <b>experimental</b> <b>units</b> (12 plants) and with snap-beans with 21 basic <b>experimental</b> <b>units</b> (42 plants) are enough for estimating the optimum plot size for evaluating the mass of fruits in plastic tunnel with a confidence interval of 95 % minor or equal to two basic <b>experimental</b> <b>units.</b> Uniformity trials with snap-beans with 18 basic <b>experimental</b> <b>units</b> (36 plants) and with zucchini with ten basic <b>experimental</b> <b>units</b> (ten plants) in plastic greenhouse are enough for estimating the optimum plot size for evaluating the mass of fruits with a confidence interval of 95 % minor or equal to three basic <b>experimental</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
