5|$|Because New Jersey {{had been}} {{recalled}} for {{service in the}} Vietnam War her modernization differed from her sisters {{for a number of}} reasons. When reactivated in 1967 New Jersey had her 20mm Oerlikon and 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns removed, and received improved <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> capabilities. This alteration helped reduce the time it took get New Jersey recommissioned: since she was not in her World War II format the only major physical alteration to New Jersey involved the removal of four of her ten 5inch gun mounts {{to make room for the}} Armored Box Launchers. In addition to saving time, this also made New Jersey cheaper to reactivate since the cost needed to modernize the battleship only included the addition of missile and gun system mounts, <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> suites, and improved radar and gun spotter technology.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{an annual}} Fighter Weapons Instructor Course (FWIC) run by No.410 Squadron, and a Fighter <b>Electronic</b> <b>Warfare</b> and Advanced Radar (FEWAR) Course. The intense and highly {{challenging}} FWIC lasts for three months. Each operational CF-18 squadron and tactical radar squadron sends candidates (eight students per course) who graduate with the leadership qualities and expertise required {{to return to their}} squadrons and design tactical training programs themselves. The Advanced Radar Course is conducted in two phases: ground school at 4 Wing, Cold Lake, and a flying phase at an <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> range. This three-week course is designed to allow ten pilots annually to graduate and return to their squadrons as <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> experts and instructors. Since No.410 Squadron has always had some of the most experienced CF-18 pilots in the fighter community, it is often charged with carrying out special fighter projects. The squadron conducted the operational testing and evaluation of the CF's precision guided munitions, and in 2010 was anticipating testing the use of night vision devices in the Hornet.|$|E
50|$|The squadron's {{activities}} included {{support of}} major fleet exercises, including training in antiair <b>warfare,</b> <b>electronic</b> countermeasures and electronic counter-counter-measures, electronic surveillance, electronic emissions control, {{and training in}} the face of simulated missile attacks.|$|R
5000|$|One early test of <b>electronic</b> space <b>warfare,</b> the {{so-called}} Starfish Prime test, {{took place in}} 1962, when the United States exploded a ground-launched nuclear weapon in space to test the effects of an electromagnetic pulse. The result was a deactivation of many then-orbiting satellites, both American and Soviet. The deleterious and unfocused effects of the EMP test led to the banning of nuclear weapons in space in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. (See High altitude nuclear explosion.) ...|$|R
50|$|World War I {{emerges as}} the {{struggle}} between the 'out-pirates' (<b>electronic</b> and chemical <b>warfare)</b> and the 'in-pirates' (electromagnetics). This change from the visible to the invisible forced the Great Pirates to rely on experts, which causes {{the end of the}} Great Pirates (who previously had been the only ones that were truly multi-disciplined).|$|R
5|$|F-22 Flying Testbed – {{the first}} 757 built {{was used in}} 1998 as a testbed for Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor {{avionics}} and sensor integration. The Boeing-owned aircraft was fitted with a canard above its cockpit to simulate the jet fighter's wing sensor layout, along with a forward F-22 fuselage section with radar and other systems, and a 30-seat laboratory with communication, <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare,</b> identification, and navigation sensors.|$|E
5|$|Since 1942 {{research}} and development into physics and electronics has been {{the major source of}} employment in Malvern when during World War II the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) moved from Worth Matravers on the south coast for safety from enemy action. Its staff worked on airborne radar and other <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> resources for the RAF.|$|E

It provides a comprehensive background to the subject {{and at the same time}} describes some novel algorithms. It also investigates application value and performance-related parameters of compressive sensing in scenarios such as direction finding, spectrum monitoring, detection, and classification...|$|R
50|$|Since the 1990s the Navy {{has grown}} in {{importance}} as the emphasis of the ROC's military doctrine moves towards countering a possible People's Republic of China (PRC) blockade, as well as offshore engagement. The ROCN has been working hard to expand its capability in <b>electronic</b> and anti-submarine <b>warfare,</b> {{as well as the}} replacement of its current antiquated fleet. However local shipbuilder CSBC still lacks the technology to build modern submarines.|$|R
50|$|No. 515 Squadron RAF was a {{squadron}} of the Royal Air Force formed during the Second World War. It ushered in <b>Electronic</b> countermeasures (ECM) <b>warfare,</b> jamming enemy radar installations from October 1942 as the only such squadron in the RAF initially. Later in the war 515 Sqn was joined by other squadrons as part of No. 100 Group RAF. The squadron disbanded after VE day, when {{the need for such}} a specialised squadron had reduced.|$|R
5|$|Egypt is a {{prolific}} operator of the Sea King, using many different variants {{for a wide}} variety of purposes. In addition to operating ASW Sea Kings for coastal patrols, Egypt procured a land-based transport adapted from the basic Sea King, marketed by Westland as the Commando, including a VIP subvariant. An <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> version was also deployed by the Egyptian Air Force, featuring sophisticated onboard jamming systems. As of 2011, 23 Sea Kings/Commandos remain in service with Egypt.|$|E
5|$|F-16V: At the 2012 Singapore Air Show Lockheed Martin {{unveiled}} {{plans for}} the new F-16V variant with the V suffix for its Viper nickname. It is to feature an {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) radar, a new mission computer and <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> suite, and various cockpit improvements; this package is an option on current production F-16s and can be retrofitted to most in service F-16s. First flight took place 21 October, 2015. Production run to upgrade Taiwan's F-16 fleet started January, 2017.|$|E

50|$|Sea Control Squadron 22 (VS-22) Checkmates was a carrier-based United States Navy {{squadron}} based out of Naval Air Station Jacksonville in Florida. The squadron {{flew the}} Lockheed S-3B Viking and their mission was mining, undersea and surface <b>warfare,</b> <b>electronic</b> reconnaissance and analysis, {{over the horizon}} targeting, and aerial refueling. The squadron was last attached to Carrier Air Wing Seventeen (CVW-17) and was the last squadron flying the Viking. VS-22 was disestablished in a ceremony at NAS Jacksonville on January 29, 2009, and officially on March 31, 2009.|$|R
50|$|VS-35, Sea Control Squadron 35, {{known as}} the Blue Wolves was a carrier-based United States Navy {{squadron}} based out of Naval Air Station North Island in California. The squadron flew the Lockheed Lockheed S-3B Viking and their mission was mining, undersea and surface <b>warfare,</b> <b>electronic</b> reconnaissance and analysis, over the horizon targeting, and aerial refueling. The squadron was last attached to Carrier Air Wing Fourteen (CVW-14). VS-35 was deactivated in a ceremony at NAS North Island on 24 March 2005, and officially on 31 March 2005.|$|R
50|$|Several major exhibitors who had {{attended}} the previous E3 exhibitions were not present. Activision opted to forgo a {{booth at the}} show, instead featuring their upcoming games through other publishers that would be there, such as allowing Sony to showcase Call of Duty: Infinite <b>Warfare.</b> <b>Electronic</b> Arts opted to hold their EA Play event separate from E3, and forgo any floor space at the show. Both Disney Interactive Studios (which ceased to operate as an independent developer effective May 2016) and Wargaming opted to not present in the event.|$|R
5|$|On 18 December 2013, {{production}} of Block 2 JF-17s began at PAC's Kamra facility. These aircraft have air-to-air refuelling capability, improved avionics, enhanced load carrying capacity, data link, and <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> capabilities. Block 2 construction activity is planned to run until 2016, {{after which the}} manufacturing of further developed Block 3 aircraft is planned. In December 2015, {{it was announced that}} the 16th Block II aircraft had been handed over resulting in standing up of the 4th squadron.|$|E
5|$|The other {{countermeasures}} {{the ships}} use are four Sippican SRBOC (super rapid bloom off-board chaff) six-barrel MK36 decoy launchers, which deploy infrared Flare (countermeasure) and chaff {{to disrupt the}} sensors of incoming missiles; an SSTDS torpedo defense system; and an AN/SLQ-25 Nixie torpedo countermeasures system. The carriers also use AN/SLQ-32(V) Radar jamming and deception systems to detect and disrupt hostile radar signals {{in addition to the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> capabilities of some of the aircraft on board.|$|E
5|$|An article {{published}} by Politico in September 2017, cited a self-assessment by the 173rd Airborne Brigade as {{stating that the}} brigade lacked “essential capabilities needed to accomplish its mission effectively and with decisive speed”. The document detailed a number of “capability gaps”, which had been identified during the brigade′s training with Ukrainian troops that had experience fighting against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. The report described deficiencies in air defense and <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> units {{as well as an}} over-reliance on satellite communications and GPS navigation systems. These are said to make the unit vulnerable to an enemy with high-end equipment and technology.|$|E
50|$|The Navy used PB-1Ws as the {{original}} Airborne Warning and Command System or AWACS aircraft, {{as well as for}} <b>electronic</b> countermeasures, anti-submarine <b>warfare</b> and hurricane hunters. The Navy sealed up the bomb bay doors and installed 300 gallon wing-mounted drop tanks and the AN/APS-20 Seasearch radar equipment in a bulbous housing below the former bomb bay. Radio direction finder (RDF), instrument landing system (ILS), and long range navigation (LORAN) was also installed at this time. She was not painted, but waxed to prevent corrosion, and kept her original Browning M2 machine guns.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Cristóbal Colón contemplates several {{improvements}} {{with respect to the}} original {{design of the}} class. It incorporates new Bravo 16V engines that increase its maximum speed and a bow thruster of 850 kW for operations in port. In weaponry and combat systems, two 25mm Mk 38 guns are added for close defense, a new <b>electronic</b> and submarine <b>warfare</b> control system, Aries surface surveillance radar, SPY-1 radar improvements, and improvements in communications and control systems. F105 can also operate with NH 90 helicopters by expanding the hangar and flight deck.|$|R
5000|$|Some T-33s {{retained}} two {{machine guns}} for gunnery training, {{and in some}} countries, the T-33 was even used in combat: the Cuban Air Force used them during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, scoring several kills. The RT-33A version, reconnaissance aircraft produced primarily for use by foreign countries, had a camera installed in the nose and additional equipment in the rear cockpit. T-33s continued to fly as currency trainers, drone towing, combat and tactical simulation training, [...] "hack" [...] aircraft, <b>electronic</b> countermeasures, and <b>warfare</b> training and test platforms right into the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|During the 1970s, Australia {{considered}} {{joining the}} MRCA programme {{to find a}} replacement for their ageing Dassault Mirage IIIs; ultimately the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet was selected to meet the requirement. Canada similarly opted for the F/A-18 after considering the Tornado. Japan considered the Tornado in the 1980s, along with the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and F/A-18; before selecting the Mitsubishi F-2, a domestically produced design based on the F-16. In the 1990s, both Taiwan and South Korea expressed interest in acquiring {{a small number of}} Tornado ECR aircraft. In 2001, EADS proposed a Tornado ECR variant with a greater <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> capability for Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the USAF began {{operating}} two-seat North American F-100F Super Sabres specially {{equipped for}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses mission in Vietnam. Nicknamed the Wild Weasel, these aircraft achieved {{a number of}} victories against North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile radars. The second crew member was a Navigator trained as an <b>Electronic</b> <b>Warfare</b> Officer (EWO) to decipher sensor information and guide the pilot towards the targets. However, the F-100F was an interim solution, since its limited payload often required multiple aircraft to conduct a successful strike; it also lacked the speed and endurance to effectively protect the F-105.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, the Danish Ministry of Defence {{reportedly}} {{could not}} afford the retrofitting of the AW101 fleet for Afghanistan operations, against earlier reports of a deployment in 2012. In February 2013, Aviation Week reported that earlier reliability problems had been resolved and that a full upgrade package would be applied to Danish AW101s; these included the addition of <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> pods and a new electro-optical system, in advance of a deployment in Afghanistan in 2014. In September 2013, Danish AW101s were to receive L-3 Wescam MX-15 electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors; SAR aircraft already carry the FLIR Systems Star Safire II EO/IR sensor.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{completion}} of Operation Destined Glory 96, a NATO amphibious exercise, Conolly {{paid a visit to}} Augusta Bay, Sicily. Operation Destined Glory 96, lasted 16 days and was a NATO forces combined amphibious exercise which began 13 March and continued through 26 March. It tested forces in the air and at sea in the Central Mediterranean near Sardinia and in the Tyrrhenian Sea and also trained ashore at Capo Teulada, Sardinia. Military units from the NATO countries of Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and United States took part in the exercise which focused on undersea, surface, <b>electronic</b> and air <b>warfare,</b> and included communications and shiphandling skills.|$|R
50|$|As of 2014 the Polish Air Force was {{planning}} to retain the Su-22s in service. It is hoped that this decision will {{have a positive impact}} on Polish industry, as the WZL nr 2 repair facility in Bydgoszcz will maintain the remaining aircraft under contract to the Air Force. The decision would also allow the Air Force to retain the well-trained ground crews and pilots, currently operating the machines. The Poles consider the Su-22 easier to maintain and repair than the other main combat aircraft types currently in Polish service (mainly the MiG-29 and the F-16). They also suffer from fewer malfunctions and other problems (high, 70-75% non-error index). It is also the only plane in Polish inventory equipped for <b>electronic</b> intelligence, <b>warfare,</b> and support of ground systems. The Polish Air Force has retained a large stockpile of air-to-ground weapons for use with the Su-22. By some estimates, the cost of destroying these resources would be higher than the projected cost of continuing Su-22 operations. It was decided, that starting from 2015, only 12 Su-22M4 and 4-6 Su-22UM3K out of 32 remaining would undergo a refit, increasing their lifespan for another ten years. For economical reasons the aircraft are not modernized, apart from fitting an additional radio RS-6113-2 C2M with a blade antenna on the top, but they receive a new grey multishade camouflage, similar to other Polish aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|In 1972, the 3415th Technical Wing {{became the}} USAF School of Applied Aerospace Sciences, Lowry. [...] The Department of Aerospace Munitions Training {{continued}} missile training and in 1978 was redesignated the 3460th Training Group. [...] In 1980 Lowry acquired a Davis-Monthan AFB B-52D and stabilized another B-52 for training ALCM and SRAM loading procedures.
