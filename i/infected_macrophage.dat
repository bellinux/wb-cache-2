Here, we examined the role of STPK pknE, using a deletion mutant DpknE in the modulation of intracellular signaling events that favor M. tuberculosis survival. Phosphorylation kinetics of MAPK (p 38 MAPK, ErkK and SAPK/JNK) was defective in DpknE compared to wild-type <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages.</b> This defective signaling dramatically delayed and reduced the phosphorylation kinetics of transcription factors ATF- 2 and c-JUN in DpknE <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages.</b> MAPK inhibitors instead of reducing the phosphorylation in DpknE <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages,</b> revealed crosstalks with ErkK signaling influenced by SAPK/JNK and p 38 pathways independently.

40|$|AbstractActivated mouse macrophages {{can produce}} {{high levels of}} nitric oxide, an {{antimicrobial}} effector molecule recently also implicated in antiviral defense. As viral infection may alter macrophage functions, nitric oxide production was investigated in murine <b>macrophages</b> <b>infected</b> with a Flavivirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus. <b>Infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> produced high levels of nitric oxide upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide without priming, while in control macrophages induction of nitric oxide production by lipopolysaccharide required priming with interferon-γ. Addition of interferon-γ to <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> further increased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated nitric oxide production. In contrast, nitric oxide production upon stimulation with interferon-γ plus tumor necrosis factor-α was markedly reduced in <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages.</b> Downregulation of interferon-γ plus tumor necrosis factor-α-induced nitric oxide synthesis by viral infection {{could be attributed to}} endogenous interferon-αβ produced by <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages.</b> Addition of interferon-αβ to uninfected macrophages inhibited interferon-γ plus tumor necrosis factor-α-induced nitric oxide production, and addition of interferon-αβ antibodies to <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> increased identically stimulated nitric oxide production to normal levels. Thus, interferon-αβ mimicked the effect of viral infection on macrophage nitric oxide production. These findings indicate that viral infection profoundly alters requirements of mouse macrophages for induction of nitric oxide synthesis, depending on the activating signal applied. The described effects of viral infection of macrophages on the regulation of nitric oxide production add new complexity to the role of nitric oxide in host defense against viruses...|$|R

40|$|Protozoan parasites {{belonging}} to the genus Leishmania exhibit a pronounced tropism for macrophages. In this thesis, we have highlighted aspects of the surface chemistry and intracellular antigen processing and presentation of Leishmania donovani <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage.</b> We recall from our previous study that Leishmania donovani infection causes fluidity in the macrophage membrane. We have showed here the fluidity in <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage</b> membranes are due to decreased cholesterol content in the membranes. Naturally the question arises, which physical parameters of a biological membrane are influenced by cholesterol? Membrane cholesterol regulates membrane protein function and dynamicity. We have seen a decrease in antigen presenting ability of MHC class II in Leishmania infection. MHC class II molecule being a transmembrane protein may interact with plasma membrane components {{which is responsible for}} its functional activity. Leishmania infection causes depletion of cholesterol from macrophage membrane which in turn affects the antigen presenting ability of macrophage, although the precise nature of interaction is still unclear. Measurements of dynamics of membrane proteins provide another window to show the effect of cholesterol depletion in Leishmania <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage.</b> Studying the local diffusion of membrane protein over time provide information about the dynamic property of the membrane in Leishmania infection. Biochemically, the cholesterol forms rigid liquid ordered structures within membranes called lipid rafts. The viscous drag of the lipid rafts restricts the mobility of the proteins. The novel technique allowed us to compare the diffusion of proteins in normal and Leishmania <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage</b> membrane. Leishmania infection increases the mobility of PLC-δ 1 (a lipid raft oriented membrane protein) in macrophages. The lateral diffusion of this protein is again restored back to normal with treatment with liposomal delivery of cholesterol...|$|E

Paradoxically, a variety of protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and viruses preferentially infect and replicate within these same scavenger cells. Sites of replication include not only the phagobysosome, but also the cytoplasm of infected cells. In many instances, these microorganisms can also be killed by the <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage</b> host cell.

40|$|Activation of both CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T {{cells is}} {{required}} for an effective immune response to an M. tuberculosis infection. However, <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> are poor antigen presenting cells and may be spatially separated from recruited T cells, thus limiting antigen presentation within a granuloma. Our previous studies showed that <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> release from cells small membrane-bound vesicles called exosomes which contain mycobacterial lipid components and showed that these exosomes could stimulate a pro-inflammatory response in naïve macrophages. In the present study we demonstrate that exosomes stimulate both CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) splenic T cells isolated from mycobacteria-sensitized mice. Although the exosomes contain MHC I and II as well as costimulatory molecules, maximum stimulation of T cells required prior incubation of exosomes with antigen presenting cells. Exosomes isolated from M. bovis and M. tuberculosis <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> also stimulated activation and maturation of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Interestingly, intranasal administration of mice with exosomes isolated from M. bovis BCG <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> induce the generation of memory CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells. The isolated T cells also produced IFN-gamma upon restimulation with BCG antigens. The release of exosomes from <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> may overcome some of the defects in antigen presentation associated with mycobacterial infections and we suggest that exosomes may be a promising M. tuberculosis vaccine candidate...|$|R

The parasite is able to <b>infect</b> <b>macrophages</b> and dendritic cells for dispersal throughout the body. However, the molecular mechanisms or outcomes of the subversion of the host cell are largely unknown. Recently our group established that metalloproteinases are involved in migration of <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages.</b> Herein, we evaluated the recruitment of host invasive machinery components in T. gondii <b>infected</b> murine <b>macrophages.</b> We showed by immunoprecipitation assays that MMP- 9, CD 44 TIMP- 1 and uPAR were secreted as a multi-protein complex by <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages.</b> Zymographic analysis revealed that MMP- 9 was present in its pro- and active form. Moreover, inhibition of uPA/uPAR pathway by PAI- 1 decreased secretion of MMP- 9 active forms, as well those associated to uPAR and TIMP- 1, but not to CD 44. Data presented here suggest that MMP- 9 is secreted as a multiprotein complex by T. gondii <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages,</b> similar to that observed in metastatic cells. We further speculate that uPA/uPAR system {{is involved in the}} expression/secretion of complexes containing active MMP- 9 forms...|$|R

After 6 days of incubation, adherent mononuclear cells were infected with Leishmania donovani amastigotes obtained from infected hamster spleen cells or with L. tropica amastigotes obtained from infected BALB/c tissue mouse footpad. Forty-eight percent of the macrophages were initially infected, {{with a mean of}} 3. 0 amastigotes per <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage.</b> After 6 days of incubation, 59 % of macrophages were infected and contained 8. 8 amastigotes per <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage,</b> representing 2. 9 -fold multiplication.

40|$|Resolution of {{leishmaniasis}} {{is associated}} with host immunological responsiveness to parasite antigens. In clinical disease, leishmania are found as amastigotes contained with macrophages. We investigated the possibility that Leishmania antigens are expressed on the <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage</b> surface by reacting infected macrophages with antibody to Leishmania. In vitro-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages were labelled with antibody to amastigotes when examined with immunofluorescent or immunoelectron microscopic techniques. Infected macrophages were poorly labelled by antibody to promastigotes (insect forms of Leishmania). Certain antisera that reacted with the surface membranes of amastigotes did not label the <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage</b> surface. These results indicate that human macrophages infected in vitro express Leishmania amastigote antigen(s) on their surface membranes, that such antigen(s) may not be present in large quantities in promastigotes, and that certain antigen(s) on the amastigote surface are not expressed on the surface membranes of infected macrophages...|$|E
40|$|Leishmania major {{infection}} of macrophages {{is followed by}} a time-dependent appearance of lipophosphoglycan (LPG) that can be detected on the surface of infected cells by monoclonal antibodies. The origin of these LPG epitopes is probably the intracellular amastigote. LPG epitopes could be detected on the amastigote and the <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage</b> by a number of monoclonal antibodies directed to several distinct determinants on the phosphoglycan moiety. The macrophage-expressed LPG may be modified because, unlike the parasite LPG as expressed on promastigotes or amastigotes, it could not be radiolabeled by galactose oxidase or periodate treatment of infected cells followed by reduction with 3 H-labeled sodium borohydride. Some LPG epitopes displayed on the macrophage may be anchored with glycosylphosphatidylinositol, and some may be in the water-soluble phosphoglycan form bound to macrophage integrins involved in its specific recognition.

40|$|Viruses {{can escape}} T-cell {{surveillance}} by <b>infecting</b> <b>macrophages</b> and thereby induce apoptosis of noninfected T cells. This ability {{had not been}} demonstrated for bacteria. We investigated whether infection of macrophages with the important human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis can induce T-cell apoptosis. Because Chlamydia-Mycoplasma coinfection is a frequent event, the ability of Mycoplasma fermentans-infected macrophages to induce T-cell apoptosis was also studied. <b>Infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> were cocultivated with autologous T cells in different activation states. Propidium iodide-based fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis demonstrated that <b>macrophages</b> <b>infected</b> with viable chlamydiae induced T-cell death. Apoptosis was identified as the mode of death induction by using a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay. Induction of T-cell death was macrophage dependent. Incubation of T cells with infectious chlamydiae {{in the absence of}} macrophages did not lead to T-cell apoptosis. UV irradiation of chlamydiae diminished the ability to induce death. T-cell death was induced by a cell-free supernatant of <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages.</b> Not only phytohemagglutinin-preactivated T cells but also non-mitogen-preactivated T cells were susceptible to C. trachomatis-induced apoptosis. In contrast, M. fermentans infection of macrophages did not induce T-cell death. Coinfection had no additional effect. In summary, intracellular chlamydial infection of macrophages can induce T-cell apoptosis. Apoptosis induction by chlamydiae possibly explains how persistently <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> escape T-cell surveillance and why the Chlamydia-specific T-cell response is diminished during persistent chlamydial infection...|$|R
40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis, {{the agent}} of {{bacterial}} sexually transmitted infections, can manifest itself as either acute cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or a chronic asymptomatic infection. Inflammation induced by C. trachomatis contributes greatly to the pathogenesis of disease. Here we evaluated the anti-inflammatory capacity of naringenin, a polyphenolic compound, to modulate inflammatory mediators produced by mouse J 774 <b>macrophages</b> <b>infected</b> with live C. trachomatis. <b>Infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> produced {{a broad spectrum of}} inflammatory cytokines (GM-CSF, TNF, IL- 1 β, IL- 1 α, IL- 6, IL- 12 p 70, and IL- 10) and chemokines (CCL 4, CCL 5, CXCL 1, CXCL 5, and CXCL 10) which were downregulated by naringenin in a dose-dependent manner. Enhanced protein and mRNA gene transcript expressions of TLR 2 and TLR 4 in addition to the CD 86 costimulatory molecule on <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> were modulated by naringenin. Pathway-specific inhibition studies disclosed that p 38 mitogen-activated-protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in the production of inflammatory mediators by <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages.</b> Notably, naringenin inhibited the ability of C. trachomatis to phosphorylate p 38 in macrophages, suggesting a potential mechanism of its attenuation of concomitantly produced inflammatory mediators. Our data demonstrates that naringenin is an immunomodulator of inflammation triggered by C. trachomatis, which possibly may be mediated upstream by modulation of TLR 2, TLR 4, and CD 86 receptors on <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> and downstream via the p 38 MAPK pathway...|$|R

40|$|Macrophages {{infected}} {{with a heavy}} burden of M. tb Erdman undergo a cell death that initially resembles apoptosis but quickly transitions to necrosis. Unlike the previously reported TNF dependent apoptosis induced by avirulent Mycobacterium [1], this form of macrophage cell death is not microbicidal [2]. Microbicidal effects are observed however, when the heavily <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage</b> encounters an uninfected naïve macrophage. My studies describe in part, the crosstalk between the uninfected and <b>infected</b> <b>macrophage</b> that results {{in the killing of}} the intracellular M. tb Cell contact between the two cell populations is not necessary for this killing of bacilli to occur and the soluble “signal” of communication between the two cell populations is transferrable, without naïve macrophages present, to newly infected cells also resulting in the reduced viability of the bacilli. We have found that when the IL- 1 receptor is absent in the naïve macrophage population that the co-culture antimycobacterial effect is abrogated, suggesting that IL- 1 released by the infected dying macrophage is critical for naïve macrophages to respond in a way that results in the decrease in mycobacterial viability.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{phospholipase}} A 2 (PLA 2) derived from Crotalus durissus collilineatus was evaluated in vitro and in vivo on experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis. The promastigote and amastigote forms treated with PLA 2 presented increased growth rate. In vivo studies showed that PLA 2 -treated Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis promastigotes increased the size of lesions in BALB/c mice, and histopathological analysis showed numerous necrotic regions presenting a higher density of polymorphonuclear, mononuclear, and amastigote cells. Additionally, <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> treated with PLA 2 were able to generate prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). Cytokine quantification showed that the supernatant from <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> presented moderate and high amounts of IL- 2 and IL- 10, respectively.

Here we use quantitative intravital microscopy to reveal distinct steps of granuloma formation and assess their consequence for infection. Intracellular mycobacteria use the ESX- 1 /RD 1 virulence locus to induce recruitment of new macrophages to, and their rapid movement within, nascent granulomas.

40|$|Abstract Background Unlike CD 4 + T cells, HIV- 1 <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> exhibit {{extended}} life span even upon stress, {{consistent with their}} in vivo role as long-lived HIV- 1 reservoirs. Results Here, we demonstrate that PI 3 K/Akt inhibitors, including clinically available Miltefosine, dramatically reduced HIV- 1 production from long-living virus-infected macrophages. These PI 3 K/Akt inhibitors hyper-sensitize <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> to extracellular stresses that they are normally exposed to, and eventually lead to cell death of <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> without harming uninfected cells. Based on the data from these Akt inhibitors, {{we were able to}} further investigate how HIV- 1 infection utilizes the PI 3 K/Akt pathway to establish the cytoprotective effect of HIV- 1 infection, which extends the lifespan of <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages,</b> a key viral reservoir. First, we found that HIV- 1 infection activates the well characterized pro-survival PI 3 K/Akt pathway in primary human macrophages, as reflected by decreased PTEN protein expression and increased Akt kinase activity. Interestingly, the expression of HIV- 1 or SIV Tat is sufficient to mediate this cytoprotective effect, which is dependent on the basic domain of Tat – a region that has previously been shown to bind p 53. Next, we observed that this interaction appears to contribute to the downregulation of PTEN expression, since HIV- 1 Tat was found to compete with PTEN for p 53 binding; this is known to result in p 53 destabilization, with a consequent reduction in PTEN protein production. Conclusion Since HIV- 1 <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> display highly elevated Akt activity, our results collectively show that PI 3 K/Akt inhibitors may be a novel therapy for interfering with the establishment of long-living HIV- 1 infected reservoirs. </p...|$|R

It was also shown that normal peritoneal <b>macrophages</b> <b>infected</b> with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, strain H 37 Rv, required 72 h of incubation with spleen cell culture supernatant fluids containing MycoIF in order to inhibit intracellular bacillary multiplication. Treatment of <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> with trypsin before their exposure to MycoIF abolished the ability of MycoIF to inhibit intracellular mutiplication of tubercle bacilli. Incubation of <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> with goat anti-mouse globulin before their exposure to MycoIF also blocked the action of MycoIF...|$|R
40|$|Human {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (RSV) is a lung tropic virus causing severe airway diseases including bronchiolitis and pneumonia among infants, {{children and}} immuno-compromised individuals. RSV triggers transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-beta)  production from lung epithelial cells and TGF-beta facilitates RSV infection of these cells. However, it is still unknown whether RSV infected myeloid cells like macrophages produce TGF-beta {{and the role of}} TGF-beta if any during RSV infection of these cells. Our study revealed that RSV <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> produce TGF-beta and as a consequence these cells activate TGF-beta dependent SMAD- 2 / 3 signaling pathway. Further mechanistic studies illustrated a role of autophagy in triggering TGF-beta production from RSV <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages.</b> In an effort to elucidate the role of TGF-beta and SMAD- 2 / 3 signaling during RSV infection, we surprisingly unfolded the requirement of TGF-beta [...] -SMAD 2 / 3 signaling in conferring optimal innate immune antiviral response during RSV infection of macrophages. Type-I interferon (e. g. interferon-beta or IFN-beta) is a critical host factor regulating innate immune antiviral response during RSV infection. Our study revealed that loss of TGF-beta [...] -SMAD 2 / 3 signaling pathway in RSV <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> led to diminished expression and production of IFN-beta. Inhibiting autophagy in RSV <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> also resulted in reduced production of IFN-beta. Thus, our studies have unfolded the requirement of autophagy [...] -TGF-beta [...] -SMAD 2 / 3 signaling network for optimal innate immune antiviral response during RSV infection of macrophages...|$|R
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV- 1) disseminates {{in the body and}} is found in several organs and tissues. While HIV- 1 mainly targets both CD 4 + T lymphocytes and macrophages, it has contrasting effects between these cell populations. HIV- 1 infection namely reduces the viability of CD 4 + T cells, whereas <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> are long-lived. In addition, the migration of T cells is reduced by the infection, while HIV- 1 differentially modulates the migration modes of macrophages. In 2 -dimensions (2 D) assays, <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> are less motile compared to the control counterparts. In 3 D environments, macrophages use two migration modes that are dependent on the matrix architecture: amoeboid and mesenchymal migration. HIV- 1 <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> exhibit a reduced amoeboid migration but an enhanced mesenchymal migration, via the viral protein Nef. Indeed, the mesenchymal migration involves podosomes, and Nef stabilizes these cell structures through the activation of the tyrosine kinase Hck, which in turn phosphorylates the Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP). WASP is a key player in actin remodeling and cell migration. The reprogramed motility of <b>infected</b> <b>macrophages</b> observed in vitro correlates in vivo with enhanced macrophage infiltration in experimental tumors in Nef-transgenic mice compared to control mice. In conclusion, HIV infection of host target cells modifies their migration capacity; we infer that HIV- 1 enhances virus spreading in confined environments by reducing T cells migration, and facilitates virus dissemination into different organs and tissues of the human body by enhancing macrophage mesenchymal migration...|$|R
