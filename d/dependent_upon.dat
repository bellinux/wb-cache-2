5|$|A tantric {{interpretation}} sees Shiva as {{consciousness and}} Kali as power or energy. Consciousness and energy are <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> each other, since Shiva depends on Shakti, or energy, {{in order to}} fulfill his role in creation, preservation, and destruction. In this view, without Shakti, Shiva is a corpse — unable to act.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels are fuels {{derived from}} biomass {{conversion}}, {{as in the}} conversion of cellulose contained in corn stalks, switchgrass, and other biomass into cellulosic ethanol. This process is <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> microbial consortia that transform the cellulose into sugars, followed by the fermentation of the sugars into ethanol. Microbes also produce {{a variety of sources}} of bioenergy including methane and hydrogen.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, the {{measurement}} at the k-th timestep is <b>dependent</b> only <b>upon</b> {{the current state}} and is conditionally independent of all other states given the current state.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the closure}} of Blyth Power Stations, along with the power {{stations}} at Dunston and Stella in the 1980s and 1990s respectively, {{the northern part of}} North East England has become heavily <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> the National Grid for electrical supply. However, there are still two large power stations at Hartlepool and Wilton in the south of the region.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the power {{stations}} at Stella, as well as those at Dunston and Blyth (in 1981 and 2001 respectively), the northern part of North East England has become heavily <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> the National Grid for electricity. However, in the South of the region there are still two large power stations, at Hartlepool and Wilton.|$|E
5|$|Mycorrhizal {{symbiosis}} between {{plants and}} fungi {{is one of}} the most well-known plant–fungus associations and is of significant importance for plant growth and persistence in many ecosystems; over 90% of all plant species engage in mycorrhizal relationships with fungi and are <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> this relationship for survival.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} {{perceive}} that my discourse made much impression upon them all that while, till {{it happened that}} there came two men of the neighborhood, hearing of the disturbance, and knowing my brother (for they had been both <b>dependents</b> <b>upon</b> his family), and they came to my assistance. These being, as I said, neighbors, presently knew three of the women, and told me who they were, and where they lived, and it seems they {{had given me a}} true account of themselves before.|$|R
5000|$|Photoautotrophic {{tissue culture}} {{is defined as}} [...] "micropropagation without sugar in the culture medium, in which the growth or {{accumulation}} of carbohydrates of cultures is <b>dependent</b> fully <b>upon</b> photosynthesis and inorganic nutrient uptake".|$|R
50|$|A further {{importance}} is to {{theories of the}} evolution of human speech since alaryngeal speech shows that speech is not <b>dependent</b> entirely <b>upon</b> evolved anatomy as it can be created using vocal tract anatomy in an adaptive manner.|$|R
5|$|A {{circle of}} Bronze Age stone coffins {{was found on}} the Drumpellier estate in 1852. A number of other Bronze Age urns and relics have been found in Coatbridge. An Iron Age wood and thatch crannóg {{dwelling}} was sited in the Loch at the present day Drumpellier Country Park. <b>Dependent</b> <b>upon</b> the water level in the loch, the remains can still be seen today.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} and oppressive system of rules regulating {{every facet of}} Victoria's life, it kept her in reclusive isolation most of the time, {{with the goal of}} making her weak, compliant and utterly <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> her mother and Conroy. The intention was for the Duchess to be appointed regent upon Victoria's (assumed youthful) ascension and for Conroy to be created Victoria's private secretary and given a peerage.|$|E
5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
50|$|From the start, the Italian Social Republic {{was little}} more than a puppet state <b>dependent</b> entirely <b>upon</b> Germany. The RSI {{received}} diplomatic recognition from only Germany, Japan and their puppet states. Even the otherwise sympathetic Spain refused to establish formal diplomatic relations with the RSI.|$|R
50|$|Churchill {{stood for}} the British Empire, for British {{independence}} {{and for an}} 'anti-Socialist' vision of Britain. By July 1945 {{the first of these}} was on the skids, the second was <b>dependent</b> solely <b>upon</b> America and the third had just vanished in a Labour election victory.|$|R
5000|$|Production {{rates are}} only {{limited by the}} maximum speed that the fluid can be laid down on the {{substrate}} without breaking the curtain or getting air bubbles between the substrate and the coating material. This is <b>dependent</b> mainly <b>upon</b> the viscosity of the coating fluid.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the closure}} of Dunston power station, along with the later {{closures}} of the power stations at Stella and Blyth, {{the northern part of}} North East England has become heavily <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> the National Grid for electrical supply. However, in the south of the region there are still two large power stations at Hartlepool and Teesside, meaning that the south of the region does not depend upon the National Grid for electrical supply as much as the north of the region.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned with providing defense from Native American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education. Education {{was viewed as a}} religious duty, to be provided for at home, where its quality was <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> the spare time and level of education of parents. With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches.|$|E
5|$|Incidentally, Turner's {{favorite}} {{sport is}} soccer, not football. He is {{also interested in}} foreign cultures and expressed regret at being unable to spend a semester abroad because of college football. Turner said that, <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> the outcome of his football career, {{he would like to}} attend the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. He also got to meet his childhood idol David Beckham while at the 2010 South Africa world cup.|$|E
50|$|Respectability {{encompassed}} {{both economic}} and political dimensions, and was not simply an expression of ‘middle class values.’ At an economic level, it signified someone with a “competence,” a secure source of income without the need to resort to charity. The economic independence signified by respectability was expressed politically also, as each farmer, each “freeholder,” was therefore entitled to a vote. Merchants could demand votes for their candidate, and effectively monitor their clients’ compliance, since voting was open at the hustings. Universal suffrage was denied and property qualifications to vote imposed precisely because, it was argued, only a man of property had the independence to vote according to his conscience; women, as <b>dependents</b> <b>upon</b> their husbands, were denied the vote for the same reason.|$|R

2500|$|Entertainers and courtiers {{were often}} <b>dependents</b> <b>upon</b> the wealthy or were {{associated}} with the often-perceived immoral pleasure grounds of urban entertainment districts. To give them official recognition would have given them more prestige. Although shamans and diviners in Bronze Age China had some authority as religious leaders in society, the scholars did not want religious leaders amassing too much power and influence like military strongmen (one example of this would be Zhang Jiao, who led a Taoist sect into open rebellion against the Han government's authority). There were also multiple persecutions of Buddhism in China, a lot of the contention being over Buddhist monasteries' exemption from government taxation, but also because later Neo-Confucian scholars saw Buddhism as an alien ideology and threat to the moral order of society.|$|R
5|$|Like other Ojibwe dialects, Ottawa grammar {{includes}} animate and inanimate noun gender, subclasses of verbs {{that are}} <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> gender, combinations of prefixes and suffixes that are connected with particular verb subclasses, and complex patterns of word formation. Ottawa distinguishes {{two types of}} third person in sentences: proximate, indicating a noun phrase that is emphasized in the discourse, and obviative, indicating a noun phrase that is less prominent. Ottawa has relatively flexible word order compared with languages such as English.|$|E
5|$|Several {{varieties}} of M.rotula have been described. Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis named var. fuscus in 1869 for its brown cap. In 1887 Pier Andrea Saccardo described var. microcephalus from Italy, with caps half the normal size. It is now understood, however, that fruit body morphology is variable and <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> environmental conditions. Joseph Schröter described var. phyllophyla in 1889, but that taxon is now treated as Marasmius bulliardii.|$|E
5|$|The rider's {{experience}} is <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> {{the location of}} her or his seat on the train. Screens are located {{on both sides of}} the track but the only continuous screen on the track is on the right-hand side. The train makes several tight turns during the ride; riders facing forward experience all the animations while riders facing backward miss some scenes because of the lack of screen space. The cars rotate 90 degrees clockwise to face the screens; forward-facing riders rotate toward the continuous screen.|$|E
30|$|Scientific {{literature}} usually {{looks at}} spatial environments with different approaches in different domains (Lloyd 2009; Wooldridge and Veloso 1999; Fischer 2000). In urban planning and/or design studies, the interpretation {{given to the}} role of space ranges from a passive tank for human actions (anthropization), to a quasi-active agent which represents parts of the human behavior. As in a loop, the latter <b>dependents</b> <b>upon</b> the space dimension (Weyns et al. 2007; Tversky and Hard 2009). In cognition studies, a spatial environment is largely considered from the standpoint of agents’ spatial behavior. This can be analyzed through low-level (e.g. the search for an object in a given space) or high level (e.g. enjoying spatial aesthetics) cognitive actions (Mockler 1989). Knowledge-based approaches, in urban planning and spatial organization studies, integrate these two cognitive aspects (Schön 1983).|$|R

5|$|While some of {{the laws}} from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are {{applicable}} at the present time, others are <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> {{the existence of a}} predominantly Bahá'í society, such as the punishments for arson or murder. The laws, when not in direct conflict with the civil laws of the country of residence, are binding on every Bahá'í, and the observance of personal laws, such as prayer or fasting, is the sole responsibility of the individual.|$|E
5|$|With {{an economy}} {{fundamentally}} <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> a single industry, {{there was a}} scarcity of paid employment for women in Rhondda's coalmining heyday. The Encyclopaedia of Wales notes {{that the image of}} the Welsh Mam, a wife and mother constantly at home and exalted as the queen of the household, was essentially a Rhondda creation. However the Rhondda did produce the suffragette and social reformer Elizabeth Andrews, one of only nine women among a list of a hundred greatest Welsh heroes chosen by ballot in 2004.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, {{including}} Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Encyclopedia, have all {{suggested that the}} Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that humans are co-legislators of morality and that morality is a priori. They argue that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> humans, who have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E

50|$|The {{legitimacy}} of an English king depended on (somehow) demonstrating descent from William the Conqueror: {{the right of}} conquest was therefore a topic rife with constitutional connotations.
