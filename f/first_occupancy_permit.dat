This mostly leads to unwarranted delays, increased costs, and needless frustration. This research analyzes delay causes and durations for building <b>permit</b> and <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> issuances. Field study is carried out at the Konak Municipality in. zmir. 56 building and 107 <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> applications made in 2008 are thoroughly examined {{in terms of their}} rejection reasons and delay durations. The findings of the research show that the most frequent application type -new construction of a standard apartment building- reviewed requires an average duration of 107 days for building permit and 99 days for <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> issuance. Analyzing the delay causes, missing documents in the application file required for obtaining a building permit and incomplete submission of documents required after the building inspection in situ required for obtaining an <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> are found to be the main delay causes. Permit officials, inspectors and project owners are as well interviewed to reveal their concerns and suggestions for streamlining the permit processes. Finally, the permit issuance processes of various world cities are reviewed for comparison purposes. Research results show that common problems detected in the permit processes are that they are cumbersome and time consuming due to the complexity of the codes and regulations, and inadequate number of staff. For streamlining the permit processes, re-examining all bylaws and regulations for simplifying purposes, efficient use of information technologies, preparing guidebooks with simpler terms and increasing the number of staff by improving customer services are needed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Architecture, İzmir, 2011 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 76 - 81) Text in English;Abstract: Turkish and Englishxii, 85 leavesThis study aims {{to predict}} the issuance durations of <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> applications using the delay causes defined in the permit process and reveal the most significant causes affecting {{the performance of the}} prediction. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is used for predicting the issuance durations of <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> applications. The model is constructed {{to predict the}} issuance durations of least once rejected applications made to Izmir Konak Municipality during year 2008. Then, sensitivity analysis is carried out to detect the most significant delay causes affecting the issuance duration. Permit data are examined to reveal the delay causes of <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> process. Six inputs are generated from the delay causes and used in ANN model: 1) Number of missing approval letters, 2) Number of missing payment documents, 3) Number of non-conformances of project to codes and regulations, 4) Number of all missing documents, 5) First permit application season, 6) First permit rejection season. Total issuance durations of the <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> applications are used as the output parameters of the model. The results of the analysis indicate that the prediction accuracy of the model is 86 % and the number of missing approval letters, the number of missing payment documents, and the first application season are respectively the three most significant inputs affecting the prediction performance of the model. This study proves that the total issuance durations are so bound to the delay causes in the permit process that it can be learned and predicted by the ANN model and the <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> process is required to be reengineered...|$|R

25|$|The {{contract}} {{to build the}} stadium was issued the Nussli Group of Switzerland, which specializes {{in the construction of}} temporary stadiums. They used their NT grandstand system, which allowed for modular construction of stands. Construction implemented 2,500 tonnes of material. Nussli's senior project manager, Florian Weber, stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the construction was the <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit,</b> caused by the short construction schedule. Construction took 111 days, and was completed in late June 2010. Several commentators stated that use of temporary stadiums on a permanent basis could be used for other MLS and CFL stadia. For instance, the price of building an 18,500 seat permanent soccer-specific stadium was averaging $200 million.|$|R
50|$|Design {{professionals}} {{were not}} required to perform these extensive reviews during construction and developers not wishing to incur extra fees would not engage them to do so. This left the obligation for correct interpretation and construction to the developers or builders, who either lacked the experience and/or had a financial incentive to cut costs. The Provincial and Vancouver Building Codes were amended in 1993 to require, as a condition of the building <b>permit</b> and the <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit,</b> that design professionals be engaged to perform this level of certification and oversight. However, application of this provision of the codes was frequently not enforced in many condominium projects; they were issued Building Permits under another section of the code that did not require Letters of Assurance.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, cities, {{suburban}} {{communities and}} towns with over 10,000 population {{are required to}} obtain discharge permits for their storm sewer systems, under the Clean Water Act. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued stormwater regulations for large cities in 1990 and for other communities in 1999. The permits require local governments to operate stormwater management programs, covering both construction of new buildings and facilities, and maintenance of their existing municipal drainage networks. Many municipalities have revised their local ordinances covering management of runoff. State government facilities, such as roads and highways, are also subject to the stormwater management regulations. [...] Many local municipalities have placed ordinances for both commercial and residential stormwater management practices to be designed, implemented, and approved before an <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> is released.|$|R

50|$|In construction, the {{authority}} having jurisdiction (AHJ) is the governmental agency or sub-agency that regulates the construction process. In most cases, {{this is the}} municipality where the building is located. However, construction performed for supra-municipal authorities are usually regulated directly by the owning authority, which becomes the AHJ.Before the foundation can be dug, contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked, either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services. This lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities, which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations. During {{the construction of a}} building, the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code. Once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed, an <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> may be issued.|$|R

The owners had erroneously calculated the required front yard setback. If a final ruling is ever reached enforcing the setback, the addition's encroachment would need demolition and removal. In September 2007 a judge ruled that the new addition to the Beglari residence was 14 ft over the setback requirement {{and closer to the}} Greentree Road than permitted by the Los Angeles Municipal Code's zoning law. Even though judges have ruled: the use of invalid building permits for the nonconforming addition; and a post-construction <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> being improperly granted; the owners have fought to maintain their non-compliant house for over 12 years. Still without definitive resolution or demolition, another unsuccessful appeal was filed by the owners in 2013.|$|R
