25|$|When Phillips {{arrived in}} China, medical {{practices}} contrasted with Western practice. Instead of scientific methods, Chinese medicine {{was made up}} of mostly traditional methods derived from ancient times. Diagnosing patients was much different in China, where doctors diagnosed patients from observing them from the outside rather than using tests to examine internal parts of the body that may need attention (ARTICLE). As for overall well being, the Chinese believed that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a person’s internal harmony of yin and yang. The devil was blamed for all illness, but the real cause had to do with poor standards of hygiene. Phillips encountered many herbal medications in China; herbal remedies and acupuncture were both very popular treatments around this time. She also noted the practice developed by the locals in which they would simply hop from doctor to doctor if one did not provide an immediate cure.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{suffrage}} {{was achieved}} in 1920, and early 20th century antifeminism was primarily focused on fighting this. Suffragists scoffed at antisuffragists. Anna Howard Shaw, {{president of the}} National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1904 to 1915, presumed, perhaps unfairly, that the antisuffragists were merely working {{under the influence of}} male forces. Later historians tended to dismiss antisuffragists as subscribing to the model of domestic idealism, that a woman's place is in the home. This undermines and belittles the true power and numbers behind the antisuffrage movement, which was primarily led by women themselves. Arguments employed by antisuffragists {{at the turn of the}} century had less to do with a woman's place in the home as much as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a woman's proper place in the public realm. In fact, leaders of the movement often encouraged other women to leave the home and participate in society. What they opposed was women participating in the political sphere.|$|E

He was a member of Painters Eleven, the group founded by William Ronald in 1954 to promote abstract painting in Canada, and was soon encouraged in his art by the American art critic Clement Greenberg. With encouragement from Greenberg, Bush became closely tied to two movements that grew out of the efforts of the abstract expressionists: Color Field Painting and Lyrical Abstraction. His painting Big A is an example of his color field paintings of the late 1960s.|$|R

500|$|The {{cover of}} the first {{printing}} of The Great Gatsby {{is among the most}} celebrated pieces of art in American literature. It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline, with images of naked women reflected in the irises. A little-known artist named Francis Cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald {{was in the midst of}} writing it. The cover was completed before the novel; Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had [...] "written it into" [...] the novel. Fitzgerald's remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T. J. Eckleburg (depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop) which Fitzgerald described as [...] "blue and gigantic– their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose." [...] Although this passage has some resemblance to the painting, a closer explanation can be found in the description of Daisy Buchanan as the [...] "girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs." [...] Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that when Fitzgerald lent him a copy of The Great Gatsby to read, he immediately disliked the cover, but [...] "Scott told me not to be put off by it, that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story. He said he had liked the jacket and now he didn't like it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1874 the Lokhvitsky {{family moved}} to Moscow. In 1882 Mirra {{enrolled}} in the Moscow Aleksandrinsky Institute, from which she graduated in 1888. Some sources stated that her literature tutor was Apollon Maykov but modern literary historians challenge this. At age fifteen Lokhvitskaya started writing poetry and published two of her poems as a small brochure (approved by the college's authorities) not long before graduation. In 1884 Alexander Lokhvitsky died and his widow took the children back to Saint Petersburg. Mirra followed suit four years later, now as a young teacher. In 1888 several of her poems, signed M. Lokhvitskaya, were published by Sever (North) magazine. Several popular literary journals {{became interested in the}} young debutante and soon the moniker [...] "Mirra" [...] emerged.

Mofaz later admitted that the limitations imposed on the media were a mistake. Head of the Operations Directorate, General Dan Harel, said: [...] "Today, I would send a reporter in every APC". IDF Spokeswoman, Miri Eisen, said {{the decision not to}} allow reporters into the camp was a difficult one: [...] "The press people said 'Listen, the journalists aren't going to like it' and the operational people said 'We don't care about the journalists right now and about our image, we don't want them inside.' <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the way we were working operationally inside the camp.

2500|$|Corry, Renn, and Stachel {{authored}} a {{joint reply}} to Winterberg, which they claimed Zeitschrift für Naturforschung refused to publish without [...] "unacceptable" [...] modifications, {{and unable to}} find a publisher [...] elsewhere, they made it available on the internet. The reply accused Winterberg of misrepresenting the reason why Science would not publish his paper (<b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the section of the journal it was scheduled to appear in), and also misrepresenting that the paper published in Zeitschrift für Naturforschung was the same paper he had submitted to Science, and had in fact been [...] "substantially altered" [...] after Winterberg had received their comments on an earlier draft. Actually, Winterberg in his Final Comment had clearly stated that the paper submitted to Science had been a previous version. [...] They then argue that Winterberg's interpretation of the Hilbert paper was incorrect, that the lost part of the page was unlikely to have been consequential, and that much of Winterberg's reasoning about what could be in the missing piece was incorrect (down to noting [...] Winterberg claims that 1/3 of the page was removed, when actually over half a page is missing total from the two cut off pages) and internally inconsistent. They further argued there was a likely [...] "non-paranoid" [...] explanation for the missing part of the page.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviet Science Academy {{would be}} pitted against the Communist Academy {{in terms of}} status. Both of them would compete in terms of {{relevancy}} and official recognition by the party. These organizations would struggle within the bureaucracy to gain more resources and respect during the late 1920s. Until party leader [...] Avel Safronovich Enukidnze would be placed in charge of it and he made it superior to the Soviet Academy by declaration. However, the Communist Academy would fade in the 1930s because it was seen as promoting the older Bolshevik ideals and would cease to exist ending the competition between the two. This period of completion though led to a restructuring in the Soviet Sciences Academy {{in order to better}} it so {{that it would not be}} seen as obsolete. It came close in the late 1920s to dissolving the Science Academy but would stop short of it because they decided it was important to have a singular scientific institute. The reasons for nearly destroying <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the danger of thinking minds under the Soviet system and the concern that they did not uphold the right sort of ideals. They would decide that the Science Academy was necessary for the Soviet Empire and decided not destroy it but rather to rework the system. This would eventually lead to the Soviet Science Academy dominating as they found it continued to be useful as a way of competing with the West.|$|E
