5|$|Mercedes becomes {{jealous of}} Malachy {{and his new}} girlfriend, Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan). Mercedes lies to Lynsey and tells her that she is HIV-positive. Mercedes tells Malachy and they {{secretly}} plan to reconcile. Lynsey learns of this and discovers Mercedes has lied. Lynsey tells Malachy, who punches Mercedes. Mercedes and Malachy reconcile. However, Malachy is badly injured in an explosion and Mercedes is forced to turn off his life support, and he subsequently dies. Malachy's family are forced by Myra to invite Mercedes to his funeral despite discovering her infidelity. Mercedes gets into an argument with Billy Alexander (Richard Graham) at her aunt Kathleen McQueen's (Alison Burrows) fundraising event, after she accuses him of touching her.

When Billy visits Carmel, Myra slaps him and reveals {{that he is the}} father of Mercedes and Jacqui. He tells Mercedes and Jacqui that he needs a kidney transplant and that they are the only likely donors. When Mercedes and Jacqui refuse to be donors, Kathleen tells Billy that he is the father of her daughter Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), confirming that Theresa is actually Mercedes and Jacqui's half-sister. Billy is later revealed to not be needing a kidney, and that it is actually Mercedes, Jacqui and Theresa's secret half-sister, Emily Alexander (Elizabeth Henstridge). However, Mercedes is not interested in Billy nor Emily and declines to be a donor, although Jacqui later agrees to be a donor but is revealed not to be a match, so Billy and Emily disown her and leave.|$|E

500|$|In February 2011, Cavallari told Access Hollywood {{that the}} cast {{followed}} a [...] "schedule" [...] of events to be filmed {{on a given}} day, adding, [...] "We only filmed The Hills three days a week, and we did three different scenes each day and {{a change of clothes}} to film a specific scene [...] They were pushing it as far as they could go without an actual script... They give you a schedule like, 'You <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> Heidi [...] at 3 to talk about the party coming up' or whatever the situation may be". She had earlier commented that she felt viewers [...] "need to understand it's all entertainment" [...] and she [...] "would never put [...] close friends or a real relationship on a show".|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Wendy tells Stan {{that she}} smelled Ms. Ellen taking a [...] "smelly dump" [...] in the {{bathroom}} {{in an attempt to}} make him less attracted to her. In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection, but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker, but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences. At his school, the children were able to <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> the teacher and principal if they were awarded [...] "Student of the Week". Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience [...] "really, really creepy" [...] because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair.|$|E

Continuing with the song, Jillian Russell wishes for Easter eggs, Joe wishes for one day when kids don't stare at him, Bonnie wants platinum-plated silverware, Quagmire wants [...] "Japanese girls of no restraint" [...] to choke him and then whip him and Mort (who is Jewish) says he will sue if they put a Christmas tree in the airport.

500|$|Barzun Donnelly {{recommended}} to Hynes that he consider Lou Taylor Pucci {{for the lead}} role of Mercer, believing that he was [...] "perfect". Hynes watched Pucci's 2005 film Thumbsucker and thought that [...] "We'd be so lucky to have him." [...] He contacted Pucci about the role but was leaving for Norway {{in less than a}} week to attend a friend's wedding and wanted to meet with him before leaving. Pucci was in San Francisco on a press tour and Hynes flew from Los Angeles to <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> him. Hynes said of the meeting, [...] "I think we really [...] each other," [...] and Pucci accepted the role a week later. Jena Malone signed on to portray Joely because she [...] "loved the script" [...] and was keen to play [...] "a woman on the cusp of learning to toy with her [...] sexual manipulation"; she only later learned that Hynes had written the role with her in mind, having previously worked with her on the short film Al as in Al. Hynes said that Zooey Deschanel, Maura Tierney, and Bill Duke each joined the cast because they [...] "read [...] and really liked it". He made a deliberate attempt to cast Deschanel and Malone against their previous types. He described Deschanel as a [...] "glamour girl" [...] and Malone as a sexually mature woman.|$|E
500|$|By 1930, MacArthur was still, at age 50, the {{youngest}} of the U.S. Army's major generals, and the best known. He left the Philippines on 19 September 1930 and for a brief time was in command of the IX Corps Area in San Francisco. On 21 November, he was sworn in as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, with the rank of general. While in Washington, he would ride home each day to <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> his mother. At his desk, he would wear a Japanese ceremonial kimono, cool himself with an oriental fan, and smoke cigarettes in a jeweled cigarette holder. In the evenings, he liked to read military history books. About this time, he began referring to himself as [...] "MacArthur". He had already hired a public relations staff to promote his image with the American public, together with a set of ideas he was known to favor, namely: a belief that America needed a strongman leader to deal with the possibility that Communists might lead all of the great masses of unemployed into a revolution; that America's destiny was in the Asia-Pacific region; and a strong hostility to the British Empire. One contemporary described MacArthur as the greatest actor to ever serve as a U.S Army general while another wrote that MacArthur had a court rather than a staff.|$|E

2500|$|Initially Tennant and Lowe {{performed}} as West End {{because of their}} love of London's West End, but later {{they came up with}} the name Pet Shop Boys, derived from friends of theirs who worked in a pet shop in Ealing. Their big break came in August 1983, when Tennant was assigned by Smash Hits to interview The Police in New York. The duo were obsessed with a stream of Hi-NRG records made by New York producer Bobby Orlando, simply known as Bobby O. According to Tennant: [...] "I thought: well, if I've got to go and see The Police play, then I'm also going to <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> Bobby O." [...] They shared a cheeseburger and carrot cake, at a restaurant called the Applejack Diner, on 19 August (two years to the day since Tennant and Lowe had met) and, after hearing a demo tape that Tennant had brought along with him, Orlando suggested making a record with the Pet Shop Boys.|$|E
2500|$|Elaborate {{sets were}} built by {{production}} designer Danilo Donati, who also designed the film's costumes, jewelry, hair styles, wigs and makeup. Several mainstream actors were cast, Guccione intending {{to make a}} film which he felt, like Citizen Kane, would be a landmark in cinematic history. Guccione offered directing duties to John Huston and Lina Wertmüller, both of whom rejected the film. After viewing scenes from the film Salon Kitty, Guccione agreed to <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> that film's director Tinto Brass, believing Brass would be the ideal person to direct Caligula. Brass had a reputation for being difficult to deal with on film sets but Guccione thought the film's epic scope would [...] "keep [...] in line" [...] and that Brass understood the concept of the film enough to direct it. Brass described Vidal's screenplay as [...] "the work of an aging arteriosclerotic" [...] and agreed to direct only if he was allowed to rewrite Vidal's screenplay. Brass' screenplay expanded the sexual content to include orgies, decorative phalluses, and much female nudity. Guccione said Brass' rewrites were done out of necessity to the film's visual narrative and did not alter the dialogue or content.|$|E
