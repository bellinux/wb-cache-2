40|$|Summary. <b>Heat-shielding</b> is {{a method}} used by honey bee workers to {{insulate}} temperature sensitive brood from localized heat stress during development. Due largely to data collection techniques, <b>heat-shielding</b> {{has been defined as}} stationary bees congregating with their ventral side facing the heat stress. We conducted tests to determine if shielding behavior was limited to bees fitting this description. Specifically, we examined the behavior in response to heat and cold stress, and recorded both stationary and moving workers on the hive wall (ventral side visible) and on the brood comb (dorsal side visible). Our observations strongly suggest that stationary bees on the brood comb shield the developing brood from both localized heat and cold stress: after temperature-stress, the number of bees under the stressor significantly increased. A uniform response from stationary bees on the hive wall, however, was not observed: stationary bee number increased significantly after heat stress but tended to decrease after cold stress. Movement of bees on both the hive wall and brood comb decreased in response to cold stress. Movement of bees on brood comb decreased after heat stress, whereas the movement of bees on the hive wall increased in response to heat stress. This latter result raises the possibility that these bees are creating currents used to dissipate the heat and/ or are absorbing heat near the source and moving it to non-sensitive areas. Our data indicate that ‘heat-shielding’, as previously defined, is a category within a broader response of honey bees to localized temperature stress: Apis mellifera appear to respond adaptively to all localized temperature stressors.

40|$|Comparative {{studies were}} {{performed}} on the <b>heat-shielding</b> characteristics of honeycomb-core sandwich panels fabricated with different materials for possible use as wall panels for the proposed crew exploration vehicle. Graphite/epoxy sandwich panel was found to outperform aluminum sandwich panel under the same geometry due to superior <b>heat-shielding</b> qualities and lower material density. Also, representative reentry heat-transfer analysis {{was performed on the}} windward wall structures of a generic crew exploration vehicle. The Apollo low Earth orbit reentry trajectory was used to calculate the reentry heating rates. The generic crew exploration vehicle has a graphite/epoxy composite honeycomb sandwich exterior wall and an aluminum honeycomb sandwich interior wall, and is protected with the Apollo thermal protection system ablative material. In the thermal analysis computer program used, the TPS ablation effect was not yet included; however, the results from the nonablation heat-transfer analyses were used to develop a "virtual ablation" method to estimate the ablation heat loads and the thermal protection system recession thicknesses. Depending on the severity of the heating-rate time history, the virtual ablation period was found to last for 87 to 107 seconds and the ablation heat load was estimated to be in the range of 86 to 88 percent of the total heat load for the ablation time period. The thermal protection system recession thickness was estimated to be in the range of 0. 08 to 0. 11 inches. For the crew exploration vehicle zero-tilt and 18 -degree-tilt stagnation points, thermal protection system thicknesses of h = { 0. 717, 0. 733 } inches were found to be adequate to keep the substructural composite sandwich temperature below the limit of 300 F...|$|R

50|$|A {{day after}} the {{attempted}} landing, the Context Camera of NASA's MRO identified new ground markings due to the lander's impact and parachute.

On a related note, an artificially made crater was actually the goal of the THOR mission proposed under the Mars Scout program that produced Phoenix and MAVEN, the goal was sub-surface exavation.

50|$|The vehicle started encountering more {{significant}} air density {{in the lower}} thermosphere at about 400000 ft, at around Mach 25, 8200 m/s. The vehicle was controlled {{by a combination of}} RCS thrusters and control surfaces, to fly at a 40-degree nose-up attitude, producing high drag, not only to slow it down to landing speed, but also to reduce reentry heating. As the vehicle encountered progressively denser air, it began a gradual transition from spacecraft to aircraft. In a straight line, its 40-degree nose-up attitude would cause the descent angle to flatten-out, or even rise. The vehicle therefore performed a series of four steep S-shaped banking turns, each lasting several minutes, at up to 70 degrees of bank, while still maintaining the 40-degree angle of attack. In this way it dissipated speed sideways rather than upwards. This occurred during the 'hottest' phase of re-entry, when the <b>heat-shield</b> glowed red and the G-forces were at their highest. By {{the end of the last}} turn, the transition to aircraft was almost complete. The vehicle leveled its wings, lowered its nose into a shallow dive and began its approach to the landing site.|$|E

Among various materials with the capability of shielding NIR light via reflection or absorption mechanism, cesium tungsten oxide (particularly Cs 0.33 WO 3) nanoparticles have been regarded to be highly promising in transparent solar filter application [26 – 30]. Because of the strong absorption in the NIR region, owing to the free electrons or polars, they also might be efficient as a photosensitizer in NIR photothermal therapy. However, their utilization in heating the reaction media or photothermal therapy via NIR photothermal conversion has not been reported.|$|R
