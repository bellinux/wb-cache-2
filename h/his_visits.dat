5|$|Albrecht Dürer {{was an avid}} {{student of}} exotic animals, and drew many {{sketches}} based on <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> to European zoos. Dürer visited 's-Hertogenbosch during Bosch's lifetime, {{and it is likely}} the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.|$|E
50|$|In May 2014, <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> to {{the state}} of Israel was heavily publicized, where he {{delivered}} 13 speeches.

The cave under the Church of the Nativity caught fire the night after <b>his</b> <b>visit.</b>|$|R

5|$|Narendra's father's {{sudden death}} in 1884 left the family bankrupt; {{creditors}} began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home. Narendra, once {{a son of}} a well-to-do family, became one of the poorest students in his college. He unsuccessfully tried to find work and questioned God's existence, but found solace in Ramakrishna and <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> to Dakshineswar increased.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1944, {{less than}} a month before the Normandy Landings were {{scheduled}} to take place, Ismay was promoted to the rank of full general. After the successful D-Day landings, King GeorgeVI decided to visit the troops in Normandy, and selected Ismay to accompany him on the visit. In September, Ismay accompanied Churchill to another conference, the Second Quebec Conference. Ismay also accompanied Churchill on <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> to Moscow and Paris in late 1944.|$|E

5|$|The Daily Mail took on Beach Thomas as {{a writer}} of {{material}} relating to the countryside. Lord Northcliffe, who owned the newspaper, recognised that Beach Thomas would need {{to live in a}} rural environment if he was to perform his duties well. This understanding delighted Beach Thomas because it meant he could limit <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> to London. He moved to the Mimram Valley in Hertfordshire, and thereafter held Northcliffe in high regard.|$|E

5|$|After landing, {{members of}} Company E under Captain Leveridge {{were sent to}} take the {{railroad}} station, while Ellsworth, Major Charles Loeser, Lieutenant H. J. Winser and several men from Company A set out to secure the telegraph office. On the way there, Ellsworth spotted a Confederate flag atop the Marshall House inn. It was the same flag Ellsworth had seen for weeks from the White House during <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> with Lincoln. Ellsworth's group entered the inn and quickly cut down the flag, but they encountered the proprietor, James Jackson, as they descended the stairs. Jackson killed Ellsworth with a shotgun blast to the chest, and Cpl. Francis Brownell responded in kind by fatally shooting the innkeeper.|$|E

5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on <b>his</b> <b>visits.</b>|$|E
5|$|Conquest in Africa and the East {{provided}} both {{wonder and}} terror to European intellectuals, as {{it led to}} the conclusion that Eden could never have been an actual geographical location. The Garden references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to Cyriac of Ancona, a travel writer known for <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.|$|E
5|$|European {{exploration}} {{continued in}} the area around Thebes during the nineteenth century, boosted by Champollion's translation of hieroglyphs. Early in the century, the area was visited by Belzoni, working for Henry Salt, who discovered several tombs, including those of Ay in the West Valley (WV23) in 1816 and Seti I (KV17) the following year. At the end of <b>his</b> <b>visits,</b> Belzoni declared that all of the tombs had been located and nothing of note remained to be found. Working at the same time (and a great rival of Belzoni and Salt) was Bernardino Drovetti, the French Consul-General.|$|E

5|$|John and Prudentia Hogg {{were glad}} to hear that the Shelleys had left England, hoping that their son would become more {{conservative}} in Percy's absence. They were disappointed with his continued rejection of their Tory political views, but he did attend church with them during <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> and was no longer a vegetarian. They were also somewhat concerned about Hogg's association with the radical publisher Leigh Hunt and his circle of friends. Through Hunt, Hogg became acquainted with several members of London's literary circles, including Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Lamb and Walter Coulson. Hogg also met John Keats, who gave him a copy of his first book of poetry.|$|E
5|$|Jolin, {{as well as}} Dardel, used a naïve {{style in}} their {{paintings}} before this concept had been introduced into the Swedish art world. Both Jolin and Dardel were inspired by French naïvists, not just by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but also by Séraphine Louis who lived in Sentis and Wilhelm Uhde, a specialist in naïve painting. Matisse, Jolin's and Dardel's mentor, {{was no stranger to}} naïve art but it was not prominent in his work. Jolin also appreciated the cultivated and sophisticated, older painting, and was deeply impressed during <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> to the Louvre, where he was inspired by the works of masters such as Rubens, Watteau and Chardin.|$|E
5|$|Most Jews, {{religious}} and secular, consider {{the wall to}} be important to the Jewish people since it was originally built to hold the Second Temple. They consider the capture of the wall by Israel in 1967 as a historic event since it restored Jewish access to the site after a 19-year gap. There are, however, some haredi Jews who hold different views. Most notable are the adherents of the Satmar hasidic dynasty who retain the views espoused by their Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who would not approach the Wall after the 1967 conquest because of his opposition to Zionism, although he did visit the site during <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> to the Holy Land in the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Pound {{returned}} from America in 1911 and resumed <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> to Olivia and Dorothy, adhering to Olivia's restrictions. That October Pound formally asked to marry Dorothy; her father refused {{on the basis}} of Pound's meagre income. Neither Dorothy nor Pound gave up: he again asked for permission to marry her in March 1912 but was again rejected. In Dorothy's mind they continued to be engaged, although they were only allowed short visits in the Family drawing room once a week or every two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Rosebowl was {{an account}} of a trip around the world taken by Gibson and his wife in 1951. It {{described}} <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> to cultural institutions and contained ruminations on cultural collections policy. Reflecting on {{the damage caused by}} World War II to cultural artifacts, art and architecture, he advocated a wide distribution of works of art around the world, to afford them greater protection. He was {{to have an opportunity to}} pursue these views in later roles with the National Gallery of Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The Shelleys {{moved to}} Windsor {{in the summer}} of 1815. Hogg visited them there when his {{workload}} permitted. They left England for Continental Europe again in May 1816, and Hogg resumed <b>his</b> <b>visits</b> after their return, but he was no longer as close to them as he had been. This was in part due to his awkwardness with Mary, who was preoccupied with her efforts to finish writing Frankenstein. Percy and Hogg were nonetheless able to convince Mary to attend the opera with them on a few occasions.|$|E
