5|$|According to a 1997 U.S. Census Bureau report {{less than}} 10% of {{severely}} disabled individuals were employed. Despite the various barriers to employment, some AAC users achieve success in educational endeavours and employment, though often in lower paying jobs. Factors {{that have been}} <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to employment are a strong work ethic and access to AAC technology, the support of family and friends, education, and work skills. Individuals with ALS who use AAC may continue working; factors supporting continued employment include access to AAC, support from employers, governmental programs and others. Employers of AAC users report that skills in time management, problem solving, communication, technology and a good education are important to employers.|$|E
5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} {{was placed in}} the genus Pitohui with five other species, and the genus was thought to reside within the Australasian {{whistler}} family (Pachycephalidae). A 2008 examination of the genus, however, found it to be polyphyletic (meaning that the genus contained unrelated species), with some purported members of the genus not actually falling within the whistlers. The hooded pitohui and the closely related variable pitohui were both <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to the Old World orioles (Oriolidae). A 2010 study by the same team confirmed that the hooded pitohui and variable pitohui were orioles and indeed were sister species, and that together with the figbirds they formed a well defined basal clade within the family. As the variable pitohui was the type species for the genus Pitohui, the hooded pitohui was retained in that genus and the four remaining species were moved to other genera.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurid remains {{have never}} been {{recovered}} from eastern North America, while more basal tyrannosauroids, like Dryptosaurus and Appalachiosaurus, persisted there {{until the end of}} the Cretaceous, indicating that tyrannosaurids must have evolved in or dispersed into western North America after the continent was divided in half by the Western Interior Seaway in the middle of the Cretaceous. Tyrannosaurid fossils have been found in Alaska, which may have provided a route for dispersal between North America and Asia. Alioramus and Tarbosaurus are <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> in one cladistic analysis, forming a unique Asian branch of the family. This was later disproven with the discovery of Qianzhousaurus and the description of the tyrannosaur family Alioramini. Tyrannosaurid teeth from a large species of unknown variety were discovered in the Nagasaki Peninsula by researchers from the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum, further expanding the range of the group. The teeth were estimated to be 81 million years old (Campanian Age).|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the return rates on portfolio characteristics of eighteen diversified CREF's from 1983 through 1988 using regression analysis and paired comparisons of funds. The {{purpose of the}} study <b>is</b> <b>to</b> examine the relationships between CREF-specific characteristics and CREF return. Over the sample period, the size of the real estate investment and the level of liquidity within a CREF portfolio <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> return, the use of leverage <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beneficial only when nominal return on CREFs was relatively high compared to interest rates on mortgages, {{and the size of the}} fund <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> negatively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> return. This latter finding is opposite findings in earlier studies, suggesting previously unobserved cyclical performance for CREFs.

40|$|Isolates {{representing}} newly described Neosartorya species, and isolates with abnormal morphologies from Aspergillus section Fumigati {{were examined}} by phylogenetic analysis of sequences {{of part of}} their beta-tubulin gene. Phylogenetic analyses supported the earlier suggestions that heterothallism is a derived character, and that sexuality was lost {{several times during the}} evolution of Aspergillus section Fumigati.

25|$|More recently, nest {{insulation}} {{has been}} <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> {{to the mass}} of the incubating parent. This is known as an allometric relationship. Nest walls are constructed with an adequate quantity of nesting material so that the nest will be capable of supporting the contents of the nest. Nest thickness, nest mass and nest dimensions therefore correlate with {{the mass of the}} adult bird. The flow-on consequence of this is that nest insulation is also related to parent mass.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, an mtDNA {{sequence}} {{from the}} femur of a 430,000 year old Homo heidelbergensis from the Sima de los Huesos cave in Spain was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> {{to that of}} the Neanderthals and the Denisovans, but closer to the latter. Later analysis of nuclear DNA sequences from two specimens showed they were more closely related to Neanderthals rather than to Denisovans, while one of these samples also had the Denisovan-related mtDNA. The authors suggest that the mtDNA found in these specimens represent an archaic sequence indicative of Neanderthal's kinship with Denisovans that was subsequently lost in Neanderthals due to replacement by a more modern-human-related sequence.|$|E

25|$|Bottom-up {{processes}} include group composition, {{namely the}} characteristics of group members which are aggregated to the team level encompassing. An example of such bottom-up processes is the average social sensitivity or the average and maximum intelligence scores of group members. Furthermore, collective intelligence was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to a group's cognitive diversity including thinking styles and perspectives. Groups that are moderately diverse in cognitive style have higher collective intelligence {{than those who are}} very similar in cognitive style or very different. Consequently, groups where members are too similar to each other lack the variety of perspectives and skills needed to perform well. On the other hand, groups whose members are too different seem to have difficulties to communicate and coordinate effectively.|$|E
25|$|The related {{concept of}} {{maternal}} mind-mindedness assesses the mother's {{ability to understand}} and verbalize the infant's mind: thoughts, desires, intentions and memories. Maternal mind-mindedness has been <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to some developmental results, such as attachment security. A caregiver's comment is deemed an appropriate mind-related comment if the comment was deemed to match the infant's behaviour by the independent coder, if the comment associated the infant's current activity to past activities, and/or if the comment encouraged the infant {{to go on with}} his or her intentions when the conversation paused. This correlates to high maternal mind-mindedness. If the caregiver assigns the wrong internal state to the baby's behaviour, if the comment about the current activity is not insufficiently associated with a past event, if the comment deters the infant from proceeding with the current activity, and/or if the comment is unclear, it is deemed a in-appropriate mind-related comment and correlates to low mind-mindedness.|$|E

500|$|Some {{traditional}} hypotheses of {{snake venom}} evolution {{have supported the}} idea that most snakes inject far more venom into their prey than is required to kill them; thus, venom composition would {{not be subject to}} natural selection. This is known as the [...] "overkill" [...] hypothesis. However, recent studies of the molecular history of snake venom have contradicted this, instead finding evidence of rapid adaptive evolution in many different clades, including the carpet vipers, Echis, the ground rattlesnakes, Sistrurus, and the Malayan pit viper, as well as generally in the diversification of PLA2 proteins. There is phylogenetic evidence of positive selection and rapid rates of gene gain and loss in venom genes of Sistrurus taxa feeding on different prey. Several studies have found evidence that venom and resistance to venom in prey species have evolved in a coevolutionary arms race. For example, wood rats of the genus Neotoma have a high degree of resistance to the venom of rattlesnakes, suggesting that the rats have evolved in response to the snake venom, thus renewing selection pressure upon the snakes. The selection pressure on snake venom is thought to be selecting for functional diversity within the proteins in venom, both within a given species, and across species. The genes that code for venom proteins in some snake genera have a proportion of synonymous mutations that is lower than would be expected if venom were evolving through neutral evolutionary processes. In addition, snake venom is metabolically costly for a snake to produce, which scientists have suggested as further evidence that a selection pressure exists on snake venom (in this case, to minimize the volume of venom required). The use of model organisms, rather than snakes' natural prey, to study prey toxicity, has been suggested as a reason why the [...] "overkill" [...] hypothesis may have been overemphasized. However, the pitviper genus Agkistrodon {{has been found to be}} an exception to this; the composition of venom in Agkistrodon has been <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to the position of the species within the phylogeny, suggesting that those venoms have evolved mostly through neutral processes (mutation and genetic drift), and that there may be significant variation in the selection pressure upon various snake venoms.|$|E

40|$|Aesthetic, function, {{and fashion}} {{consumer}} values are investigated {{in relationship to}} other values and demographic variables. Findings suggest that fashion oriented consumers tend to value quantity over quality, buy from "want " rather than "need, " value disposability over recycling, or not return garments to a store and complain when dissatisfied. Consumers that value functionality {{are also more likely}} to value cost over convenience, need over want, and recycling over disposability.

2500|$|Michael Faraday began, in 1832, what {{promised to}} be a rather tedious attempt to prove that all electricities had {{precisely}} the same properties and caused precisely the same effects. The key effect was electrochemical decomposition. Voltaic and electromagnetic electricity posed no problems, but static electricity did. As Faraday delved deeper into the problem, he made two startling discoveries. First, electrical force did not, as had long been supposed, act at a distance upon molecules to cause them to dissociate. It was the passage of electricity through a conducting liquid medium that caused the molecules to dissociate, even when the electricity merely discharged {{into the air and}} did not pass through a [...] "pole" [...] or [...] "center of action" [...] in a voltaic cell. Second, the amount of the decomposition was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> directly to the amount of electricity passing through the solution.|$|E
