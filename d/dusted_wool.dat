40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of two organic <b>dusts,</b> <b>wool</b> and grain, and their soluble leachates to stimulate secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by rat alveolar macrophages with special reference to the role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: Rat alveolar macrophages were isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and treated in vitro with whole dust, dust leachates, and a standard LPS preparation. TNF production was measured in supernatants with the L 929 cell line bioassay. RESULTS: Both <b>wool</b> and grain <b>dust</b> samples were capable of stimulating TNF release from rat alveolar macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. The standard LPS preparation caused a dose-dependent secretion of TNF. Leachates prepared from the dusts contained LPS and also caused TNF release but leachable LPS could not account for the TNF release and it was clear that non-LPS leachable activity was present in the grain <b>dust</b> and that <b>wool</b> <b>dust</b> particles themselves were capable of causing release of TNF. The role of LPS in <b>wool</b> <b>dust</b> leachates was further investigated by treating peritoneal macrophages from two strains of mice, LPS responders (C 3 H) and LPS non-responders (C 3 H/HEJ), with LPS. The non-responder mouse macrophages produced very low concentrations of TNF in response to the <b>wool</b> <b>dust</b> leachates compared with the responders. CONCLUSIONS: LPS and other unidentified leachable substances present on the surface of grain dust, and to a lesser extent on <b>wool</b> <b>dust,</b> are a trigger for TNF release by lung macrophages. <b>Wool</b> <b>dust</b> particles themselves stimulate TNF. TNF release from macrophages could contribute to enhancement of inflammatory responses and symptoms of bronchitis and breathlessness in workers exposed to organic <b>dusts</b> such as <b>wool</b> and grain...|$|R

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} workers in wool textile mills have shown a direct {{relation}} between the concentration of <b>wool</b> <b>dust</b> {{in the air and}} respiratory symptoms. Injurious effects of <b>wool</b> <b>dust</b> on the bronchial epithelium could be important in causing inflammation and irritation. A pulmonary epithelial cell line in vitro was therefore used to study the toxic effects of <b>wool</b> <b>dust.</b> Cells of the A 549 epithelial cell line were labelled with 51 Cr and treated with whole <b>wool</b> <b>dusts</b> and extracts of wool, after which injury was assessed. Also, the effects of grain dust, which also causes a form of airway obstruction, were studied. The epithelial injury was assessed by measuring 51 Cr release from cells as an indication of lysis, and by monitoring cells which had detached from the substratum. No significant injury to A 549 cells was caused by culture with any of the dusts collected from the air but surface "ledge" dust caused significant lysis at some doses. Quartz, used as a toxic control dust, caused significant lysis at the highest concentration of 100 micrograms/well. To determine whether any injurious material was soluble the dusts were incubated in saline and extracts collected. No extracts caused significant injury to epithelial cells. A similar lack of toxicity was found when 51 Cr labelled control alveolar macrophages were targets for injury. Significant release of radiolabel was evident when macrophages were exposed to quartz at concentrations of 10 and 20 micrograms/well, there being no significant injury with either <b>wool</b> or grain <b>dusts.</b> These data suggest that neither <b>wool</b> nor grain <b>dust</b> produce direct injury to epithelial cells, and further studies are necessary to explain inflammation leading to respiratory symptoms in wool and grain workers...|$|R

50|$|Sheep wool {{insulation}} is often treated with borax to enhance its fire retardant and pest repellent qualities. The level of Borax is relatively low only 4% dry weight although the scouring baths {{have a higher}} load of 8-9%. Borax mining employs one of the cleanest mining techniques available but borax is increasingly coming into focus as a suspected reproductive toxin having been considered relatively safe for many years; animal ingestion studies in several species, at high doses, indicate that borates cause reproductive and developmental effects. The most significant exposure route for humans is inhalation which raises questions over whether <b>dust</b> from <b>wool</b> insulation {{could lead to a}} significant exposure to humans; probably unlikely for anyone except professional installers.|$|R
40|$|Allergy is {{a serious}} health problem {{throughout}} the world, affecting people of all ages. Allergic diseases such as asthma, rhinitis and atopic dermatitis are becoming an epidemic in our country, the cost of investigating these diseases is increasing and becoming expensively high. There {{are many ways to}} explore allergenic antibodies to assess the presence the amount of specific IgE as: Skin test (Prick), Specific IgE (ELISA), RAST Sp. IgE and Elimination Challenge method. Skin test produces pain, local and anaphylactic reaction and patient discomfort, other procedure with highly cost to patient. So, we have built up an evidence to use it in our allergy and immunology clinic has suitable cost for all patients based about for the other tests but it was very simple, accurate, cheap and does not produce any problems to patients. Our test depends on ELISA technique, it measures the quantitative amount of the following different allergens: As regard food allergens: Milk, Eggs, Banana, Maize, Fish, Chocolate, Wheat, Nuts, Strawberry, Shrimps, Spices, with drug as Aspirin. As regard inhalants as: House dust, Mite, Mixed Pollens, Mixed Moulds, Hay <b>dust,</b> <b>Wool,</b> Latex and Cat Hair. 150 allergic patient results of our test compared with specific IgE national kits (ELISA), Sp. IgE (RAST), Skin test and elimination challenge test. The statistical evaluation results as regard senistivity respectively: 88. 9 %, 89. 6 %, 91. 2 %, 71. 4 %, 93. 1 %. As regard specificity the results: 93. 1 %, 94. 7 %, 95. 3 %, 65. 5 %, 91. 6 %, the latter results showed that our test was in line with all tests. Our test was probably in food, drug and inhalant allergens, it can be also noted that the cheapest and most commercial technique was used, so as to be available immediately in standard laboratory and its reagents, plate and other requirements were prepared locally in our laboratory. Now it was applying successfully in allergy and immunology unit Ain Shams university hospitals in Egypt. </p...|$|R
40|$|Dust {{penetration}} {{is currently}} {{used as a}} measure of dust content when selecting indirectly for improved yield and style of wool. Merino wool from 3160 ewe and wether hogget’s over 3 years was used to estimate genetic parameters of <b>dust</b> and <b>wool</b> production traits. <b>Dust</b> penetration and dust index had a low genetic and phenotypic correlation (0. 23 and 0. 23 respectively). Dust index had a low heritability (0. 20) while dust penetration had a moderate heritability (0. 25). Genetic correlations between yield and wax (- 0. 82), suint (- 0. 62) or dust index (- 0. 59) were negative, while the correlation between yield and dust penetration was positive (0. 36). It was concluded that dust penetration and dust content are genetically distinct, therefore, dust penetration should not be used {{as a measure of}} dust content. Breeders will make faster genetic gain in reducing dust content by selecting animals on the basis of higher yield rather than dust penetration. Despite having higher yields, style grades may decline as the wools may look dirtier due to increased dust penetration...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{assessment}} of the allergenic potential towards wool products from indoor living areas (e. g. carpets, bedding and insulating material) with skin contact and with contact by the respiratory tract for inhale particles. New and used wool products were characterised with protein chemical methods (amino acid analysis and SDS gel electrophoresis). The processing agents (e. g. flame retarding and mothproofing agents) and substances like pesticides were characterised with analytic methods. The long-term use of wool products from indoor living areas can lead to changes of the products. Mechanical influence is important by carpets and is leading to damages {{on the surface of the}} carpet and the wool fibres. Fibrillates wool fibres were found. Thermal influence is important by insulating material and beddings and is leading only to small changes on the wool fibre surface. By insulating material humidity could not provoke the building of mildew. Mite contamination was founded by several beddings. This mite contamination must be involved by the investigation of the allergenic potential. The changes of the wool products generated by thermal influences are be simulated by an artificial thermal ageing process. The wool before and after ageing is not significantly different in the composition of the amino acids. But it was found a significantly decrease in the band pattern in the area of the KIF. This decrease was caused by new protein cross linkage (lanthionine and isodipeptide linkage (epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine). The changes of the processing agents are characterised by analytical methods. During the long-term use of the products dust particles can be produced. The building of dust was simulated by laboratory tests for mechanical weakly influenced products (e. g. insulating material, bedding) and mechanical strongly influenced products (e. g. carpets). <b>Wool</b> <b>dust</b> is a complex mixture of the wool, inorganic and organic compounds from the processing agents and substances of the environment. The <b>dust</b> particles of <b>wool</b> fibres are wool fibre fragments of different dimension, cortical cells, cortical fragments, polygonal cuticular cells and cuticular cell fragments. The total airborne dust and the fine airborne dust of a carpet were collected with a dust sampler. The collected dust was characterised. The investigation of the solubility of <b>wool</b> and <b>wool</b> <b>dust</b> was made with physiological model solution under in-vitro-conditions. The model solution of sweat and bronchial fluid are modified with enzymes for simulate the enzymatic activity of human fluids. The incubation of beddings with synthetic enzyme free and modified sweat solution solved only a small amount of proteins (max. 1 %). The soluble proteins show a great similarity to the PCL of the wool and the endocuticula. The incubation of dust of insulating materials and carpets with enzyme free and modified solution for the extracellular and intracellular lung solution solved only a small amount of proteins (max. 2 %). The soluble proteins show a substantial similarity to the PCL and the endocuticula and by the use of the enzyme trypsine to the proteins of the medulla and of the intermediarfilaments. However neither <b>wool</b> nor <b>wool</b> <b>dust</b> could be solved by the model solution under the conditions of these investigations. The dermatological tests (prick test) of extracts from the wool products showed no significantly reactions by test persons with a positive wool intolerance. Processing agents and the ageing of the products showed likewise no influences. No type-I-allergy is released by the solved proteins and substances from the wool products...|$|R
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} study of 2153 workers in 15 West Yorkshire wool textile mills {{was conducted to}} determine relations between respiratory symptoms and exposure to inspirable <b>wool</b> mill <b>dust.</b> A questionnaire designed to elicit all the common respiratory symptoms was developed and tested, and administered to all workers willing to participate (85 %). It was translated and administered in Urdu for the 385 workers from Pakistan whose English was not fluent. Symptoms investigated included cough and phlegm, wheezing and chest tightness, breathlessness and its variability, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, chills, nosebleeds, and chest illnesses. Additional questions were asked, where appropriate, about the times of day, days of the week, seasons, and places that the symptoms were worse or better than normal. An environmental survey was carried out at each mill, which included 629 measurements of inspirable dust, enabling estimates {{to be made of}} the airborne concentrations of inspirable dust usually experienced by each member of the workforce under current conditions. Overall symptom prevalences were: persistent cough and phlegm, 9 %; wheeze, 31 %; breathlessness on walking with others on level ground, 10 %; persistent rhinitis, 18 %; persistent conjunctivitis, 10 %; persistent chills, 2 %; ten or more nosebleeds a year, 2 %; and three or more chest illnesses in past three years, 5 %. After allowing for the effects of age, sex, smoking habit, and ethnic group, cough and phlegm, wheeze, breathlessness, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and nosebleeds were found to be more frequent in those exposed to higher than to lower concentrations of dust. In some experiencing high concentrations (blenders and carpet yarn backwinders) cough and phlegm, wheeze, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis were related to the years worked in such jobs. Relative risks of each symptom in relation to inspirable dust concentrations were calculated by means of a logistic regression analysis. At concentrations of 10 mg/m 3, the current United Kingdom standard for nuisance dusts, the risk of cough and phlegm relative to that of an unexposed worker was 1. 37, that of wheeze 1. 40, breathlessness 1. 48, rhinitis 1. 24, and conjunctivitis 1. 70. Since some of these symptoms may be associated with functional impairment of the lungs, further studies of selected workers are being carried out to estimate the functional effects of exposure to <b>dust</b> in <b>wool</b> textile mills...|$|R
5000|$|In October 1884, Macaulay {{convinced}} Secretary of State for India Lord Randolph Churchill of {{the need}} to undertake a mission to Tibet, which would include Tibetan scholar Sarat Chandra Das. It was agreed that he would first travel to Sikkim to discuss with its Chogyal the administration of the state and its relations with the British government. He was then to travel on to the Lachen Valley to investigate the feasibility of opening a trade route into Tibet's Ü-Tsang province and finally to attempt to establish friendly relations with the Tibetans to the north of Sikkim. Permission for entry to Tibet from India had been agreed in advance by the Chinese Qing authorities under the [...] "Separate Article" [...] contained in the 1876 Chefoo Convention. Macaulay was given the requisite visa despite the objections of some members of the Zongli Yamen with the notable exception of pro-reform minister Li Hongzhang. Macauly believed that a ready market existed in Tibet for Indian tea and British textiles, with Tibet exporting gold <b>dust,</b> musk and <b>wool</b> and assured the Sikkim Chogyal that the British would pay for the necessary roads and bridges while Sikkim would need to supply only labour.However, in 1885, [...] "international concerns" [...] arose and the British government cancelled the entire mission.

40|$|Background: Skin prick test (SPT) is {{the most}} {{effective}} diagnostic test to detect IgE mediated type I allergic reactions like allergic rhinitis, atopic asthma, acute urticaria, food allergy etc. SPTs are done to know allergic sensitivity and applied for devising immunotherapy as the therapeutic modality. Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted in the department of Immunology and Molecular medicine at SKIMS. A total of 400 patients suffering from allergic rhinitis, asthma and urticaria were recruited in this study. SPT was performed with panel of allergens including house dust mite, pollens, fungi, <b>dusts,</b> cockroach, sheep <b>wool</b> and dog epithelia. Allergen immunotherapy was given to allergic rhinitis and asthmatic patients as therapeutic modality. Results: In our study, age of patients ranged from 6 to 65 years. Majority of patients were in the age group of 20 - 30 years (72 %) with Male to female ratio of 1 : 1. 5. Of the 400 patients, 248 (62 %) had urticaria, 108 (27 %) patients had allergic rhinitis and 44 (11 %) patients had asthma. SPT reaction was positive in 38 (86. 4 %) with allergic asthma, 74 (68. 5 %) patients with allergic rhinitis and 4 (1. 6 %) patient with urticaria, respectively. Allergen immunotherapy was effective in 58 % patients with allergic rhinitis and 42 % allergic asthma. Conclusion: Identifiable aeroallergen could be detected in 86. 4 % allergic asthma and 68. 5 % allergic rhinitis patients by SPT alone. Pollens were the most prevalent causative allergen. There was significant relief in the severity of symptoms, medication intake with the help of allergen immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer death in North America. Exposure to cotton dust has {{previously}} been reported to decrease the risk of lung cancer. We used data from two large case-control studies conducted in Montreal from 1979 - 1986 (Study 1) and 1996 - 2002 (Study 2) respectively, to examine the association between occupational exposure to cotton dust and risk of lung cancer. Cases were diagnosed with incident histologically-confirmed lung cancer (857 in Study 1, 1203 in Study 2). Population controls were randomly selected from electoral lists and frequency-matched to cases by age and sex (533 in Study 1, 1513 in Study 2). Interviews for the two studies used a virtually identical questionnaire to obtain lifetime occupational and smoking history, and several lifestyle covariates. Each participant's lifetime occupational history was reviewed by experts to assess exposure to a number of occupational agents, including cotton dust. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. The lifetime prevalence of exposure to cotton dust was approximately 10 %- 15 % in both studies combined, with some variation by study and by sex. Overall there was no decreased risk of lung cancer among subjects exposed to cotton dust. Rather, among all subjects there was a suggestion of slightly increased risk associated with any lifetime exposure to cotton dust (OR[*]=[*] 1. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 1. 5). This risk appeared to be concentrated among cases of adenocarcinoma (OR[*]=[*] 1. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 2. 2), and among moderate and heavy smokers (OR[*]=[*] 1. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 1. 7). There was no association when restricting to cases of either squamous cell or small cell cancer, or among never smokers and light smokers. An analogous examination of subjects exposed to <b>wool</b> <b>dust</b> revealed neither increased nor decreased risks of lung cancer. There was no evidence that cotton dust exposure decreased risks of lung cancer...|$|R
40|$|The {{temporary}} or supplementary thread {{has been}} {{employed as a}} supportive structure {{in the manufacture of}} utilitarian and decorative woven textiles for over a hundred years. First developed by wool cleaners and finishers during the mid 19 th century, the technique has been repeatedly employed to aid innovative yarn and fabric development by some of the textile industry’s leading engineers. The devoré technique, also known as burn out, developed from this temporary thread process during the late 1880 s. The popularity of devoré with textiles engineers reached its peak in the 1920 s when a period of high decoration coincided with innovation in new artificial fibers such as viscose rayon and cellulose acetate. The post war resurgence in textile engineering and fashion designing during the Art Deco period engendered numerous highly decorative devoré and temporary thread processes that utilized metallic, rayon, wire and latex threads. Fabric Innovation from Established Processes The devoré procedure of chemically removing single or multiple fibers from a constructed fabric {{can be traced to the}} wool cleaning industries of the mid to late 19 th century and the carbonizing treatment, employed to remove plant debris trapped within wool fleece. By treating wool in sulphuric acid solution, contaminating plant matter was reduced to <b>dust</b> when the <b>wool</b> was heated. The earliest forms of woven devoré follow the same principle of destruction, only the plant matter was replaced with cotton threads constructed within a wool woven textile. Initially it was American and European yarn manufacturers who recognised the economic potential of the temporary thread technique. Delicate wool fibers were twisted (spun) with a cotton thread which acted as a secure rigid guide during fabric construction. The earliest forms of fabric patterning using carbonizing treatments favored localised thread removal using printed carbonising pastes, whereupon cotton or linen threads previously twisted with wool or silk threads, and used for the warp or weft (or both), were burnt away revealing delicate lace-like open work effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{relations}} of lung function and chest radiographic appearances with exposure to inspirable dust {{were examined in}} 634 workers in five wool textile mills in west Yorkshire, randomly selected to represent fully the range of current exposures to <b>wool</b> mill <b>dust.</b> Most of these workers could be categorised into three large sex and ethnic groups; European men, Asian men, and Asian women. Exposures to inspirable dust had been measured at a previous survey and time spent in current job, and in the industry were used as surrogates for lifetime cumulative exposures. Chest radiographs were interpreted on the International Labour Office (ILO) scale by three medically qualified readers, and the results combined. Profusions of small opacities of 0 / 1 on the ILO scale, or greater, were present in only 6 % of the population, and were not positively associated with current exposure to <b>wool</b> mill <b>dust,</b> or duration of exposure. In general, statistically significant relations between exposure and lung function indices were not found, {{with the exception of}} an inverse relation between the forced expiratory volume/forced vital capacity ratio and dust concentration in European women. A suggestive but not statistically significant inverse relation between FVC and current dust concentration was seen in Asian men. Substantial differences were found between mills in mean values of lung function variables after adjustment for other factors but these were not apparently related to the differences in dust concentrations between these mills. Dyeworkers and wool scourers (mostly European men in relatively dust free jobs) on average experienced an FEV 1 251 ml lower than other workers when age, height, smoking habits, and occupational factors had been taken into account. Twenty four per cent of the workforce responded to intracutaneous application of one or more common allergens (weal diameter at least 4 mm), only 12 (7. 9 %) of these responding to wool extracts. Atopic subjects did not appear to have an increased susceptibility to the effects of inspirable <b>wool</b> <b>dust</b> on lung function. These studies suggest that exposure to <b>wool</b> mill <b>dust</b> may cause functional impairment in some workers but there is little indication from these data of frequent or severe dust related functional deficits. More detailed estimates of cumulative dust exposure by reconstruction of exposure histories might clarify associations between exposure to dust and lung function. These chest radiographic findings provide no evidence that exposure to <b>wool</b> mill <b>dust</b> is related to lung fibrosis...|$|R
