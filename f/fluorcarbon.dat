It is also an alternative for <b>fluorcarbon</b> aftertreatments to impart anti-staining properties to polyamide yarn or carpets.However, due to economic considerations currently the only widespread use as textile auxiliary is the use as an agent to improve chlorine fastness, i.e. resistance against dye bleaching due to cleaning with hypochlorite solutions in high-end polyamide 6,6-based carpets and swimwear. It is, however, used in relatively small quantities for the activation of upholstery flock; this serves as an anti-static treatment.|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{influence}} of fluorocarbon FC 43 on the metabolism of oestrogens in the isolated perfused rat liver was investigated. In comparative once-through pcrfusions with FC 43 emulsion or a lbumin solution as perfusion medium, the clearance rates of oestrone and its metabolites were determined. In pcrfusions with FC 43, the clear-ance of oestrone was lower, and the metabolites {{formed in the}} liver were more concentrated in the outflowing medium than in perfusions without fluorocarbon. This {{can be explained by}} the high affinity, even of conjugated oestrogens, to FC 43, which is established by equilibrium dialysis and partition coefficient. The results presented here show that the fluorocarbon has a strong {{influence of}} its own on the metabolism of steroids in the isolated perfused liver. There-fore, this solvent should be avoided as medium when the metabolism of steroids is studied in perfusion experiments.

40|$|Unprecedentedly high {{reflectivity}} distributed Bragg reflectors {{consisting of}} fluorocarbon polymer (CFx) and high refractive index inorganic oxide multilayers have been fabricated {{by means of}} assisted ion-beam sputtering at room temperature. Multilayer stacks consisting of a CFx/TiOx and CFx/HfOx pairs exhibit reflectivities larger than 98 % in the infrared and ultraviolet spectral region, respectively. The superior wide tunability and the high efficiency, with respect to inorganic-inorganic multilayers {{is due to the}} exceptionally low refractive index of the <b>fluorcarbon</b> polymer (n similar or equal to 1. 35) on a very large spectral region (300 - 2000 nm).

40|$|Different plasma {{treatments}} in a rf {{discharge of}} Ar, He, or N 2 {{are used to}} etch, cross-link, and activate polymers like PC, PP, EPDM, PE, PS, PET and PMMA. Due to the numerous ways a plasma interacts with the polymer surface, the gas type and the plasma conditions must be adjusted on the polymer type to minimize degradation and aging effects. Wetting and friction properties of polymers can be improved by a simple plasma treatment, demonstrated on PC and EPDM, respectively. However, the deposition of ultra-thin layers by plasma enables the adjustment of wetting properties, using siloxane-based or <b>fluorcarbon</b> films, and further reduction of the friction coefficient, applying siloxane or a-C:H coatings. Nevertheless, the adhesion of plasma-deposited coatings should be regarded, which can be enhanced by depositing a graded layer...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 72 - 76) Energy conservation {{will allow}} the earth's limited resource base of high quality fuel to be stretched further. The {{fact is that we}} may be faced with continuing shortages of fuel and power unless new sources are developed. It has become increasingly advantageous to produce power from previously wasted heat. Power produced by waste heat has no fuel costs. Further cost considerations involve only the investment for new equipment to generate the power. Waste heat sources are most common in big industries such as the chemical, cement, power, petroleum, steel and food industries. These six industries produce seventy percent of the nation's total wasted heat. One of the most efficient ways of converting waste heat into work is {{through the use of a}} Rankine Cycle, now commonly used in most heat recovery plants. Traditionally the working fluid for Rankine Cycles has been water, since it is low in cost. However, other fluids have also been used because of the disadvantages presented in employing water. For example, hydrocarbons are widely used in oil and gas related plants. <b>Fluorcarbon</b> refrigerants also are used in many industries. Supplementary to this project is a computer program allowing easier and faster access to thermodynamic properties. Because of the importance of thermodynamic properties, a eleven constants equation-of-state (a revised version of the Benedict Webb Rubin equation) has been used in the program. A broad discussion on fluids selection explains how and why propane and R- 22 have been selected as the best fluids when compared to the other nine fluids. Also presented as an analysis the pressure and temperature sensitivity of Iso Butane, in an attempt to find the best thermodynamic point to enter or exit expanders and other equipment involved in the Rankine Cycle. Also presented is a discussion of the economic point of view, showing that the Rankine Cycle can have a payback period of one and at the most five, years...|$|E
