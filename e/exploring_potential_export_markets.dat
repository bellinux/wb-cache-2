5000|$|The {{domestic}} fuel blending <b>market</b> and the <b>export</b> <b>market</b> for ethanol remain difficult in Ethiopia for several reasons. The technical precision and regulation necessary for successful blending has prevented its success in Ethiopia; major petroleum sellers like Shell, Total, Mobil, and domestic {{companies such as}} National Oil resist the blending of ethanol in petroleum fuels because the fuel supply system is poorly regulated and the fuel is sometimes adulterated. [...] Fuel sellers cannot trust the integrity of their fuel if blended with ethanol, because the ethanol may take up water into the fuel and promote phase separation and worsened contamination. [...] As for the <b>export</b> <b>market,</b> Ethiopia’s ethanol production {{is too small to}} attract large international buyers and has only succeeded in selling ethanol at lower prices than other exporters. Ethiopia’s landlocked location also makes export difficult.

The model predicts that more productive firms employ strategies that generally involve entering more markets, larger markets, and entering markets more rapidly. More productive firms also tend to enter larger then smaller markets whereas less productive firms tend to enter smaller then larger markets.

Given the aggregate size of the region’s <b>potential</b> <b>export</b> <b>market</b> for textiles and garments, a halving of average shipping costs would increase exports twenty-fold.

It has the positive effect of contributing to improve the performance of the domestic industry. Besides, the new industries will create job opportunities and produce a sustainable economic growth. However, the fact that Côte d'Ivoire is party to RTAs in the sub-region like WAEMU and ECOWAS frameworks reduces the <b>potential</b> <b>export</b> <b>market</b> within the region for the SEZs based companies. In addition, the investors in SEZs could be faced with trade barriers induced by the divergent trade rules under RTAs. That could make the would-be investors reluctant to invest in Côte d'Ivoire, and induce them to choose another country to invest in. In the light of the need for investors to deal with clear and predictable rules, this investigation argues that the multiplicity of regional and divergent regulations governing goods from SEZs could be source of confusion and concerns, and eventually, it could impact negatively on SEZs programmes implementation in Côte d'Ivoire.

40|$|We {{contrast}} FDI {{liberalization and}} import substitution as alternative development {{strategies in the}} presence of agglomeration economies. We first develop a two-country model where firm-level increasing returns and inter-firm linkages, stemming from the use of intermediates, generate external economies in manufacturing. With positive transport costs, such external economies are partly country-specific. Hence, industry agglomerates in one country (the North), while the other (the LDC) enjoys lower wages and welfare, as in Krugman & Venables (QJE 1995). We then remove policy restrictions on inward FDI. Firms have an incentive to become multinationals (MNC) to reap gains from proximity to foreign customers. We show that MNC may be able to operate profitably in the LDC, even if indigenous firms cannot: the MNC’s cost advantage, stemming from firm-level scale economies, helps them overcome the disadvantages of a small local industrial base. In turn, MNC entry expands this industrial base, encouraging further entry. Hence, MNC promote convergence in industrial structure and income. This may hurt the North, since its manufacturing output may contract, but always benefits the LDC. In contrast, LDC tariffs increase both the domestic demand facing local manufacturers, and the cost of imported intermediates used in local production for both domestic and foreign <b>markets.</b> If <b>potential</b> <b>export</b> <b>markets</b> are relatively large, if tariffs mainly affect intermediates, or if production relies heavily on intermediates, the cost effect dominates and LDC tariffs reinforce the incentive for industry to cluster in the North. Intuitively, tariffs on intermediates reduce LDC firms’ ability to exploit external economies generated abroad. Hence, conventional measures of the gains from trade can substantially underestimate the benefits of LDC trade liberalization...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{feasibility}} study of the commercialization potential of Canarium indicum nuts in Papua New Guinea, market surveys were undertaken in May and September 2005 in the Solomon Islands and in Vanuatu, to gather up-to-date market information on the trade in packaged and processed C. indicum kernels and kernel oil, and on the constraints and opportunities for its further development. In addition, a supply chain analysis was made and a niche market survey was undertaken in Australia. From the findings of these surveys, {{it was concluded that}} globally *the market for nuts is growing. *current demand for Canarium nuts in the region exceeds supply, *market confidence requires improvements in the surety of supply, *the scale of operations and level of technology must be viable at the village small/medium sized enterprise level, *training should be provided pre- and post-harvest in villages and urban centres, and *market development should focus initially on satisfying domestic and regional markets. It was concluded that to implement these conclusions, a marketing network in Melanesia is required to create a 'Melanesian Supply Chain' that {{can take advantage of the}} differences in timing of the fruiting season across the region, and to promote a unified marketing strategy. This network should also assist emerging entrepreneurs with budgeting, cash flow management, product and market development and price setting.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the project {{presented in this article}} was to analyse {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} German organic beef production as compared with France, Austria, the Czech Republic and Argentina. Additionally, a number of marketing initiatives in France, Austria, Great Britain and Switzerland were analysed to examine their applicability to German conditions. Within the framework of the International Farm Comparison Network, eleven case studies of organic beef farms in the countries considered were analysed. The strength of the German farms lies on the return side, which is dominated by direct payments. Germany and Austria produce at the highest cost, and profitability in Germany is relatively low. Competitive pressure from France and Austria can not be expected as long as product price levels are higher than in Germany. On the other hand, export opportunities for Germany are limited due to the preference for beef of national / regional origin. There appears to be an incentive for conversion to organic farming on marginal grassland locations in the Czech Republic. On the other hand, future cost increases can be expected. Price differences between domestic and <b>potential</b> <b>export</b> <b>markets</b> will determine the extent of expansion of organic beef production. Argentina, the lowest cost producer, shows major similarities between organic and conventional beef production. However, its potential for further expansion appears to be limited by the local competition with crop production, the use of GMO-seed, and limited potential for expanding production to locations outside the Humid Pampa. The analysis of marketing initiatives shows, however, that the most pressing need for action lies on the marketing side and among the actors themselves. Improved product quality, price premiums, differentiation of marketing channels, and improved communication (towards consumers and in the supply chain) are key words. As the elbow room for price increases appears to be rather limited in the foreseeable future, cost reductions remain a strategy for the producers, for example through specialisation, growth, productivity improvements and reduction of labour costs...|$|R
