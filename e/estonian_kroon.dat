On 3October 1932, the coalition between the Union of Settlers and Smallholders and National Centre Party broke up, with the latter wanting to devalue the <b>Estonian</b> <b>kroon</b> during the Great Depression. Päts himself was one of the key opponents of devaluation.|$|E

25|$|Otsason led the Bank of Estonia in {{its very}} first years when legal acts {{regulating}} {{the activities of the}} bank were created and monetary reform to re-establish <b>Estonian</b> <b>kroon</b> as the national currency of Estonia was prepared. On 15 March 1990 the Statutes of the Bank of Estonia were approved; on 15 May 1990 the procedure for establishment of commercial banks was established. The programmes for transition to national currency were finished in November 1990 and next year started the preparations for monetary reform.|$|E
25|$|The Government of Estonia {{decided that}} the country should adopt the euro as its {{official}} currency, and finalized the design of Estonian euro coins in late 2004. The switchover to the euro took place on 1 January 2011, later than planned, because continued high inflation had prevented the country from fulfilling the entry criteria earlier. Until joining the eurozone, the <b>Estonian</b> <b>kroon</b> had been pegged to the euro {{at a rate of}} 15.64664 EEK to one euro; before then, the kroon was pegged to the German mark at approximately 8 EEK to one DEM.|$|E
25|$|A month-long {{government}} crisis started. Since {{there were}} only three major parties in the Riigikogu, the third being the Estonian Socialist Workers' Party, no functioning coalition could be found until special authority was given to Konstantin Päts to form a grand coalition between all three major parties. His cabinet took office on 1November 1932. On 25November 1932, Päts's government was given more powers by the disunited Riigikogu to deal with the economic crisis. His government was forced to resign on 18May 1933, after the National Centre Party, still favouring devaluation, left the coalition and the Union of Settlers and Smallholders had lost many of its members to the reactivated Settlers' party. The succeeding Tõnisson's National Centre Party cabinet devalued the <b>Estonian</b> <b>kroon</b> by 35% on 27June 1933. Although the devaluation proved to be successful and had a good impact to the economy later under his own rule, Päts never recognized his mistake by opposing the devaluation.|$|E

50|$|Many coin-operated {{machines}} in Germany {{would accept the}} 1992, 1993 and 1995 stampings of the cupronickel <b>Estonian</b> 1 <b>kroon</b> coin as a German 1 mark coin. This was profitable for users of the Estonian coins as the kroon was pegged to the mark at a fixed rate of 8:1. All cupronickel 1 kroon coins were demonetized in May 1998 and the replacement aluminium-bronze <b>Estonian</b> 1 <b>kroon</b> coin was not interchangeable with the German mark in coin-operated machines.|$|R

25|$|In June 1992, Estonia {{replaced}} the ruble {{with its own}} freely convertible currency, the kroon (EEK). A currency board was created and the new currency was pegged to the German Mark {{at the rate of}} 8 <b>Estonian</b> <b>kroons</b> for 1 Deutsche Mark. When Germany introduced the euro the peg was changed to 15.6466 kroons for 1 euro. Estonia was set to adopt the euro in 2008 but due to high inflation rates the adoption date was delayed to 2011. On 1 January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro and became the 17th eurozone member state.|$|R

50|$|The new {{banknotes}} (the second kroon) reached Estonia in April 1992. The <b>Estonian</b> <b>kroon</b> was pegged to the German Deutschmark to ensure stability. The German Bundesbank was informed of this. The <b>Estonian</b> <b>kroon</b> was declared the sole legal tender in circulation and Eesti Pank the only regulator of monetary relations in Estonia. Within three days, 1500 rubles were exchanged to krooni for each resident natural {{person at the}} rate of 1 kroon = 10 rubles. Almost the entire amount of rubles in circulation in Estonia was exchanged to kroons at the same rate (deposits, money held by enterprises, etc.). The rate was considered under-priced by many opponents, but it actually corresponded to the market rate of that time. Time and the later course of events have indisputably proven the correctness of the choice made. All the laws and other legal acts planned for the beginning of the monetary reform came into effect. Eesti Pank began to publish daily exchange rates of the <b>Estonian</b> <b>kroon</b> against the most important foreign currencies.|$|E
