5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc by the <b>full</b> <b>court.</b> The request was granted, and the <b>full</b> <b>court</b> reversed {{the decision of}} the three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, Napier as {{presiding}} judge in the <b>Full</b> <b>Court</b> appeal and Reed as the trial judge. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on the fairness of the hearing.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Al-Kateb {{appealed the}} {{decision}} against {{him to a}} <b>Full</b> <b>Court</b> of the Federal Court, hoping that the reasoning applied in the Al Masri case (which was factually similar to his situation) would be applied to him. The appeal was removed into the High Court {{at the request of}} the then Attorney-General of Australia Daryl Williams, under provisions of the Judiciary Act 1903. Pending the appeal, Al-Kateb was released in April 2003, by an interlocutory consent order of the Federal Court. The case was argued alongside two other cases which also concerned immigration detention and hearings were held on 12 November and 13 November 2003.|$|E

5|$|On December 15, 2011, Bonds {{was sentenced}} to 30 days of house arrest, two years of {{probation}} and 250 hours of community service, for an obstruction of justice conviction stemming from a grand jury appearance in 2003. However, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston then delayed the sentence pending an appeal. In 2013 his conviction was upheld on appeal by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. However, the <b>full</b> <b>court</b> later granted Bonds an en banc rehearing, and on April 22, 2015, an 11-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit voted 10-1 to overturn his conviction.|$|E
5|$|On February 20, 2010, Noriega's lawyers filed a {{petition}} with the Supreme Court of the United States to block his extradition to France, after the court refused {{to hear his}} appeal the previous month. Noriega's attorneys had hoped the dissenting opinion in that ruling, written by Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, would convince the <b>full</b> <b>court</b> to take up his case, but on March 22, 2010, the Supreme Court refused to hear the petition. Two days after the refusal, the District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami lifted the stay that was blocking Noriega's extradition.

5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, {{for the purposes of}} processing and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed the provisions of the Migration Act extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered to be for the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a <b>Full</b> <b>Court</b> of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Fuller</b> <b>Court</b> {{refers to}} the Supreme Court of the United States from 1888 to 1910, when Melville Fuller served as the eighth Chief Justice of the United States.

During {{the era of the}} <b>Fuller</b> <b>Court,</b> the Judiciary Act of 1891 was passed, easing the burden of the Supreme Court by creating the United States courts of appeals.

5|$|The first {{shipment}} of coins, $130,000 in half dollars, arrived by ship on December 9, 1883. Hawaii {{was still in}} an economic recession. A number {{of members of the}} business community, including Sanford B. Dole, objected to the issue on the grounds that so much silver would inflate the currency, and went to court to prevent the government from giving Spreckels bonds in exchange for anything except gold coin, as the law required. The government opposed the action, which was brought in the islands' supreme court, {{on the grounds that the}} silver coins were equivalent to gold. The chief justice, A. F. Judd, granted a temporary writ of mandamus against the government giving the Dole plaintiffs what they wanted, finding that the coins were not equivalent to gold, and that the coinage and loan acts had been violated. On appeal to the <b>full</b> <b>court,</b> though, Judd was reversed, as the court found that Dole and his associates should have filed for an injunction. But when they did, the petition was denied. In the interim at a meeting chaired by the king, the privy council had declared the new coinage a legal tender; once the lawsuit was resolved, the government paid for a half million dollars in coins with a like amount of bonds.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the reasons}} that James W. Ely 2 ̆ 7 s recent book, The Chief Justiceship of Melville W.

In particular, the <b>Fuller</b> <b>Court</b> played active roles in protecting property rights and in fostering commerce, while the modern Court has largely abdicated its historical obligations in these regards.

40|$|The {{taxpayer}} granted {{an option}} to a prospective purchaser for the purchase by the latter of a property owned by the taxpayer. Under the option, the taxpayer received a security deposit from the prospective purchaser, subsequent to which the taxpayer entered into {{a contract with the}} prospective purchaser for the sale of the property. The purchase was not completed by the prospective purchaser, and the deposit was forfeited. The Commissioner assessed the taxpayer for GST payable on the forfeited deposit, but the taxpayer objected to the assessment, an objection which the Commissioner disallowed. The taxpayer then appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which disallowed the appeal. The taxpayer then appealed to the <b>Full</b> Federal <b>Court,</b> which unanimously allowed the appeal. This article argues that the <b>Full</b> Federal <b>Court’s</b> decision was wrong. It argues so on either of two grounds: the <b>Full</b> Federal <b>Court</b> erred on drawing the proper conclusion on applying the relevant legislative provisions to the facts; or it applied a method of statutory interpretation (under the purposive approach) which was not the best. The submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner to the <b>Full</b> Federal <b>Court</b> did not include the first of those two grounds. Those submissions did include the second, but not underpinned by the analysis articulated in this article. The Commissioner was granted special leave by the High Court to appeal the <b>Full</b> Federal <b>Court’s</b> decision. It was subsequently announced that he would appeal to the High Court.
