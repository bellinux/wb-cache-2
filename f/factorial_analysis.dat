In this paper, the authors studied the degradation of bromophenol blue through the electrochemical anodic oxidation by using the boron-doped BDD as the anode. The effect of statistically important operating parameters on treatment per-formance, such as treatment time, flow rate, applied current and concentration of supporting electrolyte, was evaluated by employing a <b>factorial</b> design <b>analysis</b> in terms of color removal and COD removal amount.

40|$|In a {{zebrafish}} recessive mutant young (yng), retinal {{cells are}} specified to distinct cell classes, but {{they fail to}} morphologically differentiate. A null mutation in a brahma-related gene 1 (brg 1) is responsible for this phenotype. To identify retina-specific Brg 1 -regulated genes that control cellular differentiation, we conducted a <b>factorial</b> microarray <b>analysis.</b> Gene expression profiles were compared from wild-type and yng retinas and stage-matched whole embryos at 36 and 52 hours postfertilization (hpf). From our analysis, three categories of genes were identified: (i) Brg 1 -regulated retinal differentiation genes (731 probesets), (ii) retina-specific genes independent of Brg 1 regulation (3, 038 probesets), and (iii) Brg 1 -regulated genes outside the retina (107 probesets). Biological significance was confirmed by further analysis of components of the Cdk 5 signaling pathway and Irx transcription factor family, representing genes identified in category 1.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the application of}} the <b>factorial</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> methodology in studying the influence of variations in stoichiometric, kinetic and operating parameters on the performance indices of an oxidation ditch simulation model (benchmark). <b>Factorial</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> investigates the sensitivities in a region rather than in a point. Hence, it has the advantage of giving more information about parameter interactions (non-linearity). Short-term results obtained have shown the following. The index AE is not significantly affected by variations in the value of parameters of the activated sludge model (ASM) No 1. The index TSP is greatly influence by heterotrophic yield (YH), heterotrophic decay (bH) and specific hydrolysis (kh) and the index EQ is dominated by YH, Monod coefficient (KS), bH, kh, anoxic condition correction factors (g, h), hydrolysis half-saturation coefficient (KX), autotrophs maximum specific growth rate (?A) and ammonia half-saturation coefficient (KNH).

L. aethiopica is geographically restricted to Ethiopia and Kenya; L. tropica is widely dispersed from the Eastern Mediterranean, through the Middle East into eastern India and in north, east and south Africa. Their phylogenetic inter-relationship is only partially revealed. Some studies indicate a close relationship. Here, eight strains of L. aethiopica were characterized genetically and compared with 156 strains of L. tropica {{from most of the}} latter species' geographical range to discern the closeness. Twelve unlinked microsatellite markers previously used to genotype strains of L. tropica were successfully applied to the eight strains of L. aethiopica and their microsatellite profiles were compared to those of 156 strains of L. tropica from various geographical locations that were isolated from human cases of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, hyraxes and sand fly vectors. All the microsatellite profiles were subjected to various analytical algorithms: Bayesian statistics, distance-based and <b>factorial</b> correspondence <b>analysis,</b> revealing: (i) the species L. aethiopica, though geographically restricted, is genetically very heterogeneous; (ii) the strains of L. aethiopica formed a distinct genetic cluster; and (iii) strains of L. aethiopica are closely related to strains of L. tropica and more so to the African ones, although, by <b>factorial</b> correspondence <b>analysis,</b> clearly separate from them. The successful application of the 12 microsatellite markers, originally considered species-specific for the species L. tropica, to strains of L. aethiopica confirmed the close relationship between these two species. The Bayesian and distance-based methods clustered the strains of L. aethiopica among African strains of L. tropica, while the <b>factorial</b> correspondence <b>analysis</b> indicated a clear separation between the two species. There was no correlation between microsatellite profiles of the eight strains of L. aethiopica and the type of leishmaniasis, localized (LCL) versus diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL), displayed by the human cases...|$|R
