Scouting is often dealt with in a humorous manner, as in the 1989 film Troop Beverly Hills, the 2005 film Down and Derby, and the film Scout Camp. In 1980, Scottish singer and songwriter Gerry Rafferty recorded I was a Boy Scout {{as part of his}} Snakes and Ladders album.|$|E

25|$|As a {{facet of}} culture {{throughout}} most of the 20th century, Scouting has been portrayed in numerous films and artwork. It is especially prevalent in the United States, where Scouting is tied closely to the ideal of Americana. The works of painters Norman Rockwell and Joseph Csatari and the 1966 film <b>Follow</b> <b>Me,</b> Boys! are prime examples of this idealized American ethos. One of the earliest depictions of Scouting in the entertainment media is a 1908 British silent film Scouts to the Rescue, shown in nickelodeons. Produced by Williamson Kinematograph, it depicted Boy Scouts tracking a gang of kidnappers through the woods to rescue an abducted baby.|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the episode, Liz and Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) are exchanging Yo Mamma Jokes.

500|$|... "Go Missin'" [...] has {{a running}} {{duration}} of three minutes and two seconds. It contains similar characteristics to [...] "Climax", {{in that it}} is a quiet storm R track, complimented by drum machine. It is built upon synthesizers, while incorporating bass. Usher utilizes his falsetto range throughout the song, shifting in arrangements. Billboard wrote that the song's lyrics follow Usher attempting to [...] "convince a stranded woman at a club to come home with him". The Huffington Post Kia Makarechi described [...] "Go Missin'" [...] as a [...] "standard track", and wrote that its lyrics contain [...] "serial killer-esque" [...] undertones in the line: Conscience telling you you shouldn't go, don't listen / I'mma take care of you for sure / <b>Follow</b> <b>me</b> right out that back door / Go missin.|$|E
500|$|The Boy Scouts of America {{are quite}} {{particular}} {{about how and}} when the Scout uniforms and insignia {{may be used in}} film and other portrayals; and for that reason, most films and television productions made in the US utilize [...] "ersatz" [...] Scouting organizations. Examples of this include the [...] "Order of the Straight Arrow", portrayed in the King of the Hill cartoon series, and the [...] "Indian Guides" [...] depicted in the 1995 Chevy Chase film, Man of the House. One exception to this policy is the Walt Disney movie <b>Follow</b> <b>Me,</b> Boys! with Fred McMurray portraying a Scoutmaster of a rural troop. [...] It was released to theaters in 1966 and re-released in 1976. Another is the final scene of The Sopranos television show, where Tony Soprano sits down to dinner in a restaurant. At another table, several Cub Scouts, in full uniform, are seated.|$|E
500|$|Adem Ali of Forté Magazine {{identified}} the song, along with Raja's subsequent releases, as exemplifying the singer's [...] "blend of club-kid neo-pop" [...] combining elements of pop, techno, and electro music.

The instrumental is provided by [...] "deep, throbbing beats" [...] and electronics. Rolling Stone's Lyndsey Parker described Raja's vocal performance as a [...] "whole lot of groaning", and Bustle's Anneliese Cooper classified it {{as an example of}} [...] "crazy shit shouted to a beat". In the chorus, Raja sings [...] "Follow me, <b>follow</b> <b>me,</b> I’m a diamond crowned queen. Come with me, to my pretty, pretty palace, Gonna lick on your trigger, every inch will make you quiver." [...] Other lyrics include other sexual references, such as: [...] "S-E-X, sex for dinner / I'm a thunder-breathing dragon cat." ...|$|E
5000|$|On [...] "The Queen Is Back", Summer {{discusses}} her musical {{legacy and}} public persona. [...] "I'm {{making fun of}} myself," [...] she said. [...] "There's irony, it's poking fun {{at the idea of}} being called a queen. That's a title that has <b>followed</b> <b>me,</b> <b>followed</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>followed</b> <b>me.</b> We were sitting and writing and that title kept popping up in my mind and I'm thinking, 'Am I supposed to write this? Is this too arrogant to write?' But people call me 'the queen,' so I guess it's ok to refer to myself as what everybody else refers to me as. We started writing the song and thought it was kind of cute and funny." ...|$|R
