40|$|This article {{sets out}} the {{overlapping}} {{political and cultural}} roots of an innovative <b>farming</b> <b>co-operative</b> in Andalusia, one composed of both ex-labourers and small farmers. One strand of values involves the realization of a food chain in which no capitalist enterprise can extract profit from their labours: this, together with various conceptions of personal and local autonomy, shapes much of their practice of organic farming. Nevertheless, their labour has to generate an acceptable livelihood through selling food in an environment dominated by large-scale commercial agriculture in both the `conventional' and `organic' sectors. The article explains how they achieve this by building ties with consumers around a variety of shared values. This focus on the particularities of a radical food movement sheds light on many larger issues, both the nature of markets and competition in the dominant economy, and the debates about organic certification and `conventionalization...|$|E
40|$|The CFCA (French Confederation of Farming Co-operatives) has {{developed}} since 1998 {{a number of}} works on co-operative social balance adapted to <b>farming</b> <b>co-operative</b> companies, following the reflection initiated by the CJDES. The co-operative social balance, an innovative self-assessment procedure performed by the co-operative, is both an instrument to support managers in decision-making and a process to strengthen dialogue between co-operatives, their partners, and external stakeholders. The co-operative social balance brings co-operatives into a voluntary process of advancement, since diagnosis is attained in a participatory way, due to {{the large number of}} indicators of co-operative actions used, and provides support in defining lines of improvement. After a first stage in which a reference system was built to cover all the spheres of action in a co-operative society, the CFCA is currently conducting an experiment in fifty co-operative companies to validate these tools and study their use in depth. The present paper contains a description of the experiment and the procedure.

40|$|The author {{tries to}} {{interpret}} the questions raised during recent discussions on Yugoslav agricultural co-operatives {{in the light of}} E. Kardelj’s theory on agricultural co-operatives. In the first section of his article the author sums up the principal views of that theory and states that the agricultural co-operative is not the aspired ultimate model of socialist development in rural communities. Therefore {{from the point of view}} of Kardelj’s theory the disappearance of the characteristics of the co-operative as an association of co-operating members, and the strengthening of its characteristics as an enterprise cannot be critically assessed. What is called the Yugoslav 2 ̆ 7 co-operative question 2 ̆ 7 can be treated exclusively as a question of the possibility of the development of group economic operation by private farmers on the principles of workers’ self-management. However, this type of enterprise need not necessarily be organized on the co-operative model. The author then discusses the various aspects of agricultural co-operatives as a factor of co-operation between self-managed socialist enterprises and a number of peasant households. He states that the system of socialist enterprises, in which workers’ self-management is developed, must not be identified with co-operative <b>farming.</b> <b>Co-operative</b> principles and the principles of workers’ self-management — despite a number of similarities — are not identical. This raises the problem of finding the laws of the transformation of agricultural co-operatives into the system of self-managed socialist enterprises. Bearing in mind this nature of the Yugoslav co-operative problem, the author takes a critical view of the concept which calls for a simple reconstruction of the classical agricultural co-operative while at the same time neglecting the problem of setting up this type of collective enterprise on the principle of workers 2 ̆ 7 self- -management. This problem cannot be solved by the classical type of co-operative, which thus cannot be regarded as a special form of socialist evolution which could develop without conflicting with the self-managing system of economic operation. Starting from this basic view, the author discusses the elements of the concept of agricultural co-operative according to which in the system of self- -managed socialist economic operation co-operatives may take over the functions of a socializing mechanism. The co-operative can become a kind of group enterprise of associated private farmers capable of a regular production of goods. It cannot avoid the processes of agro-industrial integration which turns in into a factor of the subordination of private agricultural producers to the great agro- -industrial integrational unit. In developing its character as a self-managing enterprise, the co-operative may become a factor of the real integration of private smallholders with the system of socialist economic operation. In fact, the problem which theory should deal with more thoroughly is how to ensure that group enterprises of associated private farmers evolve from the co-operative form to the self- -managing form of economic organization...|$|E

40|$|Selling to {{an agency}} Cue: Small-scale farmers {{wanting to take}} {{advantage}} of lucrative export markets, are likely to struggle if they work alone. Even if they are lucky enough to have contacts overseas, and are able to grow produce of the highest standard, there is still the problem of quantity. How can they ever grow enough to interest a foreign buyer? One solution is for farmers to sell their produce to a crop buying agency. Good agencies will not only buy the produce, but also support the farmers in growing it to the right standards. One such example is Agriflora, a company based in Zambia. Daniel Sikazwe spoke to Simon Maonde, Vice Chairperson of a <b>farming</b> <b>co-operative</b> that sells to Agriflora, and asked him about how the agency was helping the co-operative with its production and marketing. He also found out about how the co-operative is managing to sell vegetables to local buyers, in competition with imports from neighbouring countries. TAPE IN	?We formed the co-operative..... TAPE OUT	..... work hard to beat it. ? DURATION	 4 ? 06 ? Closing announcement:. Simon Maonde on his marketing strategy of attracting buyers to the farm, rather than taking produce to the buyer. Transcript Maonde	We formed the co-operative, we wanted to co-operate ourselves as a group, {{to make sure that our}} produce are put at one point where we can bargain for a better price. Then two years ago came in Agriflora scheme. So we then touched, and Agriflora has become the biggest, not only buyer but organiser of our co-operative. Sikazwe	Agriflora is a big company which exports small-scale producers? produce to other countries, but I am very sure that they will not accept just any crop that comes there. There is a standard that they are going to follow. How do you make sure that you grow the kind of crops that will meet their standard?. Maonde	Yes, you are right. Agriflora is very very strict in the way the crop is grown. The seed has to be provided by Agriflora themselves to prove that it is the right seed. Second, the time when you are growing we have an extension officer from MAFF and an agronomist from Agriflora itself, to see that the produce are the right type and don?t have any diseases or anything else. At the time of harvesting the Agriflora makes sure that they come to your farm, and they show me the type that we have to harvest, and which is not required called reject. Sikazwe	So in this case if Agriflora is going to accept your produce, it has to be of very high standard or quality. Tell me about the secret that it involved in you producing products that are of very high quality. Maonde	The secret first is the planting of it; you make sure that is planted according to the specification or spacing, as we call it. And secondly is to scout, as it grows you scout whether diseases or insects that attack it. Now if there are any you immediately go to Agriflora who send a person to scout and when they prove that one then they spray it. So if it is sprayed and well looked after the crop will be good. The last one is that there is a special standard the worldwide requires. If you have Mange Tout or Fine Beans which are bent, or it has a seed inside which is grown up, it is rejected. So you must make sure that you harvest the exact requirement. Sikazwe	Let?s now talk about some of the products that you take on to the local market. You have tomatoes, you have peas and many other crops. There is liberalisation in place. We have seen a lot of products coming from Zimbabwe and South Africa and other countries. You might find yourself disadvantaged because these are coming from places or countries where there are subsidies on agriculture. Just how do you manage to get your crops on the market? Maonde	That one you are right, it has been very difficult. But the only way we have done it, is because the South Africans and the Zimbabweans, they normally dump it at either supermarkets, or the bigger market which is Soweto. And the small businesswomen and men who need these things sometimes have no transport to get to the region. So in that way we decide to deliver our things in the townships. So in that way we beat them by going to the townships, or by making arrangements with the marketers themselves, coming to our farms to the co-operative. When they see the grade and not only that but the price; because if for example the box of tomato in Soweto market is at 20, 000, if he came to our co-operative and we sold it at 15, 000, so he is happier because, one, he has saved his 5000, plus even transport for himself or herself, plus the baggage he is carrying. As I said, the liberalisation of market, you really need to work hard to beat it. End of track. Selling to a crop buying agency is another marketing strategy that small-scale farmers may chose to adopt. This interview features a Zambian co-operative that sells its export vegetables (Mange Tout, Fine Beans, Babycorn) to an agency, for which it has to fulfil very strict production standards. It also sells vegetables (tomatoes, carrots, onions), to local buyers, competing with cheap imports by inviting buyers to the farm...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the study of the {{development}} of <b>co-operative</b> <b>farming</b> in Saskatchewan from 1944 to 1960. Farmers attempted <b>co-operative</b> <b>farming</b> for a variety of reasons: costs of mechanization, technology, economic conditions, or the need to become established in farming. The motives differed among the participants, however, they all sought an alternative to traditional farming methods, and were eager to attempt a new method that would have them consolidate their land, labor, capital, and in most cases, their homes. Most co-operative farmers not only worked together they also lived together on one farm site. This thesis is an analysis of the experiences of <b>co-operative</b> <b>farms</b> and there members. The election in Saskatchewan of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in 1944 aided {{in the development of the}} program. The CCF government actively encouraged and promoted the organization of <b>co-operative</b> <b>farms,</b> at first as a measure to rehabilitate returning veterans on the land, but also as an option for existing farmers as a solution to some of the practical problems they were facing. Acting as a consolidating body for organizations and individuals interested in <b>co-operative</b> <b>farming,</b> the government provided land, monetary assistance, and education for many of the farms. However, it was soon realized that the agricultural system was not set up or maintained in the interests of cooperative farms. Rather, the existing system was designed to accommodate only individual family <b>farms.</b> <b>Co-operative</b> <b>farms</b> had difficulty fitting in to the established agricultural system. They faced many legal roadblocks that impeded their development and forced many to dissolve. In addition to the legal difficulties, there was also the social perception of what a farmer was supposed to be, an individual. Many members of <b>co-operative</b> <b>farms</b> could not overcome that perception and work within a group on a democratic basis. The farms that were able to work through the many difficulties they faced, demonstrated that <b>co-operative</b> <b>farming</b> could work successfully even in an environment that was dominated by the family <b>farm.</b> Though most <b>co-operative</b> <b>farms</b> lasted only a few years, their experience suggests that co-op farming could be economically and socially viable given the appropriate political, economic, and social conditions- and could succeed under unfavorable conditions if the members were sufficiently committed...|$|R
