25|$|The first {{proposals}} for a tramway to Singsaker was {{launched by the}} management of Trondhjems Elektricitetsværk og Sporvei in 1924. They proposed a route from the existing Elgeseter Line at Elgeseter Bridge via Singsaker and Rosenborg to Buran. It would have been built it in several stages, with the first terminus at Tyholtveien. The whole line was estimated to cost 1.175 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The board instead chose {{to wait in the}} hopes that the price would be reduced. A new proposal in 1926 saw a change in the plans. Instead of following Høyskolealléen, Klæbuveien and Christian Fredriks gate, the line was chosen to <b>just</b> <b>follow</b> Klostergata and Eidsvolls gate. A bus route was also considered, but it would cost NOK96,000 more per year to operate than a tramway, thus making the whole project unprofitable. A trolleybus was also considered, but at the time there was no technical way to combine the overhead wires from both trams and trolleybuses on the same road.|$|E
25|$|A {{positive}} correlation between minorities and a socio economic status of being low income in industrialized and rural regions of the U.S. depict how low income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in health. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low income minorities, to be conscious about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that minorities in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets. Therefore, in areas where supermarkets are less accessible (food deserts) to impoverished areas, the more likely these groups are to purchase inexpensive fast food or <b>just</b> <b>follow</b> an unhealthy diet. As a result, because food deserts are more prevalent in low income communities, minorities that reside in these areas are more prone obesity, {{which can lead to}} diseases such as chronic kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.|$|E

25|$|The sunni {{scholar and}} sufi mystic Ibn Arabi stated the angels {{are the first}} beings created and {{distinguished}} between angels of the corporeal and the incorporeal world, called Al-Ama (the cloud), there all of the creation will be created. In this place, angelic beings dwelled {{in the presence of}} God, but are unable to recognize each other or even themselves, until God elected one of them, to become the Higher Pen writing, everything God will create in the cosmos. The angels in the corporeal world are more akin to the humans than in the majority Islamic view. Accordingly, angels are spirits blown into light, while humans are spirits blown into shape, and jinn spirits blown into wind (wind is referring to the hot air, discharged from the flame called marijin min nar, from which the jinn are created according to the Quran). Humans are even superior to the angels, because angels can <b>just</b> <b>follow</b> straight lines, therefore they can function as forces of nature and perform specific tasks but are unable to know Gods names, attributes or to perceive God in different ways like humans can do. Angels hesitated to bow before Adam, because they were unable to see the true nature of human. Some angels erred in believing their way of perceiving God is the only way, and they become guilty of opposing Adam as a vice regent and fixing on one interpretation of God to the exclusion of others.|$|E

He asserts that he never tested songs on audiences before recording them, but [...] "What'd I Say" [...] is an exception. Charles himself does not recall where the concert took place, but Mike Evans in Ray Charles: The Birth of Soul places the show in Brownsville, Pennsylvania. Shows were played at [...] "meal dances" [...] which typically ran four hours with a half-hour break, and would end around 1 or 2 in the morning.

[...] But at the same time, they tend to <b>just</b> <b>follow</b> him. [...] We do put them in Yadi's hands." [...] Molina reads opposing hitters and will move fielders with subtle signs and gestures to align them with his pitch calling. [...] La Russa commented that [...] "it's not just instinct. [...] It's sense, based on how a hitter's standing, how he responds to the pitch or two before, and he's very creative in how he makes his adjustment based on what he sees with the hitter and knowing what his pitcher can do." ...|$|E
