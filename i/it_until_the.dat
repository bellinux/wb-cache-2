5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned the theme of the crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|An {{internal}} {{attempt was}} made to discredit Gomułka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and he tolerated <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> societal damage wrecked by the Moczar movement had become irreversible. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by Leonid Brezhnev, was preoccupied with the crisis in Czechoslovakia and not inclined to support personal changes in the Polish leadership.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 14th century, a {{house by the}} name of Capell's Court stood on the site of Linton Park. It took its name from a family of local landowners named de Capell who held the {{property}} from the late 14th century to the mid-15th century. It was then sold to the Baysden family who held <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> late 16th century, when it was sold to Sir Anthony Mayney. Mayney's grandson sold the estate to the judge Sir Francis Wythen. Wythen's daughter, Catherine, inherited the estate and, following her second marriage to Brigadier-General Sir George Jocelyn, the estate was sold to London merchant Sir Robert Mann.|$|E
5|$|In 1528, Margaret Tudor, now Regent of Scotland for {{her infant}} son James V, married Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven, a {{descendant}} of Albany. His brother, Sir James Stewart (c.1513–1554), was made Captain of Doune Castle, and Sir James' son, also James (c.1529–1590), was created Lord Doune in 1570. Lord Doune's son, another James (c.1565–1592), married Elizabeth Stuart, 2nd Countess of Moray around 1580, becoming Earl of Moray himself. The castle thus came to be the seat of its keepers, the Earls of Moray, who owned <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 20th century.|$|E

5|$|On 4 January, several incidents, {{including}} a couple exchanges of gunfire, {{suggested that the}} embassy's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Somalis until the USS Guam and USS Trenton arrived with their helicopters and soldiers, at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January. The embassy had just six Marine guards, whose job was limited to protecting the chancery. Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> ships arrived. The request was denied, but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning.|$|E

5|$|Reynolds did {{not believe}} there was time to make changes because, {{if there were any}} delays in publication, the {{newspaper}} would not be published {{before the end of the}} school year. After consulting with his supervisors, he opted to publish a four-page newspaper instead of a six-page one, omitting the pages containing the two stories in question. Cutting two pages removed a total of seven articles from the paper. Reynolds did not tell the students about the decision, and they did not find out about <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> paper was delivered to the school.|$|E

The Wau–Salamaua campaign cost the 6th Division 240 killed and 520 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The Ineligibility Clause has {{interfered}} with appointments {{as far back}} as 1793. President George Washington attempted to appoint William Paterson to the Supreme Court on February 27, 1793, after the resignation of Associate Justice Thomas Johnson. However, Paterson, who was serving as Governor of New Jersey, had previously been elected to serve a Senate term that would expire at noon on March 4, 1793.

5|$|The castle {{deteriorated}} {{during this}} period. The masonry {{of the castle}} had probably been stripped for use as local building materials, as this part of England was traditionally very short of suitable stone. Edward VI gave the castle to Sir John Checke, until it reverted to Mary I. After Mary, the castle was acquired by Sir Gervase Elwes, whose family retained <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. At some point after 1720, the surviving east and south sides of the inner bailey walls were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} David C. Large wrote that, {{like any}} public pronouncements, these bylaws {{did not tell}} the full story about HIAG's real goals. By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice, he was able to tease out what the organisation stood for. For example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, surviving and fallen, as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|While at peak intensity, Ernest {{was a small}} cyclone with gales {{extending}} 130km (80mi) {{outward from}} the well-defined eye. After maintaining peak winds for about 12hours, the cyclone began weakening while turning to the southeast. On January23, Ernest made landfall on the southwest coast of Madagascar at Itampolo, with winds estimated at 130km/h (80mph). The cyclone accelerated to the southeast across the island and quickly weakened into a tropical storm. Late on January23, the JTWC issued its last advisory after Ernest began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Early the next day, MF declared Ernest extratropical, and continued tracking <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> storm dissipated on January25 in the southern Indian Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The genre was {{dominated}} by European clergymen <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 12th century, and <b>it</b> wasn't <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 13th century that debate poetry began to flourish {{in many of the}} vernacular literatures of Europe, which <b>it</b> did <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 16th century. As the Middle Ages waned, so did the literary form of debate poetry. A small number of debate poems of questionable importance were produced during the Renaissance, and thus the debate poem is primarily a medieval phenomenon.|$|R

5|$|Although it was {{the second}} Champions League season to feature clubs that had not won their {{national}} leagues the year before, Manchester United and Bayern Munich were the first such clubs to reach the final of the competition. Nevertheless, both went into the match as champions, having won their domestic leagues in 1998–99; Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title with a 1–1 draw against Hertha BSC on 9 May with three games to go, while Manchester United left <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> last day of the season (16 May), when they came back from 1–0 down against Tottenham Hotspur to win 2–1 and beat Arsenal to the title by a point. Both teams were also playing for the Treble; in addition to their league win, Manchester United had beaten Newcastle United in the 1999 FA Cup Final on 22 May to claim the Double, while Bayern were due to play Werder Bremen in the 1999 DFB-Pokal Final on 12 June.|$|E
5|$|Although the tree-ring {{analysis}} of the Philadelphia painting firmly places it in van Eyck's workshop, the technical evidence fails to prove indisputably whether van Eyck or a workshop member painted <b>it.</b> <b>Until</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s {{it was thought that}} the Philadelphia panel was the original and the Turin panel a copy, but x-ray analysis revealed a highly developed and sophisticated design underneath the paint that is accepted as by Jan van Eyck's hand. Infrared reflectography further disclosed extensive underdrawings beneath the original paint; the artist even made alterations to the composition after laying down the underdrawings and completing the painting. The underdrawings are typical of van Eyck's work and similar to those found in the Ghent Altarpiece, thereby, according to Luber, tying the Turin version to van Eyck.|$|E

Tureen and Jankelalong with Donald Perkins, a lawyer for the paper and timber companiesnegotiated a solution whereby $30 million of the settlement funds would come from various programs in the federal budget. That settlement was presented to the Maine congressional delegation in August 1979, but they refusal to endorse <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Maine legislature had approved it.
