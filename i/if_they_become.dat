5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>become</b> pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.|$|E

50|$|The book {{argues that}} the pattern is sharply evident in for example 300 years of Ancient Greek history, the Swiss Cantons since the 14th century, in the County of Flanders during the 14th century, in the {{three and a half}} centuries of the Hanseatic League, and in Renaissance Italy. These periods {{included}} numerous societies that frequently changed regime type. The societies abruptly stopped fighting other oligarchies <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> an oligarchy and abruptly stopped fighting other democracies <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> a democracy. This pattern immediately reversed if the regime type changed again.|$|R
25|$|Alert warning - People {{without a}} working spleen {{can carry a}} card, or wear a special {{bracelet}} or necklet which says {{that they do not}} have a working spleen.

25|$|The {{varicella}} vaccine is recommended in many countries. Some countries require the varicella vaccination or an exemption before entering elementary school. A second dose is recommended {{five years after}} the initial immunization. A vaccinated person is likely to have a milder case of chickenpox <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>become</b> infected. Immunization within three days following household contact reduces infection rates and severity in children.|$|E
25|$|Police {{dogs are}} retired <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>become</b> injured {{to an extent}} where they will not recover completely, pregnant, or raising puppies, or are too old or sick to {{continue}} working. Since many dogs are raised in working environments {{for the first year}} of their life and retired before they become unable to perform, the working life of a K9 is 6–9 years.|$|E

25|$|The electoral {{participation}} of Dominicans in the United States may improve {{as a result}} of the 1994 approval of dual citizenship by the Dominican legislature, which makes it easier for migrants to become U.S. citizens without relinquishing their Dominican nationality. A 1997 Dominican law, which took effect in 2004, allows Dominicans living abroad to retain their Dominican citizenship and voting rights even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>become</b> citizens of another country.|$|E
25|$|The idea of reincarnation is {{accepted}} {{by a few}} Muslim sects, particularly of the Ghulat, and by other sects in the Muslim world. Alawis belonging to Shia denomination of Islam hold that they were originally stars or divine lights that were cast out of heaven through disobedience and must undergo repeated reincarnation (or metempsychosis) before returning to heaven.

25|$|Dutch {{subjects}} {{are not allowed}} to renounce their nationality <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>become</b> stateless so this renunciation has to occur while they have dual nationality, which is illegal in Japan and South Korea. Therefore, acquiring Japanese or South Korean nationality cannot be done by exempted Dutch subjects without breaking the laws of such countries. Each sovereign state decides for itself who are its citizens, and other states {{are not allowed to}} intercede on behalf of individuals in such internal affairs.|$|E

25|$|When closed, a well-maintained bin is odorless; when opened, {{it should}} have little smell if any smell is present, it is earthy. Worms require gaseous oxygen. Oxygen can be {{provided}} by airholes in the bin, occasional stirring of bin contents, and removal of some bin contents <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>become</b> too deep or too wet. If decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin, or the layers of food waste have become too deep, the bin will begin to smell of ammonia.|$|E

25|$|Dominant {{native plants}} {{are capable of}} {{inhibition}} of EcM fungi on the roots of neighboring plants through the release of chemical compounds or through competitive interactions. Some invasive plants are capable of inhibiting the growth of native ectomycorrhizal fungi through similar mechanisms, especially <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>become</b> established and dominant. Invasive garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata, and its allelochemical benzyl isothiocyanate were shown to inhibit the growth of three species of EcM fungi grown on white pine (Pinus strobus) seedlings. Changes in EcM communities can have drastic effects on nutrient uptake and community composition of native trees, which can in turn have far-reaching ecological ramifications.|$|E
25|$|H. pylori can infect {{the stomach}} {{of some people}} without causing stomach ulcers. In {{investigating}} asymptomatic carriers of H. pylori, researchers identified a genetic trait called Interleuik-1 beta-31 which causes increased production of stomach acid, resulting in ulcers if patients become infected with H. pylori. Patients without the trait do not develop stomach ulcers in response to H. pylori infection, but instead have increased risk from stomach cancer <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>become</b> infected. Investigation into other gastrointestinal infections has also shown that the symptoms {{are the result of}} interaction between the infection and specific genetic mutations in the host.|$|E

25|$|About 100million {{bacteria}} must typically be ingested {{to cause}} cholera {{in a normal}} healthy adult. This dose, however, is less in those with lowered gastric acidity (for instance those using proton pump inhibitors). Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having {{the highest rates of}} infection. Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type, with those with type O blood being the most susceptible. Persons with lowered immunity, such as persons with AIDS or children who are malnourished, are more likely to experience a severe case <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>become</b> infected. Any individual, even a healthy adult in middle age, can experience a severe case, and each person's case should be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional health care provider.|$|E
25|$|Ixodes ricinus has a three-host lifecycle, {{which usually}} takes 2–3 years to complete, {{although}} it can take from 1 to 6 years in extreme cases. Adults feed on large mammals such as sheep, cattle, dogs, deer, humans, and horses for 6–13 days, before dropping off. An engorged female lays several thousand eggs and subsequently dies. The larvae that hatch do not actively seek a host, and usually feed on insectivores (orders Erinaceomorpha and Soricomorpha), although they may also find rodents, rabbits, birds, reptiles, or bats. They feed for 3–5 days before dropping off and moulting. The resulting nymphs then ascend grasses or twigs to seek their next host, but must return to the moist microclimate at the soil surface <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>become</b> dehydrated. The nymphs feed on small to medium-sized mammals.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{reproductive}} units, the females {{tend to be}} closely related and have strong social bonds. Reproductive units split <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>become</b> too large. While females have strong social bonds in the group, a female will only interact with at most three other members of her unit. Grooming and other social interactions among females usually occur between pairs. Females in a reproductive unit exist in a hierarchy, with higher-ranking females having more reproductive success and more offspring than lower-ranking females. Closely related females {{tend to have a}} similar hierarchical status. Females generally stay in their natal units for life; cases of females leaving are rare. Aggression within a reproduction unit, which is rare, is usually just between the females. Aggression is more frequent between members of different reproductive units and is usually started by females, but males and females from both sides will join and engage if the conflict escalates.|$|E
