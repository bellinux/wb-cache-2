40|$|Persons with {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis (PALS) {{suffer from}} a degenerative motor neuron disease that severely affects their speech. Speech therapy helps them compensate or use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) for communication purposes, however their natural speech may still be unintelligible. Studies have indicated the acoustic changes in PALS 2 ̆ 7 speech that affect the perception of their speech. One primary acoustic cue for vowel perception distorted in PALS is <b>formant</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The present study tested the potential of digitally manipulating (changing) vowel <b>formant</b> <b>frequencies</b> in PALS to an average male 2 ̆ 7 s values. The goal was to manipulate the <b>formant</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{in order to enhance}} perception and thereby intelligibility. Five male speakers with ALS recorded a wordlist of 70 words. For each word, the researcher identified the vowel location, and the word was imported into the computer program Praat (Boersma 2 ̆ 6 Weenink, 2001). A Praat programming script conducted linear predictive coding (LPC) analysis to separate the source and filter characteristics of the word. Using the identified filter characteristics, the values of the first three <b>formant</b> <b>frequencies</b> for each vowel were removed and replaced by the <b>formant</b> <b>frequencies</b> of that vowel for an average male. Each word was then resynthesized by combining the source and manipulated filter.

40|$|Abstract. An {{experiment}} {{has been}} performed where various two-formant models {{reported in the}} literature were assessed as to their ability to predict the <b>formant</b> <b>frequencies</b> obtained in a vowel identification task. An alternative model is proposed in which the auditory processing of vowel sounds is assumed to take place in two stages: a peripheral processing stage and a central processing stage. In the peripheral stage the speech spectrum is transformed to its auditory equivalent and the <b>formant</b> <b>frequencies</b> are extracted from this spectrum using a peak-picking mechanism. The central stage performs a two-formant approximation on the results of the first stage operation, and it is this formant pair that vowel identification is taken to operate on during vowel perception. The first and second <b>formant</b> <b>frequencies</b> of this two-formant model are taken to be equal to the first and second <b>formant</b> <b>frequencies</b> extracted at the first stage plus a perturbation term which accounts for the interaction effects of the neighbouring formants. The perturbation caused by each of these neighbouring formants is inversely proportional to its separation from the main formants. This model compares favourably with previous models in its prediction of the <b>formant</b> <b>frequencies</b> obtained from the vowel identification task. Zusammenfassung.
