50|$|Compounds in this {{generation}} were more potent, more stable and had longer durations of action. One of these, CGP2928, a peptidomimetic compound, {{was the first}} renin inhibitor proven effective when taken orally. Tested on marmosets, it was only active at high doses. Development of new drugs in the second generation continued to improve pharmacokinetic properties. Remikiren, <b>enalkiren</b> and zankiren were then discovered. These were peptidomimetic inhibitors with improved structures that made them more specific, potent and stable. Unfortunately, clinical development was terminated because the drugs had poor oral bioavailability (poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized) and lowering blood pressure activity still remained low.|$|E
50|$|Pepstatin, {{which was}} {{described}} in 1972, was the first synthetic renin inhibitor, but poor pharmacokinetic properties prevented it from entering in vivo investigations. The first generation of renin inhibitors, such as H-142, were peptide analogues of angiotensinogen. However, these inhibitors had also limited drug-like properties. Hopes of breakthrough appeared in 1982 when development of the second generation renin inhibitors began. This generation consisted of peptide-like compounds, such as remikiren, <b>enalkiren</b> and zanikiren. They had more drug-like rather than substrate-like properties, and in 1990 they went to clinical trials. The second generation had its limitations and never completed clinical trials.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{sustained}} renin inhibition by repeated administration of <b>enalkiren</b> (A- 64662), the novel dipeptide renin inhibitor, were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 32 inpatients (eight per group) with essential hypertension who were maintained {{on a diet}} containing 60 meq/day sodium. Three different dosage regimens of <b>enalkiren</b> were studied: 1) 1. 2 mg/kg quotid., 2) 03 mg/kg q. i. d., and 3) 0. 1 mg/kg q. i. d. Each patient received an intravenous infusion every 6 hours for 1 week. Placebo infusions were used to mimic the 4 times/day dosing schedule. Blood pressure was measured periodically via 24 -hour automated monitoring equipment. Mean plasma renin activity in the patient groups ranged from 1. 58 to 2. 68 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr. Plasma renin activity was promptly suppressed in all groups receiving <b>enalkiren.</b> Prolonged duration of plasma renin activity suppression (^ 24 hours) was demonstrated after the administration of 1. 2 mg/kg <b>enalkiren.</b> The 0 3 mg/kg q. i. d. and 1. 2 mg/kg quotid. regimens produced statistically significant reductions (p<, 0. 05) in systolic and diastolic blood pressures with clear evidence of persistent antihypertensive activity for 12 hours or more {{when compared with the}} placebo group. Despite relatively large reductions in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean pulse rates were essentially unchanged...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to compare the effects of three potent {{reference}} renin inhibitors (remikiren, CGP 38560 A, and <b>enalkiren)</b> in sodium-depleted normotensive squirrel monkeys. In these monkeys, arterial pressure was measured in the conscious state with a telemetry system. Oral and intravenous maximal effective doses of the three renin inhibitors were compared in parallel groups of monkeys. In additional experiments, remikiren was given on top of either CGP 38560 A or <b>enalkiren</b> in the same animals. Finally, the three drugs were compared with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril. The effects of the three drugs on the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system (plasma renin activity, immunoreactive renin, and immunoreactive angiotensin II concentrations) were also measured. Our results show that remikiren was as effective as cilazapril and markedly more effective than CGP 38560 A or <b>enalkiren</b> in reducing arterial pressure in our monkey model. Interestingly, these differences in arterial pressure could not be explained by differences of in vitro potency or different biochemical changes of the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system, because the inhibitors all reduced immunoreactive angiotensin II to similarly low levels. One possible explanation is that, in our model, remikiren in contrast to CGP 38560 A and <b>enalkiren</b> is able to inhibit renin in a functionally important extraplasmatic compartment.

40|$|Standard {{treatments}} {{available today}} for treating hypertension is diuretics, β-blockers, {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} inhibitors (ACEs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, a-blockers, vasodilators, and centrally acting drugs. It is difficult to achieve the optimized renin angiotensin aldosterone system suppression with currently available antihypertensive agents, because ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics all activate the compensatory feedback mechanism that increases renin release and increase plasma renin activity. The first orally active direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) were developed in 1980 s, including <b>enalkiren,</b> remikiren, and zankiren. However, poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, less bioavailability (< 2 %), short half life, and low potency hindered {{the development of these}} compounds. Aliskiren is the first DRI for the treatment of hypertension. Aliskiren is designed through a combination of molecular modeling techniques and crystal structure elucidation. Aliskiren effectively reduces the blood pressure as a mono therapy as well in combination therapy...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of drugs}} that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system {{is one of the}} {{effective}} way to intervene in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disorders, especially in hypertension treatment. The idea of blocking the renin system at its origin by renin inhibitor has existed for more than 30 years. Renin inhibitor supresses the covension of angiotensinogen into angiotensin, and further deacreases the generation of the active peptide angiotensin II. The first generation (<b>enalkiren)</b> and second generation (remikiren) of orally active renin inhibitors were never used clinically because of low bioavailability and weak blood pressure-lowering activity. At present, aliskiren is the first non-peptide orally active renin inhibitor of the third generation to progress to phase III clinical trials and was approved by U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2007. Aliskiren becomes the first renin inhibitor with indications for the treatment of hypertension in Indonesia, a compounds with improved oral bioavailability, specificity and efficacy. This review summarises the development of oral renin inhibitors, pharmacological aspects, with a focus on aliskiren.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the renin {{inhibitor}} <b>enalkiren</b> (Abbott- 64662) was evaluated in eight normal volunteer subjects on a standardized sodium diet (100 mmol/day) by measurement of various components of the renin-angiotensin system and drug levels in plasma. On day 1, vehicle and doses of 0. 001, 0. 003, and 0. 01 mg/kg i. v. were administered within 2 minutes at 90 -minute intervals. On day 2, vehicle and doses of 0. 01, 0. 03, and 0. 1 mg/kg i. v. were given. With the higher doses, blood pressure tended to decrease slightly with no change in heart rate. Plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin-(l- 8) octapeptide (angiotensin II) fell markedly in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of plasma renin activity was maximal 5 minutes after administration of the drug and persisted 90 minutes after the doses of 0. 03 and 0. 1 mg/kg. Not surprisingly, there was a close correlation between plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II levels (r= 0. 81, n= 28, p< 0. 001). In contrast, active and total renin measured directly by monoclonal antibodies rose in dose-related fashion in response to renin inhibition. Pharmaco-kinetic parameters were calculated using the plasma drug concentrations obtained up to 6 hours after the 0. 1 mg/kg dose. By means of a two-compartment model, plasma mean half-life of the drug was estimated at 1. 60 ± 0. 43 hours. (Hypertension 1989; 13 : 941 - 947...|$|E
