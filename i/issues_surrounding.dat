5|$|Several Arabians, {{mostly of}} Polish breeding, were {{captured}} from Nazi Germany and imported to the U.S.A. following World War II. In 1957, two deaths in England {{led to more}} sales to the United States: first from Crabbet Stud on the demise of Lady Wentworth, and then from Hanstead {{with the passing of}} Gladys Yule. As the tensions of the Cold War eased, more Arabians were imported to America from Poland and Egypt, and in the late 1970s, as political <b>issues</b> <b>surrounding</b> import regulations and the recognition of stud books were resolved, many Arabian horses were imported from Spain and Russia.|$|E

5|$|Thomas {{composed}} the epitaph placed on William the Conqueror's tomb in St. Etienne in Caen, but the chronicler Orderic Vitalis felt that Thomas was chosen more for his rank than for his skill in composition. Thomas did not concern {{himself with the}} church–state <b>issues</b> <b>surrounding</b> the Investiture Crisis, but he was tenacious in defending the independence of York against the efforts of Canterbury to assert primacy over the whole of England.

5|$|Cariappa's {{alliance}} with the Indian Army was spread {{over a period of}} around three decades, during which he had broad experience of staff and command work. After his retirement in 1953, he served as the Indian high commissioner to Australia and New Zealand until 1956. With a view toward ex-servicemen's welfare, Cariappa founded the Indian Ex-Servicemen's League (IESL) in 1964. He was also instrumental in setting up the Directorate of Resettlement (later Directorate General Resettlement), an inter-service organisation under the Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare, Ministry of Defence, that looked after the various <b>issues</b> <b>surrounding</b> the resettlement of retired soldiers, especially those who retired young.|$|E
5|$|Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's {{government}} of doing little {{to stem the}} HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive. Mandela later {{admitted that he had}} personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing <b>issues</b> <b>surrounding</b> sex in South Africa, and that he had instead left the issue for Mbeki to deal with. Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa had one of the world's highest crime rates, and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade. Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed {{to deal with the problem}} of corruption.|$|E

5|$|<b>Issues</b> <b>surrounding</b> the {{planning}} and construction of L'Enfant Plaza (immediately {{to the west of}} the site) delayed construction of any buildings on the block until the late 1960s. In 1963, the RLA purchased the land from the Westminster Memorial Church, Fifth Baptist Church, and homeowners. The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters, but the RLA declined to sell the property. (The federal government does not pay taxes on land and structures it owns, and the RLA wanted a private owner who would add to the tax base.) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29, 1965, but there were no buyers.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September, the {{surviving}} relatives of each decedent received 2 million Russian rubles (about US$40,000) {{for each person}} {{who died in the}} accident. Ukrainian relatives stated to Norwegian media that they had not received information about the cause and other <b>issues</b> <b>surrounding</b> the accident. At the time, Ukraine was experiencing very high unemployment, and Arktikugol offered wages many times what was then offered in mainland Ukraine. Many miners not only had to support their immediate family, but also relatives. Vnukovo Airlines stated on Ukrainian television that the relatives would receive US$20,000 per deceased person. About a year after the accident, all relatives had been offered US$20,000, but about two-thirds of them chose not to accept the amount, and instead started a process to sue the insurance company. Their lawyer, Gunnar Nerdrum, stated that according to both Norwegian and Russian law, they could demand at least US$140,000.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal <b>issues</b> <b>surrounding</b> when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E

5|$|As of 2012, {{progress}} on the project has been stalled by disagreements between the Wolkoffs {{and the town of}} Islip over the amount the Wolkoffs will spend for the transportation piece of the project, and between the family and labor unions over wages and health care. The town of Islip has stated that the Wolkoffs agreed to spend $75million (2011USD) for the infrastructure improvements; however, the family stated in a September 2011 letter that they would only commit to $27million (2011USD) and that they never agreed to the original figure. Gerald Wolkoff thought that the discrepancy stemmed from his belief that transportation should be funded by the government, not from private sources, as his project would generate tax revenue for the government. Despite the <b>issues</b> <b>surrounding</b> the project, the Heartland project received $2.5million from the State of New York for roadway improvements in December 2011. The funding was part of a $101million (2011USD) package given to Long Island for various economic improvements.|$|E
5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as {{thousands of people were}} trapped in the hospital without power. The triage system put into effect deprioritized critically ill patients for evacuation, and a number of these patients were euthanized by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical <b>issues</b> <b>surrounding</b> euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Moser {{enrolled}} at the University of Innsbruck, taking classes in botany, zoology, geology, physics and chemistry. At this time, Austria was {{under the control of}} Nazi Germany and did not exist as an independent state. Moser became an authorised mushroom controller and instructor, and it was officially requested that he attend mycological seminars around Germany and Austria. At these seminars, he met a number of prominent mycologists, including Ernst Thirring. Thirring showed Moser some of the <b>issues</b> <b>surrounding</b> the large genus Cortinarius, which remained an interest {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1943, aged 19 and after only three terms at Innsbruck, his studies were interrupted so he could perform military service. Having shown earlier promise in languages, he was trained as an interpreter, then sent to the Balkan Peninsula. He continued to show an active interest in mycology, collecting and identifying mushrooms and reading Rolf Singer's Das System der Agaricales.|$|E
