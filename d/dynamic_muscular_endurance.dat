40|$|Purpose. It was {{the aim of}} {{the present}} paper to {{describe}} the nutritional intake, the physical performance capacity and certain anthropometric variables of a group of schoolchildren (n= 297) from 7 to 12 years of age. The findings on this population may be used to give advise in specific marketing situations. Design. The subjects were asked to complete a three day food diary. During a school visit body weight, stature and skinfold thicknesses were measured. Fitness assessment was assessed using items of the Eurofit testbattery. Data analysis was carried out as a function of sex and age groups. Findings. Seventy seven percent of all subjects had a caloric intake below the RDA while 23 % had an intake above the RDA. Macronutrient distribution showed for all groups a low carbohydrate intake, a high fat intake, whilst protein intake was just near the upper limit of the RDA. Flexibility, explosive leg strength, abdominal <b>dynamic</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> and cardiovascular endurance was significantly lower when comparing our data with data of the 1990 ’s. Significant correlations were found between the BMI values and the sum of skinfolds. Value. We demonstrated that at very young age, nutritional and physical activity habits in our self-selected population were rather poor...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the cardiorespiratory adaptations to an eight-week circuit weight training program are better measured with a biokinetic swim-bench test versus a standard treadmill test. The working hypothesis of the study was that since standard circuit weight training programs stress the upper body considerably more than the lower body, then the physiological adaptations to the program would be more evident in an upper body test of cardiorespiratory responses than a lower body of the same capacity. Twelve college-aged subjects participated in an eight-week circuit weight training program. Prior to the program, each subject was tested for cardiorespiratory responses by both a treadmill test and a biokinetic swim bench test. At the conclusion of the circuit weight training program, the subjects were re-tested to assess the physiological adaptations that had occurred over the course of the program. The test re-test reliability for the swim bench protocol developed for use in this study was r =. 85. Results of the post-test showed no significant changes in maximum oxygen uptake, heart rate, or respiratory rate for either the swim-bench or the treadmill test. There was a significant increase in ventilatory equivalent for both the swim bench and the treadmill tests, and also a significant increase in max Ve for the treadmill test (p <. 05). A significant increase in <b>dynamic</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> occurred in all subjects (p <. 01). It was concluded that although the results from the study were for the most part not significant, a replication of the study using a longer training program may produce the results that were originally hypothesized...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the relationship between selected motor tests and competitive successfulness in tennis for different age categories. The sample was comprised of 615 tennis players of both genders in the age categories of under- 14 and under- 18 years. Several motor abilities were investigated: the neuromuscular power of the arms, the elastic power of the legs, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>muscular</b> strength <b>endurance</b> of the trunk, acceleration, agility, hand-eye coordination, dynamic balance and running endurance. Competitive successfulness of players of both genders was defined by the position on the national ranking list and represented a criterion variable. The results of regression analysis showed in all categories a moderate, statistically significant correlation between the system of predictor variables and the criterion variable. A group of eight motor variables described 34 % of the criterion variable variance in the category of 12 - to 14 -year old girls and 54 % in the same age category of boys, whereas for the 15 - to 18 - year-old players the predictor variables described 52 % of the criterion variable variance in girls and 34 % in boys. The running endurance test in girls and the hand-eye coordination test in boys partially described competitive successfulness in the category of 12 - to 14 -year-olds. In the category of 15 - to 18 -year-olds, the criterion variance was partially described by the <b>dynamic</b> <b>muscular</b> strength <b>endurance</b> of the trunk in girls and hand-eye coordination and acceleration in boys. The results of the study underline the importance of several motor abilities for competitive successfulness in particular age categories of young tennis players. Cilj ovog istraživanja bio je utvrditi povezanost izabranih testova za procjenu motoričkih sposobnosti i natjecateljske uspješnosti u tenisu za različite dobne kategorije.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{relationships}} between obesity and measures of back and core <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> in firefighters. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in career firefighters without low back pain. Obesity measures included body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage assessed with air displacement plethysmography. <b>Muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> was assessed with the Modified Biering Sorensen (back) and Plank (core) tests. Relationships were explored using t-tests and regression analyses. Results. Of the 83 participants enrolled, 24 (29 %) were obese (BMI ≥ 30). Back and core <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> was 27 % lower for obese participants. Significant negative correlations were observed for BMI and body fat percentage with back and core endurance (r = − 0. 42 to − 0. 52). Stepwise regression models including one obesity measure (BMI, body fat percentage, and fat mass/fat-free mass), along with age and self-reported physical exercise, accounted for 17 – 19 % of the variance in back <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> and 29 – 37 % of the variance in core <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance.</b> Conclusions.

Montclair State University, Montclair, NJ Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of {{traditional}} exercise incorporating resistance/balance training and kickboxing training on muscular fitness, balance, and quality of life in older individuals. Methods: Nineteen older adults (60 to 80 years of age) were randomly assigned to a kickboxing group (n= 9) or traditional exercise group (n= 10) for an 8 -week exercise program. All participants were tested on static and <b>dynamic</b> balance, <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> of the upper and lower body, and quality of life prior to and after the exercise program. The 8 -week traditional exercise program consisted of a general warm-up followed by strength and balance training of the upper and lower body (two sets of 10 repetitions, twice a week). Participants in the kickboxing group, in addition to the traditional exercise training, performed alternate front punch, cross punch, upper-cut punch, and front and back kick exercises. Both groups completed each training session with a cool-down and stretching. A mixed design 2 x 2 factorial analysis of variance was computed, comparing the traditional exercise group and the kickboxing group before and after the 8 -week training program. A level of p 3 ̆c 0. 05 was used as the criteria for achieving statistical significance. Results: There were no significant interactions with respect to exercise group and time, however a significant main effect for time (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) was observed for many of the fitness parameters collapsed across exercise groups. An increase in <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> was noted for the bicep curl (Pre 11. 217 + 0. 476 curls, Post 13. 750 + 0. 827 curls) and chair stand test (Pre 9. 361 + 0. 650 stands, Post 11. 711 + 0. 383 stands). Both measures of balance were also improved post exercise training. Times for the agility test were lowered (Pre 9. 081 + 0. 289 s, Post 8. 224 + 0. 323 s), while scores for the Berg static balance test were raised (Pre 7. 994 + 0. 630 points, Post 11. 072 + 0. 326 points). Quality of life was unchanged at the conclusion of the exercise program.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 41 - 45) This paper explores {{prior research}} on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to acute bouts of muscular strength and <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> training. Heart rate variability (HRV), high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), very low frequency (VLF), total power, pre-ejection period (PEP), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and heart rate (HR) were recorded and analyzed, and used as markers of parasympathetic (PNS) and sympathetic (SNS) activity. The hypothesis tested was that ANS activity would differ during muscular strength and <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> exercise. Specifically, greater increases and decreases in the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the system, respectively, would occur during muscular strength exercise compared to <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> exercise due to greater relative intensity of muscular work. It was also hypothesized {{that there would be}} greater sympathetic activity during recovery (post-rest) than at baseline (pre-rest). Measurement instruments included the Vivometrics LifeShirt and VivoLogic Software (Version 3. 2). Data collection instruments were worn by each subject before, during, and after exercise to record values during resting, exercise, and recovery conditions. The results deomstrated that there were increases in sympathetic modulation and parasympathetic withdrawal during resistance exercise. However, there were greater PNS and SNS reponses to <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> exercises compared to muscular strength exercises. After both types of exercise, ANS activity did not return to baseline values during post-exercise recovery; there was greater signficance in results for the session including <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> testing. This indicates that <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> causes a larger and prolonged response in the autnomic nervous system, with increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity throughout endurance exercise and recovery. This leads {{to the question of whether}} <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> is safe or effective for a disordered population, and suggests that it may not be. Further research should be conducted regarding the autonomic response to <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> exercise in order to better understand the effect of resistance exercise on autonomic response, and the implications of prescribing resistance exercise to an individual or population...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{primarily}} to determine the reliability and factor validity of four <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> tests, and secondly, to identify gender differences in <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> tests. For this purpose, a new <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> test was constructed for pupils aged between seven and eight (CROCO). The research was done on a sample of 71 pupils aged between seven and eight (35 girls and 36 boys), their body height being 129. 2 ± 1. 3 cm for boys and 127. 1 ± 1. 4 cm for girls, body weight 29. 3 ± 7. 2 kg for boys and 27. 1 ± 6. 5 for girls. According to the results, all tests have shown a good level of reliability and factor validity. Also, the present study confirmed the expected gender differences (p£ 0. 05). In all <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> tests, the boys were slightly better than girls (p£ 0. 05). The authors recommend the implementation of the CROCO test and other <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> tests used in this study, both for the implementation in the primary school curricula and in sports because of these tests’ satisfactory level of reliability and factor validity.

Fifteen track and field athletes (400 m sprinters, decathletes and middle-distance runners) participated. The subjects were used to obtain data on changes in running speed during 80 m and 400 m running, maximal O_ 2 intake, O_ 2 debt and isokinetic <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance.</b> The time taken to cover 400 m was negatively correlated with maximum O_ 2 (r=- 0. 558; p< 0. 05) and <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> of hip flexion (r=- 0. 521; p< 0. 05). Running speed over a distance of 400 m began to decrease after 80 m, and kept decreasing until the finish. The change in running speed after 80 m was expressed as a linear regression equation, and the regression gradient was interpreted to be an index of the decrease in running speed. There were significant correlations between the <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> of hip flexion and extension respectively (r=- 0. 666; p< 0. 01, r=- 0. 517, p< 0. 05).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> training on O 2 -cost and performance in double poling (DP) on a rollerski treadmill. Twenty-two well-trained cross-country skiers (31 ± 4 years, 77 ± 9 kg, 181 ± 8 cm, VO 2 max running: 64 ± 5 mL·kg− 1 ·min− 1) were counter-balanced to either a combined <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> and running interval training group [MET; n = 11 (♂ = 9, ♀ = 2) ], or an endurance running interval training group [ET; n = 11 (♂ = 9, ♀ = 2) ]. Both groups continued their normal low-and moderate intensity training, but replaced 2 weekly high intensity-training sessions with two project-specific sessions for 6 weeks. In these sessions, MET combined upper-body <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> training (4 × 30 repetitions, 90 s rest between sets) and running intervals (3 × 4 or 2 × 6 min, 3 min rest), while ET performed running intervals only (6 × 4 or 4 × 6 min, 3 min rest). The DP test-protocol consisted of 50 min submaximal poling for O 2 -cost measurement, followed by a self-paced 1, 000 -m performance test. In addition, subjects performed a VO 2 max test in running. MET increased <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> (P < 0. 05) and 1 RM in simulated DP (P < 0. 01) more than ET. Further, MET reduced the 1, 000 -m time and O 2 -cost compared to baseline values (P < 0. 05), and tended to improve the 1, 000 -m time more than ET (P = 0. 06). There were no changes in VO 2 max running or VO 2 peak DP in either MET or ET. In conclusion, 6 weeks of <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> training increased both <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> and 1 RM in simulated DP. Further, specific upper-body <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> training improved DP performance and thus, seems as a promising training model to optimize performance in well-trained cross-country skiers...|$|R

Twelve male national and international level surfers volunteered to take part in the study. Their mean (± SD) age, body mass, height and surfing experience were 27. 0 ± 3. 3 years, 73. 2 ± 7. 1 kg, 1. 7 ± 0. 05 m and 21. 0 ± 3. 1 years, respectively. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two trials: no fluid ingestion (NF) or fluid ingestion (FI) during 100 min of surf practice in a steamer wetsuit. The experiment was designed to emulate not only the physical and cognitive demands of surfing but also the ambient environment in which it takes place. Before and immediately after surf practice, the participants had their hydration status measured, completed a cognitive test battery and upper and lower-body <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> tests. Surfing performance was assessed during the first and last 20 min of practice. At the conclusion of the NF trial, participants showed a 3. 9 ± 0. 7 % body mass (BM) loss, this was significantly greater (P < 0. 05) than the 1. 6 ± 0. 7 % BM loss seen at the end of the FI trial. In the NF trial, surfing performance decreased by 20. 3 ± 7. 1 %, but showed a slight improvement in the FI trial (1. 9 ± 10. 2 %). Of the six cognitive domains assessed (short-term memory, information processing speed, working memory, attention, visuomotor skill and visual acuity) all were significantly impaired when at a 3. 9 ± 0. 7 % BM loss (P < 0. 05) yet were unaffected at a 1. 6 ± 0. 7 % BM loss. Information processing speed and working memory were the most strongly correlated to surfing performance (r = 0. 74; P < 0. 05). At the conclusion of the NF trial upper and lower-body <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> were diminished by 21. 2 ± 5. 5 % and 4. 4 ± 5. 8 %, respectively. At the conclusion of the FI trial upper-body <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> was reduced by 17. 0 ± 4. 1 % while lower-body <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> was marginally better (1 ± 3 %).

The change in kinematic variables between the beginning and the end of the run were correlated with the measures of <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance.</b> Several statistically significant negative correlations emerged between the change in stride length and concentric hip extension (HE(con)), r = - 0. 934; eccentric hip extension (HE(ecc)), r = - 0. 818; eccentric knee flexion(KF(ecc)), r = - 0. 957; and change in maximum hip extension (Delta max HE), r - - 0. 857; and Delta max HE with HE(con), r = - 0. 846. We concluded that the local <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> of both HE(con) and KF(ecc) are important in maintaining a stable running style...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the trainability of body composition, aerobic power and <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> of cadet wrestlers. Material: Fifteen cadet wrestlers (age: 15. 20 ± 0. 94 years) participated in this study. Methods: The testing was conducted twice, before and after four-week training period. The physiological parameters included aerobic power, <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> and body composition. Results: A significant decrease in the body fat was observed following the training (p 0. 05). In general, although a lot of factors including skill, mental, genetic and other fitness factors render some influences on a wrestler's success, improvement of physical fitness plays an important role in championship. Based on results of the present study more time is needed to improve <b>muscular</b> and cardiovascular <b>endurance,</b> therefore wrestling coaches and trainers are recommended to pay special attention to these factors. Conclusion: Our results indicated that wrestlers experienced significant changes in their body fat percentage during four-week training period. Cadet wrestlers’ aerobic power, <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> and body composition are trainable, although these improvements may be less than what has been observed in junior and senior wrestlers...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxia is an {{important}} modulator of endurance exercise-induced oxidative adaptations in skeletal muscle. However, whether hypoxia affects resistance exercise-induced muscle adaptations remains unknown. Here, we determined the effect of resistance exercise training under systemic hypoxia on muscular adaptations known to occur following both resistance and endurance exercise training, including muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), one-repetition maximum (1 RM), <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance,</b> and makers of mitochondrial biogenesis and angiogenesis, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator- 1 α (PGC- 1 α), citrate synthase (CS) activity, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1), and capillary-to-fiber ratio. Sixteen healthy male subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} either a normoxic resistance training group (NRT, n = 7) or a hypoxic (14. 4 % oxygen) resistance training group (HRT, n = 9) and performed 8 weeks of resistance training. Blood and muscle biopsy samples were obtained before and after training. After training muscle CSA of the femoral region, 1 RM for bench-press and leg-press, <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance,</b> and skeletal muscle VEGF protein levels significantly increased in both groups. The increase in <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> was significantly higher in the HRT group. Plasma VEGF concentration and skeletal muscle capillary-to-fiber ratio were significantly higher in the HRT group than the NRT group following training. Our results suggest that, in addition to increases in muscle size and strength, HRT may also lead to increased <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> and the promotion of angiogenesis in skeletal muscle...|$|R

40|$|Background: Up-to-date {{research}} on musculoskeletal- and neuromotor fitness (MSMF) is lacking. The {{aims of the}} present paper were to a) establish normative values of MSMF by gender and age, and b) to assess {{how much of the}} variance in MSMF can be explained by obesity in adults. Methods: A random selection of 726 Norwegians (20 – 65 years) participated in a national cross-sectional study. <b>Muscular</b> <b>endurance,</b> <b>muscular</b> strength, explosive power, flexibility and balance were assessed in addition to waist circumference (WC). Results: Females displayed significantly higher scores compared to males on <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> of the back extensors and on the flexibility tests (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Males displayed significantly higher scores than females (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) on handgrip strength, modified push-ups, and explosive power. An inverse association was found between age and all MSMF scores for females (Beta:− 0. 06 –(− 0. 92), p[*]≤[*] 0. 044) and males (Beta:− 0. 15 –(0. 91), p[*]≤[*] 0. 006), where younger participants displayed higher test scores on all MSMF tests, compared to older participants. Furthermore, participants showing higher scores on WC displayed lower scores on the following MSMF tests for both females and males: <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> of the back extensors, balance, flexibility of the shoulder, and explosive power (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Additionally, male participants with higher WC scores showed lower scores on <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> of the upper body and flexibility of the hamstrings compared to males with lower WC scores (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Conclusions: The data provide normative values of MSMF for adults based on age and gender, and support an inverse relationship of MSMF to age and WC...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Physical {{activity}} is suggested {{to be important}} for low back pain (LBP) but a major problem is the limited validity of the measurement of physical activities, which is usually based on questionnaires. Physical fitness {{can be viewed as}} a more objective measurement and our question was how physical activity based on self-reports and objective measured levels of physical fitness were associated with LBP. Materials and methods We analyzed cross-sectional data of 1, 723 police employees. Physical activity was assessed by questionnaire (SQUASH) measuring type of activity, intensity, and time spent on these activities. Physical fitness was based on <b>muscular</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>endurance</b> capacity and peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak). Severe LBP, interfering with functioning, was defined by pain ratings C 4 on a scale of 0 – 10. Results Higher levels of physical fitness, both muscularand aerobic, were associated with less LBP (OR: 0. 54; 95 %CI: 0. 34 – 0. 86, respectively, 0. 59 : 95 %CI: 0. 35 – 0. 99). For self-reported physical activity, both a low and a high level of the total physical activity pattern were associated with an increase of LBP (OR: 1. 52; 95 %CI: 1. 00 – 2. 31, respectively, 1. 60; 95 %CI: 1. 05 – 2. 44). Conclusion These findings suggest that physical activity of an intensity that improves physical fitness may be important in the prevention of LB...|$|R
40|$|Breast cancer {{treatment}} {{often results in}} impaired shoulder function, in particular, decrements in <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> and range of motion, which may lead to decreased quality of life. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} {{to determine the effects of}} walking pole use on shoulder function in female breast cancer survivors. Participants had previously been treated with 1 or a combination of the following: mastectomy, breast conservation therapy, axillary lymph node dissection, chemotherapy, or radiation. Participants were randomly placed in experimental (n = 6) and control (n = 6) groups and met with a cancer exercise specialist 2 times each week for 8 weeks. The experimental group used walking poles during the 20 -minute aerobic portion of their workout, whereas the control group did not use walking poles but performed 20 minutes of aerobic exercise per workout session. Both groups participated in similar resistance training programs. Testing was done pre- and postexercise intervention to de-termine upper body <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> and active range of motion at the glenohumeral joint. Repeated-measures analy-sis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant improvements in <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> as measured by the bench press (P =. 046) and lat pull down (P =. 013) in the walking pole group. No within-group improvements were found in the group that did not use walking poles. The data suggest that using a walk-ing pole exercise routine for 8 weeks significantly improved <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> of the upper body, which would clearly be beneficial in helping breast cancer survivors perform ac-tivities of daily living and regain an independent lifestyle...|$|R
40|$|This study {{determined}} potential {{changes in}} upper body <b>muscular</b> strength and <b>endurance</b> {{as a result}} of walking with the use of specially designed walking poles (Exerstriders). Ninety-two inactive females, 20 - 49 yrs, volunteered to participate in the study. Ss were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups: Exerstriders (E), who walked using the Exerstriders; Walkers (W), who participated in a conventional walking program; and Controls (C). E and W participated in a supervised 12 -week walking program, exercising 4 days per week, for 20 - 45 min per session, at 70 - 85 % of maximal HR. Ss were assessed for upper body <b>muscular</b> strength and <b>endurance</b> before and after training. Strength (lb) was assessed using 1 -RM tests for triceps pushdown and a modified lateral pulldown exercise. To assess <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance,</b> Ss performed a 1 min bout of alternating arm pulls on a modified Biokinetic Swim Bench apparatus. Total work output (kpm) was used as the criterion measure. Changes in <b>muscular</b> strength and <b>endurance</b> were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA and Tukeyls post-hoc tests. E had sig (pc. 01) increase (37 %) in <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance</b> from pre to posttesting, which was greater than the non sig (p>. 01) increases shown by W (14 %) and C (5 %). There were no sig (p>. Ol) changes in pushdown or pulldown strength in any group. It would appear that although Exerstriding can result in substantial increases in <b>muscular</b> <b>endurance,</b> it may not provide sufficient stimulus to increase strength. A longer training period may be needed to alter this parameter...|$|R
