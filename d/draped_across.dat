5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen <b>draped</b> <b>across</b> ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E
5|$|In early January2016, a {{stationary}} front was <b>draped</b> <b>across</b> the western Caribbean; a non-tropical low developed along this boundary over northwestern Cuba by January6. Moving northeast {{ahead of the}} subtropical jet stream, the system acquired a surface vortex the following day to the northeast of the Bahamas. Initial conditions, including strong wind shear, low sea surface temperatures, and dry air, inhibited formation of a tropical cyclone as the storm moved northeast toward Bermuda. The large system featured gale-force winds, with maximum sustained winds of 60–65mph (95–100km/h). On January8, the system passed about 75mi (120km) north of Bermuda, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the islands. On January9, an anomalous blocking pattern prevented the cyclone from continuing along a seasonal northeasterly track. Instead, the storm turned east-southeast into a region slightly more favorable for subtropical development. Hurricane-force winds developed around {{the core of the}} cyclone on January10 as it deepened to 979mbar (hPa; 28.91inHg), though convective activity near the center remained sparse. Separated from the jet stream, the cyclone dove south-southeast over the central Atlantic around a mid-latitude trough. Slight weakening took place on January11.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} flag should be {{displayed in the}} open only between sunrise and sunset, except {{on the occasion of}} public meetings, processions, or funerals, when it may be displayed for the duration of such functions. When displayed on a platform, the {{national flag}} should not be used to cover the speaker’s desk, nor should it be draped over the platform. The national flag should never be defaced by placing slogans, logos, lettering or pictures of any kind on it, for example at sporting events. The flag should not be draped on cars, trains, boats or other modes of transport; it should not be carried flat, but should always be carried aloft and free, except when used to drape a coffin; on such an occasion, the green should be {{at the head of the}} coffin. The tricolour is <b>draped</b> <b>across</b> the coffins of Presidents of Ireland (including former presidents), soldiers and Garda Síochána personnel killed in the line of duty, and other notables accorded state funerals, such as Roger Casement in 1965, or Kevin Barry in 2001.

2500|$|The feud between Love and Manson {{carried over}} into their shows {{immediately}} after the tour began. They traded nightly exchanges of thinly-veiled insults during their respective sets. MTV also noted the extreme difference between both band's production, set design and use of special effects. Hole opted for a minimal set design consisting of a projected backdrop {{and a series of}} garlands <b>draped</b> <b>across</b> the monitors and drum kit. Their special effects were limited to occasional use of a pressurized cannon that projected an explosion of glitter during their performance of the song [...] "Dying", and a rain of rose petals that were dropped from the rafters onto the stage during the song [...] "Celebrity Skin". Manson's performance, by contrast, utilized expensive pyrotechnics, elaborate props and set pieces as well as numerous costume changes. Much to Love's chagrin, the majority of concertgoers were Manson fans who were less interested in the Hole performance.|$|E

2500|$|The basic, unadorned toga virilis ("toga of manhood") was a semi-elliptical, white {{woolen cloth}} some 6 feet in width and 12 feet in length, <b>draped</b> <b>across</b> the {{shoulders}} and around the body, over a plain white linen tunic. A commoner's toga virilis was a naturally off-white; the senatorial version was more voluminous, and brighter. The toga praetexta of curule magistrates and some priesthoods added a wide purple edging, and was worn over a tunic with two vertical purple stripes. It could also be worn by noble and freeborn boys and girls, and represented their protection under civil and divine law. Equites wore the trabea (a shorter, [...] "equestrian" [...] form of white toga or a purple-red wrap, or both) over a white tunic with two narrow vertical purple-red stripes. The toga pulla, used for mourning, was made of dark wool. The rare, prestigious toga picta and tunica palmata were entirely purple, save for their gold embroidery; they were originally awarded to Roman generals for the day of their triumph, and later worn by emperors and Imperial consuls.|$|E
2500|$|One {{painting}} at least depicts an actress playing {{the part of}} Circe. This is Franz von Stuck’s striking portrait of [...] " [...] as Circe” (1913). She played this part in a Viennese revival of Calderon’s play in 1912 {{and there is a}} publicity still of her by Isidor Hirsch in which she is <b>draped</b> <b>across</b> a sofa and wearing an elaborate crown. Her enticing expression and the turn of her head there is almost exactly that of Van Stuck’s enchantress as she holds out the poisoned bowl. It suggests the use of certain posed publicity photos in creating the same iconic effect as had paintings in the past. A nearly contemporary example was the 1907 photo of Mme Geneviève Vix as Circe in the light opera by Lucien Hillenacher at the Opéra-Comique in Paris. The posing of the actress and the cropping of the image so as to highlight her luxurious costume demonstrates its ambition to create an effect that goes beyond the merely theatrical. A later example is the still of Silvana Mangano in her part as Circe in the 1954 film “Ulysses”, which is as cunningly posed for effect.|$|E
40|$|Field {{investigations}} into glacial sediments and landforms {{in the southern}} Prince Charles Mountains reveal at least four major phases of deposition. The oldest, which is a thick succession of mud-rich sediments on the summit surfaces, is a potential correlative of the mid-late Cenozoic Pagodroma Group. The next three {{are a series of}} thin, sandy diamict <b>drapes</b> <b>across</b> the massifs. The first phase of thin diamicts records a glacial expansion that inundated all of the 2000 m high nunataks, with weathering characteristics suggesting an early-mid Pleistocene age. The second phase records an ice height increase of ? 800 m near the modern grounding line. Sediments from this phase are relatively unweathered, and depositional landforms indicate deposition probably terminated during the short warm phase that occurred between 11 and 9. 5 ka BP. The third and final phase indicates minor readvance since this time. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Some of the {{principal}} features of the dayside solar wind ionosphere interaction at Venus are presented. The dayside ionopause and ionosphere are observed to respond dramatically to solar wind pressure variations. The ram pressure of the solar wind is manifested mainly as magnetic pressure just external to the subsolar ionopause, and the ionopause location is controlled principally by this pressure. The ionosheath field is observed to <b>drape</b> <b>across</b> the dayside ionosphere, and ionopause currents {{over most of the}} dayside usually act to exclude the high ionosheath field from the generally low-field ionosphere. Tenuous, warm ionospheric plasma is sometimes observed on field lines outside the ionopause current sheet, suggesting that this dayside ionospheric plasma can be transported to the nightside and into the Venus wake. Some of the magnetic and thermal plasma features of the dayside ionosphere are shown, and modeling and distribution of flux ropes, small scale helical magnetic structures, are discussed in the context of thermal plasma observations...|$|R

2500|$|The {{sculpture}} is {{carved from}} a single block of white Carrara marble – a rare medium for Giambologna. The surface is highly finished and in good condition aside from some drill and rasp marks. It depicts a nude young woman {{in the act of}} washing, seated in an awkward position on a truncated column. She is voluptuous and fleshy in the usual Mannerist way. She has a blank, inscrutable expression, and wavy, centrally-parted hair. Her straight nose reflects classical Roman sculpture. There is a bracelet on her left arm, and a chemise or shift with embroidered cuffs is <b>draped</b> <b>across</b> her left thigh. The woman's pose is complex, with her weight resting mostly on her left buttock, which is seated on a round column from which drapery hangs. According to art historian Peggy Fogelman, [...] "With one leg and both arms positioned in front of her, the figure's weight and the compositional balance seem tilted forward". Her left leg is raised; her knee sharply bent. The head is inclined downwards, and her eyes are blank. She holds an ointment jar in her left hand, raised high above her head. Her right hand holds a small cloth which she uses to clean her left foot.|$|E
