25|$|<b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who {{has lived}} through the extravagances of the 1960s, {{received}} global acclaim for the humanitarian and spiritual facets of his music, experienced {{the darker side of}} popular music's excesses, seen the murder of one of his closest friends , and has now settled on a life away from the constant spotlight of public scrutiny.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Dylan is a superbly eloquent {{writer of}} pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images." [...] The editor of Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams, reviewed Blonde on Blonde in July 1966: [...] "It is {{a cache of}} emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready {{to become part of}} your reality. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who will speak to you, a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want. All {{you have to do is}} listen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1958, {{shortly after}} Smith {{was fired by}} the Phillies, {{unconfirmed}} reports were published indicating that a deal was {{in the works for}} the Cincinnati Reds to hire Smith as their manager. [...] Jimmy Dykes had been named interim manager after Birdie Tebbetts resigned the post. [...] At the end of September, Smith signed a one-year contract to take over as manager for the 1959 season. Cincinnati general manager Gabe Paul announced: [...] "We believe that in [...] Mayo Smith we have a young, progressive, middle-of-the-road manager who will help formulate the kind of baseball organization that will result in success for our club." [...] In The Cincinnati Post, Pat Harmon expressed skepticism: [...] "he naming of Smith caused no ripple of excitement in the city. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who had a fourth and two fifths and was dropped by the Phillies." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{eyes of the}} Echo-dwarf glistened. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{who might}} help him in his plans.|$|R
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{new phase}} in her life. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> willing {{to marry her}} {{even though she had}} no assured fortune.|$|R
60|$|But <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> {{who rose}} of Himself. He {{was raised by}} God, and {{therefore}} He raised Himself, for He was God.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, sire, it is,' {{answered}} the servant; 'and <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> I have brought with {{me from the}} country to confirm the tale.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's just my point. It IS serious. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{who is a}} {{helpless}} burden. He may be restored to reason and usefulness--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I've got you." [...] Ernest's jaw snapped like a trap. [...] "Let me show you. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{who works}} on the street railways." ...|$|E
60|$|Saxon <b>was</b> glowing. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>a</b> protector, {{something}} to lean against, of whom even the Butchertown toughs were afraid {{as soon as}} his name was mentioned.|$|R
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who {{had come}} from {{goodness}} knows where, whose strange wanderings and secret appearances in the neighborhood had oft roused the anger of the village folk, just as his fantastic clothes, his silken doublet and befrilled shirt had excited their scorn; <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> I say, who came from nowhere, and now he chose--the yokels of the neighborhood declared it that he chose--to make his exit from the world in as weird a manner as he had effected his entrance into this remote and law-abiding little island.|$|R
60|$|If the {{thoughts}} that still hung heavy {{on my mind}} were only the morbid, fanciful thoughts of the hour, <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> whose society would dissipate them. I resolved to try the experiment, and accepted his invitation.|$|R
6000|$|Here is realization, [...] <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> tallied--he realizes here {{what he has}} in him, [...] The past, the future, majesty, love--if {{they are}} vacant of you, you [...] are vacant of them.|$|E
6000|$|... “Explain! explain!” cried Richard; “it {{was about}} the mines, ha! Ay, ay, I see it, I see it; <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with a pick on his shoulder. So you heard it all, Benjamin?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is not enough, my friend. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of whom I {{only know}} that he has bought a great many marble statues. He has done nothing for his country, and nothing for his sovereign." ...|$|E
60|$|How {{characteristic}} of cowboys that they lied to shield Jack Belllounds! But it was futile {{to attempt to}} deceive the old rancher. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who had <b>been</b> forty years dealing {{with all kinds of}} men and events.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Crewe {{glanced at}} him again. In spite of himself, respect was growing in him. He had {{expected}} to find {{a certain amount of}} eagerness and subserviency--though veiled; <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of different calibre than he looked for in Ripton.|$|R
60|$|Lydia {{looked at}} him thoughtfully. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> whom she had mistaken for the finest image of manly {{strength}} and beauty in the world; {{and he was so}} devoid of artistic culture that he held <b>a</b> statue to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> distasteful lump of stone.|$|R
6000|$|... "'O strange interment! Civilized lands [...] Afford few types thereof; <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{who takes}} his rest [...] Beside his very Love, Beside {{the one who}} was his wife [...] In our sight up above!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{very thing}} that has always struck me when, poor man, {{he has tried to}} be civil to me. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> {{sensible}} himself, but who has never had the hap to live with sensible women.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The sun {{touches his}} side--and yet, Captain Ludlow, {{you may be}} right--for <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> in his fore-top, plainly enough to be seen. A shot, or two, among his spars and sails, might now do service." ...|$|E
60|$|Muda Saffir nodded. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{after his}} own heart, which loved intrigue and duplicity. Evidently he would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good ally in wreaking vengeance upon the white giant who had caused all his discomfiture--afterward {{there was always}} the kris if the other should become inconvenient.|$|R
60|$|Assuredly the Americans are the best-natured {{people on}} earth! <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> whose house <b>was</b> nearly {{tumbling}} down about his ears--always bating the principle in architecture just named--and he could smile as Nero may be {{supposed to have}} done when fiddling over the conflagration of Rome.|$|R
60|$|Gently explorative, he {{slid his}} hand from wrist to elbow and came to rest half way back. Tired and languid from the morning in the sun, she found herself thrilling to his touch and half-dreamily {{deciding}} that <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> she could love, hands and all.|$|R
6000|$|... “I thank you, sir, {{for what}} you have done,” said the youth, with a little distance; “but <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who will take me under his care, and spare you all, gentlemen, any further trouble on my account” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. This is a {{man with}} whom God is, in whom God works and walks; a man whose motion is governed and steered by the mighty hand of God, and the effectual working of his power. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 4. This man {{can look}} upon death with comfort, can laugh at {{destruction}} when it cometh, and longs {{to hear the}} sound of the last trump, and to see his Judge coming in the clouds of heaven. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> indeed! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{about to}} risk his life--for {{there was no}} denying the fact--in a great sociological experiment, yet they {{received}} the announcement with absolute unconcern. It offered one more assurance, had I needed it, of the degenerate state of the civilization upon which I was turning my back.|$|R
60|$|Poor Thomas Newcome {{was quite}} abashed by this strange reception. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> hungry for affection, and one {{relation}} {{asked him to}} dinner next Monday, and another invited him to shoot pheasants at Christmas. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> beardless young sprig, who patronised him, and vouchsafed to ask him whether he found London was changed.|$|R
6000|$|Dorothea colored with pleasure, {{and looked}} up gratefully to the speaker. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who could {{understand}} the higher inward life, and with whom {{there could be some}} spiritual communion; nay, who could illuminate principle with the widest knowledge <b>a</b> <b>man</b> whose learning almost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} anybody is to do. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> as mad as a March hare, and yet nobody can touch him. If {{it was not}} for the child, I should advise Emily to put him out of her head altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 3. This man is {{travelling}} to Mount Zion, {{the heavenly}} Jerusalem, {{the city of}} the living God, and to an innumerable company of angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect, to God the Judge of all, and to Jesus. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|ARETHUSA. He hasn't {{learned to}} know you, Kit, as I have, nor yet {{do you know}} him. He seems hard and violent; at heart he is only a man {{overwhelmed}} with sorrow. Why else, when {{he looks at me}} and does not know that I observe him, should his face change, and fill with such tenderness, that I could weep to see him? Why, when he walks in his sleep, as he does almost every night, his eyes open and beholding nothing, why should he cry so pitifully on my mother's name? Ah, if you could hear him then, you would say yourself: <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> that has loved; <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> that will be kind to lovers.|$|E
60|$|When {{this news}} was made public, the school, lost in wonder and admiration, gasped at the Head {{as he went}} to his house. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> to <b>be</b> reverenced. On the rare {{occasions}} when he caned he did it very scientifically, and the execution of a hundred boys would be epic--immense.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Spugg {{told this}} with no false boasting or bravado, eating his celery {{as he spoke}} of it. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who had nearly had his chauffeur's wings blown off and yet he never moved a muscle. I began to realize the kind of {{resolute}} stuff {{that the man was}} made of.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who {{sincerely}} did {{not mind}} what people thought of him, and so convention had no hold on him; he <b>was</b> like <b>a</b> wrestler whose body is oiled; you {{could not get a}} grip on him; it gave him <b>a</b> freedom which <b>was</b> <b>an</b> outrage. I remember saying to him: ...|$|R
