40|$|In this paper, a {{model is}} {{presented}} {{which shows the}} relationship between country grain storage costs and transport bottlenecks {{that exist in the}} harvest period. It is shown that transport bottlenecks limit the amount of grain that can be transported from receival points in the peak receival period. This constraint means that the cost of operating country receival points is high because the turnover of storage capacity is limited. However, system costs can be reduced by focusing the peak transport task at sites that are less <b>intensive</b> <b>users</b> of scare transport capacity. This allows more grain to be transported out of the system in the peak period, decreasing the need for costly long term storage at country sites. In the longer term, differences in the intensity of transport use means that optimal levels of investment in storage capacity (relative to grain receivals) will differ between sites. Relatively more storage should be constructed at sites that are <b>intensive</b> <b>users</b> of transport capacity (eg. those sites that are furthest from the port). Less storage capacity is needed at sites that are less <b>intensive</b> <b>users</b> of transport because a large depot-to-port transport task will be concentrated at these sites in the peak period.

30|$|Automatic and {{semi-automatic}} segmentation {{methods have}} been developed across imaging modalities and different anatomical regions. Common requirements include maximum automaticity with minimum operator interaction, time efficiency, accuracy, and boundary reproducibility. Some segmentation algorithms rely on region-growing methods that require an operator to select a seed point within the volume of interest [47]. These methods work well for relatively homogeneous lesions, but show the need for <b>intensive</b> <b>user</b> correction for inhomogeneous lesions. For example, most stage I and stage II lung tumours present as homogenous, high-intensity lesions on a background of low-intensity lung parenchyma [48, 49] and, therefore, can be automatically segmented with high reproducibility and accuracy.

These approaches trade <b>intensive</b> <b>user</b> interaction for precision. In this paper, we introduce the Amber ("Adaptable Model-based Extraction of Result Pages") system that replaces the human interaction with a domain ontology applicable to all sites of a domain. It models domain knowledge about (1) records and attributes of the domain, (2) low-level (textual) representations of these concepts, and (3) constraints linking representations to records and attributes. Parametrized with these constraints, otherwise domain-independent heuristics exploit the repeated structure of result pages to derive attributes and records. Amber is implemented in logical rules to allow an explicit formulation of the heuristics and easy adaptation to different domains.

Internal environment factors involve firm-level decision making, namely cost and benefit analysis, organisational capabilities and leadership values.

40|$|Abstract. The live-wire {{approach}} is an interactive, contour-based segmentation technique. Generally, the contour of a targeted object (anatomical structure) is built by interactively selecting control points and finding minimal-cost paths between them. By its very nature, {{this method is}} applicable only to 2 D images. For the segmentation of 3 D datasets (volumes), the interactive generation of live-wire contours has {{to be applied to}} each slice of the volume. This process can be quite tedious, due to the sometimes <b>intensive</b> <b>user</b> interaction. In this contribution, we propose adaptive propagation as an alternative to individually processing all image slices or shape-based interpolation of live-wire contours. 1 Introduction and Related Work In the context of medical image segmentation, and due to object characteristics as well as image quality, a fully-automatic segmentation is in most cases not possible. Moreover, the results of automatic segmentation methods often need further correction. For example, the complex anatomical structure of th...|$|E
