40|$|The {{standard}} contour method {{determines the}} residual stress component normal {{to the plane}} of measurement. This talk presents extensions to the contour method to allow determination of multiple stress components. Two extensions are presented, both using additional stress measurements and then superposition to determine the original residual stresses. The first extension involves making additional cuts to determine stresses on multiple cut planes, using only the contour method. The second extension involves measuring in-plane stresses on the surface exposed by the original cut, using x-ray diffraction and hole drilling in this case. Experiments were preformed on <b>indented</b> <b>disks</b> of both 316 L stainless steel and 2024 -T 351 aluminum. Results are compared with a finite element prediction and with stresses independently measured using neutron diffraction {{to show that the}} new theories are valid. Additional issues discussed will include the necessity to include a calibrated cyclic hardening model in the finite element simulation, difficulties in measuring surface stresses, and the repeatability of contour measurements on identical specimens...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} sow {{as soon as}} {{possible}} after the first rains, farmers must be able to prepare their fields quickly. Two new pieces of equipment for animal traction which would speed up this work have recently been developed by the Centre for Research and Experimentation of Tropical Agricultural Machinery (CEEMAT) in France. The first is a tine that enables soil compacted during the dry season to be broken up and worked down to 15 cm before the first rains. This ensures good infiltration of water and paves the way for seed bed preparation as soon as the first major rain arrives. The second piece of equipment is the 'rolicultivator'. It is a cross between a pulverizing disk, and a rolling tine, usually pulled by a tractor. Adapted to animal traction, it consists of an <b>indented,</b> curving <b>disk</b> roller that can prepare about 62 cm of soil (about three plough furrows) m a single passage. Soil preparation is thus much faster. Tested in Burkina Faso and Botswana, both of these new farm implements can easily be made and repaired in local workshops. For more details, contact: G.

40|$|The {{recently}} developed contour method can measure complex residual-stress maps {{in situations where}} other measurement methods cannot. This talk first describes {{the principle of the}} contour method. A part is cut in two using a precise and low-stress cutting technique such as electric discharge machining. The contour of the resulting new surface, which will not be flat if residual stresses are relaxed by the cutting, is then measured. Finally, a conceptually simple finite element analysis determines the original residual stresses from the measured contour. Next, this talk gives several examples of applications. The method is validated by comparing with neutron diffraction measurements in an <b>indented</b> steel <b>disk</b> and in a friction stir weld between dissimilar aluminum alloys. Several applications are shown that demonstrate the power of the contour method: large aluminum forgings, railroad rails, and welds. Finally, this talk discusses why the contour method is significant departure from conventional experimental mechanics. Other relaxation method, for example hole-drilling, can only measure a 1 -D profile of residual stresses, and yet they require a complicated inverse calculation to determine the stresses from the strain data. The contour method gives a 2 -D stress map over a full cross-section, yet a direct calculation is all that is needed to reduce the data. The reason for these advantages lies in a subtle but fundamental departure from conventional experimental mechanics. Applying new technology to old methods like will not give similar advances, but the new approach also introduces new errors...|$|R
