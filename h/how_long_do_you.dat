This increases the transportation expense for those who has been move to the urban area, what's more, they have less money to earn by investment because they are using all of money to pay their daily expense already. For example, the fare of New York city subway(MTA) is all the same no matter <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> travel, it's all 2.75 USD. It's justice of Housing inequality.|$|E

40|$|Election policy gets {{made in a}} {{world without}} data. Recently I 2 ̆ 7 ve {{proposed}} a solution to that problem - creating a Democracy Index, which would rank states and localities based on how well their election systems are run. Imagine a U. S. News and World report for the election system that would rank jurisdictions based on basic questions that matter to voters: <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> stand in line? How many ballots got discarded? How many machines broke down? This idea - one that was put into legislation by then Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton - is {{the first and most}} useful step we could take to improving our badly administered election system. Elsewhere, I have described why a Democracy Index should help get change passed. Here, I want to focus on a different question: how to figure out what kind of change we want. Part II describes the problems associated with policymaking in a world without data. Part III explains why a Democracy Index, by pulling together the right data in the right form, would provide a much-needed corrective to ongoing debates about election policy...|$|R

30|$|Two {{questions}} in the questionnaire are used to identify migrants in the urban labour market: (1) In which location is your hukou registered? and (2) <b>How</b> <b>long</b> ago <b>did</b> <b>you</b> leave this location? Migrants are defined as those who have left their registered hukou location {{for more than six}} months. Another question asks the type of hukou (agricultural or non-agricultural) and helps divide migrants further into two categories. As individuals with an agricultural hukou usually come from rural areas, we refer to this group as rural migrants. Similarly, we refer to migrants with non-agricultural hukou as urban migrants as most of them come from other urban areas, and refer to residents who have local urban hukou as urban residents.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether parents understand and adhere to preoperative fasting instructions. AIM: To identify how we may reduce perioperative morbidity relating to failure to fast. BACKGROUND: Children are routinely fasted preoperatively {{with the aim}} of reducing the risk of aspiration of gastric contents and its sequelae. METHODS: Parents of children on the day case ward following elective surgery completed a survey asking: (i) For <b>how</b> <b>long</b> was your child asked to fast? (ii) <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ensure your child was fasted of food and clear fluids? (iii) What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think is the purpose of fasting? We also asked the parents to complete a checklist of items they thought acceptable to consume when fasting. RESULTS: Despite affirming fasting status in the preoperative check, 13. 5 % were not fasted. Parents reported advised fasting times of 1 - 24 h (median 6) for solids and 0. 5 - 24 h (median 3) for fluids. Children were fasted of solids for 3 - 40 h (median 9. 5) and of fluids for 0. 5 - 24 h (median 5). Regarding the understanding of fasting, 9 referred to aspiration and 53 to the prevention of nausea or vomiting. Thirteen believed that fasting status altered the efficacy of anesthesia. During the fasting period, 4. 9 % would allow French fries, 22. 3 % toast/crackers, 17. 5 % cereal, 14. 7 % a sweet, 14. 9 % gum, and 12. 6 % tea with milk. CONCLUSIONS: Children we believe to be fasted may not be. Parents may deliberately misrepresent the actual fasting status of their child. Adherence to fasting advice may be affected by parents' recall and understanding of fasting advice...|$|R
