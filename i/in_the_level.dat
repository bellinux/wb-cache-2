40|$|Abstract Background Azelnidipine (AZL), a long-acting dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonist, {{has been}} {{recently}} approved {{and used for}} treating ischemic heart disease and cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction, however, its effect on hyperglycemia-induced cardiac damage has not been studied. Methods This study examined the effect of AZL on circulating markers of cardiac damage, altered lipid and cytokines profile and markers of oxidative stress including homocysteine in diabetic rats. Results STZ induced diabetes caused {{a significant increase in}} blood glucose levels. It also resulted in an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of homocysteine and cardiac damage markers, like Troponin- 1, CK-MB, CK-NAC, uric acid, LDH and alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, there was an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IFN-γ, and TGF-β and decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of IL- 4 and IL- 10. Additionally, there was increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, VLDL and a decrease in HDL in these animals. There was an altered antioxidant enzyme profile which resulted in a notable increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of oxidative stress markers like lipid peroxides, nitric oxide and carbonylated proteins. Compared with the untreated diabetic rats, AZL treatment significantly reduced <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of troponin- 1 (P Conclusion Our results indicate that AZL treatment can reduce the risk of hyperglycemia induced metabolic disorders and its role can be further extended to explore its therapeutic potential in diabetic patients with cardiac complications. </p...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} statistic {{tracked by}} {{the game is}} Karma which {{is affected by the}} decisions and actions the character performs during the game. Positive actions to Karma include freeing captives and helping others, while negative actions towards this include killing good characters and stealing. Actions vary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of karma change they cause; thus, pickpocketing produces less negative karma than the killing of a good character. Karma can have tangible effects to the player, beyond acting as flavor for the game's events, in that it can affect the ending the player gets, alter dialogue with non-player characters (NPCs) or give off unique reactions from other characters, while also granting access to certain perks that require a specific Karma level. However, the player's relationships with the game's factions are distinct, so any two groups or settlements may view the player in contrasting ways, depending on the player's conduct.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report the}} effects of 2 regimens of hormone {{replacement}} therapy during the postmenopausal period on {{the profile of the}} major lipoprotein subfractions (HDL, LDL, and VLDL). METHODS: We carried out a cohort study in 38 postmenopausal patients who were starting their hormone replacement therapy due to gynecological indications, for a period of 12 weeks. Analysis of lipoprotein subclasses was performed through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: Hormone replacement therapy cause an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of larger subfractions of VLDL and HDL (p= 0. 008 and 0. 03, respectively) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of larger particles of VLDL due to a 36 % increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of larger particles (p= 0. 004), concomitantly with a 15 % reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of smaller particles (p= 0. 04). In regard to HDL, the increase occurred only a 17 % increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of larger particles (p= 0. 002). No significant change occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution pattern of LDL subfractions. CONCLUSION: The proportion of larger subfractions of VLDL and HDL increases after hormone replacement therapy. <b>The</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of larger particles of VLDL occurs due to an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>the</b> larger subclasses concomitantly with a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> smaller particles. However, an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of larger particles of HDL occurs only due to an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>the</b> larger subfractions...|$|R

On July 3, 2013, the update was released, with fifteen levels of all-new gameplay. Instead of knocking over the pigs' castles, the player's goal {{is to keep the}} pigs from stealing the egg and leaving the playing field with it. The pigs arrive in waves of complicated vehicles, and the only available bird is Red, whose new ability is to target the nearest pig. There is no score, and the three stars are awarded by completing three objectives in one try. The first objective is to finish the level without getting the egg stolen. The second is to pop all the pigs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>level.</b> The third is to use fewer than or equal to a certain number of birds to clear the level. Because some people were skeptical about the new gameplay, Rovio later announced that they would add levels to the episode based on the original level style. On September 16, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to the episode using the original style and these levels include manual targeting for Red Bird.|$|E
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava flows, vesicular lava flows, dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava flows and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present.
