25|$|The {{constitutional}} crisis of 1926 provoked {{a consideration of}} the constitutional relations between the self-governing dominions and the British government.

The independent position of the Dominions in the British Empire (later the Commonwealth) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community</b> was put on a firm foundation by the Balfour Declaration of 1926, subsequently codified in the Statute of Westminster (1931).|$|E
25|$|Since Pakistan and India {{each had}} {{weapons of mass}} destruction, many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community</b> were {{concerned}} that if the Kargil conflict intensified, it could lead to nuclear war. Both countries had tested their nuclear capability in 1998 (India conducted its first test in 1974 while it was Pakistan's first-ever nuclear test). Many pundits believed the tests to be an indication of the escalating stakes in the scenario in South Asia. When the Kargil conflict started just a year after the nuclear tests, many nations desired to end it before it intensified.|$|E
25|$|While Brazil was {{conducting}} its nuclear activities {{outside of the}} nuclear non-proliferation regime, many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community</b> doubted its stated peaceful intention.

This opinion was manifested openly and implicitly by different nations as well as the international anti-nuclear movement. The most vehement of skeptics was the U.S., with countries like France, Canada, the UK and the Soviet Union also following suit in their doubts of Brazil.|$|E

In 2006, German researchers published the results {{of one of the}} first and largest randomized controlled clinical trials.

25|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} Thomas E. Dewey, {{the governor}} of New York who {{had a reputation as}} a liberal in his party. The opposition lambasted Roosevelt and his administration for domestic corruption, bureaucratic inefficiency, tolerance of Communism, and military blunders. Labor unions, which had grown rapidly in the war, threw their all-out support behind Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Truman won the 1944 election by a comfortable margin, defeating Dewey and his running mate John W. Bricker with 53.4% of the popular vote and 432 out of the 531 electoral votes. The president campaigned in favor of a strong United Nations, so his victory symbolized support for the nation's future participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

25|$|The North Korean leaders {{understood}} {{the importance of}} sports not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community,</b> but also internally. The major ideology in North Korea, Juche, has been solidified through the Communist Party's use of sports. The North Korea regime believed that by supporting the increases in sport, the North Korean people would overall be more fit. This would allow the people to be more useful in the revolutionary struggle. For this reason, {{it was important to}} start athletics young. In fact, training in physical sport was mandatory during schooling. In the 2000s, major sporting events were being broadcast throughout North Korea, and these events are still being used as propaganda tools. Sports have played a vital role in maintaining the power of the ruling class, {{while at the same time}} offering opportunities to interact with the international community.|$|E

25|$|However, due to {{his poor}} {{performance}} in economy and diplomacy, Roh was not a popular president, having the worst approval rating on average ever recorded in South Korean political history. His economic policy was often criticized for persisting with certain obsolete economic views and failing certain livelihood issues. There had been a considerable diplomatic dissonance between South Korea and its traditional allies during Roh's presidency as well. Former Bush administration officials such as Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates, in their memoirs published, claimed that Roh was anti-American and disclosed {{that there had been}} numerous conflicts between the U.S. and South Korea because of Roh's unpredictability. There has been criticism that Roh's anti-Americanism, nationalism, and pro-North Korean views contributed to a contradiction in diplomacy and impaired credibility <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community.</b> It also led to a decline in some of his popular support, especially among the older generation.|$|E
