25|$|I cannot {{bring myself}} when I {{contemplate}} how much his influence and efficiency may be thrown away, when {{he becomes a}} prominent supporter of parliamentary reform, for from that <b>instant</b> <b>he</b> becomes the tool and slave of every worthless adventurer. He is born aristocratic, that is his station in the country; one that enables him if he acts in that sphere, to defend the rights and liberties of the people, whom he ought to consider as under his special care and guardianship.|$|E
500|$|Having {{observed}} {{the workings of}} what he thought an alarming tendency of the poetic imagination, as well as Shakespeare's possible aristocratic bias, Hazlitt then observes that, after all, traits of Coriolanus's character emerge, even in this dramatic context, that Shakespeare clearly shows {{to be less than}} admirable. For example, [...] "Coriolanus complains of the fickleness of the people: yet, the <b>instant</b> <b>he</b> cannot gratify his pride and obstinacy at their expense, he turns his arms against his own country. If his country was not worth defending, why did he build his pride in its defence?" ...|$|E
500|$|Wisden's {{obituary}} described Hammond {{as one of}} the {{top four}} batsmen who had ever played, calling him [...] "a most exciting cricketer. ... The <b>instant</b> <b>he</b> walked out of a pavilion, white-spotted blue handkerchief showing from his right pocket, bat tucked underarm, cap at a hint of an angle, he was identifiable as a thoroughbred." [...] Throughout the 1930s, the public and critics regarded Hammond as England's best batsman, succeeding Jack Hobbs, and next to Bradman, the best in the world (although George Headley also had a claim). Among English batsmen, only Herbert Sutcliffe, with a higher Test average, was similarly successful. According to Alan Gibson, however, although Sutcliffe was dependable in a crisis, [...] "his batting never gave quite the same sense of majesty and excitement that Hammond's did". More recently, Hammond w{{as one of the}} inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame, launched in January 2009, and was selected by a jury of cricket journalists as a member of England's all-time XI in August 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Captain Trotter {{reported}} {{that on the}} 18th [...] "he started on horseback {{early in the morning}} to examine some rocks up the stream." [...] He returned tired and complained of a headache. He breathed heavily and coughed all night. The native doctor diagnosed acute bronchitis and inflammation of the lungs and treated him with brandy mixed in a cough mixture. At 2 p.m. he drank some port wine and [...] "his respiration grew slower and slower, and also did his pulse, and he finally breathed his last, dying so quietly {{that it was impossible to}} say at what precise <b>instant</b> <b>he</b> passed away".|$|E
2500|$|The Glass House {{resulted}} in recognition for Johnson, {{not just in}} architectural circles, but also among the public at large. The house was featured in Life magazine, and the New York Times Magazine published a set of cartoons about it. [...] "What really sets Johnson apart [...] " [...] Michael Sorkin wrote in 1978, [...] "is his aptitude for publicity." [...] The Glass House [...] "established Johnson as the titular leader" [...] of Modernist style in 1949. [...] "If it was Mies van der Rohe who provided the real inspiration for the Glass House [...] it was only Johnson who could have built the house and lived in it himself. Johnson's career began when he turned himself into the Man in the Glass House. In an <b>instant,</b> <b>he</b> became the austere apostle for modern architecture [...] or rather the modern apostle for austere architecture." [...] As Life magazine put it in 1949: [...] "Except when entertaining, Johnson lives alone, servantless and accompanied only by weather, paintings and books." ...|$|E
2500|$|O'Hare {{was last}} seen at the 5 o'clock {{position}} of the TBF. About that time, the turret gunner of the TBF, Alvin Kernan (AOM1/c) noticed a Japanese G4M Betty bomber above and almost directly behind O'Hare's 6 o'clock position. Kernan opened fire with the TBF's [...]50-cal. machine gun in the dorsal turret and a Japanese gunner fired back. Butch O'Hare's F6F Hellcat apparently {{was caught in a}} crossfire. Seconds later Butch's F6F slid out of formation to port, pushing slightly ahead at about 160 knots and then vanished in the dark. The Avenger pilot, Lieutenant Commander Phillips, called repeatedly to O'Hare but received no reply. Ensign Skon responded: [...] "Mr. Phillips, this is Skon. I saw Mr. O'Hare's lights go out and, at the same <b>instant,</b> <b>he</b> seemed to veer off and slant down into darkness." [...] Phillips later asserted, as the Hellcat dropped out of view, it seemed to release something drop almost vertically at a speed too slow for anything but a parachute. Then something [...] "whitish-gray" [...] appeared below, perhaps the splash of the aircraft plunging into the sea.|$|E

2500|$|The preface notes Morrison's intent: [...] "The Author's object has been, and the {{intention}} of the Dictionary ought to be, to communicate the Language to Europeans." [...] Its content is wide-ranging. [...] "There are beautiful pieces of poetry, interesting and instructive portions of History and Biography; and important Moral Maxims, in Chinese that is a language amongst the most ancient and the most extensively known on earth,… it is the living language of five nations, which together, constitute one third of the mankind." [...] Wu and Zheng say, [...] "Far more than a mere dictionary of the Chinese language, Morrison's dictionary is a history book, a biography, a collection of idiomatic expressions and common sayings of the Chinese people, and, last but not least, full of the Christian evangelical message expressed in many ways." [...] , In both Part I and II , discussion of paper (...) occasions discussion of its invention by Cai Lun, although his name appears as both [...] "Tsae Lun" [...] or [...] "Tsae-lun" [...] and one entry mistakenly places him in the 10th century [...] instead of the 1st. Another example is the entry on [...] (cāi, [...] "guess; suspect"), which occasions a digression on a Chinese drinking game: [...] " [...] to guess the number of fingers thrown out, or stretched straight from a previously folded hand, which is a drunken amusement of the Chinese. When the opponent guesses the right number of fingers thrown out, at the <b>instant</b> <b>he</b> speaks, he wins, and the person throwing out his fingers has to drink as a forfeit." [...]|$|E
2500|$|... “On {{the day of}} the [...] "Big Issue", when {{thousands}} of Indians were gathered at the agency, this man Little, who had been in hiding, walked boldly among them. Of course the police would arrest him at sight, and he was led toward the guardhouse. He struggled with them, but was overpowered. A crowd of warriors rushed to his rescue, and there was confusion and a general shout of [...] "Hurry up with them! Kill them all!" [...] I saw American Horse walk out of the agent's office and calmly face the excited mob. [...] "What are you going to do?" [...] he asked. [...] "Stop, men, stop and think before you act! Will you murder your children, your women, yes, destroy your nation to-day?" [...] He stood before them like a statue and the men who held the two policemen helpless paused for an <b>instant.</b> <b>He</b> went on: [...] "You are brave today because you outnumber the white men, but what will you do tomorrow? There are railroads on all sides of you. The soldiers will pour in from every direction by thousands and surround you. You have little food or ammunition. It will be the end of your people. Stop, I say, stop now!" [...] Jack Red Cloud, son of the old chief rushed up to him and thrust a revolver almost in his face. [...] "It is you and men like you," [...] he shouted, [...] "who have reduced our race to slavery and starvation!" [...] American Horse did not flinch but deliberately reentered the office, followed by Jack still flourishing the pistol. But his timely appearance and eloquence had saved the day. Others of the police force had time to reach the spot, and with a large crowd of friendly Indians had taken command of the situation. When I went into the office I found him alone but apparently quite calm. [...] "Where are the agent and the clerks?" [...] I asked. [...] "They fled by the back door," [...] he replied, smiling. [...] "I think they are in the cellar. These fools outside had almost caught us asleep, but I think it is over now." ...|$|E
