[...] Gerrard thought that although Liverpool controlled the first half, they did not control the match as much in the second half as they would have liked. Gerrard echoed his manager's sentiments in regards to new players joining the club: [...] "We need to strengthen and bring some quality into the club. The manager and the people in charge of the club know that and it will be an interesting summer." ...|$|E
500|$|The Great Silence has {{influenced}} {{the works of}} Quentin Tarantino. Describing the film as his favorite [...] "snow Western", he has paid homage to it in Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight. Robert Richardson, the cinematographer for The Hateful Eight, noted that he and Tarantino studied The Great Silences photography to get {{an understanding of the}} intimacy Tarantino wanted to achieve in the film. Upon being asked what his favorite Western films where, he responded with [...] "I do love The Great Silence, because Quentin turned me on to it and I love the cinematic nature of that, in the snow.

500|$|Biographer Karen Hollinger {{described}} the early 1990s as {{a downturn in}} the popularity of Streep's films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious but commercially unsuccessful dramas, and more significantly {{to the lack of}} options available to an actress in her forties. Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family, a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, [...] "By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in her anymore. And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> your parts with great care." [...] At the Screen Actor's Guild National Women's Conference in 1990, Streep keynoted the first national event, emphasizing the decline in women's work opportunities, pay parity, and role models within the film industry. She criticized the film industry for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off.|$|E

[...] "If we keep producing cricketers who are 25 plus, they're mature, they're ready to play, they've still got a seven or eight-year career, then we're doing OK." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{versions}} of Bowling for Dollars awarded prizes {{in addition to}} the money. In the Detroit edition of the show, a contestant who got a spare won a dinner for two at a local restaurant. If that spare was a split, they would also get two large pies from Buddy's Pizza. If the contestant got only one strike, they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a pin from a [...] "pin board" [...] for a prize from a local jeweler; one such prize was a genuine diamond ring. Finally, if a contestant did break the jackpot, he or she got to bowl one more time, and if that was a strike (a [...] "turkey") they would receive yet another prize, such as a recliner chair or bicycle. [...] The Los Angeles version awarded a portable television set for three consecutive strikes, and a car for four.|$|E

2500|$|A further {{strategy}} {{aimed at}} diminishing the power dynamic between photographer/subject {{was to have}} each participant choose their own image, with the option of re-photographing them if they desired. [...] Fulbeck states, [...] "... every participant not only got to write their statement the way they wanted to, they also <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> their own image. A camera is a tremendously powerful tool and the power dynamic between photographer and subject is palpable. For this reason, I wanted to give some of the power back to the subjects. It {{was never going to}} be completely democratic – it is, after all, my concept, my project, and my design – but there are some strategies you can employ to make it less unilateral. Everyone got to see their image and choose to keep it or erase it and shoot again." [...] One participant was re-photographed 27 times.|$|E

2500|$|McLaren's absence was {{formally}} registered at 4:00am (local time) and sparked a massive manhunt that drew in friendly forces {{from outside of}} the UK military sphere.

We must bring your clothes all out here and lay them on the bed, and see. That dress-suit may turn up yet. You probably thought {{it was something like}} an ulster.

60|$|MRS TARLETON. Well, no, {{not afraid}} of them, exactly; but youve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up their ways. You know, dear, I never quite agreed with your father's notion of keeping clear of them, and sending you to a school that was so {{expensive}} that they couldnt afford to send their daughters there; {{so that all the}} girls belonged to big business families like ourselves. It takes all sorts to make a world; and I wanted you to see a little of all sorts. When you marry Bunny, and go among the women of his father's set, theyll shock you at first.|$|E

Of course there are men here and there to whom the whole of life is like an after-dinner hour with a cigar; easy, pleasant, empty, perhaps enlivened by some fable of strife to be forgotten before the end is told--before the end is told--even if there happens to be any end to it.|$|E

At age 13, they moved to Arlington, where Kudla was set to matriculate at Washington-Lee High School. But six hours of court time each day left no room for traditional high school, so starting in ninth grade, he was home-schooled at JTCC and had to commute on his own to practice in College Park via Metro, lugging two racket bags and changing trains twice during rush hour. [...] "My parents were strict, but not crazy strict. I was never spoiled. I wanted tennis. It was always my dream."

He gave me a passage across, and took me to the house of a man he knew. Of course, it was no use my trying to doctor people, when they could not tell me what was the matter with them, and I worked at one thing and another, doing {{anything}} I could turn my hands to, for four or five months. That is how I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up Swedish. Then some people told me that Russia was a place where a doctor might get on, for that they had got no doctors for their army who knew anything of surgery, and the czar was always ready to take on foreigners who could teach them anything. I had got my diploma with me, and some of my friends came forward and subscribed enough to rig me out in clothes and pay my passage. What was better, one of them happened to have made the acquaintance of Le Ford, who was, as you may have heard, the czar's most intimate friend.|$|E

I will tell you what I would rather do, and that is, pick up green hands from the east. There are scores of them here now; men who have come as far as this, and can't start west till the snows melt. You need not think {{anything}} more about the money. You tell me what you crushed is a fair sample of that five hundred pounds, and that is quite good enough for me, and the gravel being so rich is another proof of what the lode was when the stream cut through it. I can put the twenty-five thousand dollars down, {{and there are plenty of}} men here who will take my word for the affair and plank their money down too. If there weren't I would put a mortgage on my houses, so that matter is done. To-morrow I will get the men whose names you are to give in for a claim each; it will be time in another two months to begin to look about for some steady chaps from the east, farmers' sons and such like.
