2500|$|While the European Economic Community {{originally}} {{focused on}} free movement, and dismantling barriers to trade, more EU law today concerns {{regulation of the}} [...] "social market economy". In 1976 the Court of Justice said in Defrenne v Sabena the goal was [...] "not merely an economic union", but to [...] "ensure social progress and seek the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their peoples". On this view, stakeholders in each member state might not {{have the capacity to}} take advantage of expanding trade in a globalising economy. Groups with greater bargaining power can exploit weaker legal rights in other member states. For example, a corporation could shift production to member states with a lower minimum wage, to increase shareholder profit, even if production costs more and workers are paid less. This would mean an aggregate loss of social wealth, and a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] in human development. To make globalisation fair, the EU establishes a minimum floor of rights for the stakeholders in enterprise: for consumers, workers, investors, shareholders, creditors, and the public. Each field of law is vast, so EU law is designed to be subsidiary to comprehensive rules in each member state. Member states go beyond the harmonised minimum, acting as [...] "laboratories of democracy". EU law makes basic standards of [...] "exit" [...] (where markets operate), rights (enforceable in court), and [...] "voice" [...] (especially through votes) in enterprise. Rules of competition law balance the interests of different groups, generally to favour consumers, for the larger purpose in the Treaty on European Union article 3(3) of a [...] "highly competitive social market economy". The EU is bound by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 345 to [...] "in no way prejudice the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership". This means the EU is bound to be neutral to member state's choice to take enterprises into public ownership, or to privatise them. While there have been academic proposals for a <b>European</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Code,</b> and projects to frame non-binding principles of contract and tort, harmonisation has only occurred for conflict of laws and intellectual property.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{a unified}} <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> {{can be traced to}} the {{idea of a}} unified Europe and the {{creation}} of the European Union. The European Parliament requested the creation of a <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> in 1989, 1994 and 2000. A pragmatic approach has seen the proponents of a <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> develop uniform laws in discrete areas before working towards a comprehensive <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} aim of a <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> is, like {{a national}} civil code, to deal comprehensively with the core areas of private law. Private law typically {{covered in a}} civil code includes the family law, the law of inheritance, property law and the Law of Obligations. The law of obligations includes the law of contracts, delicts (or torts) and restitution. It was from work on European contract law that the push for a comprehensive <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> arose. The development of a <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> has primarily focused on creating a unified law of contracts. Thus <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> is often used in specific reference to the harmonisation of contract law throughout the EU.|$|E

40|$|Change of circumstancies is an {{important}} institution in modern contract law. In Roman law, this institution had not been constructed systematically, but the jurists took into consideration the distribution of risk of impossibility of performance of contracts caused by unforeseen events according to different types of contract, customs, bona fides, and unjust enrichment, and provided pluralistic remedies including renegotiation, partial remissions of debts and unilateral dissolution of contract. Based on Roman law, medieval jurists had formed an abstract theory of clause rebus sic stantibus. Since legal humanistic and liberal natural law schools jurists {{had to face the}} fight between this clause and the principle pacta sunt servanda. This explains why the clause rebus sic stantibus was not normally included in modern <b>European</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>codes</b> and it entered into them little by little by way of doctrines and cases. Only in recent times many <b>European</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>codes</b> have expressly regulated the change of circumstancies and this is the trend also of the European private law.

25|$|Portugal's <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> {{had been}} a chaotic and uncompiled system of laws since the Philippine Dynasty, and many {{realized}} that it required reform. Since early attempts to rationalize these laws failed, and a unified code based on the French <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> was disavowed in 1820, the Portuguese courts continued to function using the Ordenações Filipinas of 1603, which amounted to a simplified reform of the Manueline codes of 1521. A book of commentary on Portuguese law, A Propriedade: Filosofia do Direito (Property: Philosophy of Law), written by Judge António Luís de Seabra and published in 1850, was adapted in 1867 as the new Portuguese <b>Civil</b> <b>Code.</b> It was unique among <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>codes</b> in its characterization {{of the law in}} terms of person and property; it was divided into four sections: the person, property, the acquisition of property, and the defense of that property considered as legal rights.

40|$|The author {{analyses}} {{the legal}} {{treatment of the}} penalty clause into Spanish Civil Law, with {{special attention to the}} regulation offered by the <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> in their articles 1152 to 1155, the differents functions which the penalty clause achieves and the differentiated regulation into Fuero Nuevo of Navarra in the Lex 518. All of this {{can be seen as a}} reflection of the dualism in Spanish Legal System between the Common Civil Law (represented by the Spanish <b>Civil</b> <b>Code)</b> and the Foral or Special Law (represented by differents regionals compilations). The regulation of the Spanish <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> sets as general rule the contractual penalty as substitute of the regime of compensation into the article 1101 of spanish <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> in case of breach of contract or in case of defective or untimely performance by the debtor. This provision allows to the creditor to avoid a real damage assessment, so that the penalty clause lets a advanced estimate of damages without needing to prove them. But also admits the regulation of the penalty clause into the spanish <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> other functions, for instance the cumulative penalty (with the legal and previously valued compensation of damages or with the specific performance). This regulation, unchanged since the enactment of the spanish <b>Civil</b> <b>Code,</b> has been object of special attention by the preliminary draft to modernisation of the law of obligations drawn up by the Commission of Codification of the Ministry of Justice in 2009, picking up some of the guidelines present in other <b>European</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Codes</b> as well as in the contributions of prestigiouses scholars, which are expression of the effort aimed at the harmonisation of European Contract Law...|$|R
40|$|Contractual {{liability}} is {{an important}} topic of the ongoing reform of the effective Serbian Law on Obligations (2007 - 2009), which aims to harmonize the national legislation in this field with {{the laws of the}} European Union. In this paper the author analyzes the evolution of the traditional <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>codes</b> (the German BGB, French <b>Code</b> <b>civil,</b> the Austrian ABGB the Swiss OR and the Hungarian <b>Civil</b> <b>Code),</b> with due attention to the doctrine and jurisprudence, taking into account the proposed reforms of the effective Serbian Law on Obligations concerning issues of contractual liability, such as the legal consequences of nonperformance, misperformance, default, etc. The author is of the opinion that the notion of the breach of contract doesn't cover all the cases in which contractual liability arises, although it embraces nonperformance, misperformance and default. The notion of contractual liability, namely, covers not only the cases of breach of contract, but the infringement of public policy, good morals and mandatory rules, which all lead to the nullity of the contract. In cases of voidable contracts (that is in case of defects of contractual will, such as mistake, deceit and duress) it is questionable whether the scope of contractual liability should be extended to mistake, which is a case of nonconscious discrepancy between contractual will and its expression. It is undisputable that contractual liability arises in case of deceit and duress, to the burden of the party acting in bad faith. The rescission of contract entails a separate complex of legal issues, since it may be justified by the other party's breach of the contract. It can also be onesided, two-sided or by a mutual agreement. Furthermore, specific rules apply to rescission of contract due to changed circumstances. In case of termination of a contract by mutual agreement, the parties usually agree on the extent of liability, that is on the extent of indemnification. Contractual liability is also specific that, according to the principle of parties' autonomy, the parties always may in advance agree on the extent of damages for the case of breach of contract, in a form of a clause on liquidated damages, forfeit money, suretyship for indemnification, the limitation of the sum insured in insurance contracts, clauses in the general conditions of business, etc. The author calls {{attention to the fact that}} these clauses in certain extent limit the scope of the indemnification for breach of a contract, according to which this liability differs from the liability for torts, where the principle of full indemnification applies as a rule...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author gives an {{overview}} of the emergence and evolution of the idea of discharge or modification of contract due to supervening events, from Roman to contemporary law, with special emphasis on the evolution of the doctrine and its development as a legal institution in the European legislation or case law. The institution of changed circumstances (supervening events) allows the discharge or (judicial) modification of a contract in a situation when the performance of an obligation has not become impossible, but it would require unreasonable costs or the performance would be inexpedient, hence it {{is considered one of the}} most striking exceptions to the principle of pacta sunt servanda. It belongs to the group of a very few institutions in relation to which one cannot claim to have direct and clear roots in Roman law. In the works of learned lawyers one may find only sporadic traces of it. In contrast to Roman legal science, Roman philosophy was more favourable to the theory of supervening events, a fact very well proven by the works of Cicero and Seneca. In the late Middle Ages the canonists and, especially, postglossators gave the greatest contribution to the evolution of the theory of supervening events. The school of postglossators considered supervening events a general legal institution, tacitly implied in every legal statement constituting obligation. The ideas of postglossators left a great impact on further evolution of the theory. Even the designation of the institution, clausula rebus sic stantibus, generally accepted in contemporary literature, derives from them. In the period following the postglossators' time, lasting until the end of the 18 th century, there is still an interest in the theory of supervening events in literature. However, under the influence of the school of natural law a somewhat restrictive approach is adopted, in the German doctrine in the first place, according to which the clausula rebus sic stantibus should not be implied in all contracts, but applied exceptionally, if specific conditions are met. The first <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>codes,</b> the Bavarian, Prussian and Austrian, do regulate the effect of supervening events explicitly, in content which is, in general, in line with these theoretical standpoints. It seems that in the 19 th century legal science nearly abandoned the idea of supervening events, which could be considered as a consequence of the inviolable primacy of the tenet of pacta sunt servanda, at the time. In line with that, the most important <b>civil</b> <b>codes</b> of this era, such as the French, German and Swiss did not govern the effect of supervening events as a general legal institution. The institution of supervening events is gradually accepted in the case law after the First World War, while the period after the Second World War is heralded by the tendency of its statutory regulation. The ever-growing number of states that regulated supervening events as a general legal institution of contract law included the former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, too, as well as the Republic of Serbia and the other states that were once members of the common, South Slavic federal state...|$|R
