5|$|Rumours {{circulated}} {{of a brain}} haemorrhage, {{followed by}} competing reports {{that he had been}} mugged and even that he had drunk <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Later, there was speculation about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death– pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite his heavy drinking his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Pausanias {{returned}} to Byzantium {{as a private}} citizen in 477 BC, and took command of the city until he was expelled by the Athenians. He then crossed the Bosporus and settled in Kolonai in the Troad, until he was again accused of collaborating with the Persians and was recalled by the Spartans for a trial after which he starved <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> The timescale is unclear, but Pausanias may have remained in possession of Byzantium until 470 BC.|$|E
5|$|The other {{theory to}} gain support {{was that it}} was viral {{marketing}} to promote an upcoming movie or video game. A Redditor noted that the film version of Dan Brown's novel Inferno was beginning production at that time for a late 2016 release. In the story, a rich villain makes a video warning of his plans to release a virus in order to reduce population growth. In it he also wears a plague doctor costume, likens <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> and claims {{at the same time to}} be the cure.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{testifying before}} the grand jury, Dworkin left Bennington on the liner Castel Felice to live in Greece and to pursue her writing. She {{traveled}} from Paris to Athens on the Orient Express, and went to live and write in Crete. While in Crete, she wrote a series of poems titled (Vietnam) Variations, a collection of poems and prose poems that she printed on the island in a book called Child, and a novel in a style resembling magical realism called Notes on Burning Boyfriend—a reference to the pacifist Norman Morrison, who had burned <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> in protest of the Vietnam War. She also wrote several poems and dialogues which she hand-printed after returning to the United States in a book called Morning Hair.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the writers}} who {{fell victim to}} the regime of Sejanus and its aftermath, were the historians Aulus Cremutius Cordus and Velleius Paterculus and the poet Phaedrus. Cordus was brought to trial in AD 25 by Sejanus, under accusations of treason. He was charged for having eulogized Marcus Junius Brutus and spoken of Gaius Cassius Longinus {{as the last of}} the true Romans, which was {{considered}} an offence under the Lex Maiestatis; the Senate ordered the burning of his writings. His fall is elaborated upon by Seneca the Younger, in his letter to Cordus' daughter Marcia To Marcia, On Consolation. Seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising him because he had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source that Cordus starved <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Marcia was instrumental in saving her father's work so that it could be published again under Caligula.|$|E
5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur, Ivy {{was raised by}} the Valentines, a noble family in London, England. Ivy's father became obsessed with the cursed sword Soul Edge, and worked <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Her mother died shortly afterward, and revealed to Ivy {{that she was not}} their biological daughter. Becoming an alchemist, Ivy learned of her father's obsession and decided to destroy Soul Edge. She created an animated, segmented sword, bringing it to life by unknowingly summoning Soul Edge's current host, Nightmare, and was convinced to become one of his servants without realizing he wielded the blade she sought. After learning the truth, and that her real father was the sword's previous host Cervantes and her to be its next, she departed. Continuing her quest to destroy the sword in later games, Ivy was attacked by Cervantes and her soul consumed in Soulcalibur IV. Using an artificial soul to keep herself alive, she acts as a teacher to younger warriors when the sword re-appears years later.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the shock}} of the Western public, the {{practice}} of Vietnamese monks self-immolating was not unprecedented. Instances of self-immolations in Vietnam had been recorded for centuries, usually carried out to honor Gautama Buddha. The most recently recorded case had been in North Vietnam in 1950. The French colonial authorities had tried to eradicate the practice after their conquest of Vietnam in the nineteenth century, but had not been totally successful. They did manage to prevent one monk from setting fire to himself in Huế in the 1920s, but he managed to starve <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> instead. During the 1920s and 1930s, Saigon newspapers reported multiple instances of self-immolations by monks in a matter-of-fact style. The practice had also been seen in the Chinese city of Harbin in 1948 when a monk seated down in the lotus position on a pile of sawdust and soybean oil and set fire to himself in protest against the treatment of Buddhism by the communists of Mao Zedong. His heart remained intact, as did that of Đức.|$|E

25|$|On December 28, 1930, when Welles was 15, {{his father}} died of heart and kidney failure {{at the age of}} 58, alone in a hotel in Chicago. Shortly before this, Welles had {{announced}} to his father that he would stop seeing him, believing it would prompt his father to refrain from drinking.
