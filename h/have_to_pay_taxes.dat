It was rebuilt and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, the miller did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> for the next 15 years. In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance from the States General after the miller requested assistance. The mill was rebuilt {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ian Maxtone-Graham, though the {{original}} draft of the plot was much different. Originally, Homer was to learn {{that he was a}} Native American, and would try to exploit it to not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes.</b> The idea had been going well for a few days, but the staff did not actually know whether Native Americans had to pay taxes. When the writers found out that they did, the whole plot had to be scrapped. Executive producer Mike Scully's brother Brian pitched the idea of the trillion-dollar bill, which they accepted, as they were out of ideas.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, she pointed out that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should no longer <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes.</b> She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, willing, and able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing.|$|E

25|$|After several years, a {{deal was}} finally reached, and PennDOT {{acquired}} the necessary land via eminent domain to straighten the road. Homeowners near the campus {{as well as}} a local car wash sold their property to PennDOT for the new right-of-way, which in itself caused controversy.

25|$|The {{site of the}} Cira Centre sits {{within a}} Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). A KOZ was {{designed}} to encourage development in poor and blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from almost all state and local taxes. In 2002 the Center City office vacancy rate was 12.5 percent and numerous businesses leases were set to expire in 2005 and 2006. Owners of other buildings were critical of having the KOZ for the Cira Centre and the proposed KOZ designation for the Comcast Center, another office high-rise being planned. The landlords were afraid that the tax breaks for the new skyscrapers would attract their existing tenants to the new buildings. On December 24, 2003 Brandywine Realty Trust announced the first tenants to lease room in the Cira Centre. Brandywine Realty Trust signed leases with Dechert LLP, Woodcock Washburn LLP, and Attalus Capital. Dechert LLP and Woodcock Washburn LLP were moving from other city skyscrapers, the Bell Atlantic Tower and One Liberty Place respectively. Attalus Capital was moving its offices from Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Dechert and Woodcock Washburn moving to the Cira Centre fueled the KOZ controversy because Dechert and Woodcock Washburn were wealthy law firms and would no longer <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> for numerous years. By 2006, about 60 percent of Cira Centre's tenants came from within Philadelphia.|$|E

2500|$|In Anhui, Wan Li was {{responsible}} for the earliest post-Mao agrarian reform. [...] He instituted the household-responsibility system whereby farmers divided communal lands and assigned them to individual farmers. [...] However, Wan faced resistance from conservatives in Beijing who criticized his reforms as not sufficiently socialist or ineffective. [...] However, Wan pressed on with the reforms anyway. [...] His six guidelines (the Anhui liu tiao) relaxed controls on trading as well, permitting farmers to sell surplus produce independently. Peasants were allowed to grow vegetables on 3/10th of a mu and did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> on wheat and oil-bearing plants grown on private plots.|$|E

Developers do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> on the increased value of the property {{for the duration of the}} abatement period, with a phase out period in which the tax benefit is gradually reduced over years. The lost property taxes would otherwise go to the city government as property tax revenue.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1947 season, Breadon {{decided to}} sell the team. He had still been unable to find land for his planned stadium, and was facing the {{prospect}} of having to pay taxes on his stadium fund. However, he would have likely had to sell the team in any event, as he had learned he had terminal prostate cancer. When local tax attorney and real estate investor Fred Saigh got word that the Cardinals were on the market, he met with Breadon and he made an unusual proposal: if Breadon sold him the team, he would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> on his stadium fund. To ease his initial reluctance to make the deal, Saigh brought in former Postmaster General of the United States Robert E. Hannegan as a partner. In late 1947, Breadon sold the club to Saigh and Hannigan for $4 million. In addition to winning six World Series and nine NL pennants, Breadon also had the highest regular season winning percentage of any owner in franchise history at [...]570. His teams totaled 2,470 wins and 1,830 losses.|$|E

Other police included were [...] Adams negotiated an agreement with Rizzo when he was hired in 2009 that stipulated that he suffered from back, knee and neck injuries and that the city would support his application for a disability pension (Liz O. Baylen, Los Angeles Times). Prosecutors filed suit regarding an agreement with Rizzo, Adams had himself declared disabled the day of his being hired in Bell. The disability status stands to net Adams millions of tax-free pension dollars at taxpayers’ expense. Under the agreement, the 59-year-old Adams would receive a lifetime disability benefit whenever he was ready to retire, meaning he would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> on half of his $400,000-plus annual pension. His Bell retirement would be the third-richest in the state's huge pension system. [...] The state attorney filed suit against Adams and Bell following that report on his [...] "disability". [...] "You're only supposed to receive a disability retirement if you are disabled and unable to perform the normal duties of your job," [...] said California Public Employees' Retirement System spokesman Ed Fong. [...] "If that is not the case, it would be fraud." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{cannot be}} too clearly understood, that, when the Zulus laid {{down their arms}} they did so, hoping and believing {{that they would be}} taken over by the English Government, which, having been fairly beaten by it, they now looked on as their head or king, and be ruled like their brethren in Natal. They {{expected}} to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> and to have white magistrates placed over them, and they or the bulk of them looked forward to the change with pleasure. It must be remembered that when once they have found their master, there exists no more law-abiding people in the world than the Zulus, provided they are ruled firmly, and above all justly. Believing that such a rule would fall to their lot they surrendered when they did. How great, then, must their surprise have been when they found, that without their wishes being consulted in the matter, their own hereditary king was to be sent away, and thirteen little kings set up in his place, with, strangest of all, a white man as chief little king, whilst the British Government contented itself with placing a Resident in the country, to watch the troubles that must ensue.|$|E

We are free ourselves, and our sympathies are with all men who are {{struggling}} to be free; but we have no idea of conquest here, and were Peru to offer to come under our rule we should not accept it. We have already wide possessions in North America and elsewhere, and need no further territories, especially in a climate that is unfitted for us. We might rule it as we do India, but the Peruvians would never be contented, and we should never attempt to keep them in subjection did they wish us gone. India, the country you speak of, is inhabited by many races and religions. Before we went, there were incessant wars, and were we to leave they would at once recommence. The people, then, feel that our rule is a real benefit, and that they are far happier under it than they were under their native rulers. When we went there we had no thought of conquering it; we only went there to trade. It was because we were attacked that we defended ourselves, and there are still portions of the country that are altogether independent, and so long as the native sovereigns leave us alone we are well contented that things should remain as they are. We do not enrich ourselves {{at the expense of the}} natives. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> to keep up the expenses of the army and administration there, but England draws no revenue from India. It does not, as Spain did, enrich itself with the plunder of the land; and it is free to people of all nations to trade there as we do ourselves. Individuals may gain wealth there by commerce, or by the growth of indigo and other things that we cannot raise at home, but as a nation we obtain no revenue whatever from India. The army there is for the most part raised from the people, who are free to enlist or not as they please, and who fight as faithfully for us as they would have done for their own rulers.” ...|$|E
