40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to quantify a measure of balance in a group of elderly individuals and to compare these measurements in relation to the age, gender and level of participation in physical exercise of these subjects. Forty-four subjects between the ages of 40 and 80 years walked at their natural cadence across a force platform while simultaneously being videotaped. Ten trials were performed by each subject. The data from five trials acquired during the stance phase of level walking were used to solve the inverse dynamics problem of determining the moments of force at the ankle, knee and hip joints of the support leg. An Analysis of Variance design was used to compare the peak moments of force at each joint during the period in which the muscle groups at each joint are contributing to the support of the body. The older subjects and the female subjects tended to produce smaller ankle <b>joint</b> <b>moments</b> (p 3 ̆c. 01) than their younger and male counterparts, respectively, during the push-off phase of walking. The older subjects also tended to produce smaller knee <b>joint</b> <b>moments</b> (p =. 07) during weight acceptance, and the hip <b>joint</b> <b>moments</b> appeared to be more affected by the activity level of the subject, also during weight acceptance, with smaller hip <b>joint</b> <b>moments</b> in the non-active group (p 3 ̆c. 02).

Recently, electromyography-assisted optimization (EAO) was reported to predict appropriate muscle forces. This paper calculated <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> of antagonistic muscles across three joints of the lower leg during gait, using muscle forces predicted by EAO. Five male subjects walked freely five times. The model we used had three joints and eleven muscles of the lower leg in the sagittal plane. Electrodes were placed on eight muscles. Results showed that about 2 ～ 4. 8 Nm <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> of antagonists were observed from mid stance to swing phase {{in the case of the}} hip.

Gait velocity is further known to affect <b>joint</b> <b>moments</b> and foot pressures.

MethodsTwenty healthy young adults had to cross an 8 m walkway with a walking speed of 1. 3 ms− 1. The wooden walkway was equipped with a force and a pressure platform. While walking speed was kept constant each participant walked with five different imposed stride lengths (SL) : preferred (SL 0); with a decrease of 10 % (SL− 10); with a decrease of 20 % (SL− 20); with an increase of 10 % (SL+ 10) and with an increase of 20 % (SF+ 20).

40|$|Abstract Background A sit-to-stand (STS) {{movement}} requires {{muscle strength}} {{higher than that}} of other daily activities. There are many elderly people, who experience difficulty when standing up from a chair. The muscle strength required (or the load on the joints) during a STS task is determined by the kinematics (movement pattern). The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the kinematics and resultant joint moments of people standing up from a chair in order to determine the minimum peak joint moments required for a STS task. Methods This study consisted of three steps. In the first step, kinematic data of lower extremity joint angles (hip, knee and ankle) during STS movements were experimentally collected from human subjects. Eighty-five sets of STS kinematic data were obtained. In the second step, the experimentally collected kinematic data and a link segment model of the human body were used to generate more than 5, 000, 000 computed STS movements. In the third step, using inverse dynamics method, joint moments of the lower extremity were calculated for all movements obtained through the preceding steps. From the outputs of the third step, the optimal kinematics (movement pattern) in terms of minimized peak <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> for the hip, knee and ankle was determined. Results The peak hip <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> ranged from 0. 24 to 1. 92 N. m/kg. The peak knee <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> ranged from 0. 51 to 1. 97 N. m/kg, and the peak ankle <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> ranged from - 0. 11 to 1. 32 N. m/kg. The optimal movement patterns differed depending on which minimized <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> index was selected (hip, knee or ankle). However, the sum of the peak hip <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> and peak knee <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> was always approximately 1. 53 N. m/kg regardless of which minimized <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> index was selected. Conclusion The most important finding of this study was that the relation between the peak joint moments at the hip and knee joints was complementary and the sum of those moments needed to be greater than 1. 53 N. m/kg in order to perform a successful STS. A combined hip-knee value of 1. 5 N. m/kg or lower may indicate the need for physical rehabilitation and/or exercise to increase muscular force. </p...|$|E

Second, the subjects performed six 8 -s maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) before repeating the passive and active trials. Although there was no decrease in isometric <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> after MVICs, peak concentric moment was significantly reduced (11. 5 %, P < 0. 01). This was accompanied by, and correlated with (r = 0. 90, P < 0. 01), significant reductions in peak triceps surae electromyographic amplitude (21. 0 %, P < 0. 01). Achilles tendon stiffness (10. 9 %, P < 0. 01) and passive <b>joint</b> <b>moment</b> (4. 9 %, P < 0. 01) were also significantly reduced.
