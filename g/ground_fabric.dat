5000|$|A {{variant of}} the static spark hypothesis, {{presented}} by Addison Bain, is that a spark between inadequately <b>grounded</b> <b>fabric</b> cover segments of the Hindenburg itself started the fire, and that the spark had ignited the [...] "highly flammable" [...] outer skin. The Hindenburg had a cotton skin covered with a finish known as [...] "dope". It is a common term for a plasticised lacquer that provides stiffness, protection, and a lightweight, airtight seal to woven fabrics. In its liquid forms, dope is highly flammable, but the flammability of dry dope depends upon its base constituents, with, for example, butyrate dope being far less flammable than cellulose nitrate. Proponents of this hypothesis claim that when the mooring line touched the ground, a resulting spark could have ignited the dope in the skin.|$|R

Preparation (set up) is done by pulling at the fabric of the floor and fixes the fabric to pin multiple times at a certain distance. From this background, this study aims to evaluate the work set up drying on the grounding {{to reduce the risk of}} injury or operator fatigue and how to reduce product defects that occur. The next goal is to repair the fabric drying remove the grounding process. The method used to meet the goals of this research is the Nordic Body Map method used to determine the complaints experienced by the operator by means of interviewing the operator about any posture that have complaints. Making the design tools is also proposed in an effort to make improvements to the drying <b>fabric</b> <b>grounding</b> process results. In order to know the criteria for tools that can meet the needs of the operator by using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) / House of Quality (HOQ) and anthropometric data. The tools are made to reduce the activity of the operator bent when performing the drying process. These do not need to lift the <b>fabric</b> from the <b>grounding</b> process to the drying process. The proposed tool also reduces the fabric touching the floor, so that the fabric does not become dirty, which is one form of disability.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{innovative}} lightweight materials are rapidly {{increased in the}} recent years, owing to their cost-effective, high-strength, environmentally-sound use of materials and process technologies, {{in addition to that}} they reduce the weight of a product. The characteristics of 3 D-spacer fabrics {{as one of the most}} important lightweight materials in future are multifaceted not only owing to its extremely light materials, but also because of exceptionally high stiffness to weight ratio compared to other constructions. It is also one possible method for improving the properties of fabric-reinforced composites. It can enhance the through-the-thickness properties, such as shear strength, dimensional stability, damage, tolerance, and fracture toughness that are critical for many structural applications. Spacer fabric has been employed in high-technology applications because of its critical mechanical properties related to high tensile strength, tear strength and stiffness. Furthermore, its multidirectional structures allow with more reinforcement along the thickness direction leading to an increase in stiffness and strength properties. The fundamental aim of this thesis exists in the development of a new kind of woven spacer fabrics for the light weight composites materials, in an effort to weave spacer fabrics that can not be realized with the old technology which are mentioned above. Therefore, the work in brief focuses on two main goals: 1. Development of a new kind of spacer fabrics for composites in the lightweight constructions. 2. Development of special devices of a narrow weaving machine for standing the process of the new kind of spacer fabrics production. The slippage strength test had to be carried out for the floated warp yarns through the <b>ground</b> <b>fabrics</b> by using different elements of woven fabric structures variables represented in different fabric constructions, different weft densities and different repeats of constructions by using different materials. The importance of this test related to the backward-movement of the floated warp yarns which is the crucial stage in the weaving process of spacer fabrics during the backward-movement. The results of this test determine the required forces for the backward-movement, on the other side it is the best method to observe the behavior of structure elements during the backward movement. The results of the slippage strength had been statistically analyzed, and the weaving process for the spacer fabrics had been achieved. It was concluded that the best properties for the woven spacer fabrics and the optimum case for the weaving process on the test weaving machine had been achieved when the following items are realized: Development of the narrow weaving machine is closed in assisting operations, let-off and take-up and enhancement for take-up processes. Extra let-off and take-up devices must be constructed at the weaving machine. Extra let-off device has to be used for controlling the floated warp yarns of <b>ground</b> <b>fabrics.</b> On the other side, extra take-up and the developed take-up devices have to be used for controlling the woven spacer fabrics. The experimental results give fundamental knowledges for the next steps in research and development of woven spacer fabrics made of high-performance yarns on the wide weaving machine. Die Ziele der Arbeit bestanden in der Entwicklung der Geometrie der Spacer Fabrics und der notwendigen Falteneinrichtung an der Bandwebmaschine. Spacer Fabrics werden ausschließlich aus zwei Deckflächen, die durch eingewebte Stege verbunden sind, gefertigt. Zur Entwicklung der Spacer Fabrics muss eine Doppelnadel-Bandwebmaschine mit zwei Webfächern eingesetzt werden. Für die Faltenwebeinrichtung werden der entwickelte Extra-Kettablass und der Extra-Abzug benötigt. Der Antrieb und die Steuerung des Extra-Abzuges erfolgen durch einen Synchronantrieb und der Antrieb und die Steuerung des Extra-Ablasses durch Pneumatik. Eine frei programmierbare Steuerung der Faltenwebeinrichtung ermöglicht eine sichere und optimierte Synchronisation zwischen Webprozess und Faltenbildung. Im Ergebnis einer systematischen Strukturentwicklung von Spacer Fabrics und der Simulation ihrer günstigen Herstellung mittles eines speziell entwickelten Slippage Strength Tests werden die optimalen Strukturen ermittelt.

40|$|Among the {{earliest}} collections of suzani in the United States is that acquired by Doris Duke, kept at Shangri La, the home she built in Honolulu. Nine of the suzani she purchased in India while on her honeymoon in 1935. In January 2005 the Shangri La Suzani Research Project initiated {{a collaborative effort}} to document Duke 2 ̆ 7 s collection with respect to materials, stitches, designs, patterns, colors, and <b>ground</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Suzanis represent an urban embroidery tradition in the 19 th century and perhaps earlier; they are worked by young women of Uzbekistan and neighboring regions in Central Asia. Bright and colorful, they are large in contrast to most domestic embroidery work. They are used as hangings and covers, often initially for the household of a bride. With the collaboration of a curator, textile conservator, and technical assistant, three pairs of eyes all trained to look differently yielded a collective understanding that affected our vision and led to an analysis that distinguishes our work from that of others who preceded us {{in the study of}} suzanis. We began to recognize that variations in stitch type, size, placement, orientation and density, combine to play with effects of light. We came to understand that catching the light is clearly an intention of the design and construction. During the course of our analysis and documentation, we came to appreciate aspects of this needle craft that exhibit a clear articulation of the relationship of symmetry and beauty. While the stitching in each object was consistent, what particularly distinguishes the group is the careful attention to both symmetry and symmetry-breaking, and to contrasting patterns of local symmetries and global symmetries to create differing visual effects. This paper presents the suzanis of Doris Duke 2 ̆ 7 s collection, focusing on the playfulness in catching the light through the use of stitch, and joyfulness in the visual expression of beauty through the play of symmetry and symmetry-breaking...|$|R

If the diffuse surface is colored, the reflected light is also colored, resulting in similar coloration of surrounding objects.|$|R
50|$|Broderie perse can be {{done with}} any printed fabric on any ground, but it {{originally}} was worked with Chintz type fabrics. Chintz typically has clearly defined, separated motifs, which were cut out and invisibly applied onto the <b>ground</b> <b>fabric.</b> The typical intention was to create a scene from the motifs, but the decoration could also be random. The resulting fabric was often made into bedspreads, either unlined for summer or quilted for winter. They were typically saved for special occasions, such as guest beds.|$|E
50|$|Appliqué is {{a sewing}} {{technique}} where an upper layer of fabric is sewn onto a <b>ground</b> <b>fabric.</b> The upper, applied fabric shape {{can be of}} any shape or contour. There are several different appliqué techniques and styles. In needle-turn appliqué, the raw edges of the appliquéd fabric are tucked beneath the design to minimize raveling or damage, and small hand stitches are made to secure down the design. The stitches are made with a hem stitch, so that the thread securing the fabric is minimally visible {{from the front of}} the work. There are other methods to secure the raw edge of the appliquéd fabric, and some people use basting stitches, fabric-safe glue, freezer paper, paper forms, or starching techniques to prepare the fabric that will be applied, prior to sewing it on. Supporting paper or other materials are typically removed after the sewing is complete. The <b>ground</b> <b>fabric</b> is often cut away from behind, after the sewing is complete, in order to minimize the bulk of the fabric in that region. A special form of appliqué is Broderie perse, which involves the appliqué of specific motifs that have been selected from a printed fabric. For example, a series of flower designs might be cut out of one fabric with a vine design, rearranged, and sewn down on a new fabric to create the image of a rose bush.|$|E

50|$|A scroll frame or {{embroidery}} frame keeps the entire piece of fabric taut, {{rather than just}} the piece being worked. It is made of four pieces of wood: two rollers for the top and base, and two side pieces.

5000|$|Designs can be {{geometric}} {{and formal}} or imaginative. Patchwork blocks were initially created individually, accumulated over time, {{by use of}} scrap and salvaged material. Geometric designs were {{the most efficient way}} to aggregate fabric into useful units. Applique, where a piece of fabric is layered on top of the a base or [...] "ground" [...] fabric and then the cut edges are folded under and sewn down, is not limited to simple geometric designs. Early uses of applique in the United States included efforts to expand the effect of expensive, imported European fabrics in early America. The dense printed patterns were cut out, spread apart on a background of plain fabric, allowing the effect of the rare fabric to spread further. [...] Broderie perse is a related technique, where selections of printed fabric are cut out, and sewn in place to produce the effect of a custom printed cloth. Reverse appliqué involves cutting the <b>ground</b> <b>fabric,</b> and placing another fabric beneath the opening. The raw, cut edges are folded under, and sewn onto the smaller piece of fabric below, creating a new design.|$|E
5000|$|The name slip {{as used in}} {{needlework}} {{derives from}} the horticultural sense, where it describes a cutting of a plant used for grafting.Canvaswork floral slips and other motifs appliquéd to a woven background fabric such as velvet or damask became common in England from the mid-14th century, replacing the all-over embroidery of Opus Anglicanum. These were worked with silk thread in tent stitch on linen canvas, cut out, and applied to the <b>ground</b> <b>fabric,</b> often with an outline and embellishments of couched thread or cord or other embroidery. Slips were also appliquéd of rich fabrics on plainer ones, similarly detailed with couched cord and embroidery. This style of decoration is characteristic of later medieval ecclesiastical embroidery (and probably of domestic embroidery as well, although little of this survives). Following {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries during the English Reformation, rich vestments were cut up and the fabrics and motifs reused to make secular furnishings. [...] Appliquéd slips of both old fabric and new canvaswork are characteristic of domestic textiles such as chair covers, cushions, and especially wall hangings and bed curtains throughout the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras.|$|E
