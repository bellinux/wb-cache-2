5|$|Two months later, Warren {{returns to}} the garage and Lucas shows his support for Chris and defends him. Chris meets and befriends Warren's son, Blake (Oliver Edwin). When Warren learns Blake is friends with Chris, he decides {{to put a stop}} to the situation. Warren threatens to kill Chris unless he stops {{spending}} time with Blake. Mason told TV Week that he thinks <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> Chris and Blake cannot continue their friendship because of Warren and his views. It soon becomes clear someone is spying on Chris, but whether it is Warren or someone else is not clear. Mason added something big would happen and it may not end well for Chris.|$|E
25|$|Several weeks later, {{she runs}} away from Fatboy's house without warning, {{returning}} to Walford and {{spending the night}} at Shirley's flat. Leon and Fatboy track her down and she apologises for disappearing. Shirley decides to let her stay with her for a while, and attempts to get Zsa Zsa into a local school. This fails, so she asks Phil for a favour, and he speaks to the headmaster Mr Allcock (Bill Buckhurst). Shirley tells Zsa Zsa she has an appointment with Mr Allcock {{but she is not}} interested until she sees him and takes a liking to him. She befriends Whitney and gives her relationship advice. Mr Allcock visits and Zsa Zsa flirts with him, but she gets a place in the school due to Phil's intervention. Zsa Zsa receives a letter from her mother asking her to join her in Spain, but she does not want to go, so tries to prove she is useful by babysitting Shirley's housemate Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) baby George and saying <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> after Shirley went to all the trouble to get her into school. Shirley acts like she does not care if Zsa Zsa stays or goes but after she tears up Tina's letter, she lets on to Heather that she would have missed Zsa Zsa.|$|E
500|$|In the New Testament, Saint Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus) wrote, [...] "Doth {{not even}} nature itself teach you, that, {{if a man}} have long hair, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. But if any seem contentious, we have no such custom, neither do the churches of God." ...|$|E

60|$|Walter did not {{say whether}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> or not. He looked silently over the Glen to the {{dimpling}} blue harbour beyond.|$|R
500|$|CSKA manager Valery Gazzaev praised {{his players}} despite their loss and hinted that {{injuries}} {{may have been}} a factor in the loss: [...] "The game was satisfactory – we had followed the plan we set out, but still we made two mistakes. On the whole I think our team played very well but of course <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating {{there might have been a}} different outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E
2500|$|... "But {{every woman}} that prays or prophesies {{with her head}} {{uncovered}} dishonours her head: for that is even all one {{as if she were}} shaven. For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: but if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also, 1 Corinthians 14:34,35 states, [...] "Let your women keep {{silence in}} the churches: for it is not {{permitted}} unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> for women to speak in the church." [...] (The reason for {{this has to do}} with acknowledging Headship: Headship and the head covering are seen by many as inseparable since the head covering is intended to teach the meaning of headship. See below for information on the head covering).|$|E
60|$|Pir. Pray, sir, let us {{reserve the}} lady {{to our own}} uses; <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to good catholicks to give her up to infidels.|$|R

2500|$|McIntyre {{asked whether}} {{he was to be}} shot. Kelly replied, [...] "No, why should I want to shoot you? Could I not have done it half an hour ago if I had wanted?" [...] He added, [...] "At first I thought you were Constable Flood. If you had been, I would have roasted you in the fire." [...] Kelly asked if the police came out to shoot him. [...] "No", replied McIntyre, [...] "we came to {{apprehend}} you." [...] "What", asked Kelly, [...] "brings you out here at all? <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to see fine big strapping fellows like you in a lazy loafing billet like policemen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Majid Jahangir Khan (...) is {{a former}} cricketer, batsman and captain of the Pakistan cricket team. In his prime, Majid Khan (often {{referred}} to as [...] "Majestic Khan" [...] by the British press) {{was considered one of}} the best batsmen in the world, able to decimate any bowling attack, including the mighty West Indian fast bowlers of that era. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that over an 18-year Test career, he only played in 63 Test matches, primarily because Pakistan played a very limited Test match schedule. Thus, the cricketing world was deprived of the pleasure of watching one of the greatest exponents of batting in the world. Khan's first-class career spanned 1961 to 1985. Overall, he played 63 Tests for Pakistan, scoring 3,931 runs with 8 centuries, scored over 27,000 first-class runs and made 73 first-class centuries, with 128 fifties. Majid played his last Test for Pakistan in January 1983 against India at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore and his last One Day International (ODI) was in July 1982 against England at Old Trafford, Manchester.|$|E
60|$|Beggars should next be suppressed, who lounge {{about all}} day, {{to see where}} they can steal at night. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> we should suffer real objects of charity to beg; {{and for those who}} are not so, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> but they should work.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> the way Crabtree treated your brother!" [...] said Captain Harry to Dick. [...] "It's {{a wonder}} {{to me that}} Captain Putnam keeps him here." ...|$|R

60|$|Our common women {{ought to}} be {{restrained}} in the liberties they have lately taken; they openly swear and talk so obscenely, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to a Christian country.|$|E

60|$|So they bounced {{and jerked}} and argued at one another, to their hearts' content. Then the {{conductor}} retired, smiling subtly, {{in a way}} they have. Our fat friend looked at us with hot, angry, ashamed, grieved eyes and said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame.</b> Yes, we chimed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame.</b> Whereupon <b>a</b> self-important miss who said she came from some Collegio at Cagliari advanced and asked a number of impertinent questions in a tone of pert sympathy. After which our fat friend, left alone, covered his clouded face with his hand, turned his back on the world, and gloomed.|$|R

60|$|They {{made their}} way back to the launch in silence. Patsy was quite {{disappointed}} in Maurie. He had so many admirable qualities that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> he could <b>be</b> so untruthful and unreliable.|$|R
5000|$|Leslie Norman is {{credited}} as associate producer. He later recalled [...] "I went out Australia {{as a sort}} of hatchet man. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame,</b> but that film <b>was</b> awkward, <b>a</b> bit stiff and staid." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Because I've {{caught a}} cold in my head. I always do, when I {{go in the}} water with my clothes on. And it takes me weeks to get over it, too. I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to serve me so." ...|$|R
