5000|$|The {{military}} {{usefulness of}} Munroe's and Neumann's work was unappreciated {{for a long}} time. Between the world wars, academics in several countries Myron Yakovlevich Sukharevskii (Мирон Яковлевич Сухаревский) in the Soviet Union, William H. Payment and Donald Whitley Woodhead in Britain, and Robert Williams Wood in the U.S. recognized that projectiles could form during explosions. However, {{it was not until}} 1932 that Franz Rudolf Thomanek, a student of physics at Vienna's Technische Hochschule, conceived an anti-tank round that was based on the hollow charge effect. When the Austrian government showed no interest in pursuing the idea, Thomanek moved to Berlin's Technische Hochschule, where he continued his studies under the ballistics expert Carl Julius Cranz. [...] There in 1935, he and Hellmuth von Huttern developed a prototype anti-tank round. Although the weapon's performance proved disappointing, Thomanek continued his developmental work, collaborating with Hubert Schardin at the Waffeninstitut der Luftwaffe (Air Force Weapons Institute) in Braunschweig. [...] By 1937, Shardin believed that hollow-charge effects were due to the interactions of shock waves. It was during the testing of this idea that, on February 4, 1938, Thomanek conceived the shaped-charge explosive (or Hohlladungs-Auskleidungseffekt (hollow-charge liner effect)). [...] (It was Gustav Adolf Thomer who in 1938 first visualized, by <b>flash</b> <b>radiography,</b> the metallic jet produced by a shaped-charge explosion.) Meanwhile, Henry Hans Mohaupt, a chemical engineer in Switzerland, had independently developed a shaped-charge munition in 1935, which was demonstrated to the Swiss, French, British, and U.S. militaries.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} formation, flying, {{penetration}} of explosively-formed projectiles (EFP) {{and the effect}} of water on performance of the charge for underwater applications is simulated by Ansysis Autodyn 2 D-Hydro code. The main objective of an explosively formed projectile designed for underwater applications is to disintegrate the target at longer standoff distances. In this paper we have simulated the explosively formed projectile from OFHC-Copper liner for 1200 conical angle. The Affect of water on the penetration of EFP is determined by simulations from Ansysis Autodyn 2 -D Hydrocode and by varying depth of water from 1 CD- 5 CD. The depth of penetration against steel target is measured experimentally. <b>Flash</b> X-Ray <b>Radiography</b> (FXR) is used to capture EFP jet formation and its penetration against target is measured by depth of penetration experiments.

Jet particle’s locations calculated from the X-ray films become different from their real positions under this situation because of the film to object distance(FTOD) and correction for error by FTOD is required.

40|$|International audienceTime {{resolved}} radiography of pure dodecane and cerium doped dodecane sprays expanding through multi-hole production diesel injectors {{are reported}} {{for the first time}} using a table top flash X-ray source. The radiograph analysis indicates that strong mixing between liquid and ambient gas occurs in the very near nozzle region.

The cone angle, the penetration velocities and the liquid fraction value inferred from the radiographies are in relative good agreement with the recently published results involving very close injector and injection configurations and the reference X-ray diagnostics based on synchrotron radiation. This indicates that the mean energy analysis, re-quired with the use of non monochromatic X-ray sources, appears as a reliable approach.

Because the Xray spectrum from the sources has an end-point energy of {approx} 300 keV with a strong component of {approx} 60 keV tungsten K-line radiation, the Sn portion of the target is radiographically opaque. However, X-rays are transmitted through the PMMA portion of the target thereby allowing motion of the Sn-PMMA interface to be imaged. Also, the shock location is tracked as a function of time due to the density increase in the shocked PMMA.
