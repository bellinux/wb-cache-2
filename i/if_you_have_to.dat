Then they tap it once again but this time they put their heel a few milimeters above the ground and repeat the process with the other foot. They {{do this in a}} walking motion. it is very hard especially <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> follow the beat of fast drums. If they catch themselves off beat they will tap their foot three times instead of two to get back with the drums' rhythm.|$|E

It is tough to go to Russia – I always say that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> travel {{more than two hours}} it is difficult.

In this version, he {{reveals that the}} two thugs worked for Carmine Falcone. At {{the end of the}} tapes, Joker apparently blames Batman for what happened to him. Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What can I say? I like to keep things interesting.

500|$|The {{show was}} {{launched}} by ITV and Syco at the Millennium Hotel Mayfair, London, on 3 May 2011. The initial recruitment phase for contestants lasted until 13 May. The updated format was conceived by Simon Cowell, {{who said that}} it was inspired by roulette and the story of Ashley Revell, who had bet his entire life savings on [...] "red" [...] in a roulette game in Las Vegas. It is the most expensive game show in history, costing in the region of £15m, at around £1.5m per episode. ITV's director of entertainment and comedy, Elaine Bedell, was contacted by Cowell, [...] "This being Simon this was at 1.30am, but even then it was quite a compelling idea". When later talking about the £1m prize on offer each night, Cowell said, [...] "It's expensive <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give away a million every night but we have insurance for that." ...|$|E

In June 1951, she finally secured the return of Alexis by agreeing to cancel her receivership action and divorce suit in California in return for a divorce [...] "guaranteed by L. Ron Hubbard". She met him in Wichita to resolve the situation. He told her that she was [...] "in a state of complete madness" [...] due to being dictated to and hypnotized by Hollister and his [...] "communist cell". Playing along, she told Hubbard that he was right and that the only way she could break free of their power was by going through with the divorce. He replied, [...] "You know, I'm a public figure and you're nobody, so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go through the divorce, I'll accuse you of desertion so it won't look so bad on my public record."

[...] They proceed across the disc, encountering a variety of mythical creatures, most of which lead to near-death experiences for Rincewind. [...] Fortunately for Rincewind, the Octavo spell in his head precludes him from actually dying, resulting in several comic encounters with Death. Meanwhile, a significant power struggle is occurring within the Unseen University. [...] Narrator Brian Cox explains that [...] "in the competitive world of wizardry, {{the way to the top}} is via dead men's pointy shoes... even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> empty them yourself". [...] The power-hungry wizard Ymper Trymon (Tim Curry) plans to become Archchancellor. Trymon assassinates several faculty members but is thwarted by the incumbent Archchancellor, Galder Weatherwax, and his superior magical knowledge of the Octavo. Trymon knows there is no point in deposing the Archchancellor until he learns how to control the Octavo, which is growing increasingly restless as Rincewind (and the spell in his head) moves further away from Ankh-Morpork and into greater danger.|$|E
500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go to Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dick {{hailed from}} Keokuk, Iowa, {{which has long}} been called the [...] "Home of Champions" [...] and the [...] "Racing Capital of the World" [...] along with his younger brother Ron. The “Keokuk Gang” {{consisted}} of “Old Man” Ernie Derr, Don White, Ramo Stott and Hutcherson himself. Dick Hutcherson said of Derr: 'Got to beat the old man. The old man will be tough to beat <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> haul him out in a wheelchair.' He started racing in 1956 and moved up to the International Motor Contest Association (IMCA) circuit in 1959. Hutch was a quick learner and very competitive and took the IMCA championship in 1963 and 1964. He was the Late Model champion at Huron, South Dakota’s Dakota State Fair Speedway in 1960 and 1964. He has 81 IMCA wins to his credit. During this time he also raced in the Midwest Association for Race Cars circuit.|$|E

2500|$|Satana then starred as [...] "Varla" [...] in the 1965 film Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!—a very {{aggressive}} and sexual female character {{for which she}} did all of her own stunts and fight scenes. Renowned film critic Richard Corliss called her performance [...] "the most honest, maybe the one honest portrayal in the Meyer canon and certainly the scariest". Originally titled The Leather Girls, the film is an ode to female violence, based on a concept created by Russ Meyer and screenwriter Jack Moran. Both felt at her first audition that Satana was [...] "definitely Varla." [...] The film was shot on location in the desert outside Los Angeles during days when the weather was more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and freezing nights, with Satana clashing regularly with teenage co-star Susan Bernard due to Bernard's mother's reportedly disruptive behavior on the set. Meyer said Satana was [...] "extremely capable. She knew how to handle herself. Don't fuck with her! And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fuck her, do it well!
