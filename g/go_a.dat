5|$|The Aggies {{broke the}} losing streak in 1910 with a stalemate, 11–11. In {{the final minutes}} of the game, Hopkins was on the Maryland eight-yard line, second down with two yards to <b>go.</b> <b>A</b> Johns Hopkins guard named Schrieber then ran from the field to their bench to leave a knocked-out tooth for safekeeping. The referee penalized the Blue and Black ten yards, and when their field goal attempt was blocked, the game ended in a tie.|$|E

5|$|Along the way, the LocoRoco {{can grow}} in size by eating special berries, and then can be split and rejoined {{to pass the}} LocoRoco through narrow spaces. The game's bright and {{colorful}} visuals and dynamic music soundtrack were hallmarks of the game, earning it several awards from the gaming press in 2006. While the game did not sell high volumes, its success {{led to the development}} of four other LocoRoco titles – two sequels for the PSP (PlayStation Portable)/PSP <b>Go,</b> <b>a</b> spin-off for the PlayStation 3 and a mobile version (called LocoRoco Mobile and LocoRoco Hi, depending on the market) for cellular (mobile) telephones.|$|E
5|$|Although only an {{alternate}} {{member of the}} tribunal without a vote, his voice was heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping the final result.

To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.|$|E

5|$|At E3 2015, Square Enix Montreal {{announced}} Lara Croft <b>Go,</b> <b>a</b> {{successor to}} Hitman Go set within the Tomb Raider universe. It {{was released on}} 27 August 2015. In the game, players use touchscreen controls to move Lara Croft around a level composed of nodes and lines. While the core mechanics and design are similar to Hitman Go, the developers did not want Lara Croft Go {{to feel like a}} re-skin, so an emphasis has been placed on the puzzle-driven exploration and gameplay elements of the Tomb Raider brand. The following year, Square Enix Montreal announced a similar title Deus Ex Go, based on the Deus Ex series.|$|E
5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} never {{seemed to have a}} dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would <b>go</b> <b>a</b> step further in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E
5|$|In November 1996, Blancornelas was {{planning}} to visit New York City to receive an international award {{for his work in}} covering the drug trade, political corruption, and the relationship between the drug lords and the police. A few days before he was about to fly, a policeman in Tijuana visited Blancornelas and warned him that he was risking his life if he decided to <b>go.</b> <b>A</b> year later, the warning proved to be true: in 1997 in Tijuana, Blancornelas was ambushed and wounded by gunmen of the Tijuana Cartel while heading to the airport for publishing a photo of the drug lord Ramón Arellano Félix. Blancornelas was nearly killed when the attackers opened fire on his car, wounding him in the abdomen and killing his driver and bodyguard, Luis Valero Elizalde, who died protecting him and managed to kill one of the shooters. Blancornelas suffered complications from the injury {{for the rest of his}} life. In the attack, Blancornelas' car was hit more than 180 times, but only four bullets penetrated the journalist's body. Elizalde, however, was hit 38 times. That same year, three other prominent journalists were killed in Mexico.|$|E

Each episode focuses on different transportation vehicles; however, one episode is reserved for Santa Claus, and another for roller coasters.

5|$|The {{threat of}} a French {{invasion}} did not subside, but instead grew stronger into 1386. At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Polein his capacity of chancellorrequested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm. Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed. The parliament (later known as the Wonderful Parliament) was presumably working {{with the support of}} Gloucester and Arundel. The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a scullion from his kitchen at parliament's request. Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole <b>go.</b> <b>A</b> commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.|$|E
5|$|UConn went unbeaten {{through the}} Conference {{regular season and}} Tournament and easily {{advanced}} into the NCAA Tournament; in the regional final against Virginia a 4-points win in their closest {{game of the year}} opened the doors of the Final Four at the Target Center in Minneapolis. UConn blew out Stanford in the semifinals behind Wolters' 31 points, reaching the championship game for a rematch against Tennessee. In the final game UConn found itself in early trouble when Lobo was called for three personal fouls in 94 seconds in the first half, but in the second half the team was able to rally from a 9-point deficit and a key Rizzotti layup gave UConn the lead with less than 2 minutes to <b>go,</b> <b>a</b> lead that the team kept until the final score of 70–64 and their first national title. Rebecca Lobo was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player.|$|E
5|$|While the Ordainers {{were at work}} {{drafting}} their reform document, Edward {{decided to}} address {{one of the main}} causes behind the discontent: the Scottish situation. Edward II had, almost immediately after his accession, abandoned the relentless Scottish campaigns of his father. As a result, Robert the Bruce had been able to regain the initiative in the war, reconquer lost territory, and stage destructive raids into the north of England. To aggravate matters, Edward had continued to raise extortionate taxes, ostensibly for the war in Scotland, but without showing any result. If the King could produce victory against the Scots, this would <b>go</b> <b>a</b> long way towards undermining the work of the Ordainers. In June, the King summoned the magnates for a military campaign, but most of the Ordainers refused {{on the basis of the}} work they were performing. When the King departed for Scotland in September, only Gloucester, Warenne and Gaveston among the earls accompanied him. The campaign proved frustrating for Edward, when Bruce refused to engage in open battle, or even get involved in negotiations. In February, Gaveston was sent with an army north from Roxburgh to Perth, but he failed to track down the Scottish army.|$|E

50|$|Real Wheels, {{also known}} as There <b>Goes</b> <b>a...,</b> is a {{collection}} of children's videos for children ages 3-8 years old that features a specified vehicle and the various jobs that it has along with real people who work the job which requires the vehicle. Episodes like There <b>Goes</b> <b>a</b> Garbage Truck, There Goes the Mail and There <b>Goes</b> <b>a</b> Rescue Vehicle, were released {{as a part of the}} series. Each episode focuses on different transportation vehicles, however, one episode is reserved for Santa Claus, and another for roller coasters.

5|$|Chris befriends Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell) and {{she asks}} him to father her child, to which Chris replies {{that he needs}} time to decide. Chris meets Nate Kinski and they arrange to <b>go</b> <b>a</b> picnic for their first date. Chris is shocked when Nate attacks a drunk guy for harassing Paige Smith (Olympia Valance), but Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) convinces him to give Nate a second chance. When Chris asks Nate to open up about {{his time in the}} army and Afghanistan, Nate gets {{physical}} with him. Nate promises that it will not happen again and asks Chris not to push him about opening up until he is ready. During Georgia and Kyle's joint hen and bucks night, Chris is punched by an unseen assailant and he hits his head. Kyle and Georgia find him and he is rushed to hospital, and placed in an induced coma. Josh later confesses to punching Chris. When Chris wakes up, he struggles to remember words and his right side is weakened. Chris is allowed leave from the hospital to attend Georgia and Kyle's wedding. After he is discharged from hospital, Nate becomes Chris's carer. Chris decides to return to work at the garage but is unable to do the work and is sent home. Chris later suffers a seizure and is admitted to hospital. He is forced to quit his job as he can no longer handle the workload due to his injuries. Josh's mother, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), offers Chris a job as a trainee manager at Lassiter's Hotel, which Nate persuades him to accept.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} cargo {{offloaded}} at Karachi, 8,700 bales of raw cotton were loaded, along with various quantities of fish manure, resin, rice, scrap iron, sulphur, and timber. Added to this were 1,000 barrels of lubricating oil. The ship's captain {{was concerned about}} having to take the flammable items but was told {{that they had to}} <b>go.</b> <b>A</b> proposal to add 750 drums of turpentine was refused. The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could spontaneously combust. This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so. Before the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked. Tarpaulins were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested. Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi. Fort Stikine sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB74, which had departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on 6 April. The unescorted convoy arrived at Bombay on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|West Ham {{took some}} heart in their {{performance}} at Old Trafford by scoring the opening goal, thus breaking United's clean sheet record. The champions responded in typical fashion, scoring twice in both {{halves of the}} match to win a third on the trot and give Ferguson the perfect boost ahead of their midweek Champions League tie. Although victorious away to Košice, United couldn't break the deadlock in their next league match to Bolton, squandering numerous chances to remain {{at the top of}} the table, most notably from Andy Cole. The main talking point at the Reebok Stadium came in the 35th minute, when a brawl between Nathan Blake and Gary Pallister resulted in both players being controversially sent off. After the game, a furious Ferguson personally sent a video of the incident to The Football Association in the hope of the decision being rescinded. Referee Paul Durkin publicly admitted before the video arrived that, in hindsight, he had made the wrong decision. Mark Hughes returned to Old Trafford and scored what looked to be the winner for Chelsea, before super-sub Ole Gunnar Solskjær popped in to earn a dramatic equaliser with four minutes to <b>go.</b> <b>A</b> first-half header from Leeds defender David Wetherall was enough to condemn United to their first defeat of the season and first in almost three months of football. Worse was to come for the champions, as captain Roy Keane was ruled out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage, although Ferguson revealed after the Leeds match that they hoped that he would be fit enough to play some part in their next Champions League game, at home to Juventus on the coming Wednesday. Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence.|$|E
