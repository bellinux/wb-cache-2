Samples were stored at four storage temperatures (20 °C, 28 °C, 35 °C and 42 °C). The volatile fraction was analyzed using headspace GC-MS fingerprinting as a function of time and temperature (kinetics). Fingerprinting enabled selection of sulfur-containing compounds (<b>dimethyl</b> sulfide, carbon <b>disulfide,</b> <b>dimethyl</b> pentasulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, bis-(methylthio) -phosphine and methyl (methylthio) methyl disulfide), nitriles (heptanonitrile, 5 -methyl-hexanenitrile, hexanenitrile and 5 -(methylthio) -pentanenitrile), fatty acid derivatives (octanal and 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol), furanic compounds (2 -ethylfuran) and Strecker aldehydes (3 -methylbutanal) as volatiles significantly changing during shelf-life. In general, most of the volatiles decreased as a function of shelf-life.

2500|$|These ants {{have evolved}} a unique {{mechanism}} {{to deal with}} this increased foraging cost. After the battle injured ants [...] "call" [...] for help with a pheromone in their mandibular gland (consisting of two chemical compounds: <b>Dimethyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> and Dimethyl trisulfide). This attracts nestmates which then start to investigate the injured nestmate and pick her up. By carrying these injured ants back they reduce their mortality by 32% to close to zero. Inside the nest the clinging termites get removed. In case they lost one or two legs the ants adapt to a four or five legged locomotion to compensate for it, allowing them to reach running speeds similar to a healthy ant. These injured ants are then capable again of performing colony tasks and are even observed in future raids against termites. A model calculated the value of this helping behaviour to allow a colony to be 28.7% larger than a colony that would not show this behaviour (due to the energy saving by not having to replace the injured workers with new healthy replacements). This is the only invertebrate species known to show such a behaviour towards injured individuals.|$|E

We believe that the border intercropping pattern was the best intercropping pattern of onion with lettuce because, first the caterpillar to enter in the field finds a barrier of onion crop and this attacks the onion, it begins to release a number of volatile organic compounds containing sulfur and these may have a defensive role.

40|$|Dialkyl and diaryl dichalcogenides {{are highly}} {{versatile}} and modular precursors for {{the synthesis of}} colloidal chalcogenide nanocrystals. We have used a series of commercially available dichalcogenide precursors to unveil the molecular basis for the outcome of nanocrystal preparations, more specifically, how precursor molecular structure and reactivity affect the final shape and size of II-VI semiconductor nanocrystals. Dichalcogenide precursors used were diallyl, dibenzyl, di-tert-butyl, diisopropyl, diethyl, <b>dimethyl,</b> and diphenyl <b>disulfides</b> and diethyl, <b>dimethyl,</b> and diphenyl diselenides. We find {{that the presence of}} two distinctively reactive C-E and E-E bonds makes the chemistry of these precursors much richer and interesting than that of other conventional precursors such as the more common phosphine chalcogenides. Computational studies (DFT) reveal that the dissociation energy of carbon-chalcogen (C-E) bonds in dichalcogenide precursors (R-E-E-R, E = S or Se) increases in the order (R) : diallyl 3 ̆c dibenzyl 3 ̆c di-tert-butyl 3 ̆c diisopropyl 3 ̆c diethyl 3 ̆c dimethyl 3 ̆c diphenyl. The dissociation energy of chalcogen-chalcogen (E-E) bonds remains relatively constant across the series. The only exceptions are diphenyl dichalcogenides, which have a much lower E-E bond dissociation energy. An increase in C-E bond dissociation energy results in a decrease in R-E-E-R precursor reactivity, leading to progressively slower nucleation and higher selectivity for anisotropic growth, all the way from dots to pods to tetrapods. Under identical experimental conditions, we obtain CdS and CdSe nanocrystals with spherical, elongated, or tetrapodal morphology by simply varying the identity and reactivity of the dichalcogenide precursor. Interestingly, we find that precursors with strong C-E and weak E-E bond dissociation energies such as Ph-S-S-Ph serve as a ready source of thiol radicals that appear to stabilize small CdE nuclei, facilitating anisotropic growth. These CdS and CdSe nanocrystals have been characterized using structural and spectroscopic methods. An intimate understanding of how molecular structure affects the chemical reactivity of molecular precursors enables highly predictable and reproducible synthesis of colloidal nanocrystals with specific sizes, shapes, and optoelectronic properties for customized applications...|$|R

40|$|Discovery of cheap, {{nontoxic}} {{and readily}} available antiatherosclerotic drugs {{is an extraordinary}} challenge in this modern world. Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases have been predicted to be {{the leading cause of}} death by the year 2030. Hence, this thesis was designed to search for plant (s) with anti-atherogenic properties, investigate its possible side effects and extrapolate its likely mechanism(s) of action. An ethnobotanical survey was employed in identification of locally important plants used for the management and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and its predisposing factors in Nkonkobe Municipality, Eastern Cape in South Africa. Information on the names of plants, their parts used and methods of preparation was collected through a questionnaire which was administered to herbalists, traditional healers and rural dwellers. The most frequently used plant (Rhizomes of Tulbaghia violacea Harv.) was investigated for toxicity using brine shrimp lethality (in vitro) and in vivo toxicity test (acute and subchronic) on rats to determine safety dosage. The in vitro antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity of the plant was investigated using models such as 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 - picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), nitric oxide (NO), 2, 2 ’- azinobis [3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid] diammonium salt (ABTS), lipid peroxidation inhibition and the ferric reducing agent. Phytochemical content and the effect of oral administration of fresh methanolic extract rhizomes of Tulbaghia violacea (250, 500 mg/kg. bwt/day) on Lipid peroxidation (TBARS), serum and tissue antioxidant enzymes in normal, hypercholesterolemic and diet induced atherogenic rats were also assessed. More so, the potential of the extract (250 and 500 mg/kg. bwt) to protect against atherogenic diet (4 percentage cholesterol 1 pecentage cholic acid and 0. 5 percentage thiouracil) induced fatty streaks formation, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction was also investigated. Ethnobotanical study revealed that 19 plant species are used for the treatment of heart related diseases in the Municipality. 53 percentage of the plants mentioned were used for the management of chest pain, 47 percentage for high blood pressure, 42 percent for heart disease, 16 percentage for stroke and 11 percentage for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Tulbaghia violacea was repeatedly mentioned as the plant species used for the treatment of high blood pressure and predisposing factors in the study area. The brine shrimp cytotoxicity test revealed that fresh, dried methanolic extracts and essential oil of the T. violacea exhibited a high degree of cytotoxic activity with IC 50 values of 18. 18 (fresh) and 19. 24 (dried) μg/ml. An IC 50 value of 12. 59 μg/ml was obtained for the essential oil of the plant. The low cytotoxicity values obtained, suggested that rhizome of T. violacea may serve as a potential source of antimicrobial and anticancer agents. In vivo acute study of single oral administration of 5 g/kg dose does not produce mortality or significant behavioral changes during 14 days observation. In the sub-chronic study, the extract (250, 500 mg/kg/bwt/ day) administered for a period of 28 days showed no mortality or morbidity. The weekly body and organ weight of the rats showed no significant differences between the control and the rats treated with the extract. The extract at all doses does not show any effect on of biomarkers of liver or renal damage. However, a significant decrease in the activity of ƔGT was observed in the extract treated groups. Hematological evaluation revealed that oral administration of fresh methanolic extracts of rhizomes of T. violacea does not cause anaemia or leucocytosis in the animals. Furthermore, histopathology results of the internal organs revealed no detectable inflammation. These results demonstrated that the rhizome extract of T. violacea was potentially safe for consumption orally even in chronic concentration. In vitro antioxidant evaluation showed that the essential oil, fresh and dried methanolic extracts exhibited potent antioxidant activities in a concentration dependent manner. Phytochemical investigation reveals that the fresh and the dry extract of RTV are rich in flavonoid, flavonol, phenols, tannin and proanthocyanidin, while the essential oil contained dimethy <b>disulfide,</b> <b>dimethyl</b> trisulfide, (methyl methylthio) methyl, 2, 4 -dithiapentane (11. 35 percent) and (methylthio) acetic acid, 2 - (methylthio) ethanol, 3 -(methylthio) - and propanenitrile (7. 20 percent). The fresh extract had higher radicals scavenging activity than the essential oil or dried extract, with 50 percentage inhibition of DPPH, hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation at a concentration of 35. 0 ± 0. 12, 19. 3 ± 0. 11 and 17. 9 ± 0. 15 μg/ml respectively. Oral administration of methanolic extract of RTV in 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg to female Wistar rats significantly inhibited reduction of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The extracts also inhibited (p< 0. 05) lipid peroxidation in normal, high cholesterol and diet induced atherosclerosis fed rats in a dose dependant manner. Also the extract (250 and 500 mg/kg/bwt/day) caused a significant (p< 0. 05) improvement in body weight of treated animals compared with untreated hypercholesterolemia control rats. The extracts also protected significantly (p< 0. 05) against atherogenic diet induced liver damage or fatty streaks formation in the aorta as revealed by histological examination. The anti-cholesterolemia and anti-atherosclerotic activities of the extract compared favorably well with standard drugs Gemfibrozil and Atorvastatin respectively. Conclusively, rhizomes of T. violacea possess significant anti-atherogenic activity and its mechanism of action(s) may be due to its antioxidant and anti-hypercholesterolemia properties. The results of this study also suggested that rhizome of T. violacea is relatively safe for human consumption and it may be used as an alternative to garlic...|$|R
