5000|$|A30-B18 origin's do not {{fit well}} into a some {{contrasting}} neighbor-joining analysis (Trees).

In Israel the level of A*3002 is less than one percent and in Asia the allele is detected in some parts of South Asia and may be associated with other recent migrations from Africa. Within the Aegean/Ionian region only Macedonia shows an appreciable level of A*3002, and Albania shows levels of B18-DR3 indicating gene flow from the West from the Italian peninsula to the eastern Ionian coast. While haplotypes have a higher threshold of detection, Cw5-B18 has not been detected in any Eastern Mediterranean people; the B18-DR3 is also rare to Sardinia's East except in the Italians, Swiss and Albanians (1.8%); and DR3-DQ2 is generally lowest in Europe in the Northeastern Mediterranean.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) loci {{have been}} implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders in which language is affected. However, to date, no studies have investigated the possible involvement of HLA loci in specific language impairment (SLI), a disorder that is defined primarily upon unexpected language impairment. We report association analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and <b>HLA</b> <b>types</b> in a cohort of individuals affected by language impairment. METHODS: We perform quantitative association analyses of three linguistic measures and case-control association analyses using both SNP data and imputed <b>HLA</b> <b>types.</b> RESULTS: Quantitative association analyses of imputed <b>HLA</b> <b>types</b> suggested a role for the HLA-A locus in susceptibility to SLI. HLA-A A 1 {{was associated with a}} measure of short-term memory (P = 0. 004) and A 3 with expressive language ability (P = 0. 006). Parent-of-origin effects were found between HLA-B B 8 and HLA-DQA 1 * 0501 and receptive language. These alleles have a negative correlation with receptive language ability when inherited from the mother (P = 0. 021, P = 0. 034, respectively) but are positively correlated with the same trait when paternally inherited (P = 0. 013, P = 0. 029, respectively). Finally, case control analyses using imputed <b>HLA</b> <b>types</b> indicated that the DR 10 allele of HLA-DRB 1 was more frequent in individuals with SLI than population controls (P = 0. 004, relative risk = 2. 575), as has been reported for individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). CONCLUSION: These preliminary data provide an intriguing link to those described by previous studies of other neurodevelopmental disorders and suggest a possible role for HLA loci in language disorders...|$|R
40|$|Background: The human {{leukocyte}} antigen system (HLA) {{contains many}} highly variable genes. HLA genes {{play an important role}} in the human immune system, and HLA gene matching is crucial for the success of human organ transplantations. Numerous studies have demonstrated that variation in HLA genes is associated with many autoimmune, inflammatory and infectious diseases. However, <b>typing</b> <b>HLA</b> genes by serology or PCR is time consuming and expensive, which limits large-scale studies involving HLA genes. Since it is much easier and cheaper to obtain single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data, accurate computational algorithms to infer <b>HLA</b> gene <b>types</b> from SNP genotype data are in need. To infer <b>HLA</b> <b>types</b> from SNP genotypes, the first step is to infer SNP haplotypes from genotypes. However, for the same SNP genotype data set, the haplotype configurations inferred by different methods are usually inconsistent, and it is often difficult to decide which one is true. Results: In this paper, we design an accurate <b>HLA</b> gene <b>type</b> inference algorithm by utilizing SNP genotype data from pedigrees, known <b>HLA</b> gene <b>types</b> of some individuals and the relationship between inferred SNP haplotypes and <b>HLA</b> gene <b>types.</b> Given a set of haplotypes inferred from the genotypes of a population consisting of many pedigrees, the algorithm first constructs a weighted similarity graph based on a new haplotype similarity measur...|$|R
