40|$|One of {{the reasons}} {{frequently}} given {{for the failure of}} new technolo-gies is the potentially destructive presence of two versions of a new technology, or excessive <b>entry.</b> <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> this phenomenon using a two-period model with heterogeneous consumers. We identify two counteracting e¤ects of the entry of an additional new technology; the variety e¤ect and the coordination e¤ect. We show that for two tech-nologies, an individual adopter’s incentive to adopt decreases. Turning to aggregate expected welfare, however, we …nd that it can be bene…-cial to let a second technology enter anyway.
