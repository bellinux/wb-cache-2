Primary cardiac conduction defects are {{mainly caused by}} mutations in genes involved in impulse conduction processes (e. g., gapjunction genes and transcription factors) or repolarisation processes (e. g., ion-channel genes), whereas primary cardiomyopathies are mainly caused by defective force generation or force transmission due to gene mutations in either sarcomeric or cytoskeleton proteins.

METHODS: Detailed indications for TOPFA were extracted from medical charts. RESULTS: Of 2465 completed records, indications were: chromosomal anomalies n = 963 (39. 1 %), malformations {{of a single}} organ without chromosomal or <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiologies</b> n = 898 (36. 4 %), multiple malformations without chromosomal or <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiologies</b> n = 238 (9. 7 %), obstetrical complications n = 161 (6. 5 %), non-chromosomal genetic diseases n = 158 (6. 4 %), foetal infections n = 21 (0. 9 %), unexplained severe oligohydramnios n = 20 (0. 8 %), foetal exposure to teratogenic agents n = 6. Overall, 33. 3 % of anomalies were lethal (e. g. anencephaly), 25. 2 % were expected to result in isolated mental retardation (e. g. Down) and 35. 1 % in substantial handicap (e. g. myelomeningocele). In 6. 4 % of cases, the anomaly was either of late onset (e. g.

40|$|Human {{population-based}} {{studies have}} shown that cognitive ability and negative emotions are associated with later health outcomes. Part of this association might be due to shared genetic influences. The present thesis has two main objectives. The first is to examine the shared <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiology</b> between cognitive ability and mental and physical health. The second is to examine the shared <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiology</b> between the tendency to experience negative emotions and mental and physical health. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 provide an introductory overview of the field of individual differences in psychology, with the first Chapter focussing on cognitive ability and the second on personality (especially neuroticism). Each of these Chapters provide an historical overview of the two traits, followed by the associations with health outcomes, and finish by exploring the <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiology</b> of both cognitive ability and negative emotions and the potential genetic overlap with health outcomes. Chapter 3 focusses on the main cohort analysed in this thesis, the UK Biobank. This Chapter outlines the study population and its demographics, and provides a detailed account of the main variables examined in this thesis. Chapters 4 to 7 present the empirical work and are split in two parts; the first part (Chapters 4 and 5), focusses on cognitive ability. The second part (Chapters 6 and 7) focusses on negative emotions. Chapter 4 presents two studies, examining the shared <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiology</b> between cognitive ability and mental and physical health using linkage disequilibrium score regression and polygenic profile analysis; Mendelian Randomization is used to test for direction of effect between cognitive ability and physical health. The results indicate a substantially shared <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiology</b> between cognitive ability and both physical and mental health. No evidence was found for a causal association between cognitive ability and physical health.

40|$|Imprinting {{disorders}} (ImpDis) are a {{group of}} currently twelve congenital diseases with common underlying (epi) <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiologies</b> and overlapping clinical features affecting growth, development and metabolism. In the last years it has emerged that ms are characterized by {{the same types of}} mutations and epimutations, i. e. uniparental disomies, copy number variations, epimutations, and point mutations. Each ImpDis is associated with a specific imprinted locus, but the same imprinted region can be involved in different ImpDis. Additionally, even the same aberrant methylation patterns are observed in different phenotypes. As some ImpDis share clinical features, clinical diagnosis is difficult in some cases. The advances in molecular and clinical diagnosis of ImpDis help to circumvent these issues, and they are accompanied by an increasing understanding of the pathomechanism behind them. As these mechanisms have important roles for the etiology of other common conditions, the results in ImpDis research have a wider effect beyond the borders of ImpDis.

40|$|International audienceImprinting {{disorders}} (IDs) are a {{group of}} eight rare but probably underdiagnosed congenital diseases affecting growth, development and metabolism. They are caused by similar molecular changes affecting regulation, dosage or the genomic sequence of imprinted genes. Each ID is characterised by specific clinical features, and, as each appeared {{to be associated with}} specific imprinting defects, they have been widely regarded as separate entities. However, they share clinical characteristics and can show overlapping molecular alterations. Nevertheless, IDs are usually studied separately despite their common underlying (epi) <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiologies,</b> and their basic pathogenesis and long-term clinical consequences remain largely unknown. Efforts to elucidate the aetiology of IDs are currently fragmented across Europe, and standardisation of diagnostic and clinical management is lacking.

40|$|Individuals with schizophrenia, {{compared}} to healthy individuals, {{are known to}} exhibit deficient prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response as well as reduced performance on the antisaccade task. There is evidence for genetic transmission of both PPI and antisaccadic abnormalities in schizophrenia. It {{has been suggested that}} PPI and antisaccade measures identify separate endophenotypes, {{on the basis of a}} lack of relationship between PPI and antisaccade deficits in patients with schizotypal personality disorder. However, given that patients with schizotypal personality disorder are unlikely to manifest all the abnormalities associated with schizophrenia, it is important to determine that there is no relationship present between these two abnormalities in people affected with schizophrenia. The main objective of this investigation therefore was to establish the lack of the association between PPI and antisaccade deficits in schizophrenia in two independent studies. Study 1 involved 39 patients with schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls and study 2 involved 35 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls. PPI (uninstructed paradigm) of the acoustically elicited startle (eye blink) was measured electromyographically. Antisaccadic eye movements (standard, non-overlap version) were measured using infrared oculography. Patients displayed reduced PPI and a lower percentage of correct antisaccades relative to healthy controls in both studies. As expected, no relationship occurred between PPI and the percentage of correct antisaccade responses in either group. It is concluded that PPI and antisaccade abnormalities in schizophrenia represent separate endophenotypes, reflecting the functions of different <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiologies</b> and different or only partially overlapping neural systems...|$|R
40|$|Cardiomyopathy {{frequently}} has {{a genetic}} basis. In adults, mutations in genes encoding {{components of the}} sarcomere, cytoskeleton, or desmosome are frequent genetic causes of cardiomyopathy. Although children share these causes, ~ 30 % of children have an underlying metabolic, syndromic, or neuromuscular condition causing their cardiomyopathy, making the aetiologies more diverse in children as compared with adults. Although some children present with obvious signs or symptoms of metabolic, syndromic, or neuromuscular disease, other cases may be quite subtle, requiring {{a high level of}} suspicion in order to diagnose them. In general, the younger the child, the more extensive the differential. Advantages of identifying the underlying genetic cause of cardiomyopathy in the paediatric population include confirming the diagnosis in ambiguous cases, facilitating appropriate surveillance and management of cardiac and extra-cardiac diseases, providing prognostic information, and establishing the genetic basis in the family, thereby allowing the identification of at-risk relatives and institution of appropriate family screening as indicated. For these reasons, genetic testing is increasingly recognised as standard of care, and guidelines for genetic counselling, testing, and incorporation of family-based risk assessment have been established. Therapies aimed at treating specific <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiologies</b> of cardiomyopathy are emerging and are exciting new developments that require increasingly sophisticated approaches to diagnosis.

40|$|Background: Recent {{analyses}} of trait-disorder overlap suggest that psychiatric dimensions {{may relate to}} distinct sets of genes that exert their maximum influence during different periods of development. This includes {{analyses of}} social-communciation difficulties that share, depending on their developmental stage, stronger genetic links with either Autism Spectrum Disorder or schizophrenia. Here we developed a multivariate analysis framework in unrelated individuals to model directly the developmental profile of genetic influences contributing to complex traits, such as social-communication difficulties, during a ~ 10 -year period spanning childhood and adolescence. Methods: Longitudinally assessed quantitative social-communication problems (N ≤ 5, 551) were studied in participants from a UK birth cohort (ALSPAC, 8 to 17 years). Using standardised measures, genetic architectures were investigated with novel multivariate genetic-relationship-matrix structural equation models (GSEM) incorporating whole-genome genotyping information. Analogous to twin research, GSEM included Cholesky decomposition, common pathway and independent pathway models. Results: A 2 -factor Cholesky decomposition model described the data best. One genetic factor was common to SCDC measures across development, the other accounted for independent variation at 11 years and later, consistent with distinct developmental profiles in trait-disorder overlap. Importantly, genetic factors operating at 8 years explained only ~ 50 % of the genetic variation at 17 years. Conclusion: Using latent factor models, we identified developmental changes in the genetic architecture of social-communication difficulties that enhance the understanding of ASD and schizophrenia-related dimensions. More generally, GSEM present a framework for modelling shared <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiologies</b> between phenotypes and can provide prior information with respect to patterns and continuity of trait-disorder overla...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to identify patients with Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) as a molecular diagnosis determines both treatment and prognosis. Genetic testing is currently expensive and many patients are therefore not assessed and are misclassified as having either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Biomarkers could facilitate the prioritisation of patients for genetic testing. We hypothesised that patients with different underlying <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiologies</b> for their diabetes could have distinct metabolic profiles which may uncover novel biomarkers. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform metabolic profiling in urine from patients with MODY due to mutations in the genes encoding glucokinase (GCK) or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF 1 A), type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) and normoglycaemic control subjects. Urinary metabolic profiling by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and ultra performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to Q-TOF mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was performed in a Discovery set of subjects with HNF 1 A-MODY (n = 14), GCK-MODY (n = 17), T 2 D (n = 14) and normoglycaemic controls (n = 34). Data were used to build a valid partial least squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) model where HNF 1 A-MODY subjects could be separated from the other diabetes subtypes. No single metabolite contributed significantly to the separation of the patient groups. However, betaine, valine, glycine and glucose were elevated in the urine of HNF 1 A-MODY subjects compared to the other subgroups.

In order to study this, we investigated three FHH kindreds with recurrent pancreatitis for mutations of the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) to identify a possible common <b>genetic</b> <b>aetiology</b> for typical FHH and that associated with pancreatitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three FHH kindreds (18 affected, 14 unaffected members) in which the proband had presented with recurrent pancreatitis were identified. The entire 3234 bp coding region of the CaR gene was examined by direct DNA sequencing using fluorochrome labelled dideoxy-terminators. Mutations were confirmed and demonstrated to co-segregate with FHH by restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: Three novel heterozygous missense mutations (Asn 178 Asp, Arg 220 Gln and Pro 221 Ser) in the extracellular domain of the CaR were identified {{in each of the}} probands. These mutations, which co-segregated with the hypercalcaemia, were not detected as common polymorphisms in 55 unrelated normocalcaemic controls.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{replicate}} {{the association of}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility loci in an independent European sample and to assess their specificity with anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) status. METHODS: A selection of 64 SNP previously associated with RA have been typed in a cohort of 267 RA patients (169 ACPA-positive and 98 ACPA-negative) and 152 controls from the Rheumatology Units of the University Hospital of Pisa (Italy) and the University of Pécs Medical Center (Hungary). Regression analyses were performed first considering overall RA patients and secondly, taking both serotype subgroups as different disease entities. The results have been adjusted for age, gender and origin of individuals. RESULTS: The well-known CD 2, REL, TNFAIP 3, IRF 5, PTPRC, and CCR 6 have been confirmed as RA disease associated loci together with recently discovered BACH 2, RASGRP 1, and IKZF 3 loci, taking all RA patients as a unique phenotype. Results from both serological subgroups separately reflect the specificity of these susceptibility loci and show additional ACPA-positive specific associations for variants at IL 6 R, IL 2 RA, BLK, DDX 6, IL 6, and TLE 3 genes. CONCLUSIONS: The results from GAPAID project are consistent with previously established RA disease associations for CD 2, PTPRC, REL, CCR 6, TNFAIP 3, IRF 5, BLK, IL 2 RA, and DDX 6 loci.

OBJECTIVE: To define the medical, neuropsychological, and behavioural phenotypes in carriers of this deletion. METHODS: We collected clinical data on 285 deletion carriers and performed detailed evaluations on 72 carriers and 68 intrafamilial non-carrier controls. RESULTS: When compared to intrafamilial controls, full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) is two standard deviations lower in carriers, and there is no difference between carriers referred for neurodevelopmental disorders and carriers identified through cascade family testing. Verbal IQ (mean 74) is lower than non-verbal IQ (mean 83) and a majority of carriers require speech therapy. Over 80 % of individuals exhibit psychiatric disorders including ASD, which is present in 15 % of the paediatric carriers. Increase in head circumference (HC) during infancy is similar to the HC and brain growth patterns observed in idiopathic ASD. Obesity, a major comorbidity present in 50 % of the carriers by the age of 7 years, does not correlate with FSIQ or any behavioural trait. Seizures are present in 24 % of carriers and occur independently of other symptoms. Malformations are infrequently found, confirming {{only a few of the}} previously reported associations. CONCLUSIONS: The 16 p 11. 2 deletion impacts in a quantitative and independent manner FSIQ, behaviour and body mass index, possibly through direct influences on neural circuitry. Although non-specific, these features are clinically significant and reproducible. Lastly, this study demonstrates the necessity of studying large patient cohorts ascertained through multiple methods to characterise the clinical consequences of rare variants involved in common diseases...|$|R
