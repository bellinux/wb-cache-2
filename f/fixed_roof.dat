5|$|Telenor Arena, {{sometimes}} referred to as Fornebu Arena, is a multi-purpose indoor arena located at Fornebu in Bærum, outside Oslo, Norway. It serves as a venue for a variety of events, including concerts, exhibitions, action shows, family shows, TV and sport. It has a capacity for 15,000 spectators for sports and 23,000 for concerts, including 40 luxury boxes and club seating for 1,200. The venue has a <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> and an asphalt floor. The venue was opened ahead of the 2009 Norwegian football season as a replacement for Nadderud Stadion. It cost 585 million Norwegian kroner (NOK) to build, of which NOK300 million was for the sports venue.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{completion}} of the 2007 Championships, the new <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> was put in place, in time for the 2008 Championships. The retractable section of the new roof was completed for the 2009 Championships.|$|E
25|$|Sedan: A car seating four or {{more with}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> that is full-height up to the rear window. Known in British English as a saloon. Sedans can have 2 or 4-doors. This {{is the most common}} body style. In the U.S., this term has been used to denote a car with fixed window frames, as opposed to the hardtop style wherein the sash, if any, winds down with the glass.|$|E
50|$|Four new {{passenger}} carriages entered service in 2014. They are also 16-seat semi-open vehicles, painted dark green and red, but with <b>fixed</b> <b>roofs</b> and facilities for disabled access. They were built by Alan Keef.|$|R
5000|$|After {{university}} he had {{a variety}} of jobs including : digging ice tunnels for glaciologists on Monte Rosa in Switzerland; <b>fixing</b> <b>roofs</b> and teaching. Eventually he settled as a geophysicist for British Petroleum (BP), specialising in Africa.|$|R
50|$|A clout is a {{relatively}} short, thick nail with a large, flat head used for attaching sheet material to wooden frames or sheet. A typical use is <b>fixing</b> <b>roofing</b> felt {{to the top of}} a shed. They are usually made of galvanised mild steel, but copper clouts are also available.|$|R
2500|$|Coupé: A 2-door, 2- or 4-seat {{car with}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>roof.</b> Its doors are often longer than those of an {{equivalent}} sedan and the rear passenger area smaller; the roof may also be low. In cases where the rear seats are very small and not intended for regular use it is called a 2+2 (pronounced [...] "two plus two"). Originally, a coupé was required to have only one side window per side, but this consideration has not been used for many years. Occasionally seen as Fixed Head Coupé, or FHC, particularly when referring to a hardtop version of a convertible.|$|E
2500|$|The Z06 model {{replaced}} the FRC model {{as the highest}} performance C5 Corvette. Instead of a heavier double-overhead cam engine like the ZR-1 of the C4 generation, the Z06 used an LS6, a [...] derivative of the standard LS1 engine. Using the much more rigid <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> design allowed the Z06 unprecedented handling thanks to upgraded brakes and less body flex. Those characteristics, along {{with the use of}} materials such as a titanium exhaust system and a carbon fiber hood in the 2004 model year, led to further weight savings and performance gains for the C5 Z06. The LS6 was later upgraded to for 2002–2004. Although the Z06's rated power output equal to that of the C4 ZR-1, the improved rigidity, suspension, brakes, and reduced weight of the C5 produced a car quicker than C4 ZR-1.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>roof</b> {{tanks are}} {{typically}} used with products that have relatively low volatilities and flash points. Using a <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> tank to store a product with high volatility {{can lead to}} product losses as vapors escape the enclosure.|$|E
50|$|During the off-seasons, {{there are}} work weekends, during which alumni, staff, and kids {{participate}} in work activities, such as wood chip spreading or <b>fixing</b> <b>roofs.</b> An Alumni weekend {{provides an opportunity}} for alumni to reconnect. All of these events are hosted at Chimney Corners Camp because of the heated and insulated cabins.|$|R
50|$|The early trams had open upper decks, {{a form of}} roll top {{retractable}} cover, {{known as}} the 'Kennington roof' was trialled on the roofless trams in 1904; these were not totally successful, and <b>fixed</b> <b>roofs</b> were installed from 1906 onwards. From 1919 the drivers positions and the balcony's of the upper decks began to be enclosed.|$|R
30|$|A further {{example is}} the roofing {{industry}} (RS). Here {{there is a strong}} complementarity with other construction activities since every building requires a roof. Also, repairs should be expected to exhibit low price sensitivity because one has to <b>fix</b> <b>roof</b> damages immediately if possible massive further damages are to be avoided. Again, substitutions of labor through capital or new roofing techniques that are less labor-intensive can become a strategy of the firm.|$|R

50|$|A <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> tank {{is a type}} {{of storage}} tank, used to store liquids, {{consisting}} of a cone- or dome-shaped roof that is permanently affixed to a cylindrical shell. Newer storage tanks are typically fully welded and designed to be both liquid- and vapor-tight. Older tanks, however, are often riveted or bolted, and are not vapor tight. A breather valve (pressure-vacuum valve), commonly installed on many <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> tanks, allows the tank to operate at a slight internal pressure or vacuum. This valve prevents the release of vapors during very small changes in temperature, barometric pressure, or liquid level. <b>Fixed</b> <b>roof</b> tanks without breather valves will generally be freely vented; thus the emissions from a <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> tank can be non-trivial. Gauge hatches, sample wells, float gauges, and roof manholes provide accessibility to these tanks, and also act as potential sources of volatile emissions.|$|E
50|$|A special rule {{exists in}} covered {{baseball}} facilities (retractable or <b>fixed</b> <b>roofed),</b> where a batted ball striking the roof, roof supporting structure, or objects {{suspended from the}} roof (e.g., speakers) while in fair territory is still considered to be in flight. Rules for batted balls striking any of those objects in foul territory differ between ballparks, with most considering such a ball to still be in flight, and some considering {{it to be a}} foul ball and dead from the time it strikes.|$|R

5000|$|The Bennett Freeze was a {{development}} ban on 1.5 {{million acres of}} Navajo lands by the US Federal Government. It {{was put in place}} in 1966 in order to promote negotiations over a land dispute between the Navajo and the Hopi and lasted until 2009. It was named for the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at the time, Robert L Bennett and meant that in the [...] "frozen" [...] area, no development at all could occur. This included <b>fixing</b> <b>roofs,</b> building houses, constructing gas and water lines, and repairing roads.|$|R

5000|$|The term 'Dutch barn' {{has been}} used in the U.K. both to {{describe}} such structures with <b>fixed</b> <b>roofs</b> and those with adjustable roofs. [...] The latter type are also, confusingly, sometimes called French barns. Due to their ease of construction these structures are often considered temporary and appear and disappear in the landscape; the interval is often determined by the life of the pole upright or the corrugated iron roof. They are often constructed with a rounded or arched corrugated iron roof and with metal uprights, although frequently, telegraph poles are used for the uprights.|$|R

50|$|The roof {{is made of}} {{aluminum}} and {{is made up of}} three separate sections. The fan grills and roof slope area belong to the roof sections, and can be removed as part of the roof, making the entire width of the body available for work on the machinery inside. The roof sections are resting on the side panels, their connecting belts, and the <b>fixed</b> <b>roofs</b> of the driver's cabs, and a floating seal is built into the sections. The roof sections are completely flat for aerodynamic reasons, {{with the exception of the}} pantographs, the signal horns, and the antenna for radio communication.|$|R

50|$|The C107/SLC was a 4-seat {{car with}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> and an {{optional}} sliding steel sunroof. It replaced the W111 Coupé in 1971 {{and was replaced by}} the C126 S-class coupe in 1981.|$|E
50|$|A {{cabriolet}} version was also available. Based on the Rekord C coupé, {{this was a}} coach-built conversion produced by the body builders Karl Deutsch. The approach made them very much more expensive than other cars in the range: the cabriolet cost DM 4,000 more than the coupé on which it was based. Not many Rekord C cabriolets were sold, amid increasing concerns, during the later 1960s, that open topped cars (without roll-over bars) might be more dangerous {{in the event of}} a crash than cars with <b>fixed</b> <b>roofs.</b> An alternative cabriolet conversion, based on the Rekord C 2-door sedan, was developed by Karmann of Osnabrück. This never went into anything approaching volume production, although four pre-production examples are believed still to survive.|$|R

50|$|A {{different}} {{take on the}} multipurpose concept {{can be seen in}} the Saitama Super Arena in Japan and U Arena, a stadium set to open in 2017 near La Défense in the inner suburbs of Paris. Both venues are similar to the Carrier Dome in that they are fully enclosed stadiums (though with <b>fixed</b> <b>roofs</b> instead of the Carrier Dome's air-supported roof) that can accommodate field and indoor court sports. However, they differ from the Carrier Dome in the specific way they accommodate court sports. Both the Super Arena (used mainly for basketball, volleyball, mixed martial arts, and professional wrestling events) and U Arena (the future home of rugby union's Racing 92) feature movable seating blocks that allow each facility to serve as an appropriately sized venue for either field or court sports.|$|R
