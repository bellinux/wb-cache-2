40|$|This study investigates {{changes to}} the annual {{temperature}} cycle in both observed records and output from a coupled ocean-atmosphere global climate model. Using least-squares harmonic analysis, {{changes to the}} observed annual harmonic (for the time period 1856 - 1998), {{in addition to the}} 1961 - 1990 climatology, are compared with 9 simulations from the HadCM 2 model. The first simulation is a 1400 yr control integration, whilst the remainder are from 2 ensembles representing (1) increases in CO 2 concentrations and (2) a combination of CO 2 and sulphate aerosol increases. Observed and simulated climatologies are generally comparable, although large amplitude and phase discrepancies exist over northern North America and high-latitude oceans, respectively. The agreement may be partly artificial over the oceans due to the use of flux adjustments to maintain a realistic sea-surface temperature field. Observed northern hemisphere amplitude decreases during the 20 th century agree well with simulated changes, although there are some regional differences; observed changes to the southern hemisphere amplitude are insignificant. The sign of northern hemisphere phase changes are opposite in the 2 data sets. The nature of these results is unchanged after consideration is given to the varying spatial coverage of the observed data set, by means of applying a frozen grid mask to both observed and simulated data. These findings are consistent with previous studies, though we extend them by updating the observed record, by using ensembles to better define the climate change signal, and by considering the <b>direct</b> effects of <b>sulphate</b> aerosols. For a given warming, the inclusion of aerosols results in an enhanced amplitude decrease within the northern hemisphere, related to the summertime maximum of the <b>direct</b> <b>sulphate</b> cooling effect...|$|R

ELISA test using A. hydrophila as the coating antigen revealed that the specific antibody titer started to increase in the egg yolk at the 13 th day post-immunization (P/N= 2. 18), reached the peak at the 56 th day (P/N= 13. 82), and remained at high level until day 133 (P/N= 7. 03). The antibody was purified by saturated ammonium <b>sulphate</b> with a <b>recovery</b> rate of 63. 5 %. The specific IgY inhibited the growth of A. hydrophila at a concentration of 1. 0 mg/ml during the 18 h incubation. Pre-treatment of polyploid gibel carps Carassius auratus Gibelio with specific IgY had a protection rate of 60 % (6 / 10) against challenge with A. hydrophila, while none of the fishes in the control groups receiving sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or non-specific IgY survived the challenge. Treatment of fishes with the specific IgY 4 h after the challenge also had lower mortality (70 %, 7 / 10), a 30 % reduction against the control PBS or non-specific IgY groups (10 / 10).

40|$|Palaeoproterozoic Tulomozero Formation carbonates of the Onega basin were {{targeted}} by ICDP FAR-DEEP Hole 10 B. The recovered rocks contain abundant evidence for Palaeoproterozoic gypsum and anhydrite, {{particularly in the}} form of pseudomorphs of inclusion-containing nodules, swallow-tail twinned crystals and evaporite dissolution breccias. Similarly, sand-patch fabric indicates the former presence of surface-covering salt crusts in the Palaeoproterozoic. Atmospheric oxygen and seawater sulphate levels at that time must have been sufficient to allow such sulphates to form. Carbonate δ 13 C values are considered sedimentary or early diagenetic, predating greenschist facies metamorphism associated with the Svecofennian Orogeny. These carbonate δ 13 C values range from + 7. 7 to + 15. 7 ‰, with the highest (and lowest) values found in dolostones. The dolostones as well as calcitised calcium sulphates record the Lomagundi-Jatuli signal. However evidence for activity of sulphate-reducing and/or methanogenic bacteria seems to be lacking. Dolomite precipitation (or dolomitisation), calcium sulphate calcitisation and production of the high 13 C values (processes which typically involve such bacteria in the Phanerozoic) are thus inferred to have proceeded without the <b>direct</b> influence of <b>sulphate</b> reducers and methanogens.

40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of copper {{sulphate}} on the flotation of Mt Keith pentlandite ores was studied. As Mt Keith operates separate size flotation circuits, e. g. slime (− 8 μm), fine (− 25 μm) and coarse (− 160 μm) circuits, tests were conducted on streams of different particle size distributions prepared {{with the use of}} cyclones. The flotation response with and without the addition of copper sulphate was examined, first, on feed streams prepared by a laboratory grinding mill and cyclone and, second, on streams collected directly from the plant. It was found that copper sulphate had an adverse effect on flotation performance when the flotation feeds were prepared in the laboratory. In the flotation of slime-fine fractions that combined slime and fine particles, the addition of copper sulphate depressed nickel flotation while increasing gangue entrainment. In the flotation of coarse fractions, the addition of copper sulphate depressed nickel flotation without affecting gangue entrainment. However, when samples were collected directly from the plant streams and floated in a laboratory flotation cell, the addition of copper <b>sulphate</b> increased nickel <b>recovery</b> without affecting gangue entrainment in the flotation of slime, fine and coarse fractions. To explain this discrepancy, pulp chemistries in the two different types of tests were compared. It was found that the plant mills at Mt Keith produced a much more reducing grinding environment than the laboratory mill. This might contribute to the completely different behaviour which copper sulphate exhibited on flotation performance.

Interestingly, the anti-heparan sulphate antibody HS 4 C 3, which is directed against a downregulated epitope, interfered with the binding of hepatocyte growth factor. Three patients with the most severe airway obstruction also demonstrated interference of heparan sulphate antibody A 04 B 08 with hepatocyte growth factor binding. Results indicate changes in glycosaminoglycan composition in the diaphragm of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{chemical}} environment determines the success of the flotation process, however its characterisation and control is difficult to achieve. This paper, as two parts, Part I and Part II, evaluates the use of various measurements and their interpretation to gain an understanding of the influence of varying parameters such as the type of milling media and copper sulphate addition on the flotation performance of sulphide minerals from a platinum group mineral (PGM) bearing Merensky ore. It shows the complexity of interpretation and the importance of analysing flotation performance holistically. Part I focuses on the pulp chemistry and mineral potential measurements have been used to show the differences in the response of the various mineral electrodes to different conditions. The final flotation recoveries of the sulphide minerals in the ore followed the same trend as the decrease in mineral potential due to collector addition viz. chalcopyrite > pentlandite > pyrrhotite. Type of milling media and copper sulphate addition slightly affected the mineral electrode potential and flotation recovery of chalcopyrite. Addition of copper <b>sulphate</b> increased the <b>recovery</b> of pentlandite and particularly pyrrhotite due to activation by copper (II) ions. The copper activation mechanism was likely to be in the form of initial adsorption of copper hydroxide followed by reduction to Cu+ at the surface. However, the changes in flotation performance of the different minerals in the ore could not be completely described by the electrochemical changes, demonstrating the limitations of these measurements. Part II addresses the effect of froth stability as demonstrated by the variations in the mass and water recovery data resulting from the different milling conditions and addition of copper sulphate which emphasised the importance of considering the froth phase in the evaluation of flotation data...|$|R

All the copolymers were constructed on the basis of different number of silk/elastin blocks and silk:elastin block ratios. The rationale is that by modifying the polymer structure it will exhibit different properties that will be further explored. Recombinant protein expression was achieved in Escherichia coli strain BL 21 (DE 3) and purified by a chromatographic and non-chromatographic method.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on the solid solution – aqueous solution (SS-AS) equilibria in the (Ba,Sr,Ra) SO 4 +H 2 O system is primarily {{determined by a}} change in the aqueous solubilities of the end members BaSO 4, SrSO 4 and RaSO 4. The dependence of the solubility vs. the temperature for an MSO 4 sulphate is, in turn, determined by the entropy and the heat capacity effects of the reaction MSO 4 = M 2 + + SO 42 −. The missing data for M = Ra are estimated here by a combination of atomistic simulations, a Debye-Einstein extrapolation of known thermodynamic properties of MSO 4 <b>sulphates,</b> <b>direct</b> experimental measurements of solid solubility in the system (Ba,Ra) SO 4 +H 2 O at 70 and 90 °C, and thermodynamic modelling with the aid of the GEM-Selektor code.

Our results, consistent with earlier studies, show that the uptake of Ra by (Ba,Sr) SO 4 barite solid solutions at about 25 °C is favoured by a lower solubility of RaSO 4 relative to those of BaSO 4 and SrSO 4, however, with increasing temperature, the solubilities of MSO 4 solids converge. Consequently, an increase in temperature makes the Ra uptake by Ba,Sr sulphates less efficient. In a radioactive waste repository relevant system, this effect would be partially compensated by the common anion and the dilution effects, which both enhance the Ra-uptake...|$|R
40|$|Explants of {{cartilage}} from tibiae of 11 – 12 days chick embryos {{were grown}} in organ culture. To one group hyaluronidase {{was added to}} the medium during the first 2 days of culture; the treated tissue was then cultured in medium without enzyme for a further 4 days. Control explants grown in hyaluronidase-free medium for 6 days grew rapidly in size and the total hexosamine content more than doubled during this time. After exposure to hyaluronidase, much of the hexosamine was lost from treated cartilage and appeared in the culture medium, but it was mostly replaced in the tissue during the subsequent recovery period. Analysis of cartilage and medium showed that net synthesis of hexosamine increased greatly in treated cartilage. The proteoglycans were extracted by two procedures from control and treated cartilage after 2, 4 and 6 days in culture. The hydrodynamic sizes of the purified proteoglycans were compared by gel chromatography and the composition of the gel-chromatographic fractions was determined. The proteoglycans from controls did not change during culture, but after exposure to hyaluronidase the proteoglycans from treated cartilage were of much smaller size and lower chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> content. During <b>recovery,</b> even though new proteoglycans were formed, they were nevertheless of smaller size and lower chondroitin sulphate content than control proteoglycans.

After 2 days of treatment with the enzyme, the chondroitin sulphate in the cartilage was of shorter chain length than in controls but during recovery after 4 and 6 days in culture, the chain lengths in control and treated cartilage were similar. It is concluded that the proteoglycans formed in embryo cartilage in response to their depletion by enzyme treatment contained fewer chondroitin sulphate chains attached to the protein moiety of proteoglycans. This may have resulted from a failure under stress to glycosylate the protein moiety to the usual extent; alternatively the synthesis of normal proteoglycans of low chondroitin sulphate content may have increased, thus changing the proteoglycan population...|$|R

This includes presentation of RF histories of well mixed greenhouse gases, tropospheric ozone, direct- and indirect aerosol effects, surface albedo changes, stratospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapour. For long lived greenhouse gases, standard methods are used for calculating RF, based on global mean concentration changes. For short lived climate forcers, detailed chemical transport modelling and radiative transfer modelling using historical emission inventories is performed. For the <b>direct</b> aerosol effect, <b>sulphate,</b> black carbon, organic carbon, nitrate and secondary organic aerosols are considered. For aerosol indirect effects, time series of both the cloud lifetime effect and the cloud albedo effect are presented. Radiative forcing time series due to surface albedo changes are calculated based on prescribed changes in land use and radiative transfer modelling. For the stratospheric components, simple scaling methods are used. Long lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs) are the most important radiative forcing agent with a RF of 2. 83 &plusmn; 0. 28 W m− 2 in year 2010 relative to 1750. The two main aerosol components contributing to the direct aerosol effect are black carbon and sulphate, but their contributions are of opposite sign. The total direct aerosol effect was − 0. 48 &plusmn; 0. 32 W m− 2 in year 2010. Since pre-industrial times the positive RF (LLGHGs and tropospheric O 3 ) has been offset mainly by the direct and indirect aerosol effects, especially {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century, which possibly lead to a decrease in the total anthropogenic RF in the middle of the century. We find a total anthropogenic RF in year 2010 of 1. 4 W m− 2 . However, the uncertainties in the negative RF from aerosols are large, especially for the cloud lifetime effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) precipitation to long term changes in regional anthropogenic aerosols (sulphate and black carbon) is explored in an atmospheric general circulation model, the atmospheric {{component of the}} UK High-Resolution Global Environment Model v 1. 2 (HiGAM). Separately, sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and black carbon (BC) emissions in 1950 and 2000 over East Asia are used to drive model simulations, while emissions are kept constant at year 2000 level outside this region. The {{response of}} the EASM is examined by comparing simulations driven by aerosol emissions representative of 1950 and 2000. The aerosol radiative effects are also determined using an off-line radiative transfer model. During June, July and August, the EASM was not significantly changed as either SO 2 or BC emissions increased from 1950 to 2000 levels. However, in September, precipitation is significantly decreased by 26. 4 % for sulphate aerosol and 14. 6 % for black carbon when emissions are at the 2000 level. Over 80 % of the decrease is attributed to changes in convective precipitation. The cooler land surface temperature over China in September (0. 8 °C for sulphate and 0. 5 °C for black carbon) due to increased aerosols reduces the surface thermal contrast that supports the EASM circulation. However, mechanisms causing the surface temperature decrease in September are different between sulphate and BC experiments. In the sulphate experiment, the <b>sulphate</b> <b>direct</b> and the 1 st indirect radiative effects contribute to the surface cooling. In the BC experiment, the BC direct effect is the main driver of the surface cooling, however, a decrease in low cloud cover due to the increased heating by BC absorption partially counteracts the direct effect. This results in a weaker land surface temperature response to BC changes than to sulphate changes. The resulting precipitation response is also weaker, and {{the responses of the}} monsoon circulation are different for sulphate and black carbon experiments. This study demonstrates a mechanism that links regional aerosol emission changes to the precipitation changes of the EASM, and it could be applied to help understand the future changes in EASM precipitation in CMIP 5 simulations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMajor fluxes of sulphur and {{dissolved}} inorganic nitrogen {{were estimated}} in Central European mountain ecosystems of the Bohemian Forest (forest lakes) and Tatra Mountains (alpine lakes) over the industrial period. Sulphur outputs from these ecosystems were comparable to inputs {{during a period}} of relatively stable atmospheric deposition (10 - 35 mmol m - 2 yr - 1) around the 1930 s. Atmospheric inputs of sulphur increased by three- to four-fold between the 1950 s and 1980 s to ~ 140 and ~ 60 mmol mm - 2 yr - 1 in the Bohemian Forest and Tatra Mountains, respectively. Sulphur outputs were lower than inputs due to accumulation in soils, which was higher in forest soils than in the sparser alpine soils and represented 0. 8 - 1. 6 and 0. 2 - 0. 3 mol m - 2, respectively, for the whole 1930 - 2000 period. In the 1990 s, atmospheric inputs of sulphur decreased 80 % and 50 % in the Bohemian Forest and Tatra Mountains, respectively, and sulphur outputs exceeded inputs. Catchment soils became pronounced sources of sulphur with output fluxes averaging between 15 and 31 mmol m - 2 yr - 1. Higher sulphur accumulation in the forest soils has delayed (by several decades) recovery of forest lakes from acidification compared to alpine lakes. Estimated deposition of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was 53 - 75 mmol m - 2 yr - 1 in the Bohemian Forest and 35 - 45 mmol m - 2 yr - 1 in the Tatra Mountains in the 1880 - 1950 period, i. e. below the empirically derived threshold of ~ 70 mmol m - 2 yr - 1, above which nitrogen leaching often occurs. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen was efficiently retained in the ecosystems and nitrate export was negligible (0 - 7 mmol m - 2 yr - 1). By the 1980 s, nitrogen deposition increased to ~ 160 and ~ 80 mmol m - 2 yr - 1 in the Bohemian Forest and Tatra Mountains, respectively, and nitrogen output increased to 120 and 60 mmol m - 2 yr - 1. Moreover, assimilation of nitrogen in soils declined from ~ 40 to 10 - 20 mmol m - 2 yr - 1 in the alpine soils and even more in the Bohemian Forest, where one of the catchments has even become a net source of nitrogen. In the 1990 s, nitrogen deposition decreased by ~ 30 % and DIN output decreased to - 2 yr - 1 in the Bohemian Forest and Tatra Mountains, respectively. New steady-state conditions, with negligible nitrogen export, could be reached in future but at lower nitrogen depositions than in the 1930 s.

40|$|At present several {{primary and}} {{secondary}} treatment techniques {{have been used to}} remove iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) from low polluting textile wastewaters. However past surveys and studies carried out in the industrial areas of Sri Lanka have revealed that contamination of waterways and groundwater with Fe and Mn has been still high indicating that proper methods are neither in existence nor efficient to remove them from low polluting wastewaters. Therefore in this article we discuss the performance of an upflow anaerobic bioreactor, which is used to remove Fe and Mn from textile wastewaters. A laboratory scale study on Fe and Mn removal in upflow anaerobic bioreactor of a working volume of 20 litres with coir fibre as the filter medium was investigated for a period of 312 days using a synthetic wastewater with similar physical and chemical characteristics of a typical textile effluent. The usage of coir fibre can be justified considering its high surface area per unit volume, hence providing more area for the biofilm formation. The maximum Fe and Mn levels considered were 10 mg/l and 5 mg/l respectively, which are the typical average values of textile effluents subsequent to the {{primary and secondary}} treatments in Sri Lanka. Ten sub experimental runs (R 0 -R 9) were conducted with varying HRTs (5 days to 1 day), ratios of COD:SO 42 - (20 to 3. 5), Fe levels (0. 005 to 10 mg/l) and Mn levels (0 to 5 mg/l). During initial stages good gas production, high COD removal and relatively low sulphate reduction were observed, indicating major proliferation of methane producing bacteria (MPBs). COD:SO 42 - of 3. 5 was identified as the optimum point at which sulphate reducing bacteria (SRBs) out competed MPBs and further reduction of this ratio caused total and/or significant inhibition of MPBs, thus making conditions favourable for bacterial immobilisation of Fe and Mn. After this point the gas production ceased while the system started giving rotten egg smell, as a result of H 2 S production taking place due to the metabolism of SRBs. The results indicated highly satisfactory percentage of Fe and Mn removal, in which the effluent contained Fe and Mn below the permissible levels (1. 6 mg/l and 1. 1 mg/l for Fe and Mn respectively) stipulated by US National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for inland surface waters at HRTs higher than 3 days. Results of the mass balance showed more Fe accumulation (65 %) in sediments whereas 27 % in the filter media. On the other hand out of the accumulated Mn, sediments contained only 26 %, where as 65 % were found to be attached to the filter media. Both metals in sediments mainly consist in the form of sulphides, indicating a sulphate reduction being the major mechanism of removal.

40|$|This chapter {{assesses the}} current state of {{knowledge}} of the rate of change of global-averaged and regional sea-level in relation to climate change. We focus on the 20 th and 21 st centuries. However, because of the slow response to past conditions of the oceans and ice sheets and the consequent land movements, we consider changes in sea level prior to the historical record, andwe also look over a thousand years into the future. Past changes in sea levelFrom recent analyses, our conclusions are as follows:since the Last Glacial Maximum about 20 000 years ago, sea level has risen by over 120 m at locations far from present and former ice sheets, as a result of loss of mass from these ice sheets. There was a rapid rise between 15 000 and 6000 years ago at an average rate of 10 mm/yr. based on geological data, global average sea level may have risen at an average rate of 0. 5 mm/yr over the last 6000 years and at an average rate of 0. 1 to 0. 2 mm/yr over the last 3000 years. vertical land movements are still occurring today {{as a result of these}} large transfers of mass from the ice sheets to the ocean. during the last 6000 years, global average sea-level variations on the time scales of a few hundred years and longer are likely to have been less than 0. 3 to 0. 5 m. based on tide gauge data, the rate of global average sea-level rise during the 20 th century is in the range 1. 0 to 2. 0 mm/yr, with a central value of 1. 5 mm/yr (as with other ranges of uncertainty, it is not implied that the central value is the best estimate). based on the few very long tide-gauge records, the average rate of sea-level rise has been larger during the 20 th century than the 19 th century. no significant acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise during the 20 th century has been detected. there is decadal variability in extreme sea levels but no evidence of widespread increases in extremes other than that associated with a change in the mean. Factors affecting present day sea level changeGlobal average sea level is affected by many factors. Our assessment of the most important is as follows. Ocean thermal expansion leads to an increase in ocean volume at constant mass. Observational estimates of about 1 mm/yr over recent decades are similar to values of 0. 7 to 1. 1 mm/yr obtained from Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) over a comparable period. Averaged over the 20 th century, AOGCM simulations result in rates of thermal expansion of 0. 3 to 0. 7 mm/yr. The mass of the ocean, and thus sea level, changes as water is exchanged with glaciers and ice caps. Observational and modelling studies of glaciers and ice-caps indicate a contribution to sea-level rise of 0. 2 to 0. 4 mm/yr averaged over the 20 th century. Climate changes during the 20 th century are estimated from modelling studies to have led to contributions of between Ð 0. 2 and 0. 0 mm/yr from Antarctica (the results of increasing precipitation) and 0. 0 to 0. 1 mm/yr from Greenland (from changes in both precipitation and runoff). Greenland and Antarctica have contributed 0. 0 to 0. 5 mm/yr over the 20 th century as a result of long term adjustment to past climate changes. Changes in terrestrial storage of water over the period 1910 to 1990 are estimated to have contributed from Ð 1. 1 to + 0. 4 mm/yr of sea-level rise. The sum of these components indicates a rate of eustatic sea-level rise (corresponding to a change in ocean volume) from 1910 to 1990 ranging from Ð 0. 8 mm/yr to 2. 2 mm/yr, with a central value of 0. 7 mm/yr. The upper bound is close to the observational upper bound (2. 0 mm/yr), but the central value bound is less than the observational lower bound (1. 0 mm/yr), i. e. the sum of components is biased low compared to the observational estimates. The sum of components indicates an acceleration of only 0. 2 mm/yr/century, with a range from Ð 1. 1 to + 0. 7 mm/yr/century, consistent with observational finding of no acceleration in sea-level rise during the 20 th century. The estimated rate of sea-level rise from anthropogenic climate change from 1910 to 1990 (from modelling studies of thermal expansion, glaciers and ice-sheets) ranges from 0. 3 to 0. 8 mm/yr. It is very likely that 20 th century warming has contributed significantly to the observed sea level rise, through thermal expansion of sea water and widespread loss of land ice. Projected sea-level changes from 1990 to 2100 Projections of components contributing to sea-level change from 1990 to 2100 (this period is chosen for consistency with the IPCC Second Assessment Report), using a range of AOGCMs following the IS 92 a scenario (including the <b>direct</b> effect of <b>sulphate</b> aerosol emissions) give:thermal expansion of 0. 11 to 0. 43 m, accelerating through the 21 st century. a glacier contribution of 0. 01 to 0. 23 m. a Greenland contribution of - 0. 02 to 0. 09 m. an Antarctic contribution of - 0. 17 to 0. 02 m. Including thawing of permafrost, deposition of sediment, and the ongoing contributions from ice sheets as a result of climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum, we obtain a range of global-average sea-level rise from 0. 11 to 0. 77 m. This range reflects systematic uncertainties in modelling. For the 35 SRES scenarios, we project a sea-level rise of 0. 09 to 0. 88 m for 1990 to 2100, with a central value of 0. 48 m. The central value gives an average rate of 2. 2 to 4. 4 times the rate over the 20 th century. If terrestrial storage continued at its present rates, the projections could be changed by - 0. 21 to 0. 11 m. For an average AOGCM, the SRES scenarios give results which differ by 0. 02 m or less for the first half of the 21 st century. By 2100, they vary over a range amounting to about 50 % of the central value. Beyond the 21 st century, sea level rise will depend strongly on the emission scenario. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has attracted special attention because it contains enough ice to raise sea level by 6 m and because of suggestions that instabilities associated with its being grounded below sea level may result in rapid ice discharge when the surrounding ice shelves are weakened. The range of projections given above makes no allowance for ice-dynamic instability of the WAIS. It is now widely agreed that major loss of grounded ice and accelerated sea-level rise are very unlikely during the 21 st century. Our confidence in the regional distribution of sea level change from AOGCMs is low because there is little similarity between models. However, models agree on the qualitative conclusion that the range of regional variation is substantial compared with the global average sea-level rise. Nearly all models project greater than average rise in the Arctic Ocean and less than average rise in the Southern Ocean. Land movements, both isostatic and tectonic, will continue through the 21 st century at rates which are unaffected by climate change. It can be expected that by 2100 many regions currently experiencing relative sea-level fall will instead have a rising relative sea level. Extreme high water levels will occur with increasing frequency (i. e. with reducing return period) as a result of mean sea-level rise. Their frequency may be further increased if storms become more frequent or severe as a result of climate change. Longer term changesIf greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilised, sea level would nonetheless continue to rise for hundreds of years. After 500 years, sea-level rise from thermal expansion may have reached only half of its eventual level, which models suggest may lie within ranges of 0. 5 to 2. 0 m and 1 to 4 m for CO 2 levels twice and four times pre-industrial, respectively. Glacier retreat will continue and the loss of a substantial fraction of the total glacier mass is likely. Areas that are currently marginally glaciated are most likely to become ice-free. Ice sheets will continue to react to climate change during the next several thousand years even if the climate is stabilised. Models project that a local annual-average warming of larger than 3 °C sustained for millennia would lead to virtually a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet. For a warming over Greenland of 5. 5 °C, consistent with mid-range stabilisation scenarios, theGreenland ice sheet contributes about 3 m in 1000 years. For a warming of 8 °C, the contribution is about 6 m, the ice sheet being largely eliminated. For smaller warmings, the decay of the ice sheet would be substantially slower. Current ice dynamic models project that the WAIS will contribute no more than 3 mm/yr to sea-level rise over the next thousand years, even if significant changes were to occur in the ice shelves. However, we note that its dynamics are still inadequately understood to make firm projections, especially on the longer time scales. Apart from the possibility of an internal ice dynamic instability, surface melting will affect the long-term viability of the Antarctic ice sheet. For warmings of more than 10 °C, simple runoff models predict that an ablation zone would develop on the ice sheet surface. Irreversible disintegration of the WAIS would result because the WAIS cannot retreat to higher ground once its margins are subjected to surface melting and begin to recede. Such a disintegration would take at least a few millennia. Thresholds for total disintegration of the East Antarctic ice sheet by surface melting involve warmings above 20 *C, a situation that has not occurred for at least 15 million years and which is far more than predicted by any scenario of climate change currently under consideration...|$|R
