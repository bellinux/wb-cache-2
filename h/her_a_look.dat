60|$|Again Soames gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> which, but for {{the affection}} in it, might have been called furtive.|$|E
60|$|He gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of such {{bitterness}} {{that she}} felt it impossible to continue a pretence which deceived neither of them.|$|E
6000|$|He {{bestowed}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of mingling {{wonder and}} anger. Had he, indeed, heard her aright? Did her words imply that she disdained the honour? ...|$|E
60|$|He gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> curious <b>look,</b> which, soon {{melted into}} an amused smile.|$|R
60|$|He gave <b>her</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>look,</b> {{in which}} pride, perplexity and astonishment mingled.|$|R
60|$|Wilkinson gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> curious <b>look,</b> {{but said}} nothing and she went out.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Chudleigh gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of {{thoughtful}} candour. [...] "I {{was puzzled}} and interested. I don't know him, {{but he did}} not look the man to run away." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} turned on <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> that said: 'It's no use {{calling me a}} brute; I'm proud of being one. Besides, you know you don't dislike it.' ...|$|E
60|$|As I come in, {{she jumped}} up, and stood staring at me. I {{went to the}} tap, and turned the flow off, and then I gives <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Datchery, with {{a sudden}} change of countenance, gives <b>her</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>look.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{turned red}} {{and started back}} from <b>her</b> with <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of great alarm and horror.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Burton {{shook his}} head. [...] "No, she might find out," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "I {{think that the}} best thing is for you to go home after dinner, Joe, and just give <b>’er</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> in on the way, p’r’aps. You could say a lot o’ things about me in ’arf an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You dear, dear girl!" [...] {{he cried}} softly. [...] "Oh, I just wish I had {{you all to}} myself for a moment!" [...] And he gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> that spoke volumes.|$|E
60|$|I gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> {{that made}} her catch 'er breath, and I was just {{stepping}} through the wicket, when she laid hold of my coat and tried to hold me back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Persis," [...] said Lapham, [...] "go to bed," [...] {{and he gave}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> {{that meant}} {{obedience}} for her. She {{went out of the}} door, and left him with his tempter.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Holt gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> quick <b>look,</b> but beheld in Honora's clear eyes only eagerness and ingenuousness.|$|R
60|$|Edmund Arundel's eye it {{was that}} was glancing at <b>her</b> with <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of great {{amusement}} at her bewilderment.|$|R
60|$|Charnock {{was silent}} for some moments {{and then turned to}} <b>her</b> with <b>a</b> <b>look</b> in his face she had not seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Adam's my man,' she said, {{and at that}} I gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> {{for which}} God might have struck me dead. But instead of blaming me {{she put her arms}} round my neck.|$|E
6000|$|... "The joiner heard it, {{and gave}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> {{measuring}} her wi' his {{eye for the}} coffin. 'Five and a half by {{one and a half}} would hold her snod,' he says to himsel'." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{intensely}} fascinated. Did {{she want}} him {{to make love to}} <b>her?</b> <b>A</b> <b>look</b> at her face was enough to rebuke him for the thought. The shadows from the flickering fire played over her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You quaint goose!' said Lucy, with a {{laugh that}} jarred upon Honor, who turned round at <b>her</b> with <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of reproachful surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I ever frighten you then, Rose?" [...] asked Septimius, bending {{his black}} brow upon <b>her</b> with <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of {{surprise}} and displeasure.|$|R
6000|$|Laurie thanked <b>her</b> with <b>a</b> <b>look</b> {{that made}} <b>her</b> think in <b>a</b> sudden panic, [...] "Oh, deary me! I know he'll say something, {{and then what}} shall I do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... (But MISS SUSAN gives <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> {{which means}} {{that it must be}} done if only to avoid such a scandal. It is at this inopportune moment that MISS HENRIETTA and MISS FANNY are announced.) ...|$|E
60|$|The page glanced on <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> {{of supreme}} contempt, but vouchsafed no other answer. His mistress, {{who began to}} feel herself seriously offended, and yet sorry for the youth's folly, took up the same tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good evening, Madam Gordeloup," [...] said Harry, turning upon <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> {{of bitter}} anger. Then he went, leaving {{the two women}} together, and walked home to Bloomsbury Square--not with {{the heart of a}} joyous, {{thriving}} lover.|$|E
60|$|He gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> steady <b>look</b> and {{his face}} got rather white. The dark bruise was plainer and the blood left his lips.|$|R
60|$|The child {{stood with}} her lip between <b>her</b> teeth, <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> half, of pure misery and dismay, half of satisfaction, on her pretty sharp face.|$|R
60|$|Carnforth {{crossed the}} room and leaned on a table not far from her chair, looking down at <b>her</b> with <b>a</b> <b>look</b> from which she shrank.|$|R
6000|$|Benyon gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> {{that was}} charged with all the {{sickness}} of his helpless rage. [...] "You--you!" [...] he repeated, as {{he turned away from}} her and passed through the door which Mr. Roy had left open.|$|E
6000|$|He gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> {{which she}} found so dishonest, so really insincere, that she {{resolved}} to abandon him to Providence {{as soon as}} she could. [...] "Oh, I didn't know but there had been some little understanding at Washington." ...|$|E
60|$|Edward made no answer; {{but when}} she had turned away her head, gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might {{hereafter}} wish {{the distance between the}} parsonage and the mansion-house much greater.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Farnam gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> {{thoughtful}} <b>look.</b> [...] "Well, that's plausible; but I {{never thought}} you greedy. Why {{do you want the}} extra pay?" ...|$|R
6000|$|KEITH gives <b>her</b> <b>an</b> intent <b>look,</b> then {{crosses to}} the fire. He [...] stands there <b>a</b> moment, <b>looking</b> down, then turns to the girl, who [...] has crept back to the couch.|$|R
60|$|He gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> shrewd <b>look</b> of approval. The {{argument}} {{seemed to}} appeal to him. It quieted, to an extent, his fears for her safety.|$|R
