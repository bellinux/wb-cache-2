40|$|The {{increase}} in chilled food consumption requires enhanced {{food safety and}} quality assurance. Food deteriorating processes {{are affected by the}} presence of oxygen, combined with factors such as time and temperature. To slow down deterioration processes and prolong shelf life, traditional packaging methods are being replaced by Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP), for example. Oxygen, which is naturally present in the headspace of most food packages, is then reduced and controlled. Many sensing techniques for food quality assurance have been developed; however, almost all are intrusive, increasing the complication level and causing sample waste. The {{purpose of this article is}} to introduce a non-intrusive technique (GASMAS) for measuring gas composition in the headspace of liquid food packages. The GASMAS method uses diode laser absorption spectroscopy combined with diffuse light propagation to analyze gas located inside solids and liquids. By illuminating the package from the outside and analyzing the scattered light that emerges, the absorption from the gas inside the headspace can be studied. The GASMAS technique was evaluated on a series of carton packages with <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>orange</b> juice and a nitrogen headspace. A clear variation in oxygen content was measured for samples with different storage times. The results demonstrate the possibility of using the GASMAS method for non-intrusive quality measurements in food products and packaging. They also indicate the potential for non-intrusive quality assurance applications without waste of samples. A further development of the technique could include “in-line” quality control of packed food items throughout the food packaging supply chain...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that {{using the same}} grading standard for agricultural products from the places of shipment to the consumers is hard to be realized. The grading standard which adopted by producers is not understood by consumers. General consumers have usually doubted and distrusted the present grading method. On the other hand, producers spent considerable time and labor on grading and sorting method of the mandarin oranges. Viewing the importance of grading standard for agricultural products, this study intended to reassess the grading method that currently used in the marketing process by basing on the data analysis. It is expected that {{the result of this}} study will lead to the clarification of the grading standard used by the people concerned and simplify it. The empirical study was carried out by using the data of tracing survey of the mandarin orange in which the technique of quantification theory to be tried. The following approaches were considered for grading system: (1) Deviation of the assessment values of grading standard (classified by quality and size) among different wholesale markets, (2) The transitional change of grading assessment at the different points of the marketing channel, (3) Method of simplification of the grading system. 1. The assessment values of 2 ̆ 2 grade 2 ̆ 2 (categorized by quality) and 2 ̆ 2 class 2 ̆ 2 (categorized by size) were often different at different markets even for the same product. The price quoted by Fukuoka market was higher for the 2 ̆ 2 excellent 2 ̆ 2 quality than other markets. The price difference arisen from market assessment was likely to be wider for the grade than the class. 2. How to retain the grading standard which was classified by producer was considered. The grading, though to be done by producers, was performed {{in such a way that}} suited the interests and convenience of middlemen, and it was altered at the retail level so that the early grading was not carried to the consumers. As a result the <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>orange</b> from the famous producing area and the ordinary quality from the other areas became indiscriminately at the retailer 2 ̆ 7 s shop. It was a common practice that only the name of famous producing area was retained but that of other areas were dropped out. This fact brought about the feeling of distrust from consumers against pricing. Then, there was no difference for the rate of market margin of <b>orange</b> of different <b>quality</b> for the middlemen, there was no difference in profit rate for <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>orange</b> among different retailers but for the low quality one it had a great variation in profit rate. 3. The method of simplification of the grading sys t e m was considered. As mentioned above that grading was done to suit the interests and convenience of middlemen. Therefore, the analysis should be focused on market performance of these middlemen to simplify the grading. It should have two grades that were the 2 ̆ 2 excellent 2 ̆ 2 quality grade and the other, and had 3 sizes, namely, large (those of size 2 L and above), middle (size L, M), and small (size S and below) for assessing the present grading of the middlemen. 現在施行されている青果物の規格について検討した. 農産物は一貫した規格基準で出荷段階から最終消費段階まで流通するのが困難である,それ故,一般消費者は流通業者の経済活動に対し不信の念をいだく. 一方,生産者段階では規格区分のために多くの投下労働を必要とする. 以上のように規格を中心とする問題は多面的であり,かつ重要である. 本稿は以下の目的に沿って分析したものである. 第 1 の目的は,規格に関する実態を明確にすることである. 第 2 の目的は規格簡素化の方向性を示すことである. 温州みかんの追跡調査により得たデータを基礎にして,実態分析および計量分析(数量化理論による分析) を行う. 分析のプロセスは以下の通りである.

30|$|With {{respect to}} product quality and {{consumer}} preferences, Rudolf (2015) shows {{that despite the}} fact that other competitors (e.g. Turkey and Greece) have a more favourable geographical position with regard to their proximity to the Russian market, the competitiveness of Egyptian oranges on the Russian market relies primarily on their quality and price. Soliman (2013) assessed the competitiveness of Egyptian fresh oranges in a number of European markets, including Russia, using the global value chain analysis approach (GVCA) based on interviews with buyers and key stakeholders in these markets. His results suggest that Egyptian oranges are perceived to be of <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> than <b>oranges</b> from Turkey and Morocco. Moreover, unlike many other competing countries and due to favourable climatic conditions, Egyptian Valencia oranges do not normally experience the “re-greening phenomenon” which breaks down the colour dyes that give oranges their normal colour, causing a greenish tint, i.e. the reappearance of chlorophyll in mature oranges (Abu Hatab and Nsanimana 2016). Increased health concerns among consumers in Russian and other importing markets and fears of the use of chemicals to re-colour oranges therefore result in a high demand for Egyptian oranges on the Russian market.|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} fitness {{consequences}} of foraging on patchy resources, consumption rates, growth rates and survivorship of Armadillidium vulgare were monitored while feeding in arenas {{in which the}} spatial distribution of patches of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food (powdered dicotyledonous leaf litter) was varied within a matrix of low quality food (powdered grass leaf litter). Predictions from behavioural experiments that these fitness correlates would be lower when <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food is more heterogeneously distributed in space were tested but not supported either by laboratory or field experiments. To investigate whether A. vulgare can develop the ability to relocate <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food patches, changes in foraging behaviour, over a comparable time period to that used in the fitness experiments, were monitored in arenas {{in which there was}} a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food patch in a low quality matrix.
