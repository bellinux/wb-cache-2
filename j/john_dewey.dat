5|$|Harry Elmer Barnes {{called the}} book {{one of the}} most {{exciting}} and challenging in the field of education since Émile. (This said, Hartup of Contemporary Psychology said Summerhill was closer to Freud's Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality than to Émile and criticized Neill's psychoanalytic overemphases.) The psychoanalyst Benjamin Wolstein put Neill's work alongside that of <b>John</b> <b>Dewey,</b> and Sir Herbert Read likened Neill to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Henry Caldwell Cook. David Carr characterized the book as centered on moral education, despite Neill's recurrent insistence on the danger of moral teachings. Scholar Richard Bailey agreed with Carr's characterization.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her work at Hull House, Smith was involved in public education. Francis Wayland Parker invited her to head the vocal music department at the Chicago Normal School in 1897 and she was asked by <b>John</b> <b>Dewey</b> to teach at the University of Chicago {{as the head of}} the Department of Music, School of Education from 1901 to 1910. She not only trained teachers for Dewey but assisted him in developing a revised curriculum for the music education program. Smith also instructed courses at the Chicago Kindergarten College and at the Froebel Kindergarten College, both training colleges for teachers of very young children.|$|E

5|$|Kanō {{believed}} {{this to be}} unacceptable. He refused to play such a subservient role when teaching his students. To Kanō, a teacher must command respect. At the same time, he employed the latest European and American pedagogical methods. The theories of the American educator <b>John</b> <b>Dewey</b> especially influenced him. Kanō's manner had the desired effect upon the students, but the administration was slower to warm to his methods {{and it was not}} until the arrival of a new principal that Kanō's ideas found acceptance.|$|E
5|$|The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, {{established}} {{the first major}} American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and <b>John</b> <b>Dewey</b> were leaders {{in the development of}} pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have affected various fields in social and political philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Coonley School (ACS), {{commonly}} called Avery Coonley, is an independent, coeducational day school serving academically gifted students in preschool through eighth grade (approximately ages 3 to 14), and {{is located in}} Downers Grove, Illinois. The school was founded in 1906 to promote the progressive educational theories developed by <b>John</b> <b>Dewey</b> and other turn-of-the-20th-century philosophers, and was a nationally recognized model for progressive education well into the 1940s. From 1943 to 1965, Avery Coonley {{was part of the}} National College of Education (now National-Louis University), serving as a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. In the 1960s, ACS became a regional research center and a leadership hub for independent schools, and began to focus on the education of the gifted.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression {{and lack}} of {{outreach}} to Wisconsinites and UW faculty led to the college's slow decline. Enrollment decreased every year since the program began, which its statewide reputation exacerbated. After his son was expelled in 1931 by dean and Experimental College critic George Sellery, Meiklejohn recommended the college's dissolution. Public criticism of the college included student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. Meiklejohn wrote a retrospective of the college, which philosopher <b>John</b> <b>Dewey</b> reviewed favorably and noted for its contribution to educational philosophy. University of Wisconsin faculty and regents voted to dissolve the college in May 1932. Some advisers stayed {{to teach in the}} university, and Meiklejohn remained briefly before moving to Berkeley. The Experimental College influenced programs internal to the university, and was the precursor to its Integrated Liberal Studies undergraduate program.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the school}} {{there was an}} infant school for {{children}} under six, a primary school for children under ten, {{and there was a}} preparatory school that prepared children for college in six years. When entering the school, each pupil under high school age was assigned a woman of the community {{who was in charge of}} his/her wardrobe, personal habits, and exercise. The teachers included three graduates of Harvard Divinity School (George Ripley, George Bradford, John Sullivan Dwight) as well as several women (Ripley's wife Sophia, his sister Marianne, and his cousin Hannah, as well as Georgianna Bruce and Abby Morton). Ripley was in charge of teaching English and was known to be relaxed in his class. Dana taught languages, being able to speak ten himself. Dwight taught music as well as Latin. Students studied European languages and literature and, at no extra cost, pupils could also indulge in the fine arts. The primary school was overseen by Sophia Ripley and Marianne Ripley, using a progressive child-centered pedagogy that has been compared to the later reforms of <b>John</b> <b>Dewey.</b> Sophia Ripley's dedication to the school was remarked upon by many; she only missed two classes in six years.|$|E

40|$|<b>John</b> <b>Dewey’s</b> thought has {{influenced}} the pedagogical theories in Brazil. However, it had different interpretations {{in the country}} during the Escola Nova period. In general, these renderings discuss a learning method, and not a philosophy of education. Even, when it considers Dewey’s philosophy of education, it does not focus on its esthetics. In this article, we will present some of these interpretations and also reconstruct <b>John</b> <b>Dewey’s</b> ideas about art and esthetic experience, emphasizing his philosophy of education that is wider than a pedagogical method...|$|R

It begins by noting Dewey’s distaste for the social constructs that unnecessarily create barriers between work and leisure. It then presents his argument that this work/leisure dichotomy contributes to meaningless leisure pursuits and {{is the result of}} class-based education. Finally, and most importantly, is Dewey’s explanation that if education {{is a part of the}} problem, then it can be part of the solution...|$|R
