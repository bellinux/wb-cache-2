50|$|In {{the early}} 1830s, Michael Faraday laid the {{foundations}} of electrochemistry and solid-state ionics by discovering the motion of ions in liquid and solid electrolytes. Earlier, around 1800, Alessandro Volta used a liquid electrolyte in his voltaic pile, the first <b>electrochemical</b> <b>battery,</b> but failed to realize that ions {{are involved in the}} process. Meanwhile, in his work on decomposition of solutions by electric current, Faraday used not only the ideas of ion, cation, anion, electrode, anode, cathode, electrolyte and electrolysis, but even the present-day terms for them. Faraday associated electric current in an electrolyte with the motion of ions, and discovered that ions can exchange their charges with an electrode while they were transformed into elements by electrolysis. He quantified those processes by two laws of electrolysis. The first law (1832) stated that the mass of a product at the electrode, Δm, increases linearly with the amount of charge passed through the electrolyte, Δq. The second law (1833) established the proportionality between Δm and the “electrochemical equivalent” and defined the Faraday constant F as F = (Δq/Δm)(M/z), where M is the molar mass and z is the charge of the ion.|$|E
50|$|Electrochemical {{batteries}} can {{be modified}} to integrate the use of paper. An <b>electrochemical</b> <b>battery</b> typically uses two metals, separated into two chambers and connected by a bridge or a membrane which permits the exchange of electrons between the two metals, thereby producing energy. Paper can be integrated into electrochemical batteries by depositing the electrode onto the paper and by using paper to contain the fluid used to activate the battery. Paper that has been patterned {{can also be used}} in electrochemical batteries. This is done to make the battery more compatible with paper electronics. These batteries tend to produce low voltage and operate for short periods of time, but they can be connected in series to increase their output and capacity. Paper batteries of this type can be activated with bodily fluids which makes them very useful in the healthcare field such as single-use medical devices or tests for specific diseases.A battery of this type has been developed with a longer life to power point of care devices for the healthcare industry. The device used a paper battery made using a magnesium foil anode and a silver cathode has been used to detect diseases in patients such as kidney cancer, liver cancer, and osteoblastic bone cancer. The paper was patterned using wax printing and is able to be easily disposed of. Furthermore, this battery was developed at a low cost and has other practical application.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines <b>electrochemical</b> <b>battery</b> {{models and}} optimal control theory to study power management in energy storage/conversion systems. This topic {{is motivated by}} the need to enhance the performance and longevity of battery electric systems. In particular, the rapid progress in battery material science and energy conversion presents an opportunity to bridge the knowledge gap between electrochemistry and control. Ultimately, this dissertation elucidates the key physical phenomena which enable opportunities to improve performance and battery longevity through control. We address this topic in three phases. First we provide an overview of battery fundamentals and relevant degradation mechanisms. Then we develop mathematical models for the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>battery</b> phenomena, plug-in hybrid vehicle drivetrain dynamics, and stochastic drive cycle dynamics. A battery-in-the-loop experimental test system is fabricated to identify the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>battery</b> model. Second, we investigate the battery-health conscious power management problem for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). This effort designs controllers to split engine and battery power to minimize both fuel/electricity consumption costs and battery state-of-health degradation. Mathematically, this problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program. The degradation phenomena considered include anode-side solid electrolyte interphase film growth and the "Ah-processed" model. This work is the first to utilize fundamental <b>electrochemical</b> <b>battery</b> models to optimize power management. The final phase proposes a novel battery pack management strategy which investigates the potential health advantages of allowing unequal yet controlled charge levels across batteries connected in parallel. Mathematically, this problem is formulated as a deterministic dynamic program. The optimal solutions reveal that capacity fade can be mitigated through controlled charge unequalization if concavity properties exist in the health degradation dynamics. The sensitivity of these results are analyzed across various degradation models derived from existing literature and experimental data. In total, this dissertation utilizes physics-based battery models to optimize power management in energy storage systems. The unique overarching contribution is a systematic optimal control approach for elucidating the physical electrochemical properties one can exploit through control to enhance battery performance and life. The second and third phases described above demonstrate how this approach can be very useful for PHEV and battery pack management applications...|$|E
25|$|Both {{electrostatic}} and electrochemical {{energy storage}} in supercapacitors are linear {{with respect to the}} stored charge, just as in conventional capacitors.

50|$|The {{development}} of miniaturized {{products such as}} microrobots, notebook computers, micro-aerial vehicles and other small scale devices is becoming increasingly important in our daily life. There is a growing interest in developing small scale combustors to power these micro-devices due to their inherent advantages of higher energy density, higher heat and mass transfer coefficients and shorter recharge times compared to <b>electrochemical</b> <b>batteries.</b> The energy density of hydrocarbon fuels is 20-50 {{times higher than the}} most advanced Li-ion concept based <b>electrochemical</b> <b>batteries.</b> The concept of the micro-heat engine was proposed by Epstein and Senturia in 1997. Since then, substantial amount of work has been done towards the development and application of such small scale devices to generate power through the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. Micro-combustors are an attractive alternate to batteries as they have large surface area to volume ratio, due to which, signiﬁcant amount of heat is transferred through the walls which leads to flame quenching. However, the increased rate of heat transfer through solid walls is advantageous in the case of steam reformers used for hydrogen production.|$|R
