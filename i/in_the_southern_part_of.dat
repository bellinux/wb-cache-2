5|$|A {{total of}} 95 {{percent of the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is rural. The remaining 5 percent is suburban or urban. Twenty-seven percent of the streams in the Nescopeck Creek watershed are near surface-mining operations and 73 percent are not.

After Native American resistance, the Spanish missionaries returned to Mexico. When France began settling Louisiana, mostly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the state, in 1716 Spanish authorities responded by founding {{a new series}} of missions in East Texas. Two years later, they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civilian settlement in the area.|$|E

5|$|The great {{northern}} tilefish {{has been}} subject to regulation to prevent overfishing. Regulations include catch limits and gear restrictions to prevent damage to the species' habitat and population.

5|$|The {{most common}} soil {{series in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is the Hazleton-Dekalb-Buchanan series. Twenty-six percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed contains this soil series. Much soil and bedrock in this series has been removed during mining operations. This soil series occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Nescopeck Creek watershed, near tributaries such as Black Creek and Stony Creek. The soils in this soil series are highly permeable.|$|E

At its northernmost extent, the unconformity in fact removed all of the Pahrump, and the Noonday rests directly on the Proterozoic Complex. An ancient period of erosion removed {{that part of the}} Pahrump due to its being higher (and thus more exposed) {{than the rest of the}} formation.|$|E
5|$|At Willsboro, Route22 {{heads to}} the {{northwest}} again, away from the lake, until it heads west and intersects US9 {{in the town of}} Chesterfield, the other major north–south surface route up the state's eastern side. Routes22 and 9 join together, closely parallel to the Adirondack Northway (I-87), the only other route in the state to directly connect New York City with Canada. The three routes, spread over many miles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the state, run through a narrow corridor for two miles (3km) until Routes9 and 22 veer east again toward Keeseville.|$|E
5|$|Banksia menziesii regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, or from epicormic buds on the trunk. It is {{generally}} only weakly serotinous <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> its range, that is, it lacks a canopy seed bank as follicles on old flower spikes in the canopy release their seed after two years, but populations retain more seed as populations move north. Lower canopies and drier climates predispose to hotter fires {{that are more}} likely to kill plants and effect seed release, and thus facilitate seedling recruitment.|$|E
