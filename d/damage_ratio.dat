40|$|It is {{impossible}} for any country to have a rapid economic growth without a good and efficient transportation system. However, there are several problems affecting the transportation systems. One {{of the most important}} and common problem currently is the overloading of heavy vehicles and trucks. Road pavements performance, infrastructure performance, and safety are severely reduced by heavy vehicles overloading. Several studies carried out in Malaysia, United States of America, Colombia, Australia, France, Portugal, South Africa, China, Thailand, Pakistan, and Taiwan confirmed that overloading is a series problem around the world. This study aims to investigate the effects of overloaded heavy vehicles on flexible pavements in Malaysia, by developing models describing the degradation of flexible pavement fatigue and rutting lives under different axle loadings, axle configurations and tire pressures. The study also aims to determine fatigue and rutting <b>damage</b> <b>ratios</b> for each heavy vehicle types based on their actual weights for usage in flexible pavements design. Secondary data were collected from Weight-In-Motion stations, Falling Weight Deflectometer, Coring, Dynamic Cone Penetration and Ground Penetration Radar. The secondary data were used to form plenty of finite element models to form the deterioration models and <b>damage</b> <b>ratios.</b> Apart from the development of fatigue and rutting <b>damage</b> models and <b>ratios,</b> several other conclusions were derived. The study found that fatigue and rutting <b>damage</b> <b>ratios</b> increased rapidly due to overloading. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} damage caused by single axle with two wheels is the largest, then the single axle with four wheels followed by tandem axle and then the tri-axle configuration. It was also found that tire pressure has a high effect of fatigue and rutting damages and thus regulations should include tire pressure limitation. Twenty four models were developed in this study to calculate fatigue <b>damage</b> <b>ratios</b> and rutting <b>damage</b> <b>ratios</b> for flexible pavement in Malaysia. Furthermore, Single trailer trucks with four axles, single unit trucks with two axles, and buses were identified to be causing most of the fatigue damage, while rutting is mainly caused by the same types of vehicles and single trailer trucks with six axles. The study also found that an average value of 4. 23 for fatigue damage and 6. 20 for rutting damage could be multiplied with heavy vehicles traffic volume to represent their effects and to be used for flexible pavements design in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to derive fragilities of the nonstructural {{components}} of hospital from damage survey data, and to propose an evaluation sheet for the use of logic-tree analysis in the risk assessment. First, after three major earthquakes occurred in Japan in 2003, damage surveys by questionnaire were conducted on hospitals near the earthquake observation stations. The <b>damage</b> <b>ratios</b> are obtained by correlating the statistical results of damage to the recorded seismic intensities. Secondly, fragilities are derived from the <b>damage</b> <b>ratios,</b> by the following 4 steps. (1) Seismic capacity of each component is classified into three groups: basic, deficiency 1 and deficiency 2, according to the construction conditions. (2) Seismic capacity is expressed by lognormal distribution. Based on earthquake damage experience, the acceleration corresponding to damage probability of 1 % for the three groups are set as the relation: 1 A to 0. 55 A to 0. 3 A. (3) Existing ratios of the buildings having the components of the three groups are set by referring to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan. (4) The <b>damage</b> <b>ratios</b> are sum of multiplying the nonstructural component’s damage probability of a whole building with the existing ratios, thus the acceleration corresponding to damage probability of 1 % is obtained from the <b>damage</b> <b>ratios</b> by the least square method. Finally, with the derived fragilities, an evaluation sheet is developed, in which a table with rows of three seismic capacity groups and columns of acceleration levels is shown to read the damage probability. Due to the diversities in practice of nonstructural components in different countries, the process, from damage surveys to fragilities and evaluation sheets, adopted in this study can be used to derive a country’s data that reflect local practice...|$|R

30|$|Muramatu (1963, 1983) {{determined}} the damage ratios {{of wooden houses}} during the 1891 Nobi earthquake for each district in the Gifu Prefecture and the Aichi Prefecture. From Fig. 1, {{we can see that}} the areas with a <b>damage</b> <b>ratio</b> greater than, or equal to, 60 % are distributed along the traces of the Neodani fault and the Umehara fault in the mountainous areas, and in the Nobi Plain. The area with a <b>damage</b> <b>ratio</b> greater than, or equal to, 80 % {{in the northern part of}} the Nobi Plain extends along the Kiso River. This characteristic distribution might arise from site amplification. Areas with a <b>damage</b> <b>ratio</b> of 100 % are sparsely located in the Gifu Prefecture. By comparing the distribution of the <b>damage</b> <b>ratio</b> in the Aichi Prefecture with that in the Gifu Prefecture, Muramatu (1983) interpreted that the cause of the distribution of damage ratios of 100 % in the Gifu Prefecture could be ascribed to the short distances from the source fault and the site conditions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{probability}} of damage states {{with respect to a}} ground motion index is predicted through the seismic fragility curves. Using fragility curves, it is possible to estimate the vulnerability of structures to seismic hazard. In this study, an analytical approach was adopted to construct fragility curves for thin RC shear walls that are the vertical components of the lateral-force-resisting system to earthquakes typically used in Lima, Peru since 1998. The main characteristic of these walls is the use of electro-welded wire mesh as main reinforcement instead of conventional rebar. The thin RC shear walls were modeled {{based on the results of}} experiments. A series of non-linear dynamic response analyses was performed using strong motion records obtained in Lima, Peru and the <b>damage</b> <b>ratios</b> were estimated with respect to damage states. The fragility curves for the walls were constructed assuming that the <b>damage</b> <b>ratios</b> follow lognormal distributions.

Most building fragility functions, used for damage estimation in scenario earthquakes in Japan, were developed based on the actual damage data from the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu (Kobe) earthquake. However, already sixteen years have passed after this event, and hence {{it is better to}} employ recent earthquake data. In this study, the damage ratios of buildings are investigated from the view points of structural material and the construction period.

It is clearly observed that within the construction period 1982 - 2007, the <b>damage</b> <b>ratio</b> becomes smaller for newer wooden houses. The reduction of <b>damage</b> <b>ratio</b> with construction period is also observed for other structural materials (RC and steel), but the ratios are much smaller than those for wooden houses.
