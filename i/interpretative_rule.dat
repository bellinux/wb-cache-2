40|$|The {{objective}} of the consistent-amplitude approach to quantum theory has been to justify the mathematical formalism {{on the basis of}} three main assumptions: the first defines the subject matter, the second introduces amplitudes as the tools for quantitative reasoning, and the third is an <b>interpretative</b> <b>rule</b> that provides the link to the prediction of experimental outcomes. In this work we introduce a natural and compelling fourth assumption: if {{there is no reason to}} prefer one region of the configuration space over another then they should be `weighted' equally. This is the last ingredient necessary to introduce a unique inner product in the linear space of wave functions. Thus, a form of the principle of insufficient reason is implicit in the Hilbert inner product. Armed with the inner product we obtain two results. First, we elaborate on an earlier proof of the Born probability rule. The implicit appeal to insufficient reason shows that quantum probabilities are not more objective than classical probabilities. Previously we had argued that the consistent manipulation of amplitudes leads to a linear time evolution; our second result is that time evolution must also be unitary. The argument is straightforward and hinges on the conservation of entropy. The only subtlety consists of defining the correct entropy; it is the array entropy, not von Neumann's. After unitary evolution has been established we proceed to introduce the useful notion of observables and we explore how von Neumann's entropy can be linked to Shannon's information theory. Finally, we discuss how various connections among the postulates of quantum theory are made explicit within this approach.

In administrative law jurisprudence, {{the distinction between}} legislative and <b>interpretative</b> <b>rules</b> (and thus whether the Administrative Procedure Act requires public notice and comment procedures) and the determination of whether Chevron or Skidmore provides the appropriate evaluative standard on judicial review both ultimately turn on whether the agency legal interpretation at issue carries the force and effect of law.

This together with the consistence provided by the respect of earlier panel and Appellate Body reports safeguard legal certainty. Furthermore, legal certainty and predictability requires clarity in the law applicable in WTO dispute settlement, in particular as regards non-WTO law. It will be shown that apart from peremptory norms of public international law (ius cogens), the relevance of international law outside WTO law is limited. Non-WTO treaty law must not be applied except if referred to by WTO law or incorporated therein. Apart from that international law of any kind can only be considered when interpreting WTO law. In certain circumstances this applies even to non-WTO treaty law to which not all WTO members are parties. Due to the as yet limited importance of non-WTO law, legal certainty and predictability also depend {{on the issue of}} conflict of norms, which also is relevant as far as the interrelationship of the different WTO agreements is concerned.

The Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recently catalogued over 2000 and 1600 such documents, respectively, issued between 1996 and 1999. These documents can range from routine matters, such as how employees should maintain correspondence files, to broad policies on program standards, implementation, and enforcement. Documents in the latter category include Education Department policies on Title IX implementation, Environmental Protection Agency policies on hazardous waste cleanup, the Food and Drug Administration 2 ̆ 7 s policies on food safety and broadcast advertising of pharmaceuticals, and many more. Although these documents often resemble informal rules, agencies generally avoid Administrative Procedure Act notice-and-comment requirements because guidance documents arguably qualify under the statutory exceptions for general policy statements, <b>interpretative</b> <b>rules,</b> or both. These policies now typically are express in disclaiming any binding effect upon regulated entities or upon the agency itself, a response to some recent judicial decisions requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking for a guidance accorded binding effect, {{as well as to}} congressional concern about uncertainty. Nonetheless, a guidance document often evokes a significant change in behavior by those the agency regulates.

40|$|For decades legal {{positivism}} has governed {{the interpretation}} and application {{of the law in}} South Africa. This modernist utilisation of <b>interpretative</b> <b>rules</b> and the application of the law as it is, rather than as it ought to be, led to many historical injustices. Although numerous {{attempts have been made to}} alter the interpretative system these attempts are in vain and appear to be variations on the same modernist tune. In this thesis, as an alternative to the prevalent interpretative stance, I merely suggest a transformation by exploring the possibility of postmodern legal interpretation. Although the postmodern movement causes havoc in structuralist 'sciences' this does not mean that it is a laissez-faire approach where 'everything goes' or where all systems of structure are abandoned. In order to overcome our modernist insecurities I propose that we, as a first step, merely adopt a postmodern consciousness. This stance can be acquired by utilising the assumptions of a postmodern movement called social constructionism. The advances of this perspective, which has its roots in the social psychology, shall serve as an interpretative mind set when exploring the various narratives in County of My Skull by Antjie Krog. Krog utilises the narratives of the TRC in an attempt to overcome the inequalities of the past. This literary text can be regarded as a catalyst that initiates the interpretation of legal texts from a social constructionist perspective. The hybridisation of social constructionism and the literary text leads the way for the possibility of postmodern legal interpretation.

40|$|In 2011, Korea {{ratified}} the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement (KORUS-FTA). This treaty remains controversial in Korean society, particularly because many Koreans {{claim that the}} indirect expropriation doctrine under investor-state arbitration in the investment chapter will allow global investors to challenge governmental regulation justified by the Korean constitution. Despite such criticism, the KORUS-FTA indirect expropriation doctrine and the Korean constitutional property doctrine share more than might be expected in practice. However, this substantive doctrinal convergence between national and global legal systems does not eliminate all risks of conflict between the nation-state and global investors; conflicts can occur whenever two actors interpret the same text differently. Once an investment dispute happens, independent investor-state arbitration reviews governmental action according to independent <b>interpretative</b> <b>rules.</b> Systems theory suggests that nation-states can turn such global challenges into opportunities by taking contextual control over global investment in relying on the global investment legal system of the global investment regime. The nation-state can convince global investors that the nation-state respects transnational investment mechanisms, whilst indirectly imbuing norm-making with minimum national interest without incurring serious damage to its reputation. To be specific, the nation-state can attract more foreign investors by accepting the indirect expropriation doctrine and the investor-state arbitration respected by global investors. Simultaneously, the nation-state can secure minimum control over global investment under legitimate regulatory power reflected in the same indirect expropriation clause. In addition, the nation-state can guide the investment tribunal to secure a balance between investment protection and the regulatory power of the host state by prescribing the proportionality principle. Contextual control can be a sub-optimal choice for the nation-state {{in the sense that}} it avoids a worst-case scenario by securing proportionality and predictability. In order to make this measure more effective, the current global investment legal system needs to secure more commensurate autonomy or autopoiesis by furthering simultaneous and balanced structural coupling with a greater variety of social powers. In this context, global constitutionalism provides national constitutional tools for the nation-state; specifically, democratic participation in national treaty-making procedures and autopoietic structuralisation of the investment arbitration mechanism can make the substantive contents and application of global investment law fairer and more acceptable, not only to global investors and strong states, but also to social movements and smaller countries. In the context of the KORUS-FTA, the Korean government needs to make the treaty terms of indirect expropriation clearer through democratic participation. At the same time, the Korea should pay attention to making arbitration process reflexive to more various social interests, whilst protecting its operation from inappropriate influences. Such measures can prevent KORUSFTA tribunals from making extremely unacceptable decisions to actors of the global investment regime, including the Korean government, although they could not guarantee ideal decisions that stratify all actors perfectly...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{documented}} {{increase in}} the volume of regulatory activity during the last ninety days of presidential administrations when the President is a lame duck, having either been defeated in a bid for re-election or being {{at the end of}} the second term in office. This includes an {{increase in the}} number of final rules issued as compared to other periods. The phenomenon of late-term regulatory activity has been called “midnight regulation,” based on a comparison to the Cinderella story in which the magic wears off at the stroke of midnight. This Article looks closely at one species of midnight regulation— namely, midnight rules. This Article defines midnight rules as agency rules promulgated in the last ninety days of an administration. This Article focuses on legislative midnight rules (normally issued under the notice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)), because they are the most visible and often the most controversial actions taken in the final days of administrations and because they are usually the most difficult to alter or revoke among the various midnight actions taken by outgoing administrations. However, because late-term activity goes beyond legislative rulemaking, this report also discusses, to a lesser extent, other phenomena such as the issuance of non-legislative <b>rules</b> including <b>interpretative</b> <b>rules</b> and policy statements; non-rule regulatory documents, such as guidance documents and executive orders; and the use of other presidential powers, such as the pardon power and the ability to entrench political appointees into protected employment positions in the new administration. This Article documents the existence of the midnight rules phenomenon both quantitatively and qualitatively, using numerical measures of the volume of rules and qualitative analysis of some rules as illustrations. The Article reviews various explanations for the existence of the phenomenon, ranging from the simple human tendency to work to deadline, to more complicated political factors that may affect the timing of rules. The Article also reports on interviews of officials involved in rulemaking to inform the analysis of the causes and effects of the midnight rulemaking phenomenon. This Article also addresses midnight rulemaking from a policy perspective, asking whether there are reasons to be concerned about the phenomenon. Midnight rulemaking and midnight regulation generally have been strongly condemned by commentators and media from across the political spectrum. There are at least two possible sets of concerns regarding the increase in rulemaking at the end of an administration: first, midnight rules may be of lower quality than rules issued at other times during administrations, and second, midnight rulemaking may involve undesirable political consequences, mainly the unwarranted extension of an outgoing administration’s agenda into the successor’s term. It may be very difficult to arrive at firm conclusions on either of these potential objections to midnight rulemaking, but this Article will attempt to do so from various perspectives...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{construe}} {{scientific understanding}} {{not only as}} understanding the phenomena by means of some theoretical material (theory, law or model), but more fundamentally as understanding the theoretical material itself {{that is supposed to}} explain the phenomena. De Regt and Dieks (2005) emphasise the contextual aspects of the intelligibility of theories, showing that it depends on their "virtues", on the historical standards of intelligibility, and on the particular "skills" of their users. My paper aims at continuing this proposal, first by giving a more precise definition of one's understanding of a theory and then by emphasising the importance, for this issue, of the particular formats in which a theory is expressed and hence grasped by its users. To defend this, I take the example of the versions of classical mechanics (variational versus vectorial) and the various formats of representation of its main principles and models. What does "understanding a theory" mean? At first sight, we could say that it amounts to having {{a clear view of the}} logical relations between its core principles and theorems. This kind of understanding, though global, is quite abstract: one can understand the logical structure of a theory without being able to connect it to the phenomena. Moreover, this definition depends on how one 115 construes the structure of theories: it will vary according to whether one defines theories as logical sets of statements with <b>interpretative</b> <b>rules</b> (following the "syntactic conception" of theories) or as families of models ("semantic conception"). I thus suggest that there is another sense of "understanding a theory" that itself has two aspects. To understand a theory, one has to understand both what the theory says or means and how it works; in other words, one has to grasp the phenomena by means of its conceptual apparatus (representational aspect) and to be able to manipulate it and make it fit the phenomena (computational aspect). I claim that these are essentially contextual and practical matters, and that the particular format in which the theoretical content is displayed is crucial to them. Following Humphreys' proposal (2004), I claim that one never accesses to a theory as a whole. Be it a set of statements or a class of models, in practice, it is always displayed in some particular equations, statements, images, graphs, diagrams. Humphreys' proposal of the notion of "template" to complement the classical "units of analysis" of science, like theories and models, may be a good candidate to study the relationship between the representational and computational aspects of understanding: a template is a "concrete piece of syntax" (most of the time an equation, but I suggest that Humphreys' claim could be extended to other formats) that has both a representational and computational function. With the example of classical mechanics, I show how these two functions are interrelated and, as Humphreys suggests, sometimes in tension with each other. Adressing these issues by focusing on the particular formats that are dealt with in practice may enlight this problematic relationship...|$|R

It is prefixed that the prevalent tendency of the law denies the existence of a general damage by delay plea, in connection to the mere delay in the adoption of the administrative action. In other terms, the party concerned may ask for a solace only if (following an ex post assessment) it obtains a positive action and, therefore, the delay concerns, properly, an act whose, the party concerned invokes the granting. Considering that the injustice of the damage can’t be valid in case of groundlessness (non-existence) of the obligation to provide, it’s a question of radical hypothesis, for which, although the presentation of an instance, it subsists no proceedings obligation. Another constitutive element of the liability of the P. A. (subject of thorough analysis) has been the subjective point of view of the negligence. On this point the revirement of the law, which seems to desert the traditional reconstruction of a probative burden especially against (and exclusively) the private customer. In virtue of such “tradition of law”, as concerns the private customer (damaged by an illegitimate administrative action) it isn’t required a particular probative commitment to demonstrate the negligence of the P. A., because it is enough to invoke the illegitimacy of the action as a presumptive index of guilt. It will due then to the Administration to demonstrate that it has been a forgivable error, findable in cases of contrasts in law about the correct interpretation of a rule, of uncertain formulation of rules come into force worthless, of relevant complexity of the event, of determining influence about other people’s behaviours, of illegitimacy from a following declaration of unconstitutionality of the enforced rule. In conclusion, the legal forecast of the entitlement to compensation for a belated administrative act represents a positive news in the system in a more equilibrated relation between Administration and private customer. Nevertheless, the grasp of the reform doesn’t seem particularly innovative, and it doesn’t introduce <b>interpretative</b> <b>rules</b> able to support radical changes. A possible remedy could be found in the interpretation of the evolution of the law, called, during contentious, to assess the recurrence of the assumptions above-mentioned and, so, to evaluate the damage when it is unjust and identifiable as a culpable act performed by the P. A. ...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods (CISG) {{came into}} force in 1988 when the {{required}} number of States deposited their instruments of ratification. In 1989 the relevant Australian Parliaments introduced the CISG as the Sale of Goods (Vienna Convention) Act. Through that process the Convention {{became part of}} our domestic law. Significantly articles 7 and 8 - the interpretative articles - were incorporated into the CISG. Article 7 basically has two functions. First it assists in interpreting the Convention and secondly it defines {{the boundary between the}} application of the CISG and domestic law. Article 7 (1) requires that the CISG be interpreted uniformly to promote the international character of the Convention. Recourse to domestic principles is not allowed. A new autonomous method of interpretation is developed with the aid of case law and practices. Article 7 also points to the application of good faith in international trade. Good faith as a principle is not only applied to the interpretation of the CISG as a whole but it also regulates the behavior of the parties. Article 7 (2) recognizes that the CISG was never intended to be a complete statement of sales laws. The members of the diplomatic conference in Vienna could not agree on the inclusion of several important principles of contract law into the Convention such as the principle of validity. As a consequence article 7 also delineates between the application of the CISG and domestic law through the process of gap filling. This thesis develops the principles and tools needed to implement article 7 (2) as gaps need to be filled in conformity with the general principles on which the CISG is based. It is also contended that restatements of contract law, such as the UNIDROIT Principles, if adopted by contractual parties will minimize references to domestic law. In response to the mandate of article 7, this thesis shows that tribunals and courts will look for a solution within the "Four Corners" of the CISG in a manner contemplated by those preparing it rather than taking recourse to domestic law. It is also argued that the failure to apply the rules contained within the "Four Corners" does not indicate an unwillingness to depart from domestic laws. Rather it reveals that a "sophisticated grasp" of the provisions of the CISG has not yet been achieved. Article 8 explains the <b>interpretative</b> <b>rules</b> regarding the relations between contractual parties. In particular the subjective as well as the objective intent of parties must be elicited in order to arrive at a correct understanding of the mutual obligations entered into by the parties. Article 8 touches on subtle and difficult issues, which are only partially solved through article 7. Some domestic doctrines such as the parol evidence rule and the rules on mistake need to be abandoned or reviewed. This thesis highlights the importance of reading the CISG within its "Four Corners" as individual articles cannot be read and interpreted in isolation. They are connected through general principles on which the CISG is based. The conclusion, supported by doctrinal writing and international jurisprudence, is that the CISG has been interpreted pursuant to the autonomous mandate and that courts in general have understood the significant differences of the CISG compared to domestic law...|$|R

40|$|Resumé This thesis {{deals with}} the concept of "good manners" in Czech legal order. The thesis does not attempt to define good manners. The aim of this work is not to give readers a {{comprehensive}} picture of good manners in contemporary Czech society, but to illuminate the term and explain its function. The thesis is divided into five chapters. The first chapter introduces readers to the history of the concept of good manners, with the concepts of morality, public morality and public order, {{as well as with the}} rules of good manners and the actual concept of good manners. The first chapter still contains good manners as an <b>interpretative</b> and application <b>rule</b> and the principle of fair trade. The second chapter is devoted to selected issues of individual civil rights. These issues are the following issues - a duty to maintain a divorced spouse, default interest, an usury, laesio enormis, further an objection limitation, a restitution, a penalty and an advertising and good fair competition. The third chapter {{deals with the}} case law of the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic and the case law of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. In addition case law, this chapter also deals with importance of good manners and a legal certainty. The fourth chapter deals with good manners in a civil trial. First of all [...] ...|$|R
40|$|When {{a natural}} {{disaster}} occurs, government agencies, humanitarian organizations, private companies, volunteers, and others collect information about missing persons to aid the search effort. Often this processing of information about missing persons exacerbates the complexities and uncertainties of privacy rules. This report offers a road map to the legal and policy issues surrounding privacy and missing persons following natural disasters. The report first identifies the privacy challenges in the disaster context and provides some recent examples that demonstrate how disaster relief information sharing raises unique privacy concerns and issues. It then outlines current missing persons information sharing activities {{in the context of}} disaster relief work and discusses how those information systems strike different balances between privacy and ease of use. The report then proceeds to identify some key legal privacy issues and examines in detail how these legal requirements apply to missing persons organizations and what <b>interpretative</b> challenges privacy <b>rules</b> present. For the analysis, this report focuses on privacy law in the European Union and the United States because these jurisdictions serve as important examples of privacy regulation around the globe. The report offers a general analysis rather than a detailed assessment of any particular activity that would depend on the application of the law of a specific jurisdiction. The report concludes with a set of options and strategies that organizations and policy makers involved in missing persons activities and in privacy could pursue to help address some of the privacy concerns.
