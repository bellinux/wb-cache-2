50|$|He {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of differences in roadway design considerations between electric and fuel-powered vehicles on the turnpike east of York, Pennsylvania. He noted that the <b>downhill</b> <b>stops</b> required by placement of all sixteen tollgates in the middle of downgrades significantly reduced the effectiveness of his electric's regenerative braking system.|$|R
50|$|Locusts {{change their}} {{behaviour}} and {{are attracted to}} each other when there are large numbers in close proximity. This behaviour starts when the nymphs are quite small and form a band that move together as a cohesive unit. The band of hoppers can travel a distance of up to 4 km per day, mostly moving <b>downhill,</b> <b>stopping</b> sporadically to feed and bask in the sun. When the insects are fully developed and have wings, they stay together as a swarm. Solitary adults usually fly by night but gregarious ones fly by day. The new adults mature and become sexually active {{in three or four}} weeks. There may be up to five generations per year in the Philippines, but in the cooler parts of China, there may be just one or two.|$|R
50|$|Old Square WheelsDiesel {{is trying}} to get back at Duck for making the trucks misbehave. Henry's trucks push him {{downhill}} too fast. His wheels lock when his driver applies his brakes. Henry slides <b>downhill</b> and <b>stops</b> at the junction. His driver finds out he has a flat place on each of his drive wheels. This makes Diesel nickname Henry as Old Square Wheels! Diesel will make it sound like Duck told that joke to the trucks.|$|R
50|$|Kårdal Station (Kårdal holdeplass) is {{a railway}} station in Aurland, Norway, on the Flåm Line. It is 6.34 km from Myrdal Station, 341.95 km from Oslo Central Station and 557 m above mean sea level. The station opened on 16 June 1946. It is the station that {{traditionally}} served the farm furthest {{up in the}} valley of Flåmsdalen. Because the station is located on a gradient, only trains heading <b>downhill</b> can <b>stop</b> at the station. The 2015 - 16 Flamsbana timetable lists the station as disused.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the local}} road rules {{specifies}} that the downhill driver never has {{the right of way}} and must move to {{the outer edge of the}} road. This forces the faster <b>downhill</b> vehicle to <b>stop</b> so that passing can be negotiated safely. Unlike the rest of Bolivia, vehicles are required to drive on the left side of the road to give the driver a better view of the vehicle's outside wheel and making passing safer.|$|R
2500|$|... {{a similar}} barrage for forty minutes {{in front of}} the 2nd Australian Division, on a {{regiment}} of the 236th Division advancing from Molenaarelsthoek and <b>downhill</b> from Broodseinde, <b>stopped</b> the counter-attack long before it came within range of the Australian infantry. On the southern edge of the plateau, German troops dribbling forward in the 39th Division area, managed to reinforce the garrison at Tower Hamlets, then tried twice to advance to the Bassevillebeek and were [...] "smashed" [...] by artillery and machine-gun fire.|$|R
50|$|After the {{incident}} with the coaches, Sir Topham Hatt lets James {{out of the}} shed to pull a freight train. The freight cars try to make him give up {{when they come to}} Gordon's Hill, but James keeps on. Eventually, a rusty coupling snaps thanks to a thunderstorm and some cars roll <b>downhill.</b> The conductor <b>stops</b> them and Edward offers to help, but James prefers to go it alone instead. The trucks seem to realize James will keep trying whatever they do, and finally allow James to reach the top of the hill. After hearing about what happened, Sir Topham Hatt lets James keep his red coat.|$|R
5000|$|Movie Gazette {{also noted}} {{the film is}} just M Night Shyamalan’s Signs remade on a budget. They noted it even had similar failings, in it [...] "being a movie of two halves, and going <b>downhill</b> when it <b>stops</b> {{building}} tension and turns into an alien horror movie." [...] When the aliens are finally revealed, they disappoint by being [...] "rendered in almost cartoon fashion". Another flaw was that the film's two biggest star names have their talents wasted by being relegated to roles seen only briefly in the film. The only plus was while the ending was confusing, it [...] "s better than that of Signs which was corny and obvious." ...|$|R
40|$|Semarang {{city has}} a role {{as a place of}} transit point for heavy {{vehicles}} which transport logistics to rest because it {{is in the middle of}} the roads Pantura Java. Perintis Kemerdekaan road located in the south of Semarang is artery road primary so that all types of many vehicles from the middle roads passing through the road with high speed. The conditions of Perintis Kemerdekaan road in the form of uphill and downhill that sharp enough between 4 % until 7. 7 % as long as 2 kilometers. At the end of a <b>downhill,</b> truck must <b>stop</b> on Karangrejo signal intersection. The driver of a heavy vehicles had difficulty in passing downhill of Perintis Kemerdekaan road so many accident happens because the brake failure. Study of this research is analyzing the performance of heavy vehicles passing through on downhill in Perintis Kemerdekaan road. Methods used in research is to do a survey of travel time to get spot speed in each type of the truck and the speed of change when passing through the downhill. The result of the analysis used to calculate the rate of deceleration and braking distance required in each type of truck. The result shows that decelaration the highest occurred for three research locations, for truck with machine capacity 100 - 130 HP is 2, 337 m/s 2. While for truck with machine capacity 190 - 225 HP, the highest average decelaration happened is 2, 059 m/s 2. The deceleration on both kind of truck it is still under the deceleration maximum allowed is 3, 41 m/s 2 as the maximum limit of the brake. The braking distance is required so that truck capable of being stopped in Karangrejo intersection, for truck with with machine capacity 100 - 130 HP along 94, 884 meters. While for truck with machine capacity 190 - 225 HP, the braking distance necessary along 87, 900 meters. While the distance existing from the line stopping of signal intersection up to a start braking point on the final slope as long as 250 - 300 meters...|$|R
