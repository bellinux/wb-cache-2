500|$|Both sides played defensively {{which led}} many {{commentators}} to bemoan the poor {{quality of the}} match. There were frequent pauses for injuries and accusations of diving. However, some analysts commented on the genuine desire to win both teams displayed. Numerous goal opportunities were missed, most notably by Tyrone, although only a block from Conor Gormley prevented Steven McDonnell from equalising for Armagh in the 68th minute. Tyrone led 008 [...] 004 at half-time; five of their points were scored by Peter Canavan from frees. He was replaced during the interval due to a relapse of his ankle injury during training, although he did return to the pitch for the final few minutes.
