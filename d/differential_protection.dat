With the development of smart grids {{as well as new}} communication technologies, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been potential means for realizing reconstructed communication channels (RCCs) without further installation. For a reliable design, system arrangement and the communication structure were presented. Theoretical planning of sensor nodes was formulated, which enjoys advantages such as high reliability, cost optimization, and capacity of satisfying the connectivity of the communication network. To meet the need of time delay, a novel routing protocol for WSNs was proposed with three stages including route establishment, route discovery and route maintenance, which ensured the directional propagation of data packets. Practical experiments and simulation results indicate that the proposed RCC scheme can satisfy time delay of protection relaying in emergency communication channel, as well as guarantee the connectivity of networks when some WSN nodes are damaged...|$|R

40|$|New {{applications}} like {{remote surveillance}} and online environmental or traffic monitoring {{are making it}} increasingly important to provide flexible and protected access to remote video sensor devices. Current systems use application-level codes like web-based solutions to provide such access. This requires adherence to user-level APIs provided by such services, access to remote video information through given application-specific service and server topologies, and that the data being captured and distributed is manipulated by third party service codes. CameraCast is a simple, easily used system-level solution to remote video access. It provides a logical device API so that an application can identically operate on local vs. remote video sensor devices, using its own service and server topologies. In addition, the application {{can take advantage of}} API enhancements to protect remote video information, using a capability-based model for <b>differential</b> data <b>protection</b> that offers fine grain control over the information made available to specific codes or machines, thereby limiting their ability to violate privacy or security constraints.

50|$|Distance {{protection}} detects both voltage and current. A fault on {{a circuit}} will generally create a sag in the voltage level. If {{the ratio of}} voltage to current measured at the relay terminals, which equates to an impedance, lands within a predetermined level the circuit breaker will operate. This is useful for reasonable length lines, lines longer than 10 miles, because its operating characteristics {{are based on the}} line characteristics. This means that when a fault appears on the line the impedance setting in the relay is compared to the apparent impedance of the line from the relay terminals to the fault. If the relay setting is determined to be below the apparent impedance it is determined that the fault is within the zone of protection. When the transmission line length is too short, less than 10 miles, distance protection becomes more difficult to coordinate. In these instances the best choice of protection is current <b>differential</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} pattern {{recognition}} based <b>differential</b> spectral energy <b>protection</b> scheme for ac microgrids using a Fourier kernel based fast sparse time-frequency representation (SST or simply the sparse S-Transform). The average and differential current components are {{passed through a}} change detection filter, which senses the instant of fault inception and registers a change detection point (CDP). Subsequently, if CDP is registered for one or more phases, then half cycle data samples of the average and differential currents {{on either side of}} the CDP are passed through the proposed SST technique, which generates their respective spectral energies and a simple comparison between them detects the occurrence and type of the fault. The SST technique is also used to provide voltage and current phasors and the frequency during faults which is further utilized to estimate the fault location. The proposed technique as compared to conventional <b>differential</b> current <b>protection</b> scheme is quicker in fault detection and classification, which is least effected from bias setting, has a faster relay trip response (less than one cycle from fault incipient) and a better accuracy in fault location. The significance and accuracy of the proposed scheme have been verified extensively for faults in a standard microgrid system, subjected to a large number of operating conditions and the outputs vindicate it to be a potential candidate for real time applications.|$|R
40|$|Interactions {{between social}} {{policies}} and migration are numerous. This paper proposes {{to analyze the}} influence of employment protection on bilateral migration. We show theoretically how employment protection may affect the probability to migrate, depending on (i) the effect of employment protection on wages, (2) {{the effect on the}} probability to be employed, and (3) relative preferences over wages or employment. Empirically, we show that employment <b>protection</b> <b>differential</b> between source and destination countries is an important determinant of bilateral migration. Bilateral migration of workers is negatively affected by this <b>differential</b> of employment <b>protection.</b> This effect is stronger for high-skilled workers. We also find that the effect of the differential is largely explained by the level of employment protection in destination countries. This factor does not have a significant impact in origin countries. These results are obtained controling econometrically for the high proportion of zero using Heckman two steps procedure. Overall, we find that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, migrants are not attracted by protective legislation. On the contrary, they tend to move where this protection is closer to the one of their origin country...|$|R
