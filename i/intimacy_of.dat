25|$|The total {{high school}} {{population}} was now approaching 2,400. The same committee which concluded that physical additions were needed also recommended a new organizational plan to prevent students from feeling depersonalized {{in such a}} large system. What grew out of this was the House Plan, which, in 1970, divided Columbia into four sub-schools of approximately 600 students each. The goal was to provide the <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> a small school within a large plant, {{and each of the}} houses had, for example, its own student council, intramural athletic teams, and newspapers. All of these were in addition to the traditional school-wide activities.|$|E
25|$|Most of Broadchurch series one {{was shot}} on {{location}} to heighten the reality and <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> the series, {{and because the}} Dorset coast was integral to setting {{the mood of the}} drama. The first cast read-through occurred at Bloomsbury Central Baptist Church in London on 7 August 2012. Principal photography began on interior sets at Vision Studios on 13 August 2012. Location shooting began the first week of September. Most location photography occurred in the town of Clevedon. Some scenes were also shot in the towns of Bridport and West Bay, and in the surrounding district of west Dorset. Three locations were used in the area around Yate, South Gloucestershire, and two in Bristol. Other filming locations included Shepton Mallet, Portishead, and Weston-super-Mare, and the villages of Eype and Flax Bourton. The oft-seen cliff where Danny Latimer's body is found, and which features heavily in the visuals of Broadchurch, is Harbour Cliff and Harbour Cliff Beach in West Bay. Many of the villages involved in the shooting of Broadchurch received a boost in tourism, especially in West Bay and Bridport.|$|E

500|$|... "La Couchette" [...] follows six {{characters}} on a sleeper carriage travelling from Paris to Bourg St. Maurice. Shearsmith {{said that the}} writers aimed to exploit the <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> the setting; the unusual situation which is created by trying to sleep in what is potentially {{a room full of}} strangers. This was, for Shearsmith, an [...] "odd frisson" [...] to play with. Discussing the filming, Whitehall said that the set was [...] "definitely the most intimate location I have ever been on ... It's all on springs so it moves around like a train carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on the first day I threw up. I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo. So it was quite an auspicious start." [...] Hesmondhalgh also commented on the <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> the filming, saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since [...] "Sardines", the first episode of the first series. Nonetheless, she had [...] "such a fun week" [...] filming the episode, noting that, despite the limited space on-set, it is [...] "amazing how quickly you become institutionalised". Similarly, Pemberton noted that the filming resulted in [...] "a tough week", but that it was [...] "really fun, because it's a very fun episode".|$|E
500|$|As a {{consequence}} of his unsatisfactory marriage, Wellington formed relationships with other women, but it was for Arbuthnot that [...] "he reserved his deepest affection." [...] Her husband at this time was working at The Treasury and Arbuthnot in effect became what would today be termed Wellington's social secretary during his first term of premiership between January 1828 and November 1830. It {{has been suggested that}} the Duke of Wellington allowed her [...] "almost unrestricted access to the secrets of the cabinet". Whatever her knowledge and access, however, it appears she was unable to influence the Duke, but even his refusal to bring her husband into the Cabinet in January 1828 failed to shake the <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> the trio.|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by the <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> sleeper carriages, in which people aim to sleep in close proximity to strangers. [...] "La Couchette" [...] draws upon the literary tropes associated with stories, such as Murder on the Orient Express and Strangers on a Train, following characters unknown to one another while travelling. The various characters—played by actors somewhat typecast—correspond to British comedy archetypes, and much of the episode's story and humour derives from the characters' unlikability. Critics responded positively to [...] "La Couchette", commending the cast and script, but noted that Inside No. 9 is something of an acquired taste. On its first showing, the episode was watched by 1.1 million viewers (6.1% of the audience).|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the West End {{production}} {{were generally}} positive. Rachel Ward of The Telegraph gave it {{four out of}} five stars, calling [...] "90 minutes of uninterrupted chaos". Kate Stanbury from Official London Theatre summarized, [...] "Chaotic, intense and pulsating with legendary Green Day hits, a trip to this Tony Award-winning musical may just give you the time of your life." [...] Paul Taylor of The Independent also gave {{four out of five}} stars, praising director and choreographer Racky Plews for making [...] "a sharp-witted version that throbs with some of the energy of a rock gig (if minus the feeling of unpredictability) while being shrewdly calibrated to suit the <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> the 350-seater Arts Theatre." ...|$|E
500|$|Byrnes {{found that}} Departures used {{the symbol of}} the cherry blossom, a flower which blooms after the winter only to wither soon afterwards, to {{represent}} the transience of life; through this understanding, he wrote, Japanese people attempt to define their own existence. Natural symbols are further presented through the changing seasons, which [...] "suggest delicate emotional changes" [...] in the characters, as well as the letter-stones, which represent [...] "love, communication, [...] the baton being passed from generation to generation". The film's settings are used to convey various sensations, including the solitude of the countryside and the <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> the public bath house. The colour white, manifested through snow, chrysanthemums, and other objects, is prominent in the film; Okuyama suggests that this, together with the classical music and ritualized hand gestures, represents the sacredness and purity of the death ceremonies.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for the Trylon has been positive. It was voted the best movie {{theater in the}} Minneapolis–Saint Paul area in 2011 and 2012 by City Pages, who wrote in 2011 that [...] "no theater in the Twin Cities can match [...] passion and energy for the movies." [...] In an unranked list of Minneapolis–Saint Paul's best cinemas written for WCCO, Eric Henderson called the Trylon the [...] "pluckiest upstart in the Twin Cities" [...] and described the experience of walking into the theater as [...] "stepp onto the set of a Michel Gondry fantasy-noir about a scrappy theater thriving {{in the midst of}} a Prohibition-style ban on the moviegoing experience." [...] J. L. Sosa lauded the Trylon on Film School Rejects, praising the concessions selection, the physical <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> the space, and the cinema's programmers for their [...] "impeccable taste in both high- and lowbrow culture." ...|$|E
500|$|Bianco {{preferred}} the <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] to [...] "Thriller / Heads Will Roll", which {{both he and}} Hyman criticized for its overproduction and editing. While Bianco found the final number anonymous, Hyman and Futterman approved of the performance overall, particularly for the makeup and costuming. Flandez and Brissey compared it favorably to the Super Bowl XLV halftime performances, with Brissey stating that the mashup did Jackson justice and giving it her highest grade of the episode, an [...] "A−". Roberts wrote that the performance [...] "lived up to the pre-show hype", but felt {{that the rest of}} the episode [...] "paled in comparison". VanDerWerff commented favorably, [...] "For the few minutes that number was on the screen, Glee was nearly everything it could be, blending fun music with insane production values and characters coming to certain emotional realizations in the moment, heightened as it is by the music." ...|$|E
500|$|Boyle {{acknowledged}} that the extravagance of the 2008 opening ceremony was an impossible act to follow — [...] "you can't get bigger than Beijing" [...] — and that this realisation had in fact liberated his team creatively. He said [...] "..obviously I'm {{not going to try}} and build on Beijing, because how could you? We can't, and you wouldn't want to, so we're going back to the beginning. We're going to try and give the impression that we're rethinking and restarting, because they've (opening ceremonies) escalated since Los Angeles in 1984. They've tried to top themselves each time and you can't do that after Beijing." [...] Beijing's budget had been £65m, whereas London's final budget was £27m, which was twice the original provision. The London stadium had the same number of seats as Beijing's, but was half the size; this <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> scale meant that Boyle felt he could achieve something personal and connecting.|$|E
