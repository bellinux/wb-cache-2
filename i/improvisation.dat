5|$|In 1983 FIG {{evolved into}} the European Women's Improvising Group (EWIG), bowing to {{pressure}} to tone down their name. FIG were influential on the second-generation <b>improvisation</b> scene and spawned a number of women-only improvising groups and events. FIG were also educational in that they exposed new audiences to <b>improvisation</b> and feminism.|$|E
5|$|This {{emphasis}} on <b>improvisation</b> was essential due traditional {{role of the}} music as entertainment for the entire community. Listeners in the audience expected players to surprise and astound them by playing in their own unique style, and by incorporating <b>improvisation</b> to make newer versions of the piece. If a player simply imitated a preceding player, playing patterns without any <b>improvisation,</b> the audience members would believe she/he to be repetitious and mundane. This also explains why set performance pieces for musical productions are different in some respect—young men/women would be practicing before an event, therefore rarely relying on improvisations.|$|E

5|$|Each major-thirds tuning repeats its open-notes {{after every}} two strings, {{which results in}} two copies of the three open-strings' notes, each in a {{different}} octave. This repetition again simplifies the learning of chords and <b>improvisation.</b> This advantage is not shared by two popular regular-tunings, all-fourths and all-fifths tuning.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} Bartók's {{compositional}} process {{as it relates to}} the <b>Improvisations,</b> Op. 20. The study, which focuses on the analysis of the draft manuscript 50 PS 1, compares the draft and other relevant sources with the final composition. Bartók's framework for the entire <b>Improvisations</b> is based on a compositional strategy of pairing individual <b>improvisations</b> combined with systematic revision of the draft copy by the introduction of tritones as tonal equivalents and movement by fifths from semitones, to achieve structural coherence in the individual <b>improvisations.</b> The tonic-dominant relationship is used to rearrange the individual <b>improvisations</b> in the draft and tritones as tonal equivalents are used to propel the movement between the <b>improvisations</b> to produce a coherent whole...|$|R

5|$|In each regulartuning, the musicalintervals are {{the same}} for each pair of {{consecutive}} strings. Other regular tunings include all-fourths, augmented-fourths, and all-fifths tunings. For each regular tuning, chord patterns may be moved around the fretboard, a property that simplifies beginners' learning of chords and advanced players' <b>improvisation.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{other forms}} of media, a Chicago-based theater company, Under the Gun Theater, {{developed}} a show inspired by and titled after Franco.

5|$|Kind of Blue {{is based}} entirely on modality, in {{contrast}} to Davis's earlier work with the hard bop style of jazz and its complex chord progression and <b>improvisation.</b> The entire album was composed {{as a series of}} modal sketches, in which each performer was given a set of scales that defined the parameters of their <b>improvisation</b> and style. This style was {{in contrast to}} more typical means of composing, such as providing musicians with a complete score or, as was more common for improvisational jazz, providing the musicians with a chord progression or series of harmonies.|$|E

5|$|Among {{both the}} Maguindanao and the Maranao, the agung embodies {{all that is}} {{masculine}} and thus the agung is traditionally considered a masculine instrument. To be considered a good player, one must possess strength, stamina (playing extremely fast tempos with no mistakes) and endurance. Players must also exhibit <b>improvisation</b> skills for different patterns to be considered as having quality musicianship—lest the audience considers the patterns played repetitions and mundane.|$|E

40|$|<b>Improvisations</b> {{as a form}} of the {{spontaneous}} musical expression of intrapsychological processes offer accesses to otherwise difficultly reachable depth dimensions of human experience because of their high authenticity. It was investigated whether the emotional experience of laymen will be concisely put in <b>improvisations</b> on the xylophone and so made recordable for listeners. 20 grammar school pupils expressed three basis feelings (anger, sadness, joy) in <b>improvisations</b> on the xylophone; later 74 subjects had to assign correctly the <b>improvisations</b> to these feelings. They managed it outstandingly often. This study has proved the intersubjectively recognizable experience of feelings or images related to feelings in <b>improvisations</b> of adults without musical professionality. This is relevant to the psychology of expression and has also implications for the diagnostic in clinical psychology and psychotherapy especially considering procedures in music therapy. ...|$|R

5|$|At the Conservatoire, Messiaen made {{excellent}} academic progress. In 1924, aged 15, he {{was awarded}} second prize in harmony, having been taught in that subject by professor Jean Gallon. In 1925 he won first prize in piano accompaniment, and in 1926 he gained first prize in fugue. After studying with Maurice Emmanuel, {{he was awarded}} second prize {{for the history of}} music in 1928. Emmanuel's example engendered an interest in ancient Greek rhythms and exotic modes. After showing <b>improvisation</b> skills on the piano Messiaen studied organ with Marcel Dupré. Messiaen gained first prize in organ playing and <b>improvisation</b> in 1929. After a year studying composition with Charles-Marie Widor, in autumn 1927 he entered the class of the newly appointed Paul Dukas. Messiaen's mother died of tuberculosis shortly before the class began. Despite his grief, he resumed his studies, and in 1930 Messiaen won first prize in composition.|$|E
