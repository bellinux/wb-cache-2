5|$|In 1514, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus (1490–1557) married James IV's widow Margaret Tudor, {{daughter}} of Henry VII, and Regent of Scotland for her infant son James V.

40|$|Human {{hands are}} an {{important}} source of microbial contamination of foods. However, published data on the effectiveness of handwashing and glove use in a foodservice setting are limited. Bacterial transfer through foodservice quality gloves was quanti ed using nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacter aerogenes (a nonpathogenic surrogate with attachment characteristics similar to Salmonella). Five transfer rates were determined: chicken <b>to</b> bare <b>hand,</b> chicken <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> through gloves, bare <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce, <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (with low inoculum on <b>hands),</b> and <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (with high inoculum on hands). At least 30 observations were made for each percent transfer rate using 30 individual volunteers. The logarithm of percent transfer data were then t to distributions: chicken <b>to</b> bare <b>hand,</b> normal (0. 71, 0. 42); chicken <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> through gloves, gamma (5. 91, 0. 40, 25. 00); bare <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce, logistic (1. 16, 0. 30); <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (low inoculum), normal (0. 35, 0. 88); <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (high inoculum), normal (22. 52, 0. 61). A 0. 01 % transfer was observed from food <b>to</b> <b>hands</b> and from <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> food when subjects wore gloves and a 10 % transfer was observed without a glove barrier. These results indicate that gloves are permeable to bacteria although transfer from <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> food through a glove barrier was less than without a glove barrier. Our results indicate that gloves may reduce both bacterial transfer from food <b>to</b> the <b>hands</b> of foodservice workers and in subsequent transfer from <b>hands</b> back <b>to</b> food.

After winning the next race in Canada, Jacky Ickx moved within 17 points of Rindt in the Championship, giving him a chance to win the title if he won the two remaining races. At the United States Grand Prix, a race won by Rindt's replacement at Lotus, Emerson Fittipaldi, Ickx placed only fourth, making Rindt motor racing's only posthumous world champion.

5|$|Genesis of the Daleks was {{originally}} commissioned under producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks, {{who felt that}} the outline submitted by Nation was too similar to his previous Dalek adventures, and encouraged him to explore {{the origin of the}} Daleks. The story introduces the Daleks' creator Davros (Michael Wisher), who had a unique visual design. The script was <b>handed</b> <b>to</b> Letts and Dicks' successors, producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes, who made changes to the original script which gave it a darker tone. Nation, having intentionally modelled the Daleks on the Nazis, further explored the theme in Genesis. It also addresses the moral issues that come with time travelling and genocide. The story was filmed over January and February 1975, with some location filming in a quarry in Betchworth.|$|E
