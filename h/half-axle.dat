2500|$|The Avia-Tor {{normally}} uses a fixed tricycle undercarriage, though floats or skis are options. Each mainwheel {{is supported}} by a V-pair of struts joined to the lower fuselage longerons and with a <b>half-axle</b> from wheel to the central fuselage. [...] A MVEN KS-500-2 Cobra ballistic parachute recovery system is standard.|$|E
2500|$|The T-10M {{has some}} changes to {{undercarriage}} and fin, plus {{a change of}} engine. [...] The main gear sprung element has been moved from the <b>half-axle</b> to the rearward V strut and the early castoring nosewheel replaced with a steerable system with a simpler single leg. [...] The fin of the T-10M is more angular and narrower {{than that of the}} T-10 and incorporates a triangular fillet.

5000|$|The <b>half-axles</b> {{have better}} {{contact with the}} ground when {{operated}} off-road. This has little importance on roads.|$|R
50|$|It had a fixed {{tailskid}} undercarriage with mainwheels on faired <b>half-axles</b> {{from the}} bottom of the fuselage, with short, faired, rubber ring shock absorbers from the outer lower engine mounts.|$|R
50|$|The Swift had a fixed, {{conventional}} undercarriage with faired main {{legs and}} wheels, rubber shock absorbers and <b>half-axles</b> hinged under the fuselage. The main wheels had brakes and the tailwheel was steerable.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{is fully}} independent, {{of the swing}} axle type both front and rear, each <b>half-axle</b> having about 25 cm of free movement.|$|E

50|$|Some low floor {{streetcar}} designs use split axles (a separate <b>half-axle</b> for {{the wheel}} {{on each side}} of the car). Such streetcars are unsuitable for use with single-point switches as there would be no mechanism to transfer the force from the inner to outer wheels at switches.|$|E
50|$|Tatra T 810 is {{a medium}} truck made by Czech company Tatra. Unlike other Tatra trucks, {{it does not}} use the {{traditional}} Tatra conception of backbone chassis and swinging <b>half-axles,</b> but the customary truck architecture with conventional frame.|$|R
50|$|The Moineau had a fixed, wide track, {{tailskid}} undercarriage, with large, {{low pressure}} balloon tyres on <b>half-axles</b> formed {{on each side}} by three struts, a forward pair from the lower and mid-fuselage and a drag strut to the lower fuselage further aft.|$|R
2500|$|The TE.1 had a wide-track (...) {{tailskid}} undercarriage with mainwheels on [...] faired, cranked <b>half-axles</b> hinged {{from the}} central fuselage underside, their ends independently bungee sprung from the vertices of faired V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons. Its tailskid was a double cantilever steel leaf spring.|$|R

50|$|Cons: Increased tire {{wear and}} {{noticeable}} impact on driving behavior. During cornering, which <b>half-axle</b> is uncoupled {{is dependent on}} torque direction applied by the driveline. When the torque direction is reversed, {{the speed of the}} driveline is suddenly forced to change from the inner to outer axle, accompanied by tire chirping and a large jerk. During cornering, the automatic locker is characterized by heavy understeer which transitions instantly to power oversteer when traction is exceeded.|$|E
50|$|Power was {{delivered}} to the rear wheels via a four-speed gearbox. The Tatra 30 featured a central backbone chassis, a hallmark of chief designer Ledwinka: the front axle {{was supported by a}} transverse leaf spring while a second transverse leaf spring supported the swing rear <b>half-axle.</b> The drive shaft is situated inside the backbone tube. The gearbox and engine are mounted in front of the backbone tube, while the differential is at the rear.|$|E
50|$|Its {{landing gear}} was conventional, with its mainwheels on steel <b>half-axles</b> {{centrally}} hinged within the fuselage at its deepest part and with rubber shock absorbers on the fuselage underside, giving a track of 1.55 m. A sprung tailskid was mounted on {{an extension of}} the rear fuselage.|$|R

50|$|For the 1965 model year, the Corvair {{received}} a fully {{independent rear suspension}} closely resembling that of the contemporary Corvette. The redesigned suspension reduced the rear roll center to half its previous height, using fully articulated <b>half-axles</b> that offered constant camber on the rear tires in all driving situations. This virtually eliminated the handling problems of the first-generation models.|$|R
50|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} cars and trucks, the engine turns a {{driveshaft}} (also called a propellor shaft or tailshaft) which transmits rotational force to a drive axle {{at the rear}} of the vehicle. The drive axle may be a live axle, but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential. In this case, one <b>half-axle</b> or half-shaft connects the differential with the left rear wheel, a second half-shaft does the same with the right rear wheel; thus the two half-axles and the differential constitute the rear axle.|$|E
50|$|The T-10M {{has some}} changes to {{undercarriage}} and fin, plus {{a change of}} engine. The main gear sprung element has been moved from the <b>half-axle</b> to the rearward V strut and the early castoring nosewheel replaced with a steerable system with a simpler single leg. The fin of the T-10M is more angular and narrower {{than that of the}} T-10 and incorporates a triangular fillet. The T-10s are powered by 60 kW (80 hp) Jabiru 2200s, the T-10Ms by 74 kW (100 hp) Rotax 912S flat four engines.|$|E

Relations of the <b>half-axles</b> rotation speed, as well, as of the blocking factor to time are presented for each mode of motion. These relations were generated during testing on a dynamic oper-ating test bench...|$|R
50|$|The C.251 had a fixed {{tail wheel}} {{undercarriage}} and the rudder was slightly cut away below {{to give the}} tail wheel leg room for movement. The main wheels were mounted on <b>half-axles</b> attached on the central fuselage underside and hinged on faired V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons. Landing loads were absorbed by legs also mounted on the lower longerons.|$|R
50|$|The {{front axle}} is stiff, {{suspended}} by transverse half-elliptic spring, {{carried by the}} aluminium engine block, while the rear axle consists of two independent swinging <b>half-axles,</b> suspended by a transverse half-elliptic spring, which is mounted {{on top of the}} differential box and leaning its ends against the brake plates. The advantage of this solution is excellent progressiveness of the suspension.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Abnormal {{vibration}} of {{a vehicle}} rear axle was detected during bench test. 3 D model and finite element model of the rear axle were built and the vibration modes were computed. It {{was found that the}} frequency of abnormal vibration in the bench test just matched the frequency of the first bending mode of the rear axle assembly. Therefore it can be concluded that the resonance of rear axle assembly result in the abnormal vibration and some measures are necessary, such as strengthening the <b>half-axle</b> sleeve or installing vibration absorber. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{traditional}} approach for the parts thermal state analysis under quenching {{is based on}} the Newtonâ€™s sort boundary condition between the solid wall of the parts and fluid surrounding it. This approach often does not produce good results {{because of the lack of}} data on heat transfer coefficient for the heat transfer between the part and fluid flow, and the situation becomes worth due to the essential non-stationarity of the convection and boiling processes around the part, and the complexity of hydrodynamic flow of real parts of various shapes. The problem statement and heat transfer analysis results for <b>half-axle</b> cooling under quenching in moving water flows are considered. The problem solves as a conjugate heat transfer problems (Navie-Stocks equations full set solving) with CFD (Computation Fluid Dynamics) computer technology, when it is do not need to know the heat transfer coefficients at the surface of the part. This paper is of great value for the calculation analysis and paprameter optimization of intensive steel quenching method.

40|$|Differential {{expansion}} and contraction between {{the top and}} bottom of a concrete slab results in curling. Curling affects stresses and deflections and is an important component of any mechanistic-empirical design procedure. A significant portion of the curling can be attributed to the combined effects of nonlinear "built-in " temperature gradients, irreversible shrinkage, moisture gradients, and creep, which can be represented by an effective built-in temperature difference (EBITD). Several instrumented test sections with various design features were constructed and evaluated using the Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS) in Palmdale, California. These instrumented slabs were loaded with a <b>half-axle</b> edge load without wander, to study the effects of curling and to fail the slab sections under accelerated pavement testing. A procedure for estimating EBITD using loaded slab deflections was developed using the HVS results. The advantages are that they can be used for measuring EBITD of slabs with high negative built-in curl and can also be adapted for a Falling Weight Deflectometer, making it an efficient and cost-effective procedure to backcalculat...|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a four-cylinder 1213 cc ohv {{water-cooled}} engine producing at maximum power [...] at 4,200 rpm. The four-speed gear-box included synchromesh on the top three ratios, power being delivered to the rear wheels via a jointed prop shaft. Front suspension: Independent using transverse leaf springs. Rear suspension: independent using transverse leaf springs with floating <b>half-axles.</b> Top speed: 105 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The Potez 37 had fixed, {{conventional}} landing gear, with mainwheels, {{equipped with}} brakes, placed 3.0 m {{apart at the}} ends of <b>half-axles</b> and drag struts hinged to the fuselage.

There was a small, sprung tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The {{final design}} had four seats. The engine was a {{two-cylinder}} air-cooled boxer 854 cc {{with a power}} rating of 18 HP at 3500 RPM. The engine, gear-box and <b>half-axles</b> were of unitary construction. The simple two door body had a timber frame. Although it was made purely to test different design ideas, it had good handling and could easily reach speeds of 80 km/h.|$|R

Differences in restraints and variability in concrete material properties resulted in EBITDs ranging from â€“ 5 ï¿½C to greater than â€“ 30 ï¿½C. The HVS field tests were also used to examine Miner's hypothesis along with various fatigue damage models. Results indicate test slabs cracked at cumulative damage levels significantly different from unity. New models that incorporate stress range and loading rate along with peak stresses were developed. The coefficients for these models were developed to incorporate transverse cracking, longitudinal cracking, and corner breaks. The models can also be used for slabs that exhibit high negative EBITD. For slabs susceptible to high shrinkage gradients, microcracking resulting from restraint stresses during early ages can significantly reduce the slab's nominal strength. Early-age restraint can vary considerably from one slab to another, depending on restraint. A procedure to model slab strength reduction and slab size was developed using nonlinear fracture mechanics principles. A parameter called the "effective initial crack depth" is introduced to characterize the early-age surface microcracking...|$|E
50|$|Hans Ledwinka, Tatra's designer, {{came up with}} {{a revolutionary}} idea of a {{backbone}} tube chassis, which he introduced on Tatra 11. Tatra 12 follows the same principles with the backbone tube, which has mounted the differential with swing <b>half-axles</b> at the rear. The gearbox has 4 speeds (+reverse) and the engine is on the top of it, while both are mounted {{on the front of the}} backbone tube.|$|R
50|$|The Wibault 260 had fixed, {{conventional}} steel {{landing gear}} with a track of 2.60 m, its wheels fitted with brakes. Upward sloping <b>half-axles</b> met centrally under the fuselage at the vertex of a transverse V-strut and, on each side, a faired, long displacement oleo leg and a faired drag strut, {{both from the}} lower fuselage longeron, carried the outer end of the axle. The tailskid also had an oleo strut.|$|R
50|$|While {{most other}} {{manufacturers}} derive their trucks from road applications, Tatra T815 was purposely designed for extreme off-road conditions, and its road versions {{are derived from}} the off-road original concept. The principle consists in a central load-carrying tube with independently suspended swinging <b>half-axles</b> bolted as one whole. This gives Tatra vehicles outstanding driving qualities in the most difficult terrains. The concept allows higher off-road speed compared to classical rigid axle design.|$|R
50|$|Suspension {{was usually}} {{adapted from the}} East German Barkas minivans and teams filled the strut legs with {{in-house}} mixed oils to enhance their performance. <b>Half-axles</b> often came from the soviet-made UAZ all-terrain capable jeeps and minivans. Deceleration was provided by aftermarket-drilled soviet Lada brake discs, paired with east German, four-piston Wartburg calipers. The steering assembly was often adopted from east German Trabant mini-compact cars, but required extensive customization to fit available space.|$|R
50|$|After trials with Rotax and Volkswagen engines, Lambert {{chose the}} Belgian 61 kW (82 hp) ULPower UL260i {{flat-four}} {{to power the}} M106. The development period also produced changes to the undercarriage, which initially had V-strut main legs and <b>half-axles.</b> These were replaced with cantilever spring glass fiber legs. The standard M106 has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, though tricycle gear is an option. The wheels may be faired. A glass cockpit electronic flight instrument system is standard equipment.|$|R
