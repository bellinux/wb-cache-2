25|$|A common problem, {{called the}} {{subgraph}} isomorphism problem, <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> fixed graph as a subgraph {{in a given}} graph. One reason {{to be interested in}} such a question is that many graph properties are hereditary for subgraphs, which means that a graph has the property if and only if all subgraphs have it too.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} of perfect elimination orderings <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> maximum clique of a chordal graph in polynomial-time, while {{the same problem}} for general graphs is NP-complete. More generally, a chordal graph can have only linearly many maximal cliques, while non-chordal graphs may have exponentially many. To list all maximal cliques of a chordal graph, simply find a perfect elimination ordering, form a clique for each vertex v together with the neighbors of v that are later than v in the perfect elimination ordering, and test whether each of the resulting cliques is maximal.|$|E

About the madness {{at the heart of}} the play, Rush said that for him [...] "it's about finding the dramatic impact in the moments of his mania. What seems to work best <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> vulnerability or a point of empathy, where an audience can look at Lear and think how shocking it must be to be that old and to be banished from your family into the open air in a storm.

2500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{shots of the}} library and a book called [...] "The Story of Us". Swift narrates the story while {{standing}} between two bookshelves, sitting on a desk and lying across a table (and occasionally lying on top of [...] "The Story of Us") {{with a stack of}} books next to her, as we see scenes flashing back and forth between her and her ex-boyfriend, students in the library, some library staff, and her band playing the song. The scenes between her and her ex start with a private meeting between the two in the library, scenes where she <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> place by herself without him in the library, to the awkward scene of finding him across the room from her. Swift hides behind a book she's holding when she notices her ex, then looks away pulling on her clothes and plays with her hair, in the attempt of not making him notice her. She doesn't notice that he noticed her too, later in the video, and was trying to avoid her too. They both eventually catch each other looking and they awkwardly try to give each other a silent and distant [...] "Hi" [...] as the video cuts to a scene where we see a girl who first pulls Swift's ex into a make out, then pulls away as the librarian passes by. When the librarian passes, Swift's ex pulls the girl back and kisses her again. This cheating caused the fall out between Swift and the guy. Swift eventually gives the first [...] "Hi" [...] which he returns and both get up to confront the other. The video ends with a break out of the other classmates and staff joining in, the classmates throwing away their papers and they and the staff begin dancing to the song while both Swift and her ex are face to face with each other in a very awkward moment, both trying to say how the other feels, but eventually they both shrug at each other and walk away. The last shot is of Swift closing the book of [...] "The Story of Us".|$|E
