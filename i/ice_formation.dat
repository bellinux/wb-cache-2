5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of I-35E is at exit 88A in Burnsville, where I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W. While I-35W heads {{north into}} Minneapolis, I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul. There is no access between I-35E and I-35W here, but Dakota County Road 42 (exit 88B), {{immediately to the}} north, connects the two Interstates in Burnsville. Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include State Highway 77 (MN77, signed as Cedar Avenue—exit92) at Apple Valley– Eagan and Interstate 494 (exit99) in Mendota Heights. Between exits94 and 97, the highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid Blackhawk Lake. As it crosses I-494, I-35E turns more to the north, crossing MN110 (exit101) and MN13 (exit102) in Mendota Heights before crossing the Mississippi River on the Lexington Bridge into the city of Saint Paul. This portion of I-35E is four lanes wide (two in each direction), except between MN77 and MN110, where it carries six lanes. The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes—four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for MN13—as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path. The bridge has an innovative automatic anti-icing system that sprays potassium acetate onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and <b>ice</b> <b>formation</b> in inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before <b>ice</b> <b>formation</b> or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E

25|$|For {{red blood}} cells, the optimum cooling rate is very rapid (nearly 100°C per second), whereas for stem cells the optimum cooling rate is very slow (1°C per minute).

25|$|The ice extent {{depends on}} whether the winter is mild, moderate, or severe.

According to the 18th-century natural historian William Derham, during the severe winters of 1703 and 1708, the ice cover reached as far as the Danish straits. Frequently, parts of the Gulf of Bothnia and Gulf of Finland are frozen, in addition to coastal fringes in more southerly locations such as the Gulf of Riga. This description meant that the whole of the Baltic Sea was covered with ice.|$|E

25|$|Cryonics is the {{low-temperature}} {{preservation of}} humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, {{with the hope}} that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the future. Cryonics procedures ideally begin within minutes of cardiac arrest, and use cryoprotectants to prevent <b>ice</b> <b>formation</b> during cryopreservation. However, the idea of cryonics also includes preservation of people long after death because of the possibility that brain encoding memory structure and personality may still persist or be inferable in the future. Whether sufficient brain information still exists for cryonics to successfully preserve may be intrinsically unprovable by present knowledge. Therefore, most proponents of cryonics see it as an intervention with prospects for success that vary widely depending on circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Ice {{forms on}} {{rivers and lakes}} in {{response}} to seasonal cooling. The sizes of the ice bodies involved {{are too small to}} exert other than localized climatic effects. However, the freeze-up/break-up processes respond to large-scale and local weather factors, such that considerable interannual variability exists in the dates of appearance and disappearance of the ice. Long series of lake-ice observations can serve as a proxy climate record, and the monitoring of freeze-up and break-up trends may provide a convenient integrated and seasonally specific index of climatic perturbations. Information on river-ice conditions is less useful as a climatic proxy because <b>ice</b> <b>formation</b> is strongly dependent on river-flow regime, which is affected by precipitation, snow melt, and watershed runoff as well as being subject to human interference that directly modifies channel flow, or that indirectly affects the runoff via land-use practices.|$|E

500|$|Andrée {{assured the}} {{audience}} that Arctic summer weather was uniquely suitable for ballooning. The midnight sun would enable observations round the clock, halving the voyage time required, and do away with all need for anchoring at night, which might otherwise be a dangerous business. Neither would the balloon's buoyancy be adversely affected by the cold of night. The drag-rope steering technique was particularly well adapted for a region where the ground, consisting of ice, was [...] "low in friction and free of vegetation". He said that the minimal precipitation in the area posed no threat of weighing down the balloon. If some rain or snow did fall on the balloon, Andrée argued, [...] "precipitation at above-zero temperatures will melt, and precipitation at below-zero temperatures will blow off, for the balloon will be travelling more slowly than the wind." [...] The audience was convinced by these arguments, so disconnected were they from {{the realities of the}} Arctic summer storms, fogs, high humidity, and ever-present threat of <b>ice</b> <b>formation.</b> The academy approved Andrée's expense calculation of 130,800kronor in all, corresponding in today's money to just under a million U.S. dollars, of which the single largest sum, 36,000kronor, was for the balloon. With this endorsement, there was a rush to support his project, headed by King Oscar II, who personally contributed 30,000kronor, and Alfred Nobel, the dynamite magnate and founder of the Nobel Prize.|$|E

500|$|The {{eggs are}} laid in late May or June. A clutch {{of one or}} two olive-brown oval eggs with dark brown spots is laid which take 24 to 25 days to hatch, with both parents taking turns to incubate. [...] The nest is usually placed along steep lake shorelines where the adults can quickly dive {{underwater}} when approached by predators. The eggs are about [...] long and [...] wide and the two eggs are laid with an interval of one to three days between them, and hatch [...] The newly hatched chicks are sooty black and have a white belly. Within hours of hatching, the young begin to leave the nest with the parents, swimming close by and sometimes riding on one parent’s back. The parents and chicks initially stay in shallow and isolated bays where the parents are able to defend the chicks better. The chicks are capable of making shallow dives from their first day but make deeper dives as they grow. Fledging takes 70 to 77 days. Usually, only one brood is raised. [...] Both parents feed the chicks live prey from hatching to fledging and as they grow, they become able to feed and fend for themselves after about two months. The parent birds capture small fish and hold them crosswise in their bill, call and approach the chicks with their head lowered so that the chicks can grasp them. If food is scarce, the young may fight intensely, and often only one young survives. The chicks leave the breeding ground before <b>ice</b> <b>formation</b> in the fall. A pair of loons raising two chicks have been estimated to feed on 423kg of fish during the five and a half months that they spend in their breeding territory.

40|$|Dental annuli {{analyses}} were performed on 170 ringed seal (Phoca hispida) canines recovered from five Thule semisubterranean houses located at site PaJs- 13 at Hazard Inlet, Somerset Island in the central Canadian Arctic. Season of death results indicate greater seal hunting during the spring. Age at death results were used to produce mortality profiles which, when compared with idealized patterns, revealed a prime-dominated pattern indicating the presence of some selective factor in the subsistence strategy. Based on ethnographical studies of traditional seal hunting techniques, conscious selection was eliminated as a factor. Biological studies of ringed seal demonstrate that during the spring, older, sexually mature seals, occupy breeding areas in stable fast <b>ice</b> <b>formations</b> located close to the coast in complex coastal areas. Younger immature seals, on the other hand, occupy areas of unstable pack <b>ice</b> <b>formations</b> either further from the shore in complex coastal areas, or along simple coastlines.
