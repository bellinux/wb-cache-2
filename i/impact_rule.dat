40|$|The <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> is {{an ancient}} torts {{doctrine}} that precludes recovery for emotional distress unless the victim has been physically impacted by the tortfeasor and the emotional distress grew out of that physical impact. American courts widely adopted the <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> and it persists {{in a handful of}} states to this day. Courts give several reasons for denying these negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) claims and these reasons fall into three broad categories: judicial efficiency, evidence concerns, and foreseeability. This paper proposes that Florida abrogate the <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> and switch to using a general negligence approach for NIED claims. First, this paper gives an overview of {{the current state of the}} Florida <b>impact</b> <b>rule,</b> its exceptions, and why the rule exists. This overview shows that the policy benefits that justify the <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> do not flow from the rule itself. Next, this paper discusses the impact rules as they stand in the four other states that still cling to them. Comparison of these jurisdictions with Florida reveals that Florida’s <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> is the least restrictive, appearing more like a general negligence analysis. With this background in mind, discussion of Kentucky’s recent abrogation of the <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> and Tennessee’s overruling of the physical manifestation rule shows that foreseeability is the true core of the <b>impact</b> <b>rule.</b> Lastly, analysis of <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> cases under a general negligence approach shows Florida already functionally uses general negligence principles in NIED claims. Thus, there is no loss in abrogating the <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> because Florida is functionally already there...|$|E

The absence of closed form solutions makes difficulties in estimation of {{the gap between the}} stable manifold and unstable manifold.

40|$|Impact {{analysis}} {{is concerned with}} the identification of consequences of changes and is therefore an important activity for software evolution. In modelbased software development, models are core artifacts, which are often used to generate essential parts of a software system. Changes to a model can thus substantially affect different artifacts of a software system. In this paper, we propose a modelbased approach to impact analysis, in which explicit <b>impact</b> <b>rules</b> can be specified in a domain specific language (DSL). These <b>impact</b> <b>rules</b> define consequences of designated UML class diagram changes on software artifacts and the need of dependent activities such as data evolution. The UML class diagram changes are identified automatically using model differencing. The advantage of using explicit <b>impact</b> <b>rules</b> is that they enable the formalization of knowledge about a product. By explicitly defining this knowledge, it is possible to create a checklist with hints about development steps that are (potentially) necessary to manage the evolution. To validate the feasibility of our approach, we provide results of a case study.

40|$|Abstract: Unintended {{side effects}} during changes of {{software}} {{demand for a}} precise test case selection to achieve both confidence and minimal effort for testing. Identi-fying the change related test cases requires an impact analysis across different views, models, and tests. Model-based regression testing aims to provide this analysis earlier in the software development cycle and thus enables an early estimation of test effort. In this paper, we present an approach for model-based regression testing of business processes. Our approach analyzes change types and dependency relations between different models such as Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), Unified Mod-eling Language (UML), and UML Testing Profile (UTP) models. We developed a set of <b>impact</b> <b>rules</b> to forecast the impact of those changes on the test models prior to their implementation. We discuss the implementation of our <b>impact</b> <b>rules</b> inside a prototype tool EMFTrace. The approach has been evaluated in a project for business processes on mobile devices. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Because {{exploratory}} rule discovery {{works with}} data {{that is only}} {{a sample of the}} phenomena to be investigated, some resulting rules may appear interesting only by chance. Techniques are developed for automatically discarding statistically insignificant exploratory rules that cannot survive a hypothesis with regard to its ancestors. We call such insignificant rules derivative extended rules. In this paper, we argue that there is another type of derivative exploratory rules, which is derivative with regard to their children. We also argue that considerable amount of such derivative partial rules can not be successfully removed using existing rule pruning techniques. We propose a new technique to address this problem. Experiments are done in <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> discovery to evaluate the effect of this derivative partial rule filter. Results show that the inherent problem of too many resulting rules in exploratory rule discovery is alleviated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. How to {{efficiently}} discard potentially uninteresting {{rules in}} exploratory rule discovery {{is one of}} the important research foci in data mining. Many researchers have presented algorithms to automatically remove potentially uninteresting rules utilizing background knowledge and user-specified constraints. Identifying the significance of exploratory rules using a significance test is desirable for removing rules that may appear interesting by chance, hence providing the users with a more compact set of resulting rules. However, applying statistical tests to identify significant rules requires considerable computation and data access in order to obtain the necessary statistics. The situation gets worse as the size of the database increases. In this paper, we propose two approaches for improving the efficiency of significant exploratory rule discovery. We also evaluate the experimental effect in <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> discovery which is suitable for discovering exploratory rules in very large, dense databases...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} the impact of early versus late design decisions, a study was undertaken on {{the root causes of}} missed requirements in new product development and their impact on development cost through rework activities. The context is the industrial development of unmanned aerial vehicles. The aim is to understand the occurrence rate of missed requirements, their root causes, and their relative impact. A quantitative approach of counting requirements changes and using engineering documentation enabled traceability from observation back to root cause origin. The development process was partitioned into sequential program segments, to categorize activities to before and after concept and design freeze. We found that {{there was a significant difference}} in the rate of design defects arising before and after concept freeze; and found there was a significantly higher number of corrective activities required for design defects arising earlier before concept freeze. The revision rate of concept phase decisions was over 50 %, and the rework multiplier if detected late was over 10 X. In combination, design decisions made before design freeze accounted for 86 % of the total expected program cost, and 34 % was determined before concept freeze. These results quantify and support the anecdotal 80 - 20 <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> for design decisions. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{experimentally}} {{investigating the}} dynamical behaviors when {{a system of}} rigid bodies undergoes so-called paradoxical situations. An experimen-tal setup corresponding to the analytical model presented in our prior work [28] is developed, in which a two-link robotic system comes into contact with a moving rail. The experimental results clearly show that a tangential impact does exist at the contact point and takes a peculiar property well coinciding with the maximum dissipation principle stated in [11] by Moreau; the relative tangential velocity of the contact point must immediately approach zero once a Painleve ́ paradox occurs. After the tangential impact, a bouncing motion may be excited and {{is influenced by the}} speed of the moving rail. We adopt the tangential <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> presented in [28] to determine the post-impact velocities of the system, and use an event-driven algo-rithm to perform numerical simulations. The qualitative comparisons between the numerical and experimental results are carried out and show good agreements.

40|$|In Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. 2658 (2009), the Supreme Court {{recently}} {{reaffirmed the}} doctrine, first articulated by the Court in Griggs v. Duke Power Company, 401 U. S. 424 (1971), that employers {{can be held}} liable under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act for neutral personnel practices with a disparate impact on minority workers. The Griggs Court further held that employers can escape liability by showing that their staffing practices are job related or consistent with business necessity. In the interim since Griggs, social scientists have generated evidence undermining two key assumptions behind that decision and its progeny. First, the Court in Griggs noted the absence of evidence that the selection criteria in that case (a high school diploma and an aptitude test) were related to subsequent performance of the service jobs at issue, and expressed doubt {{about the existence of}} such a link. But research in industrial and organization psychology (IOP) has repeatedly documented that tests and criteria such as those at issue in Griggs (which are heavily “g”-loaded and thus dependent on cognitive ability) remain the best predictors of performance for jobs at all levels of complexity. Second, Griggs and its progeny rest on the implicit assumption, reflected in the so-called 4 / 5 rule, that fair and valid hiring criteria will result in a workplace that roughly reflects the representation of each group in the background population. Work in psychometrics and labor economics shows that this assumption is unjustified. Because blacks lag significantly behind whites on measures of cognitive ability, most valid job selection criteria will have a substantial adverse impact on this group. The combination of well-documented racial differences in cognitive ability and the consistent link between ability and job performance generates a pattern that experts term “the validity-diversity tradeoff”: job selection devices that best predict future job performance generate the smallest number of minority hires in a broad range of positions. Indeed, the evidence indicates that most valid screening devices will have a significant adverse impact on blacks and will also violate the 4 / 5 rule under the law of disparate impact. Because legitimately meritocratic (that is, job-related) job selection practices will routinely trigger prima facie violations of the disparate <b>impact</b> <b>rule,</b> employers who adopt such practices run the risk of being required to justify them – a costly and difficult task that encourages undesirable, self-protective behaviors and may result in unwarranted liability. To alleviate this burden, the article proposes to adopt a new regime of “disparate impact realism” that abandons the 4 / 5 rule in favor of sliding scale ratios pegged to measured disparities in group performance and the selectivity of particular positions. Alternatively, the disparate <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> should be repealed altogether. The data indicate that pronounced differences in the background distribution of skill and human capital, not arbitrary hurdles imposed by employers, are the principle factor behind racial imbalances in most jobs. Moreover, blacks lag behind whites in actual on-the-job performance, which indicates that employers are not unfairly excluding minorities from the workforce but rather bending over backwards to include them. Disparate impact litigation, which does nothing to correct existing disparities and distracts from the task of addressing them, represents a cumbersome, misplaced effort that could better be directed at the root causes of workforce racial imbalance...|$|E
40|$|Since 2011, the U. S. Supreme Court {{has granted}} certiorari three {{times on the}} {{question}} of whether disparate impact liability is cognizable under the Fair Housing Act (FHA). The first two times, the parties settled. The question is before the Court once again in Texas Department of Housing 2 ̆ 6 Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., and this time the parties seem unlikely to settle. Disparate impact liability in the civil rights context entails liability for actions that have a discriminatory effect, regardless of an actor’s motive. Under the FHA, this can translate into liability for actions that make housing disproportionately unavailable for persons of a protected class or actions that tend to increase or maintain segregated housing patterns. All eleven federal circuit courts that have addressed the question agree that disparate impact claims are cognizable under the FHA. In addition, in the spring of 2013, the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) promulgated a rule that standardizes the burdens of proof for disparate impact claims under the FHA and specifically states for the first time in a formal administrative rule that disparate impact claims are cognizable under the FHA. The promulgation of HUD’s disparate <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> means that this time around the Supreme Court must give heightened deference to an interpretation of the FHA that authorizes disparate impact claims. This Note argues that despite the near-unanimity of the circuit courts’ interpretation of the FHA, the fate of disparate impact claims under the FHA was anything but certain prior to the promulgation of the HUD rule. The HUD rule makes it much more likely that the FHA disparate impact standard will survive, and this Note argues that it should...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{whether or not}} there are inherit flaws in Swedish legislation concerning psychiatric institutional care, or in the application of the act, which might lead to the failure of rule of law for the private citizen. Law (1991 : 1128) concerning psychiatric institutional care in certain instances (LPIC) aims to establish rules which will ensure rule of law for the mentally ill in case of psychiatric institutional care. Despite this, there are legal cases which indicate that these rules, and their implications, are not always considered at the psychiatric wards. The questions at issues which this study aims to answer are thus: Are there any deficiencies concerning rule of law in LPIC 2 − 3 §§, 4 − 6 §§, 7 − 10 §§, 15 − 25 §§ and 32 − 33 §§ ? This section focuses on LPIC and its design. Whether or not the act adheres to rule of law is examined through a definition which has evolved through discussions of concept based in Peczeniks definition of rule of law. The second question at issue is: Does The National Board of Health and Welfare activity supervision and the National Psychiatric Coordination inquiry point to any deficiencies in the application of the regulation that might negatively <b>impact</b> <b>rule</b> of law? This section is based on the parts concerned with compulsory commitment in The National Board of Health and Welfare activity supervision and the National Psychiatric Coordination’s inquiry. The considerations of rule of law in the application of the rules are based on the definition of rule of law derived from Annika Staaf’s viewpoints. This definition deals with the application of the rules concerning compulsory commitment. The third question at issue {{takes the form of a}} discussion dealing with the first two questions. The answer is thus based on the answers to the two opening questions and includes an extra focus placed on the historical heritage and the future psychiatric institutional care. To answer the questions at issue a traditional legal method will be used. This means that the law is determined by studying texts of law and preparatory work. Doctrine concerning compulsory psychiatric commitment is also used. To achieve a deeper understanding of the questions at issue concerning rule of law that might arise in the usage of compulsory psychiatric commitment, a historical retrospect spanning the legislative development will be presented. The result produced by the analysis indicates that the legislation in accordance with the definition of rule of law based on Peczeniks definition in most cases can be considered to adhere to rule of law. On the other hand, the demand for necessity, which rules the assessment of compulsory psychiatric commitment, is found to be indeterminable. According to the inquiry this will in some cases lead to arbitrary and routine-like admissions, and in other cases lead to the patient being in bad condition at the time of admission. The patient will thereby find it difficult to gain any usefulness from the care given. The inquiry here points to local variation which leads to a non-existing predictability. The second question at issue, where Staaf’s definition of rule of law is used, finds a somewhat higher number of deficiencies. I can in my paper thus determine that most of the deficiencies can be found in the application of the act. The gravest deficiency from a rule of law standpoint found by The National Board of Health and Welfare is the lack of local instructions regarding the monitoring of time limits during compulsory commitment. Based on these conclusions the paper’s question at issue is discussed in the last chapter. Like the National Psychiatric Coordination finds in its inquiry, this paper finds the answer to the question at issue to be that a reformation of the act is needed. In light of the historical exposition I find that new forms of care and methods of treatment have arisen since the conception of the act, which provides new possibilities for the compulsory psychiatric commitment...|$|E
