The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the role played by SEBOX in oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis using RNA interference (RNAi). Microin-jection of Sebox double-stranded RNA into GV oocytes resulted in a marked decrease in Sebox mRNA and protein expression. However, Sebox RNAi affects neither oocyte maturation rate nor morphological characteristics, including spindle and chromo-somal organization of metaphase II oocytes. In addition, Sebox RNAi had no discernible effect on the activities of M-phase promoting factor or mitogen-activated protein kinase.

Our initial tests were encumbered by the thermal effects of probe self-heating, which resulted in accelerated development of the zebrafish embryos. After subsequent optimization, our test revealed a significant retardation of primary motor axons and the migration of the LLP in embryos scanned with ultrasound, which indicated a potential for nonthermal effects on neuronal development.

In embryos held 2 h, 15 / 17 (88. 2 %) embryos contained condensed chromosomes, while only 12 / 24 (50. 0 %) embryos held 3 h exhibited this characteristic. The proportion of embryos with elongated or fragmented chromosomes tended to increase with increased hold time. While 15 / 19 (78. 9 %) of embryos held 2 h developed a single pronucleus 6 h after activation, only 8 / 22 (36. 4 %) had one pronucleus after a 4 -h <b>hold.</b> <b>Embryos</b> held 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 5 and 4. 0 h cleaved at rates of 207 / 281 (73. 7 %), 142 / 166 (85. 5 %), 655 / 912 (71. 8 %), 212 / 368 (57. 6 %), 406 / 667 (60. 9 %), 362 / 644 (56. 2 %) and 120 / 228 (52. 6 %) respectively.

Embryos with increasing numbers of copies (from 1 to 4) of thebithorax system show a decreasing frequency of phenocopies. A model is proposed that explains ldquobithoraxrdquo phenocopies as resulting from disturbances in the distribution of positional information signals for segments (inductor molecules) which compete with the product of a regulator gene (repressor) and thecis-regulatory region of thebithorax system.

Recently, our study demonstrated full pluripotency of mouse iPS cells by tetraploid complementation, indicating {{that it is possible to}} obtain fully reprogrammed iPS cells directly from differentiated somatic cells.

Gene targeting knock-in or knock-out into local regions is possible to perform with combination with a specific CRE line, which is laborious, costly, and time consuming. Therefore, a simple transfection method, an in utero electroporation technique, which can be performed with short time, will be handy to test the possible function of candidate genes prior to the generation of transgenic animals 1, 2. In addition to this, in utero electroporation targets areas of the brain where no specific CRE line exists, and will limit embryonic lethality 3, 4.

Whilst conventional volumetric measurement based assessment {{methods have been}} widely used in fish embryo membrane permeability studies, they are lengthy and reduce the capacity for multi-embryo measurement during an experimental run. A new rapid ‘real-time’ measurement technique is required to determine membrane permeability during cryoprotectant treatment.

An <b>embryo</b> <b>holding</b> cell, capable of holding up to 10 zebrafish embryos was built incorporating the original system electrods for measuring the impedance spectra. The holding cell was tested with deionised water and a series of KCl solutions with known conductance values to confirm the performance of the modified system. Untreated intact embryos were then tested to optimise the loading capacity and sensitivity of the system. To study the impedance changes of zebrafish embryos during cryoprotectant exposure, three, six or nine embryos at 50 % epiboly stage were loaded into the holding cell in egg water, which was then removed and replaced by 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 or 3  M methanol or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The impedance changes of the loaded embryos in different cryoprotectant solutions were monitored over 30  min at 22  °C, immediately following embryo exposure to cryoprotectants, at the frequency range of 10 – 106  Hz. The impedance changes of the embryos in egg water were used as controls. Results from this study showed that the optimum embryo loading level was six embryos per cell for each experimental run. The optimum frequency was identified at 103. 14 or 1380  Hz which provided good sensitivity and reproducibility.

40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} were to 1.) {{determine if a}} higher betahydroxybutyrate(BHBA) level (≥ 1. 2 mmol/L) measured at 5 days in milk (DIM) results in a lower first service conception success; 2.) study the relationship of BHBA ≥ 1. 2 mmol/L measured at 5 DIM with the following variables: season, parity, body condition score at calving (BCSCavC) and 40 DIM (BCS 40 C), retained placenta (RP), metritis, mastitis, respiratory diseases (Resp), displacement abomasum (DA), lameness (Lame), clinical endometritis (CE), cyclic and AI at estrus. The null hypothesis {{is that there is}} no association between BHBA ≥ 1. 2 mmol/L and first service conception success. From November 2012 to august 2013, 1197 Holstein-Friesian cows were studied. Cows were enrolled at calving till the second pregnancy check on 60 ± 3 days after first insemination. Cows were excluded if sold or dead within 60 DIM or when data was incomplete. The definition of P 32 AI 1 is the presence of an amniotic vesicle <b>holding</b> an <b>embryo</b> with heartbeat at 32 ± 3 days after first artificial insemination (AI). Subclinical ketosis (SCK) is defined as serum concentrations of BHBA ≥ 1. 2 mmol/L. Cows were inseminated when standing heat was observed or after timed AI (TAI). All cows had serum blood collected on day 5 post-partum from the coccygeal artery or vein and were analyzed for concentrations of 3 -OH-butyrate (BHBA; Autokit 3 -HB, Wako). For the statistical analyses 1041 Holstein-Friesian cows were included. All analyses were performed with the SAS system version 9. 3. Elevated BHBA (≥ 1. 2 mmol/L) concentrations measured with the Wako-kit on 5 DIM are not associated with pregnancy after first service. The logistic regression model with P 32 AI 1 as response variable selected by backward elimination includes 2 variables that were significantly associated; RP and mastitis; 3 variables that have a tendency toward statistical differences; DA, Lameness, and CE. So, the probability to become pregnant after first service with RP, mastitis, DA, lameness or CE is smaller than to become pregnant without these diseases. The logistic regression model with BHBA (≥ 1. 2 mmol/L) as response variable shows a statistically significantly relationship between season, parity, BCS at calving, mastitis, DA, and a tendency for statistical difference for BSC at 40 DIM and CE. The odds of having SCK in summer was 1. 7 times greater than the odds of having SCK in winter. Primiparous had lesser odds of SCK than multiparous. Cows with a high (≥ 3. 5) BCS at calving have 2. 4 times greater odds of SCK than cows with a BCS lower than 3. 0. Cows without DA were 0. 5 times as likely to develop SCK as cows with DA. The odds of SCK in cows with BCS ≥ 3. 5 at 40 DIM was 0. 5 times less than the odds of SCK in cows with BCS < 3. 0 at 40 DIM. The odds of SCK in cows without CE was 0. 7 times smaller than the odds of SCK with CE. The odds of SCK without mastitis is 1. 8 times more than the odds of SCK with mastitis. This is the first study reported such a relationship between SCK and mastitis...|$|R

The causative agent, bluetongue virus (BTV), can occur in the semen of rams and bulls {{at the time of}} peak viraemia and be transferred to a developing foetus. The risk of the transmission of BTV by bovine embryos is negligible if the embryos are washed according to the International Embryo Transfer Society (IETS) protocol. Two experiments were undertaken to determine whether this <b>holds</b> for ovine <b>embryos</b> that had been exposed to BTV. Firstly, the oestrus cycles of 12 ewes were synchronised and the 59 embryos that were obtained were exposed in vitro to BTV- 2 and BTV- 4 at a dilution of 1 x 102. 88 and 1 x 10 3. 5 respectively. In the second experiment, embryos were recovered from sheep at the peak of viraemia. A total of 96 embryos were collected from BTV-infected sheep 21 days after infection. In both experiments half the embryos were washed and treated with trypsin according to the IETS protocol while the remaining embryos were neither washed nor treated. All were tested for the presence of BTV using cell culture techniques. The virus was detected after three passages in BHK- 21 cells only in one wash bath in the first experiment and two unwashed embryos exposed to BTV- 4 at a titre of 1 x 10 3. 5 . No embryos or uterine flush fluids obtained from viraemic donors used in the second experiment were positive for BTV after the standard washing procedure had been followed. The washing procedure of the IETS protocol can thus clear sheep embryos infected with BTV either in vitro or in vivo. How to cite this article: Venter, E.

Harland This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Microdissection,” Chapter 10, in [*Early Development of* *Xenopus laevis*]([URL] by Hazel L. Sive, Robert M. Grainger, and Richard M. Harland. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2000. ### INTRODUCTION The basic Keller explant is a rectangle of dorsal mesendoderm and ectoderm from an early-gastrula-stage *Xenopus laevis* embryo. It is ~ 60 ° to 90 ° wide, extending from the bottle cells to the animal pole. This protocol describes how to dissect, assemble, and cultivate Keller explants. The purpose of Keller explants was initially to allow observation of gastrulation movements, particularly convergent extension, in culture. This is difficult to do when explants curl up, but in Keller sandwiches, the explants are cultured flat, either as a single sheet (open-face explant) or more frequently as two sheets sandwiched together with their inner surfaces apposed (closed sandwich). Explants are cultured beneath a coverslip fragment or a glass bridge resting on silicone vacuum grease until the desired stage, usually during or after neurulation. Instead of involuting beneath the ectoderm, mesoderm elongates in a plane with adjacent ectoderm. Explants are made {{at the onset of}} gastrulation before significant vertical juxtaposition of ectoderm and mesoderm has occurred. ### RELATED INFORMATION For further information on the generation and use of Keller explants, please see Keller and Danilchik (1998).

If the cuts have not reached the animal pole, complete the cuts using one of the following approaches: - i. Insert the tip of the eyebrow knife into one of the cuts, under the region that needs to be cut. Then press the hair loop against the tip of the eyebrow hair. This will complete the cut by pinching the tissue between the two hairs. - ii. Alternatively, hold the region adjacent to the cutting edge with the hair loop, and gently flick upward with the eyebrow hair. This trick requires some practice, but, once mastered, it is a clean and fast way to cut through thin tissues. 5. Using one of the cutting methods described in Step 4, make a horizontal cut at the animal end of the dissection to complete a rectangle with the previous two incisions (Fig. 1 A, slit 3). 6. <b>Hold</b> the <b>embryo</b> down with a hair loop. Using an eyebrow knife, peel back the dorsal tissues to the dorsal blastopore lip (Fig. 1 B). Use the edge of the eyebrow hair to deepen the cleft formed by the involuting head mesoderm to allow peeling back to the lip. - *In very early gastrulae, the cleft has yet to form, thus it must be cut with the knife. This removes some of the head mesoderm from the noninvoluted chordamesoderm*. 7. Flip the embryo over (vegetal pole up), and, with the edge of the eyebrow hair, cut downward along or just below the bottle cells, all the way through to the blastocoel. This is the bottom edge of the rectangle (Fig. 1 B, slit 4). - *Do not cut off the bottle cells*. 8. Remove any pieces of involuting head mesoderm that are left on the inner side of the outer mesoderm cells (Fig. 1 C). Place the rectangle inner surface down, and trim off any material that protrudes beyond the bottle cells. Then, turn the explant over, and use the tip of the eyebrow knife to gently pick off any loose head mesoderm cells. 9. Trim the explant into a regular rectangle of the desired dimensions. For an open-face explant, proceed to Step 10; for a closed sandwich, proceed to Step 11. 10. For an open-face explant: - i. Transfer the explant to a new dish of Sater’s modified blastocoel buffer (SMBB), and lay the tissue flat, with the side of interest uppermost. - ii. Using a 5 -ml syringe, put a dab of vacuum grease at each end of a sterile rectangle of coverslip (~ 5 × 10 mm) or glass bridge. - *The grease serves to hold the coverslip in place on top of the explant and should be used sparingly*. - iii. Gently place the coverslip on top of the explant. Exert slight pressure to flatten the explant, but do not damage the cells. Avoid contaminating the explant with vacuum grease. 11. To make a closed sandwich: - i. Using two rectangular explants of the same size (from Step 9), immediately press the inner sides together, making sure that the bottle cells are aligned. - *If explants are left in medium for more than a few minutes, they will not adhere well*. - ii. Trim the edges of the sandwich so that the explants are exactly the same size. Set them aside in a dissecting dish. - *The dissecting dish should be kept relatively free from debris, and thus, it is advisable to prepare sandwiches one at a time*. - iii. Transfer the sandwiches to a clean dish, and gently press each one under a coverslip (as described in Step 10. ii). Do not squash the sandwich! - *Make sure that the layers of the sandwich are well aligned and that the explant is flat. If explants are out of register, the layers will not elongate efficiently*. 12. Culture the explants in SMBB at 15 °C- 23 °C, depending on the desired rate of development. - *To monitor explant development, include three to four control embryos with intact vitelline membranes in the same dish as the explants. If the incubation time exceeds 24 hours, replace the medium every day*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The mesoderm of late-teen-stage explants begins to dissociate. **[Step 12]** - **Solution**: Reduce the salt concentration of the medium as follows: - Replace half of the volume with H 2 O containing antibiotics (e. g., gentamycin at 0. 05 mg/ml). - Alternatively, replace the entire volume with 0. 5 X MBS containing antibiotics ### REFERENCES 1.
