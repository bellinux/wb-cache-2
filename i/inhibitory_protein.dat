25|$|Upon {{contact with}} their ligand, TNF receptors also form trimers, their tips fitting into the grooves formed between TNF monomers. This binding causes a {{conformational}} change {{to occur in the}} receptor, leading to the dissociation of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>protein</b> SODD from the intracellular death domain. This dissociation enables the adaptor protein TRADD to bind to the death domain, serving as a platform for subsequent protein binding. Following TRADD binding, three pathways can be initiated.|$|E

50|$|Immune {{checkpoint}} inhibitors {{have recently}} shown promise against several cancers and may hold promise against sarcomas as well.

2500|$|Apoptosis in HeLa {{cells is}} {{inhibited}} by proteins {{produced by the}} cell; these inhibitory proteins target retinoblastoma tumor-suppressing proteins. These tumor-suppressing proteins regulate the cell cycle, but are rendered inactive when bound to an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>protein.</b> HPV E6 and E7 are inhibitory proteins expressed by the human papillomavirus, HPV being responsible {{for the formation of}} the cervical tumor from which HeLa cells are derived. HPV E6 causes p53, which regulates the cell cycle, to become inactive. HPV E7 binds to retinoblastoma tumor suppressing proteins and limits its ability to control cell division. [...] These two inhibitory proteins are partially responsible for HeLa cells' immortality by inhibiting apoptosis to occur. CDV (Canine Distemper Virus) is able to induce apoptosis despite the presence of these inhibitory proteins. This is an important oncolytic property of CDV: this virus is capable of killing canine lymphoma cells. Oncoproteins E6 and E7 still leave p53 inactive, but they are not able to avoid the activation of caspases induced from the stress of viral infection. These oncolytic properties provided a promising link between CDV and lymphoma apoptosis, which can lead to development of alternative treatment methods for both canine lymphoma and human non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Defects in the cell cycle are thought to be responsible for the resistance to chemotherapy or radiation by certain tumor cells, so a virus that can induce apoptosis despite defects in the cell cycle is useful for cancer treatment.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundNeuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an {{inflammatory}} disease {{caused by the}} aquaporin (AQP) - 4 -antibody. Pathological studies on NMO have revealed extensive astrocytic damage, {{as evidenced by the}} loss of AQP 4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), specifically in perivascular regions with immunoglobulin and complement depositions, although other pathological patterns, such as a loss of AQP 4 without astrocyte destruction and clasmatodendrosis, have also been observed. Previous studies have shown that complement-dependent antibody-mediated astrocyte lysis is likely a major pathomechanism in NMO. However, there are also data to suggest antibody-mediated astrocyte dysfunction in the absence of complement. Thus, the importance of complement <b>inhibitory</b> <b>proteins</b> in complement-dependent AQP 4 -antibody-mediated astrocyte lysis in NMO is unclear. In most of the previous studies, the complement and target cells (astrocytes or AQP 4 -transfected cells) were derived from different species; however, the complement <b>inhibitory</b> <b>proteins</b> that are expressed on the cell surface cannot protect themselves against complement-dependent cytolysis unless the complements and complement <b>inhibitory</b> <b>proteins</b> are from the same species. To resolve these issues, we studied human astrocytes in primary culture treated with AQP 4 -antibody in {{the presence or absence of}} human complement and examined the effect of complement <b>inhibitory</b> <b>proteins</b> using small interfering RNA (siRNA). MethodsPurified IgG (10 mg/mL) was obtained from 5 patients with AQP 4 -antibody-positive NMO, 3 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and 3 healthy controls. Confluent human astrocytes transfected with Venus-M 1 -AQP 4 -cDNA were incubated with IgG (5 % volume). After washing, we cultured the cells with human complements with or without heat inactivation. We observed time-lapse morphological and immunohistochemical changes using a fluorescence microscope. We also evaluated cytotoxicity using a propidium iodide (PI) kit and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. ResultAQP 4 -antibody alone caused clustering and degradation followed by endocytosis of membraneous AQP 4, thereby resulting in decreased cellular adherence and the shrinkage of astrocytic processes. However, these changes were partially reversed by the removal of IgG in culture. In contrast, following the application of AQP 4 -antibody and non-heated human complements, the cell bodies and nuclei started to swell. At 3 h, most of the astrocytes had lost mobility and adherence and were eventually destroyed or had swollen and were then destroyed. In addition, the remaining adherent cells were mostly PI-positive, indicating necrosis. Astrocyte lysis caused by rabbit complement occurred much faster than did cell lysis with human complement. However, the cell lysis was significantly enhanced by the transfection of astrocytes with siRNA against human CD 55 and CD 59, which are major complement <b>inhibitory</b> <b>proteins</b> on the astrocyte membrane. AQP 4 -antibody-negative IgG in MS or control did not induce such changes. ConclusionTaken together, these findings suggest that both complement-dependent and complement-independent AQP 4 -antibody-mediated astrocytopathies may operate in NMO, potentially contributing to diverse pathological patterns. Our results also suggest that the effect of complement <b>inhibitory</b> <b>proteins</b> should be considered when evaluating AQP 4 -antibody-mediated cytotoxicity in AQP 4 -expressing cells...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Although morphine, {{at higher}} doses, induces analgesia, {{it may also}} enhance {{sensitivity}} to pain at extremely low doses as shown in studies for testing an animal's sensitivity to pain. We used an antisense approach capable of selectively down-regulating in vivo G(i) (G inhibitory protein),G(o) and G(s) members of the G(alpha), sub-family protein subunits {{in order to establish}} if these proteins might be implicated in the effects induced by extremely low morphine doses on acute thermonociception. Main methods: Mice pretreated with a morphine hyperalgesic dose (1 mu g/kg) were submitted to hot plate test after pre-treatment with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (aODNs) targeting G(i alpha), G(o alpha) and G(s alpha) regulatory proteins. The association of G-protein (guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein) coupled receptors with G protein was investigated using co-immunoprecipitation procedure. Key findings: The downregulation of the G(i alpha 1 - 3) and G(o alpha 1) proteins reversed the licking latency responses induced by 1 mu g/kg morphine administration toward the basal value whereas downregulation of the G(o alpha 2) and G(s alpha) proteins did not significantly modify the hyperalgesic response. Significance: These results suggest that G <b>inhibitory</b> <b>proteins</b> {{play a role in the}} production of low dose evoked morphine hyperalgesia in mouse. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that both mu opioid receptor (mu OR) and alpha(2) adrenoreceptor (alpha(2) AR) are bound to G <b>inhibitory</b> <b>proteins</b> in hyperalgesic response to morphine extremely low dose. Both mu OR and alpha(2) AR appear to be necessary for low morphine dose induced hyperalgesic response through G <b>inhibitory</b> <b>proteins.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
