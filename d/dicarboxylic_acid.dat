25|$|Saffron {{contains}} more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also has many nonvolatile active components, {{many of which are}} carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, lycopene, and various α- and β-carotenes. However, saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of α-crocin. This crocin is trans-crocetin di-(β-D-gentiobiosyl) ester; it bears the systematic (IUPAC) name 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin. Crocins themselves are a series of hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin. Crocetin is a conjugated polyene <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> that is hydrophobic, and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is esterified with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are sugars, a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant α-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may comprise more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make α-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.|$|E

The drawback of this analytical approach is related to the sample size: the method entails the separation of the sample into two aliquots, one to be derivatized with HMDS and the other with BSTFA. This analytical approach can be considered exhaustive if applied on a sample with a good homogeneity. However, paint samples are often highly heterogeneous, and the amount of sample available is generally very low, making this approach unpractical in some cases.|$|R
2500|$|In {{terms of}} its structure, {{carboplatin}} differs from cisplatin in {{that it has a}} bidentate dicarboxylate (the ligand is CycloButane <b>DiCarboxylic</b> <b>Acid,</b> CBDCA) in place of the two chloride ligand, which are the leaving groups in cisplatin. For this reason, [...] "CBDCA" [...] is sometimes used in the medical literature as an abbreviation referring to carboplatin. Carboplatin exhibits lower reactivity and slower DNA binding kinetics, although it forms the same reaction products in vitro at equivalent doses with cisplatin. Unlike cisplatin, carboplatin may be susceptible to alternative mechanisms. Some results show that cisplatin and carboplatin cause different morphological changes in MCF-7 cell lines while exerting their cytotoxic behaviour. [...] The diminished reactivity limits protein-carboplatin complexes, which are excreted. The lower excretion rate of carboplatin means that more is retained in the body, and hence its effects are longer lasting (a retention half-life of 30 hours for carboplatin, compared to 1.5-3.6 hours in the case of cisplatin).|$|E

For each method, the effect of various experimental parameters on the reaction yield has been investigated and optimized: time and temperature, or amount of reagents. The better procedure was searched for the faster one-step derivatization to determine C 3 -C 10 <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> as target compounds. 	The advantages and drawbacks of the methods are investigated and compared in terms of precision and accuracy of the obtained results, sensitivity and detection limit of the procedure.

40|$|A general {{impairment}} of liver mitochondrial enzymes {{is central to}} Reye's syndrome (RS). The respiration of isolated liver mitochondria was measured after the addition of concentrated normal serum or RS serum derived from 12 patients. RS serum stimulates oxygen consumption in isolated rat liver mitochondria. This effect {{is due to the}} oxidation of uric acid by peroxisomes contaminating the preparation and a stimulation of mitochondrial respiration (1. 05 +/- 0. 14 nmol of O 2 /min X mg of protein; control 0. 30 +/- 0. 08 nmol O 2 /min X mg). The stimulation of respiration occurs in the presence of all respiratory substrates, is dependent on the amount of serum added, and represents an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. RS serum reduces ATP formation by 15 - 76 %. The uncoupling effect correlates with the amount of free fatty acid in the serum sample and resembles the effect induced by the addition of a <b>dicarboxylic</b> fatty <b>acid.</b> <b>Dicarboxylic</b> fatty <b>acids,</b> especially long-chain <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids,</b> impair ATP formation. <b>Dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> were found in the serum of all RS patients and comprised as much as 54 % of the total serum free fatty acids. 90 % of the serum <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> were of 16 - 18 carbon lengths.

40|$|International audienceAn {{atmospheric}} year-round {{study of}} C 2 -C 5 <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> (oxalic, malonic, succinic, malic, and glutaric) and sulfate {{was conducted in}} 2002 and 2003 at three remote western Europe continental sites located at different elevations (from 630 to 4360 m asl). Whatever the site and the season, oxalic acid is always the dominant diacid (average 64 % of total <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids)</b> followed by malonic acid (15 % of total <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids).</b> High correlation coefficients are observed between C 3 (malonic), C 4 (malic and succinic), and C 5 (glutaric) acids and oxalic acid. These strong relationships between C 2 -C 5 diacids support the hypothesis of a common production of these diacids through the aqueous phase chemistry of glutaric acid. Data gained at different elevations are here useful to compare the mass formation rates of sulfate and <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids.</b> It is shown that in summer the decrease of the sum of <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> with height is far less pronounced than the decrease of sulfate (a factor of 2 instead of 6. 8 from 630 to 4360 m asl). That demonstrates that the production of <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> occurs at up to 4300 m elevation while the production of sulfate from SO 2 mainly takes place between the boundary layer and 3000 m elevation. With respect to summer 2002 the sum of <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> was enhanced in summer 2003 (from 136 to 331 ng m− 3 STP at 2870 m asl, for instance) whereas a weaker increase is observed for sulfate (from 1700 to 2500 ng m− 3 STP at 2870 m asl). These changes are attributed to the particular summer 2003 conditions which led to enhanced level of oxidants (strengthened secondary productions) and warmer temperatures (enhanced emissions of biogenic precursors of diacids) ...|$|R

Analytes were derivatized using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) containing 1 % trimethylsilyl chloride and analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Among studied analytes, azelaic acid was found maximum with an average concentration of 6. 0 +/- 3. 6 ng m(- 3) and minimum concentration was found for pimelic acid (1. 06 +/- 0. 63 ng m(- 3)).

Higher <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> (C 7 -C 9) showed a strong correlation with each other (correlation coefficients (r) range, 0. 96 - 0. 97).

40|$|<b>Dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> are {{products}} of the omega-oxidation of monocarboxylic acids. We demonstrate that in rat liver <b>dicarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> (C 5 -C 16) can be converted into their CoA esters by a dicarboxylyl-CoA synthetase. During this activation ATP, which cannot be replaced by GTP, is converted into AMP and PPi, both acting as feedback inhibitors of the reaction. Thermolabile at 37 degrees C, and optimally active at pH 6. 5, dicarboxylyl-CoA synthetase displays the highest activity on dodecanedioic acid (2 micromol/min per g of liver).
