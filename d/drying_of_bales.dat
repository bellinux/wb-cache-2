40|$|Rectangular <b>bales</b> <b>of</b> hay {{measuring}} 35 x 46 x 84 cm baled to a density {{ranging from}} 145 to 172, 4 kg/m$ sp 3 $ were dried on a dryer which can contain 4 300 bales {{for a total}} weight of approximately 130 tons. A 1, 2 meter fan activated by a 60 kw L. P. Gaz engine insured an air flow of 840 m$ sp 3 $/min at 625 Pa of static pressure. This research has clearly demonstrated that approximately 50 % <b>of</b> the <b>drying</b> air flowed between the bales placed on the dryer. By increasing the flow <b>of</b> air, the <b>drying</b> rate <b>of</b> the <b>bales</b> <b>of</b> hay was also increased. The results obtained prove {{of the effect of}} both temperature and relative humidity of the air on drying capacity. Finally, the dryer was more efficient when ten (10) rows <b>of</b> <b>bales</b> were <b>dried</b> at one time rather than 5. It would be desirable to develop a mathematical model to produce a computer simulation <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> applied to <b>bales</b> <b>of</b> hay. Efficient strategies to improve <b>drying</b> procedures <b>of</b> densely <b>baled</b> hay could thus be developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of ventilated barn hay {{results in a}} high quality fodder for ruminants. Nevertheless, this production method is still a niche in Germany even it is found in organic farming. Reasons are the few publications about required investments of the needed technology for hay drying in the barn. This article provides investment and energy costs for different drying techniques: for box hay drying three different farm sizes were compared, for bale hay drying only one farm size is calculated. Bale hay drying demands more power and investment cost as box hay <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> loose hay. <b>Bale</b> <b>drying</b> {{is more complicated than}} barn drying in that the number <b>of</b> <b>bale</b> <b>drying</b> locations in a barn is a limiting factor to throughput, as is also the <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> densely packed <b>bales.</b> Barn drying is above all practical on farms where hay is the only forage on offer. Its particular advantage is the large amounts of crop that can be dried at the same time. Bale drying tends to be applied more on farms that want their forage partly as grass silage and partly as barn-dried hay...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the possibility <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> straw in dedicated and innovative straw dryers with a modified drying system. The basic problem behind the use <b>of</b> <b>bales</b> <b>of</b> straw as a fuel is their moisture content. The moisture content is mostly {{dependent on the}} time of harvest and the conditions of storage. The humidity level <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> straw may be as low as 10 %, however harvesting the straw during unfavourable weather conditions may cause the moisture level to increase up to 60 – 70 % of the relative humidity, a value often observed for fresh biomass. Experimental studies were conducted to examine the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> and heat transfer in the straw bale. The {{studies have shown that the}} inner layers <b>of</b> the <b>bale</b> heat up much faster and achieve significantly higher temperatures than the outer ones. With the application of dedicated straw dryers, a homogenous field of moisture content in the straw bale is achieved in a very cost effective way...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> silage on Irish farms frequently {{differs from}} that of comparable precision-chop silage. This paper concerns a field-scale study designed to investigate: (a) the effects of number of layers (2, 4, 6 or 8) of polyethylene stretch film and the duration of storage (7 vs. 18 months) on the conservation characteristics <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> silage, and (b) the conservation characteristics <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> (4 layers <b>of</b> stretch film) and precision-chop silages. All silages were made following three durations of wilting (0, 24 or 48 h). Wilting restricted silage fermentation, with silage pH being highest (P< 0. 001) and the concentration of fermentation products lowest (P< 0. 001) for the 48 h wilt treatment. Wrapping bales in only 2 layers of polyethylene stretch film resulted in extensive visible mould growth, but mould growth was practically eliminated by the application of 4 or more layers of film. Silage fermentation characteristics were generally improved by wilting, and by 4 compared to 2 layers of stretch film. Extending the storage duration <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> silage from 7 to 18 months reduced (P< 0. 001) the concentration of fermentation products and increased in-silo fresh weight losses (P< 0. 001) and visible mould growth. Whereas 4 layers of conventional stretch film are normally sufficient, 6 layers may be necessary to prevent mould growth when <b>bales</b> <b>of</b> unwilted silage are stored for a second season. Under good farm-management conditions differences observed between baled and precision-chop silages probably result mainly from differences in the concentration <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> matter in herbage at ensiling. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Hay {{that has}} been baled with {{incorrect}} moisture content or {{that has been}} {{under the influence of}} moisture has potential to generate heat and create a fire hazard. Traditional means <b>of</b> monitoring <b>baled</b> hay temperature in storage, by inserting a pipe probe with thermometer, are time consuming. A ZigBee wireless sensor network could be used to remotely monitor internal hay bale temperatures. Tests were conducted to determine the maximum amount of hay through which a 2. 4 GHz ZigBee module could transmit data and the resulting signal strength (RSSI). Based on analysis of the data, a ZigBee transmitter with 2 mW transmitting power can transmit data through 9 ft <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> hay and a ZigBee transmitter with 50 mW transmitting power can transmit data through 18 ft <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> hay. In general, RSSI decreased significantly with each additional 3 ft <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> hay...|$|R
