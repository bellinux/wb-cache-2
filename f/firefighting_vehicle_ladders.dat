40|$|Kontejnerska vozila predstavljaju novitet među vatrogasnim vozilima. Osnovna karakteristika ovih vozila je u tome da se vatrogasni kontejner postavlja na specijalno podvozje pomoću trajno ugrađenog hidrauličnog krana. Tako se vatrogascima omogućuje efikasna zašita ili gašenje požara sa samo jednim podvozjem i s nekoliko specijalnih kontejnera u vatrogasnoj postrojbi. Broj i vrsta kontejnera koji se mogu «navlačiti « na isto podvozje ograničeni su samo nosivošću podvozja i «navlakača», a određuju ih iskustvo stručnjaka postrojbe (sukladno procjeni ugroženosti od požara područja koje štiti postrojba) i vatrogasna znanja proizvođača. Kontejneri s opremom ili sredstvom za gašenje mogu biti trajno smješteni u postrojbi ili na mjestima očekivane vatrogasne intervencije. Također se mogu neposredno prije očekivane katastrofe premjestiti na poziciju koja vatrogascima najviše odgovara. Ovaj članak upravo predstavlja jednu takvu nadogradnju hrvatskog proizvođača vatrogasnih vozila ZIEGLER d. o. o. Hrvatska. Recently, roll on/off {{container}} vehicles {{have been}} increasingly included in <b>firefighting</b> <b>vehicle</b> manufacturing program given that they imply a new {{aspect of the}} vehicle design and construction. The basic feature of the roll on/off <b>firefighting</b> container <b>vehicles</b> distinguishing them from the standard <b>firefighting</b> <b>vehicles</b> is their mobile superstructure, which, according to its design and construction, is in short called ‘a container’. Therefore, the <b>firefighting</b> <b>vehicle</b> of this type basically includes a standard constructed truck chassis adequate capacity with loader crane for containers and a firefighter container. In relation to buyer’s demands, the container may incorporate different firefighting technical details, devices and equipment, thus determining each container’s technical and functional characteristics. Hence, depending on the equipment, roll on/off container vehicles {{may be used for}} both technical and firefighting interventions. Furthermore, the advantage of the roll on/off container vehicles over the standard <b>firefighting</b> <b>vehicles</b> is the chassis which can support a container of any type and purpose, so any firefighting intervention can be performed with only one chassis and several different containers. Roll on/off container vehicles are controlled by the German standard DIN 14505 : 2004 Fire fighting and rescue service vehicles - Vehicles for roller containers - General requirements. DIN 14530 - 21 : 2011 <b>Firefighting</b> <b>vehicles</b> - Part 21 : Pump water tanker TLF 4000 standard applies as well for the construction and design of roll on/off container vehicles. This container superstructure described herein is equipped with fire techniques and equipment with the sole purpose of fire extinguishing in refining plants. In addition this container with integrated water/foam monitor the kit included containers superstructure with foam pump and foam tank volume 15. 000 l. Bearing in mind special technical characteristics, the container of this vehicle includes fire techniques and equipment of higher technical quality than in most standard <b>firefighting</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Thus, there is strong Caterpillar diesel drive motor, designed for eternally operation, integrated in a separate, sound-insulated space of the container’s superstructure. This motor drives the KSB centrifugal pump flow 22. 500 l/min as well as the Edwards gear pump for foam agent. Foam agent dosage rate is proportional within the fixed water flow rate. Pipeline system is similar in design to the most <b>firefighting</b> <b>vehicles</b> and is equipped with ‘storz’ coupling adapters with female thread at the user endings. The coupling adapters are closed with sealed cap. Water/foam monitor of a special manufacturer Williams Ambasador is of high range and stream water and foam capacity. The article presents the construction and design of roll on/off container vehicles for water and foam fire extinguishing in refining plants, which is designed by manufacturer ZIEGLER d. o. o. Croatia, Zagreb in cooperation with company TOTAL. At the moment of the release of this article, the container with monitor and other containers with foam agent tank are in finally phase of construction and are in start production. The vehicles are being constructed for TOTAL company from Netherlands, and will be delivered under the name as Roll on/off extinguishing container with monitor (SBH Unit) and Roll on/off foam container (SVH Unit). The entire design and construction of the vehicle with all technical characteristics are owned by ZIEGLER d. o. o. The author of the article presented the above mentioned <b>firefighting</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{for the sole purpose of}} introducing the operational technical characteristics and application of the roll on/off container <b>vehicles</b> in <b>firefighting.</b> Ziegler d. o. o. and the author of this article agree to publish the full contents of the article.
