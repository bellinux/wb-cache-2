40|$|An in-pile {{corrosion}} test loop is described {{which is used}} to study the effect of reactor radiation on the corrosion of materials of construction and the chemical stability of fuel solutions of interest to the Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor Program at ORNL. Aqueous solutions of uranyl sulfate are circulated in the loop by means of a 5 -gpm canned-rotor pump, and the pump loop is designed for operation at temperatures to 300 ts C and pressures to 2000 psia while exposed to reactor radiation in beam-hole facilities of the LITR and ORR. Operation of the first loop in-pile was begun in October 1954, and since that time 17 other <b>in-pile</b> <b>loop</b> experiments were completed. Design criteria of the pump loop and its associated auxiliary equipment and instrumentation are described. In-pile operating procedures, safety features, and operating experience are presented. A cost summary of the design, fabrication, and installation of the loop and experimental facillties is also included. (auth...|$|E
40|$|During {{the report}} period, {{the nature of}} the ORNL {{supporting}} activities gradually changed, reflecting the progress in the conetruction of the N. S. Savannah. Design reviews continued to require considerable attention. The Inspection Engineering Dept. of the Jab. continued to act as an inspection agency for the ALC, witnessing inspections and tests during fabrication of components of the nuclear reactor system. An enviromnental analysis was made of safeguard aspects of operation of the N. S. Savannah at the NYSC site in Cannden. A study of the safety response of the reactor on the ORNL Analog Computer further defined the important role of the Doppler coefficient in controlling reactivity excursions. Health physics aspects of the operation were studied. Limited waste disposal studies indicated that sea disposal of exhausted demineralizer resins may be facilitated by casting the radioactive resins into concrete. Installation of a pressurized-water <b>in-pile</b> test <b>loop</b> in the ORR neared completion. The neutron flux distribution in the loop was determined by experimental measurements in a nuclear mockup of the in-pile section. Metallurgical activities included nil-ductility testing of steel from the reactor vessel, chemical analyses of primary system components, and investigations of the properties of electroless - nickel brazed joints. Limited fabrication studies were carried out on advanced fuel concepts which may have merit for future cores of the Savannah Reactor. Most of the latter effort was applied to swaged UO/sub 2 / rod-type elements. A series of physics calculations is being carried out in an attempt to evaluate the possible advantages of using Zircaloy instead of stainless steel as the structural material for Core III. Use of Zircaloy instead of stainless steel for the fuel element cans was found to result in a marked reduction in enrichnnent for a given initial cold reactivity.

40|$|To {{help ensure}} the {{long-term}} viability {{of nuclear energy}} through a robust and sustained research and development effort, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) designated the Advanced Test Reactor and associated post-irradiation examination facilities a National Scientific User Facility (ATR NSUF), allowing broader access to nuclear energy researchers. The mission of the ATR NSUF is {{to provide access to}} world-class nuclear research facilities, thereby facilitating the advancement of nuclear science and technology. The ATR NSUF seeks to create an engaged academic and industrial user community that routinely conducts reactor-based research. Cost free access to the ATR and PIE facilities is granted based on technical merit to U. S. university-led experiment teams conducting non-proprietary research. Proposals are selected via independent technical peer review and relevance to DOE mission. Extensive publication of research results is expected as a condition for access. During FY 2008, the first full year of ATR NSUF operation, five university-led experiments were awarded access to the ATR and associated post-irradiation examination facilities. The ATR NSUF has awarded four new experiments in early FY 2009, and anticipates awarding additional experiments in the fall of 2009 as the results of the second 2009 proposal call. As the ATR NSUF program mature over the next two years, the capability to perform irradiation research of increasing complexity will become available. These capabilities include instrumented irradiation experiments and post-irradiation examinations on materials previously irradiated in U. S. reactor material test programs. The ATR critical facility will also be made available to researchers. An important component of the ATR NSUF an education program focused on the reactor-based tools available for resolving nuclear science and technology issues. The ATR NSUF provides education programs including a summer short course, internships, faculty-student team projects and faculty/staff exchanges. In June of 2008, the first week-long ATR NSUF Summer Session was attended by 68 students, university faculty and industry representatives. The Summer Session featured presentations by 19 technical experts from across the country and covered topics including irradiation damage mechanisms, degradation of reactor materials, LWR and gas reactor fuels, and non-destructive evaluation. High impact research results from leveraging the entire research infrastructure, including universities, industry, small business, and the national laboratories. To increase overall research capability, ATR NSUF seeks to form strategic partnerships with university facilities that add significant nuclear research capability to the ATR NSUF and are accessible to all ATR NSUF users. Current partner facilities include the MIT Reactor, the University of Michigan Irradiated Materials Testing Laboratory, the University of Wisconsin Characterization Laboratory, and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas transmission Electron Microscope User Facility. Needs for irradiation of material specimens at tightly controlled temperatures are being met by dedication of a large <b>in-pile</b> pressurized water <b>loop</b> facility for use by ATR NSUF users. Several environmental mechanical testing systems are under construction to determine crack growth rates and fracture toughness on irradiated test systems...|$|R
40|$|An <b>in-pile</b> <b>loop</b> to {{simulate}} the BWR coolant chemistry environment was substantially redesigned to allow operation in both once-through and recirculation modes. Runs were made to obtain comparative radiolysis data while the loop was run in both modes of operation, and to verify and extend N- 16 data from the past campaigns. Modernizations included a recirculation capability, new steam separator plenum to reduce water carryover and steam carryunder, relocation of the hydrogen peroxide sampling system to reduce gamma dose, installation of a new hydrogen peroxide sampler to reduce peroxide decomposition, a new in-core section to allow operation at reduced loop flow rates, relocation of in-thimble ECP sensors to a separate ECP plenum, replacement of titanium with stainless steel as the basic material of loop construction, employing Ge detectors for N- 16 measurements and the Luminol method for peroxide measurements.

40|$|Group Power Cycle Chemistry had {{examined}} the published {{work in the}} area of water chemistry sensors applied under elevated temperature. As result of surveying the techniques for determining water chemistry at power plants, it was confirmed that high-temperature water chemistry sensors are a key technology determining the conditions of water chemistry in nuclear power plants (NPPs) [1]. IAPWS recognized that there was a requirement for work to be pursued in this field and so prepared the ICRN to assist potential investigators in obtaining sponsorship. Specifically, requirements for development of new sensors and improvement of them for application in operating plants were identified as subjects to be researched. To date (2014), several reports of the development and application of high-temperature sensors have been generated. Electrochemical corrosion potential (ECP) sensors for application under irradiation have been developed in the JMTR <b>in-pile</b> <b>loop</b> at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency; they will eventually be applied in operating NPPs [2].

40|$|A {{variety of}} spherical uranium [...] {{graphite}} fuel elements for the Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) was fabricated. Poor results with sintered alumina coated UO/ sub 2 / particles {{led to the}} development of slumina coating by vspor deposition, for which good results have been obtained. A variety of sub-surface metal, metal carbide, and ceramic coatings located between an unfueled graphite shell and the fueled core of a PBR fuel element was prepared and examined. Most of the materials and processes showed poor results. Excellent metal recoveries were achieved from the metal oxide [...] graphite system using the grind-leach technique of reprocessing. Test results on Si [...] SiC coated fuel elements showed good fission product retention in neutron activation tests, a self-welding tendency between adjacent spheres at 2500 deg F surface temperature, and no evidence of failure when an interanl gas pressure of 300 psi was applied. Fission product release rates from a pyrolytic carbon coated specimen under low-level irradiation were obtained at 150 to 1900 deg F. The design of the <b>in-pile</b> <b>loop</b> to study the behavior of fission products escaping from PBR fuel elements wss established. (C. J. G. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{developmental}} {{program was}} conducted to provide and <b>in-pile</b> <b>loop</b> facility for use in evaluating gas-cooledreactor fuel asubassemblies. The program included the design, construction, and installation of a recirculating gas loop which {{is located in a}} 6 by 6 -in. facility in the aluminum reflector of the ETR. The loop system was designed to recirculate the primary nitrogen coolant at flow rates up to 0. 9 lb per sec and pressures up to 200 psia. It will accept fuel subassmeblies up to 36 in. in length and 2. 26 ia. in diameter with specimen power generation up to 150 kw. The maximum coolant temperature at the specimen outlet is set at 1500 deg F. The loop system includes the in-reactor section, the machinery, the control system, and the specimen-handling apparatus. Salient features of the re-ertrant system include an aluminum pressure wall in the in-reactor section, static gas insulation between the reactor coolant and the circulating loop gas, and a controllable rate of heat exchange between the specimen inlet- and specimen outlet-gas channels in sections of concentric countedlow piping. The three blowers in the system feature grease-lubricated bearings and water cooling. The complete system was tested out of pile and is now installed in the ETR. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Neutron-flux {{measurements}} in a concentric-cylinder {{fuel element}} {{were made in}} a gas-cooled <b>in-pile</b> <b>loop</b> operated adjacent {{to the core of}} the BRR. The fuel element comprised four concentric fuel cylinders. Each fuel annulus (outside diameters- 1. 248 1. 018, 0. 810 and 0. 590 in.) consisted of a 0. 031 -in. - thick core of UO/sub 2 / dispersed in type 347 stainless steel and clad on each side with 0. 007 in. of typee 318 stainless steel. The element was 24 in. long and the total uranium- 235 content was approximately 192 g. Radial, vertical, and peripheral flux distributions were studied. The vertical flux profile was cosine- shaped with a peak-to-average ratio of 1. 26. The peripheral variation around the loop wall could also be fitted to a cosine curve (with a peak-to-average ratio of 1. 10). The average radial flux depression from the outer fuel cylinder {{to the center of the}} element was a factor of 2. 14. Power generation in the element calculated from flux measurements agreed to within 10 % with the power generated by measuring gas now rate and temperarure rise across the fuel element. The ratio of peak-to-average power density was found to be 1. 75. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Emphasis was {{shifted in}} the Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) Fuel Element Development Program from {{coatings}} on the sphere surface to coatings on individual fuel particles {{as the major}} deterrent to fission-product leakage. In a highlevel irradiation test, cracks developed in the coatings of specimens coated with pyrolytic carbon and siliconized silicon carbide. In another high-level irradiation test, a graphiie sphere fueled with Al/sub 2 /O/sub 3 /-coated UO/sub 2 / particles is showing excellent fission-product retention. The leakage factors for long-lived volatile flssion products such as Kr/sup 85 m/, Kr/sup 87 /, Kr/sup 88 /, Xe/sup 135 / are ranging from 10 /sup - 9 / to 10 /sup - 6 /. If this degree of fission-product retention is maintained in a large power reactor, it would result in essentially a "clean" primary loop. A simple crack in a fuelelement surface coating will permit the release {{of all of the}} volatile fission products in that specimen except those retained by the fuel particles. In view of the failures in surface-coated specimens tested to date, {{it appears to be a}} difficult task to ensure coating integrity in a large number of specimens because of their low thickness-to-diameter ratio and exposure to external loads on the fuel element. The test of a single specimen fueled with coated particles takes on added statistical significance, since about 500, 000 "fuel elements" are actually being tested. The acceptability of graphite as a fuel-element matrix material was demonstrated when four types of graphite fueled with UO/sub 2 / suffered no significant deterioration in structural properties after irradiation to about 6000 kwh which is above the present design objective of the 125 Mw(e) PBR. Thus the incorporation of coated fuel particles, having excellent fission-product retention, into a graphite sphere, having excellent structural properties, offers a simple, rugged fuel element capable of producing high coolant temperatures while retaining most of the fission products. It is this type of fuel element which will receive major emphasis during the remainder of the PBR Fuel Element Development Program. The study of the preparation of graphite blanket elements loaded with ThO/sub 2 / by the thorium nitrate infiltration process was completed. It was found that graphite densities below 1. 45 g/cc and more than five infiltration steps were required to achieve the desired ThO/sub 2 / loading. A study of the use of natural graphite to produce high-density graphite bodies was started. Densities greater than 2. 0 g/cc were produced in a single pressing. The design and construction of an <b>in-pile</b> <b>loop</b> to study fissionproduct behavior in a recycled helium stream were continued. (For preceding period see NYG- 9057.) (auth...|$|E
40|$|The HTGR {{prototype}} plant (Peach Bottom Power Reactor) {{is being}} designed to produce steam at l 450 psi and 1000 deg F {{and to have}} a net capacity of 40 Mw(e). The fuel temperatures and gas pressures will be approximately the same as those required for larger plants. The reactor data and operating conditions for the graphite-clad core are given. The reactor and primary coolant systems are described. The prospects for development of the graphite-clad fuel element in time for use in the first loading of the reactor were improved by important advances in methods of fabrication and testing of both fuel compacts and graphite sleeves. The hot-pressing process for making fuel compacts was used successfully to make full-size compacts with a uniform distribution of ThC/sub 2 /- UC/sub 2 / particles. Three irradiation capsules were fabricated and inserted in a test reactor to determine fuel compact and sleeve performance under HTGR conditions of irradiation and temperature. Two of these ran satisfactorily for the scheduled time of operation. A scope design study of the <b>in-pile</b> <b>loop</b> that will be used to evaluate the full-diameter graphite-clad element was completed. Experiments {{to determine the extent of}} fuel migration within the element were undertaken. Preliminary results indicated that the central fuel-element temperatures must not exceed 2300 -C for routine operation. An important start was made in developing an understanding of how to treat the neutron thermalization process in high-temperature graphite reactors. Analytical techniques for calculating the thermal neutron spectra in poisoned graphite media were developed and programmed for the IBM 704 computer. The experimental technique of measuring neutron spectra by using a pulsed linear electron accelerator was demonstrated by measurements made with boron-loaded graphite. A mockup of a small portion of the reactor core was constructed and operated to determine the local heat-transfer coefficients and pressure drop in the tricusp- shaped coolant passage. Initial results indicated that the variation of the heat-transfer coefficient around the circumference of the element is less than expected. Studies were started of the transient temperatures and stresses developed in the pressure vessel as a result of load changes or a scram. A detailed study of several types of steam generator for use in the nuclear steam supply system was completed. A design incorporating a steam drum was selected for further study. Preliminary flow diagrams were completed for the helium- purification and fission-product trapping systems. Adsorption isobars for selected fission products in activated carbon were measured and will be used in the detailed design of the trapping system. Detailed planning of the experimental reactor physics program was initiated. Progress was made in the identification of the principal safeguards problems for this type of reactor, and a preliminary safety analysis of the plant was completed. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Santowax OMP {{has been}} {{irradiated}} in the M. I. T. <b>In-Pile</b> <b>Loop</b> Facility at 610 °F and at 750 °F. At both temperatures the loop was operated in a transient phase and a steady-state-HB phase. In the transient phase, unirradiated material {{was allowed to}} degrade to 60 w/o DP. In the steadystate- HB phase, the HB content of the coolant was maintained constant at about 33 w/o by the removal and distillation of samples and {{the replacement of the}} HB by unirradiated material before returning the samples to the loop. Neutron and gamma ray doses were measured with adiabatic calorimeters and foil monitors. The average dose rate to the coolant in the core region of the in-pile section was about 0. 5 watts/gm, of which 37 % was due to fast neturon interactions and 63 % to gamma ray interactions. Terphenyl concentrations were measured by gas chromatography and HB concentrations by distillation. Analysis of the transient phase terphenyl concentration and absorbed dose data showed that first order kinetics provided an adequate description of the degradation rate of the terphenyls. At 610 °F {{no significant difference in the}} stabilities of the terphenyl issomers was found and the overall degradation rate of the coolant was G*(-omp) = G(-omp) /Comp = 0. 26 ± 0. 01 molecules of terphenyl degraded per 100 ev absorbed in the terphenyls. At 750 °F the terphenyl isomer stabilities were in the order para>meta>ortho. After corrections for out-of-pile pyrolysis the overall degradation rate of the coolant was G*(-omp) = 0. 49 ± 0. 02. The results are compared to those of other investigations. For the 610 °F irradiation the radiolytic gas generation rate was G(total gas) = 0. 037 ± 0. 003 molecules of gas produced per 100 ev absorbed in the coolant mixture, the principal product being hydrogen. During the 750 °F irradiation the generation rate was G(total gas) = 0. 105 ± 0. 008, with a marked increase in the evolution of methane. Physical property measurements included density, viscosity, specific heat, thermal conductivity, number average molecular weight, gas solubility, carbon-hydrogen content and ash content. The increase in viscosity with increasing DP concentration was significantly less for the 750 °F irradiation than for the 610 *F irradiation. Heat transfer measurements showed that standard correlations could be used to determine the heat transfer rates using the physical properties of the irradiated coolant. The correlation obtained for the data of both irradiations was Nu = 0. 0079 (Re) 0. 9 (Pr) 0. 4 ± 10 %. No evidence of scale buildup on the heat transfer surfaces was observed over the entire period of operation of the experiment.
