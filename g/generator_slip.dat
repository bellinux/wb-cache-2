40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} a modular, sample invariant, six samples per cycle, discrete-time model of a thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) for output feedback-based subsynchronous resonance (SSR) damping controller (SSDC) design. An SSDC is used to alleviate the instability of torsional modes caused by external fixed capacitors used in conjunction with a TCSC. It is found that damping torque analysis-based design of an SSDC using a non-local signal like <b>generator</b> <b>slip</b> is straightforward and the resulting SSDC has a simple compensator structure. On the other hand, the residues and pole-zero configuration with the line current magnitude as a feedback signal are such that it is relatively more difficult to obtain a robust design, especially if several subsynchronous torsional modes are present. Eigenvalue analysis and digital simulation studies indicate that the TCSC model can accurately predict the behaviour of a TCSC with and without a damping controller...|$|E
40|$|The {{difference}} in dynamic behaviour of wind turbines connected to different size networks is analysed for synchronous and induction generators. Modal analysis {{has been applied}} to equivalent mechanical models of the wind turbine generator and the grid connection to show the {{difference in}} dynamics for a wind turbine generator connected to a large (interconnected) utility network or an (isolated) diesel micro-grid. Frequency domain analysis of these models has been used to quantify the effect of system parameters, such as enhanced drive train damping, diesel governor action and <b>generator</b> <b>slip,</b> on dynamic interaction. It has been shown that for wind turbines connected to a large grid an induction generator can reduce dynamic interaction. In contrast, for an isolated diesel micro-grid the diesel governor response and the compliance of the diesel generator dominate the system's dynamics, and the choice of either generator option for the wind turbine is dictated by other factors...|$|E

50|$|Many {{generator}} designs use {{electric current}} flowing through windings {{to produce the}} magnetic field on which the motor or generator operates. This {{is in contrast to}} designs that use permanent magnets to generate this field instead. Such devices may have a minimum working voltage, below which the device does not work correctly, or does so at greatly reduced efficiency. Some will disconnect themselves from the circuit when these conditions apply. The effect is more pronounced in doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG), which have two sets of powered magnetic windings, than in squirrel-cage induction generators which have only one. Synchronous <b>generators</b> may <b>slip</b> and become unstable, if the voltage of the stator winding goes below a certain threshold.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{represents}} the speed regulation for a fixed pitch stall-regulated variable speed wind energy conversion system. The speed regulation {{in the high}} (above rated) wind speeds region is the main topic of this paper where in this region, the rotor/generator speed activity is controlled by using the concept of adjustable or variable speed drive (ASD/VSD). Speeds need to be controlled {{in order to maintain}} the generated power by reducing the power coefficient from the peak of Cp curve. It can be achieved by reducing the tip speed ratio from the optimum value when wind speed vary from rated wind speed to cut-out wind speed. Therefore, closed-loop scalar speed control with the concept of constant ratio of voltage/frequency was being applied. In addition, simple algorithms of drive train and squirrel cage induction generator were being used. A proportional integral (PI) controller was used to control the <b>generator</b> <b>slip</b> speed. Results demonstrate that such a closed-loop scalar control with proportional integral (PI) controller is good enough to accurately maintain constant power by restraining the rotational speed corresponding to the wind speed variation at the rated wind speed...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{study is}} presented to investigate the influence of variable transport properties and momentum, thermal and mass slip on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) momentum, heat and mass transfer in a porous media. Slip effects are simulated via careful imposition of boundary conditions at the wall. Joule heating and viscous dissipation are also studied. The governing partial differential boundary layer equations are analyzed using Lie group theory and rendered with appropriate transformations into a system of nonlinear, coupled ordinary differential equations. The multi-physical boundary value problem is dictated by twelve thermophysical parameters- concentration diffusivity parameter (Dc), Hartmann magnetic number (M), permeability parameter (omaga), Eckert number (Ec), momentum slip (a), thermal slip (b), mass (species) slip (d), Prandtl number (Pr), Schmidt number (Sc), power law index for non-isothermal and non-iso-solutal effects (m), viscosity variation parameter (A) and thermal conductivity variation parameter (S). A numerical solution is obtained {{for the effects of}} selected parameters on transport characteristics using the robust Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg fourth-fifth order numerical quadrature method in Maple 16. Excellent correlation is achieved between the present computational results and for the constant transport properties (A=S=Dc= 0), nonporous (omega= 0), non-thermal slip (b= 0), non-solutal slip (d = 0) and non-dissipative solutions without Joule heating (Ec= 0) of Yazdi et al. [35]. Increasing momentum slip enhances temperatures whereas increasing thermal slip reduces them. An increase in thermal conductivity boosts temperatures whereas greater viscosity reduces temperatures. Increasing magnetic parameter suppresses velocity and increasing permeability parameter elevates temperatures. Species concentration is enhanced with increasing concentration diffusivity and permeability parameter but depressed with increasing viscosity. Furthermore concentration is enhanced with momentum slip but reduced with mass slip parameter. Moreover increasing magnetic field is observed to aid species diffusion in the regime.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, large scale Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) are re-gaining a general {{interest}} in the wind energy sector {{as an alternative to}} Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs). However, the existing standards and guidelines for wind turbine certification do not include specific requirements for VAWT rotors. This thesis aims to study the adequacy and applicability of the IEC 61400 - 1 ed. 3, 2005 International Standard minimum design requirements, when it is applied on multi-megawatt VAWTs. This is accomplished by simulating a VAWT aeroelastic model under various Design Load Cases (DLCs) and analysing the results. The motivation comes from the recent years scientific research and developments which revealed that a VAWT can be beneficial in some types of applications in comparison with a HAWT. As a result, a minimum engineering integrity proof for VAWTs is needed before the installation and operation phase as in HAWT. The work is split into two main phases. The first copes with the construction of a reliable large scale VAWT aeroelastic model which serves {{as the basis for the}} analysis. A 5 MW 2 -bladed VAWT aeroelastic model is built based on the “DeepWind” concept. Since blade instabilities were reported the "Sandia 34 m, 500 kW VAWT test bed" is up-scaled and used as guidance for the modification of the blade structural properties. In addition, the selection and validation of an aeroelastic code able to compute the VAWT aerodynamics and loads under different environmental conditions and wind turbine states is investigated. The study has been conducted through a special project by the author as part of this thesis. It was meant to study and apply an aeroelastic code by constructing a VAWT aeroelastic model. The Sandia 34 m, 500 kW VAWT was modelled and simulated with HAWC 2 aeroelastic code, showing good agreement with experimental data published by Sandia National Laboratories. In the second part is studied the adequacy and applicability of the aforementioned international standard on VAWTs and recommendations are made by simulating several DLCs using HAWC 2 code. Ultimate and fatigue loads during normal operation of the wind turbine are extracted and sensitivity analyses of relevant parameters that could influence the results are performed. These include the blade stiffness and structural damping, and the <b>generator</b> <b>slip.</b> Various wind conditions are applied including extreme operating gust, extreme wind shear and extreme wind direction change. The results from normal power production are compared with the “NREL 5 MW HAWT” which has the same rated power as the VAWT model in order to give an insight on the load levels between horizontal and vertical axis turbines. Design situations of parked turbine and emergency shut-down are also investigated. The results (chapters 3 and 4) indicate that the loads emerging from the extreme wind shear and wind direction change conditions are not critical for the VAWT, thus the corresponding design load cases could become optional. The case of parked turbine with locked rotor at specific orientations relatively to the wind direction revealed blade instabilities when the turbine was simulated under 50 year recurrence period wind conditions. The load comparison between the horizontal and the vertical axis wind turbines showed that the loads at blade low root and turbine base bottom are higher in VAWT but it should be noted that the NREL turbine is a 3 bladed configuration, while the developed VAWT model has 2 blades. The case of supported tower with guy wires was analysed and relevant load cases are proposed. In general regarding the loads it is concluded that the inherent variation of the blade aerodynamic forces during every revolution results to highly deterministic loads on the turbine reducing the effect of turbulence. This could lead to lower partial safety factors if could be demonstrated in other VAWT types. Finally, some small modifications on the definitions of the standard are proposed in order to avoid ambiguities when it is applied to VAWTs. EWEMWind EnergyAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Various {{techniques}} have been employed {{to optimize the}} performance of wound rotor induction generator (WRIG) based wind power generation systems. Input voltage control {{was used for the}} improvement of power factor in grid-connected induction generators. However, in this case, efficiency reduces drastically due to high output current. Moreover, the control range is limited. The conventional rotor resistance control had also been used for wind-driven WRIG. But, with this, the input power factor becomes very poor. In this paper, a new control method is proposed where both input voltage and slip power control are combined to achieve better performance. For each operating point an optimum input voltage is set and slip is controlled by rotor resistance such that the maximum efficiency is obtained. Moreover, both power factor and efficiency are improved {{for a wide range of}} speed variations. Also the reactive power demand is reduced throughout the range of effective speed which is compensated by optimum fixed capacitors. This scheme is useful for low power wind energy conversion system (WECS) where wind speed varies over wide range. Simulation model for the proposed schemes are developed using MATLAB and the performance of the induction generator under various wind conditions are studied with this model. Also the performance characteristics of the proposed schemes are experimentally verified. The proposed control schemes are simple as well as cheap.
