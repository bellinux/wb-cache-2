5|$|The {{development}} of Nazi propaganda in occupied Poland {{can be divided}} into two main phases. Initial <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> directed towards creating a negative image of pre-war Poland, and later <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> aimed at fostering anti-Soviet, antisemitic, and pro-German attitudes.|$|E

5|$|Although President Jimmy Carter {{tried to}} place another {{limit on the}} arms race with a SALT II {{agreement}} in 1979, his <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> undermined by the other events that year, including the Iranian Revolution and the Nicaraguan Revolution, which both ousted pro-US regimes, and his retaliation against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December.|$|E
50|$|Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> a {{quantity}} varied by speakers when adjusting {{to an increase}} or decrease in the communication distance. The communication distance is {{the distance between the}} speaker and the listener. Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> a subjective physiological quantity, and is mainly dependent on subglottal pressure, vocal fold tension and jaw opening. Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> different from sound pressure. To measure vocal <b>effort,</b> listeners <b>are</b> asked to rate the distance between speaker and addressee.|$|R

5|$|Although serious <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> made {{to oppose}} Jim Crow laws in Nashville {{as early as}} 1905, {{it was not until}} 1958, with the {{formation}} of the Nashville Christian Leadership Council, that Nashville's African American community would lay the foundation for dismantling racial segregation.|$|E
5|$|Evacuation <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> hastened on September 2 by {{the wider}} {{dispersal}} of evacuees among newly opened shelters. Louis Armstrong International Airport was reopened to allow flights related to relief efforts, {{and began to}} load evacuees onto planes as well.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union {{defeat at}} Bull Run, panicked <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> made to {{strengthen}} the forts built by Barnard in order to defend Washington from {{what was perceived as}} an imminent Confederate attack.

30|$|Minimum {{pneumatic}} braking: in this region, {{the electric}} braking <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> {{limited to a}} maximum value, often related to the motor currents. If a higher braking <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> required, then the pneumatic brake is activated to supply the difference.|$|R
50|$|After the {{prototype}} proved successful, a larger R&D <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> initiated in 1990, led by Herman Kading. One {{of the primary}} accomplishments of this <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> to migrate the product to UNIX Platforms, including Sun, SGI, HP, and IBM.|$|R

5|$|A 1977 {{inventory}} revealed only 44 Poitou donkeys worldwide, {{and there}} were still fewer than 80 animals as of 1980. Conservation <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> led by several public and private groups in France. In 1979, the Haras Nationaux, (the French national stud) and the Parc Naturel Regional du Marais Poitevin, working with private breeders, launched an effort to improve the genetics of the Poitou, develop new breeding techniques and collect traditional knowledge on the breed. In 1981, 18 large donkeys from Portugal were acquired for use in breeding Poitou donkeys. This preceded {{the creation of the}} Asinerie Nationale Experimentale, which opened in Charente-Maritime in Dampierre-sur-Boutonne in 1982, as an experimental breeding farm for Poitous. The Parc also works to preserve the Poitevin horse breed. In 1988, the Association pour la Sauvegarde du Baudet du Poitou (SABAUD) was formed as a breeder network that focuses on marketing and fundraising for the breed, and in 1989 became the financial support arm of the Asinerie Nationale Experimentale. The Association des Éleveurs des Races Équine, Mulassière et Asine, Baudet du Poitou is the registering body for the Poitou donkey. The early conservation <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> sometimes sidetracked as some breeders sold crossbred Poitous as purebreds, which are worth up to ten times as much. Forged pedigrees and registration papers were sometimes used to legitimize these sales. However, by the 1990s, DNA testing and microchip technology began to be used to identify and track purebred animals.|$|E
5|$|Aagadu was {{released}} on 19 September 2014 in 2000 screens across the globe. Eros International acquired the film's global distribution rights. The film {{was released}} in 150 screens across the United States, a record number for a Telugu film. Owing to Mahesh's popularity there, the makers offered to screen Aagadu in every university there and in other countries, if {{there are more than}} 100 students willing to watch the film. <b>Efforts</b> <b>were</b> made to release the film across the United States with subtitles.|$|E
5|$|According to a Soviet General Staff report, 29 of the 35 major Luftwaffe {{raids on}} Soviet airfields in the Kursk sector in June 1943 were against dummy airfields. According to {{historian}} Antony Beevor, in contrast, Soviet aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The Soviet deception <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> {{so successful that}} German estimates issued in mid-June placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result {{was not only a}} vast underestimation of Soviet strength, but a misperception of Soviet strategic intentions.|$|E
40|$|By definition, giving 100 % effort all of {{the time}} is sustainable, but begs the {{question}} of how to define 100 % effort. As a corollary, once a benchmark for defining 100 % <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> chosen, it may be possible, even optimal, to give a greater amount of effort for a short period of time, while recognizing that this level of <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> not sustainable. This dynamic <b>effort</b> provision problem <b>is</b> analyzed in the context of effort and performance by National Basketball Association (NBA) players over the course of a season. Within this context, several benchmarks for sustainable <b>effort</b> <b>are</b> considered, but these are rejected by the data. Meanwhile, the data are consistent with the proposition that NBA players put forth optimal effort, even if such <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> not always sustainable. Sports, NBA, effort...|$|R

5|$|After September 1939, desperate <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> made {{to improve}} the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{arm of the}} {{conspiracy}} was directed at the Indian troops who were serving in Middle East, while <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> directed at drawing Afghanistan into the war {{on the side of}} the Central Powers, which it was hoped would incite a nationalist or pan-Islamic uprising in India and destabilise the British recruiting grounds in Punjab and across India. After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen by Britain as the only power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India.|$|E
5|$|As {{impeachment}} proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one of}} his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.|$|E
