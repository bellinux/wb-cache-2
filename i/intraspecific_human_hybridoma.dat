The problems limiting their production are the low numbers of sensitized B cells in peripheral blood, the limited choice of techniques for B cell immortalization, {{the limited number of}} suitable human myeloma or lymphoblastoid fusion partners, and the inability to immunize humans with most antigens. In order to circumvent these problems, we have compared the efficiency of different methods for production of B cell lines secreting human MAbs against the nuclear antigens dsDNA, ssDNA, and Sm/RNP from patients with the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We have tested various combinations of the following procedures: (1) EBV infection for immortalization of activated B lymphocytes, (2) activation of human resting B lymphocytes by anti-CD 40, and (3) direct fusion of lymphocytes with a myeloma cell line using PBL or splenocytes from SLE patients. The methodological aspects of this investigation include optimization of the CD 40 system and the generation of <b>human</b> <b>hybridomas</b> specific for nuclear antigens by fusion between sensitized lymphocytes and the human/mouse heteromyeloma cell line CBF 7.

The use of SCID mice avoids {{the problem of}} rejection of the <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> cells thus allowing in vivo assessment of human immunoglobulins. Using electron microscopy we {{have shown that the}} human IgG anti-dsDNA monoclonal antibody, RH 14, is nephritogenic in SCID mice, causing morphological changes in the kidney due to immunoglobulin deposition. The problem with using SCID mice is that they have an abnormal immune system; normally they are used at about 2 months of age, at which time they have virtually no functional T or B cells. It is known that older SCID mice become increasingly ‘leaky’, that is they develop some mature lymphocyte clones. Our aim was to assess if implanting anti-DNA antibodies into older ‘leaky’ SCID mice would result in pathology which was observable by light microscopy. Eight-month-old SCID mice were implanted with <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> cells secreting either RH 14 an anti-dsDNA IgG, CL 24, an antiphospholipid antibody or an irrelevant human IgG control.

These thrombi occurred only in the case of RH 14 implanted mice and were found to stain positively for human IgG and fibrin. However, apart from the interesting thrombi, we did not observe any greater pathological damage resulting from the anti-dsDNA antibody deposition than we had seen in the younger mice; indeed, the electron microscopic findings were more limited...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid autoantibodies cause hemostatic abnormalities in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are poorly understood. We have approached this problem by investigating the binding and functional effects of <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> lupus anticoagulant, anti-phospholipid and anti-DNA autoantibodies derived from SLE patients on platelets and endothelial cells. Most lupus anticoagulant antibodies did not bind to intact platelets and endothelial cells in vitro, while many antiphospholipid and anti-DNA antibodies were reactive. A comparison of SLE and normal-derived autoantibodies demonstrated that platelet-binding autoantibodies derived from SLE patients exhibited greater antigen specificity and platelet cytotoxicity than similar antibodies derived from normal individuals. By Western blotting analysis, many SLE-derived polyspecific antibodies reacted specifically with individual platelet proteins, whereas normal-derived polyspecific antibodies did not. One SLE-derived antibody, 9604 was found to react with ADP-activated platelets but not resting platelets.

The idiotype 1. 10, which was derived from a patient with active SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome, was found more frequently among patients with PAPS (10. 5 %, 10. 5 % and 22. 2 % in MG, SLE and PAPS, respectively) than the idiotype H 3, which was derived from a <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> monoclonal aCL generated from a healthy subject immunized with tetanus and diphtheria.

40|$|Abstract—It is {{well known}} that the {{physiological}} activities of compounds are affected by their molecular structures. Hence, it is very important for the risk assessment of environmental chemicals such as PCDD and PCDF to evaluate structure-activity relationships (SAR). For precise analysis of SAR, the compounds should be stereoselectively synthesized. In this paper, we evaluated SAR of flaxseed lignan, secoisolariciresinol (SECO). SECO has many physiological effects such as immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, and estrogenic activity. In addition, we first achieved the stereoselective synthesis of meso-SECO and optically active SECOs. Hence, SECO is a very good example for examining SAR. Optically active (+) - and (–) -SECO, and meso-SECO were synthesized and various physiological functions were compared. At first, the immunostimulatory effects were examined. (+) - and (–) -SECO accelerated IgM production of <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> cells, however, meso-SECO did not. However meso-SECO showed cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells, (–) -SECO slightly stimulated the cell. This means that estrogenic activity of SECO derived from only (–) -SECO. Although (–) -SECO stimulated adiponectin production of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipose cells, (+) - and meso-SECO suppressed the production.

40|$|Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an {{autoimmune}} disease of unknown etiology that {{is characterized by}} chronic inflammation of the joints and by the presence, in high titers, of an autoantibody known as the rheumatoid factor (RF). The human cytomegalovirus, {{a member of the}} human Herpesviridae family, has been proposed as a potential environmental agent involved in the induction of RF production. The report of an anti-CMV antibody having structural homology to a major group of human paraproteins with RF activity, as detected by the expression of RF-associated idiotypes and by variable region sequences, provided a possible structural relationship between CMV infection and RF production. In this thesis, the structural characterization of eight <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> anti-CMV antibodies and their possible relationship to RFs is presented. All eight antibodies recognized the viral matrix phosphoprotein, known as pp 65, which has previously been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic during the natural infection. Seven of these antibodies expressed a restricted number of RF-associated idiotypes. The HCV- 2 anti-CMV antibody expressed the greatest number of RF-associated idiotypes and was most similar to RFs of the "PO" idiotypic family. All eight antibodies were composed of different $ rm V sb{H}/V sb{L}$ pairs, with evidence of antigen-selected somatically-induced mutations in the majority of cases. When the nucleotide sequences of these anti-CMV antibodies were compared to previously reported rearranged immunoglobulin sequences, the majority were found to share the highest degree of identity with antibodies possessing RF activity. This data provides evidence that there is extensive overlap between the autoimmune and anti-pathogen antibody repertoires. Comparisons of the anti-CMV antibodies with homologous RF sequences revealed that most of the amino acid differences could be accounted for by putative somatic mutation events and different junctional diversity in the third complementarity determining region (CDR 3) of the antibody heavy chains. This was supported by the cloning and sequencing of the variable regions of a <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> RF, known as C 304, which was derived from a patient with active RA. The C 304 heavy and light chain sequences had high identity with one of the anti-pp 65 antibodies (HCV- 3) and with a previously reported antibody directed against the human herpes simplex virus (HSV). The sequences diverged at points of suspected somatic mutations and, extensively, in the CDR 3 of the heavy chains. Although no evidence was obtained that could definitively implicate human herpes viruses in the induction of RFs, this work has provided an analysis of the relationship between idiotype expression and antigenic specificity. This data has enabled the identification of the sequence differences between RFs and anti-viral antibodies that potentially play a role in determining antigenic specificity and provides the basis for an experimental model {{to address the issue of}} how primary amino acid sequence determines the specificity of human antibodies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{amplified by}} {{polymerase}} chain reaction the heavy- and light-chain antibody genes of a <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> secreting a neutralizing, IgG monoclonal antibody to the G 2 protein of Puumala virus. The heavy- and light-chain genes were cloned and sequenced and the deduced amino acids were aligned {{with those of other}} human antibodies to identify the constant and variable regions. The genes were cloned into the baculovirus plasmid transfer vector pACUW 51 such that the heavy-chain and light-chain genes were under control of the baculovirus polyhedrin or p 10 promoters, respectively. The transfer vector plasmid was cotransfected into culturedSpodoptera frugiperda(Sf 9) cells with linearized DNA of the baculovirusAutographa californicanuclear polyhedrosis virus, and recombinant baculoviruses were selected by plaque formation on monolayers ofSf 9 cells. Expression and secretion of an IgG monoclonal antibody was confirmed by assay of recombinant-infectedSf 9 cell supernatants for the presence of the heavy and light chains. Specificity of the expressed human antibody was determined by immune-precipitation of radiolabeled Puumala virus proteins and by ELISA with Puumala virus-infected cell lysates. Similar quantities of the expressed IgG and the authentic monoclonal antibody neutralized Puumala virus in plaque-reduction neutralization assays. Neither the authentic nor the recombinant antibody could passively protect hamsters from challenge with Puumala virus; however, our results demonstrate the potential of this methodology for production of biologically active neutralizing antibodies...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) often causes {{persistent}} infection {{despite the}} presence of neutralizing antibodies against the virus in the sera of hepatitis C patients. HCV infects both hepatocytes and B cells through the binding of its envelope glycoprotein E 2 to CD 81, the putative viral receptor. Previously, we have shown that E 2 -CD 81 interaction induces hypermutation of heavy-chain immunoglobulin (VH) in B cells. We hypothesize that if HCV infects antibody-producing B cells, the resultant hypermutation of VH may lower the affinity and specificity of the HCV-specific antibodies, enabling HCV to escape from immune surveillance. To test this hypothesis, we infected <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> clones producing either neutralizing or non-neutralizing anti-E 2 or anti-E 1 antibodies with a lymphotropic HCV (SB strain). All of the hybridoma clones, except for a neutralizing antibody-producing hybridoma, could be infected with HCV and support virus replication for at least 8 weeks after infection. The VH sequences in the infected hybridomas had a significantly higher mutation frequency than those in the uninfected hybridomas, with mutations concentrating in complementarity-determining region 3. These mutations lowered the antibody affinity against the targeting protein and also lowered the virus-neutralizing activity of anti-E 2 antibodies. Furthermore, antibody-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity with the antibodies secreted from the HCV-infected hybridomas was impaired. These results suggest that HCV infection could cause some anti-HCV-antibody-producing hybridoma B cells to make less-protective antibodies...|$|R

In the present study, an 8 '-azaguanine resistant cell line, termed HL- 60 R, was established by drug selection of the promyelocytic cell line HL- 60. This novel cell line showed resistance to high concentrations of 8 '- azaguanine and was sensitive to aminopterin. These characteristics make it suitable for serving as a potential fusion partner cell line in the development of macrophage hybridoma. Cell-surface analysis by FACS revealed that HL- 60 R cells per se do not express MHC-class II molecules or the macrophage marker, CD 11 b. PEG-mediated fusion of HL- 60 R was performed with PBMC-derived human macrophages.

The fully human monoclonal antibody secreted by one of these lines, KBPA 101, is an IgM/kappa antibody that binds P. aeruginosa of International Antigenic Typing System (IATS) serotype O 11 with high avidity (5. 81 x 10 (7) M(- 1) +/- 2. 8 x 10 (7) M(- 1)) without cross-reacting with other serotypes. KBPA 101 specifically opsonized the P. aeruginosa of IATS O 11 serotype and mediated complement-dependent phagocytosis in vitro by the human monocyte-like cell line HL- 60 at a very low concentration (half-maximal phagocytosis at 0. 16 ng/ml). In vivo evaluation of KBPA 101 demonstrated a dose-response relationship for protection against systemic infections in a murine burn wound sepsis model, where 70 to 100 % of animals were protected against lethal challenges with P. aeruginosa at doses as low as 5 microg/animal.

All human monoclonal cell lines that produced C. parvum antibodies were originally generated from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of a human immunodeficiency virus-seronegative woman. She had recovered from C. parvum infection and had a high specific antibody titer. Hybridization of these lymphocytes with a tumor cell line was accomplished by hypo-osmolar electrofusion. Twelve clones were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as secreting anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies after the initial hybridization. From the 12 positive clones, two high antibody-secreting clones, 17 A and 17 B, were maintained in long-term culture.

In this study, we aimed to establish a <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> cell line secreting the first anti-Vel monoclonal antibody (mAb), clone SpG 213 Dc. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes from a French Vel-negative woman with anti-Vel in her plasma were transformed with Epstein-Barr virus and then hybridized with the myeloma cell line Sp 2 /O-Ag 14 using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) method. A specific anti-Vel mAb was successfully produced and was extensively characterized by serological, flow cytometry and Western blot analyses. RESULTS: One human anti-Vel-secreting clone was produced and the secreted anti-Vel mAb (SpG 213 Dc) was examined. The specificity of the SpG 213 Dc mAb was assessed by its reactivity against a panel of nine genotyped RBCs including, respectively, three Vel-negative and six Vel-positive (three wild-type homozygous and three heterozygous) samples using flow cytometry method. Vel-positive RBCs were specifically stained and were subsequently used to perform Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis of the Vel antigen. CONCLUSION: Serological characterization of the new monoclonal anti-Vel SpG 213 Dc showed a heterogeneous level of expression of the Vel antigen on the different RBCs.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel system to study monocytic function after human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection by infecting a series of <b>human</b> macrophage <b>hybridoma</b> cell lines with HIV- 1. Since ethanol has detrimental effects on immune function, we investigated the effect of ethanol and its metabolites acetal-dehyde and acetate on monocytic function by utilizing one <b>human</b> macrophage <b>hybridoma</b> cell line, clone 43, as well as primary monocytes. Pretreatment of clone 43 and primary monocytes with ethanol and its metab-olites resulted in diminished accessory cell function for mitogen-, anti-CD 3 -, and antigen-induced T-cell proliferation. The decreased accessory cell function was associated with reduced interleukin 1 a (IL- 1 a), IL- 1 b, and tumor necrosis factor alpha production with loss of intracellular cytokine and mRNA production and the induction of transforming growth factor b. In ethanol-, acetaldehyde-, and acetate-treated HIV- 1 -infected clone 43 cells (43 HIV), there was a more rapid loss (3 days after infection) of accessory cell function at a lower infecting dose of HIV- 1 than that in untreated 43 HIV cells. We also observed a more rapid loss of surface class II antigen expression in the ethanol-, acetaldehyde-, and acetate-treated 43 HIV cells, but no change in surface expression of CD 80 or CD 86.

The following characteristics of the antigen strongly suggested that 4 E 3 recognizes liver-type aldolase B (EC 4. 1. 2. 13) : the Mr of the native molecule is 160, 000 {{and that of the}} subunit is 40, 000, and thus it has a tetrameric structure of identical subunits; the antigen is abundant in the liver and kidney of human, mouse and rabbit, and is localized by immunohistochemical methods in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and in the proximal tubules of the kidney; the antigen is precipitable by 50 - 80 % saturation with (NH 4) 2 SO 4; the antigen shows charge-dependent heterogeneity on DEAE-cellulose chromatography. To confirm this notion, aldolase B was purified to homogeneity from the liver of human, mouse and rabbit by phosphocellulose chromatography. During the chromatographic purification, the antigen activity as assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (e. l. i. s. a.) was superimposed on the enzymic activity of aldolase. Furthermore, monoclonal antibody 4 E 3 strongly reacted with purified aldolase B in SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting and also in e. l. i. s. a. using microplates coated with purified enzyme. The reaction between aldolase B and 4 E 3 activated the human complement system as assessed by the attachment of C 3 to the immune complex of aldolase B and 4 E 3...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the repertoire of antibodies to Streptococcus pneumoniae 6 B capsular polysaccharide induced with the conventional polysaccharide vaccine in adults {{at the molecular}} level two ways. In the first, we purified from the sera of seven vaccinees antipneumococcal antibodies and determined their amino acid sequences. Their VH regions are mainly the products of VH 3 family genes (candidate genes, 3 - 23, 3 - 07, 3 - 66, and 3 - 74), but the product of a VH 1 family gene (candidate gene, 1 - 03) is occasionally used. All seven individuals have small amounts of polyclonal κ+ antibodies (Vκ 1 to Vκ 4 families), although κ+ antibodies are occasionally dominated by antibodies formed with the product of the A 27 Vκ gene. In contrast, λ+ anti- 6 B antibodies are dominated by the antibodies derived from one of 3 very similar Vλ 2 family genes (candidate genes, 2 c, 2 e, and 2 a 2) and Cλ 1 gene product. The Vλ 2 + antibodies express the 8. 12 idiotype, which is expressed on anti-double-stranded-DNA antibodies. In one case, Vλ is derived from a rarely expressed Vλ gene, 10 a. In the second approach, we studied a <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> (Dob 1) producing anti- 6 B antibody. Its VH region sequence is closely related to those of the 3 - 15 VH gene (88 % nucleotide homology) and JH 4 (92 % homology). Its VL region is homologous to the 2 a 2 Vλ 2 gene (91 %) and Jλ 1 /Cλ 1. Taken together, the V region of human anti- 6 B antibodies is commonly formed by a VH 3 and a Vλ 2 family gene product...|$|R
40|$|Structure-function {{correlations}} of pneumococcal antibodies {{are important in}} predicting how changes in the pneumococcus (Pnc) -specific B-cell repertoire will influence humoral immunity against invasive Pnc disease. Using a unique panel of <b>human</b> <b>hybridomas</b> derived from memory B cells after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, we analyzed the structure-function relationship of nine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reactive to Pnc polysaccharides. The avidities of the antibodies correlated with the avidity of donor immune serum (R, 0. 7; P < 0. 025), and this relationship was particularly strong for immunoglobulin A clones (R, 1; P < 0. 0005), suggesting that the MAbs may represent important clones contributing to serological memory. Common heavy-light chain combinations and amino acid replacement mutations were seen for clones with the same serospecificity from different individuals. The two highest-avidity MAbs used Vh 3 - 48, and two MAbs with the same serospecificity, using the same V gene pairings (Vh 3 - 7 and Vk 2 A 17), had similar avidities, suggesting that canonical V gene use makes {{an important contribution to}} avidity. Although all clones had mutation levels consistent with their being derived from memory B cells, low levels of replacement mutation were associated with high avidities. This relationship was strongest for Vh genes (R, 0. 8; P < 0. 01). Opsonophagocytosis was demonstrated for all clones, and there was a trend toward clones using canonical genes with low levels of mutation having high opsonophagocytic activities (R, 0. 5). These data suggest that the use of canonical genes in the Pnc antibody response is associated with highly functional antibodies and that most somatic mutations seen in these genes are not antigen selected...|$|R
40|$|A glomerular {{permeability}} factor {{produced by}} <b>human</b> T cell <b>hybridomas.</b> T cell hybridomas {{derived from the}} T cells of a patient with minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) made a glomerular permeability factor (GPF). Sufficient quantities of GPF were available for further analysis and characterization. We obtained four stable clones of <b>human</b> T cell <b>hybridomas</b> which produced a glomerular permeability factor. When this factor was injected intravenously into rats, significant proteinurias were induced, and in normal human lymphocyte culture, GPF enhanced Concanavalin-A (Con-A) induced lymphocyte histogenesis by greater than ten fold. GPF was cytotoxic to tumor cell lines of epithelial origin, but only cytostatic to tumor cells of hematopoietic origin. Electron microscopy studies, with polyethyleneimine (PEI) staining, indicated that GPF induced {{the changes in the}} arrangement of PEI particles and partial fusion of glomerular epithelial cells in the rats given this factor intravenously. The molecular weight of GPF were estimated to be between 60, 000 and 160, 000 daltons.

40|$|This {{laboratory}} developed <b>human</b> T-cell <b>hybridomas</b> which constitutively secrete suppressor factors (SF) {{capable of}} inhibiting immune responses (Hybridoma 6 : 589 (1987). The {{mechanisms by which}} human T-cell hybridoma-derived SFs (designated 160 and 169) and Jurkat leukemic T-cell line derived SF inhibit the proliferative response to mitogen by human PBMC were investigated. The Jurkat SF had a pI of 5. 2 whereas the 160 and 169 SF had pI of 5. 7 and 4. 7 (two peaks) and 4. 7, respectively. The SF was not transforming growth factor-beta based upon neutralization and iummunoprecipitation experiments with anti-TGF-beta polyclonal antibody.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To analyse the {{phospholipid}} binding specificity, {{functional characteristics}} and idiotype expression of <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> derived monoclonal autoantibodies (MAb) {{derived from the}} spleens of two patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS [...] The IgM MAbs binding to phospholipids were generated from spleen cells of two patients (RSP and RT) with active SLE and their specificity of binding to neutral phospholipids (phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl choline, platelet activating factor, sphingomyelin) and negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidyl inositol and cardiolipin (CL)) analysed. Binding specificity of cross reactive antibodies (those binding to CL and DNA) was confirmed by fluid phase inhibition assays. Lupus anticoagulant activity and beta 2 -glycoprotein- 1 (beta 2 GP- 1) requirement for the antigen binding of these MAbs were detected using the modified dilute Russell's viper venom test and modified anti-CL enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Expression of idiotypes (Id) Id RT- 84 and Id H 3 was analysed using rabbit polyclonal and murine monoclonal anti-idiotype reagents, respectively. RESULTS [...] Twelve clones from the patient RSP and eight clones from patient RT were reactive with phospholipids. Marked differences in phospholipid binding of these MAbs were noted, varying from truly polyreactive (RT- 72 bound to most phospholipids tested) to monospecific (RT- 84 bound only to CL). Furthermore, MAbs RT- 84, RT- 129, and RSP- 57 had lupus anticoagulant activity and required beta 2 GP- 1 for CL binding. It was found that 75 % of phospholipid binding antibodies from RT clones expressed RT- 84 Id, but none from RSP clones did so, and that Id H 3 was expressed only by the RT- 83 antibody. CONCLUSION [...] These results show that human anti-phospholipid MAbs are heterogeneous with respect to phospholipid binding, functional characteristics, and Id expression...|$|R
40|$|Possibilities {{to develop}} human {{monoclonal}} antibody specificities {{have recently been}} much facilitated by improvements of <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> technology but even more so by the emerging phage-display technique. However, until recently very little has been known about the characteristics {{at the molecular level}} of the induced, T cell-dependent human antibody response, frequently targeted by these techniques. Rather, the major part of available sequence information has been related to tumor-derived or autoreactive antibodies. We have now investigated high affinity, monospecific, human antibody repertoires as developed by hybridoma technology. The VH region gene usage among such in vivo-induced repertoires is in only some respects similar to that found in the total B cell population. A limited number of heavy-chain variable segment loci account for the majority of all induced antibodies. A particular VH gene locus (4 - 34) frequently employed by peripheral B cells and associated with autoreactive antibodies was rarely used by the induced repertoire. Furthermore, in particular antigen systems, V region usage differs from the total available repertoire, and heavy-chain CDR 3 is generally longer among antibodies induced against foreign protein antigens than in the average B cell population. Light-chain gene usage is often restricted to just a few dominant genes frequently found among B cells in general. In comparison, variable regions derived by phage-display technology in some antigen systems display even longer heavy-chain CDR 3 than hybridoma-derived antibodies. This technique also appears to select a different set of germline genes preferentially (both with respect to VH and JH) as compared to hybridoma technology. In summary, the T cell-dependent antibody response against foreign antigens appears to differ from the average circulating B cell in several ways, and thus does not seem to represent a random selection of the available repertoire...|$|R
40|$|Anti-platelet autoantibodies may be {{responsible}} for hematological complications in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the mechanisms by which these antibodies cause abnormal hemostasis remain unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that an SLE-derived <b>human</b> <b>hybridoma</b> autoantibody, 9604, recognizes a surface antigen expressed on platelets activated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), calcium ionophore A 23187, or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), showing saturation with approximately 2, 000 antibody molecules bound and a K$ rm sb{d}$ of 41 nM. This antibody did not affect shape change or the initial rate of primary aggregation, but significantly inhibited secondary aggregation of stirred platelet suspensions by ADP or calcium ionophore A 23187, but not PMA. This was demonstrated to be due to the inhibition of large platelet aggregate formation, with a major shift to smaller microaggregates and singlets. 9604 recognized two reduced polypeptides of 200, 000 and 32, 000 M. W. (p 32) by Western blot analysis. The 200, 000 M. W. band was identified as the heavy chain of platelet myosin and was not expressed on the platelet surface. In contrast, p 32 was immunoprecipitated from biotinylated platelet surface proteins and was suggested to be the polypeptide responsible for the binding of 9604 to activated platelets. A murine monoclonal antibody (8 E 8) was raised against p 32 and its antigen binding properties were characterized and compared with those of 9604. 8 E 8 specifically recognized p 32, bound to ADP-activated but not resting platelets, and completely inhibited the binding of 9604 to ADP-activated platelets. Platelet proteins, isolated using an 8 E 8 affinity column, showed high molecular weight bands with sizes that corresponded to multimers of p 32 under nonreducing conditions. Purified p 32 had a tendency to self-associate, even under reducing conditions, and contained $<$ 3 % carbohydrate. HPLC analysis demonstrated that this protein has a native molecular wei...|$|R
40|$|Human-human {{hybridoma}} technology {{was used to}} immortalize human B lymphocytes from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to study the antigenic repertoire of the humoral immune response against the patients' own leukemia cells and against leukemic cells from other patients. Nine fusions were done with lymphocytes from seven AML patients, and all with the human RH-L 4 B lymphoma line as malignant fusion partner. A total of 305 Ig-producing hybrids were obtained. 26 reacted with cell surface components on AML cells, but 21 were found not to be specific for leukemia cells, when screened for reactivity against a panel of normal and malignant cells of both human and murine origin. Five hybridomas secreted Ig with high specificity for human leukemia cells, but only one hybridoma culture, aml- 18, was stable in respect to Ig-production and growth upon repeated clonings and expansion in liquid cultures. A method was developed to grow <b>human</b> <b>hybridomas</b> as ascites tumors in nude mice, but the ascites fluid did not contain increased amount of antibody. The reactivity of the aml- 18 antibody (gamma, kappa) was analyzed against samples of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood of 63 patients with leukemia and with cytologically verified leukemia cells in the blood. 22 of 54 AML samples reacted with aml- 18. The reactivity pattern was not correlated to any categories of the French-American-British (FAB) classification; two of four ALL were positive. Moreover, a pronounced intratumoral antigenic heterogeneity in regard to aml- 18 reactivity was seen and indicates {{a high degree of}} diversity in the immunological phenotype within individual AML cell populations. The study demonstrates that some patients with AML generate an immune response against their autologous malignant cells, and that the antigenic determinant in the case of aml- 18 is also expressed specifically on leukemic cells from other patients...|$|R

Supernatant from hybrid clone J 1. 3 specifically enhanced IgA production and secretion by isolated human B cells, with increases in IgA plaque-forming cells approaching those seen with addition of autologous T cells and pokeweed mitogen. A monoclonal lymphocytic leukemia with membrane IgA also differentiated to IgA plasma cells by this supernatant. Evidence suggests that this hybrid supernatant acts on post-switch IgA-committed B cells.
