5|$|Refurbishment and {{improvement}} works completed in 2007 included new and reconstructed cross bridges between platforms and {{the installation of}} lifts for mobility impaired passengers. Cosmetic improvements carried {{out at the same}} time included the reinstatement of pole-mounted roundels {{on the sides of the}} <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibule.</b> Other work in the 2000s at the station includes the construction of a substantial air rights building spanning across the cutting.|$|E
5|$|Pennethorne's gallery was {{demolished}} for {{the next}} phase of building, a scheme by Sir John Taylor extending northwards of the main entrance. Its glass-domed <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibule</b> had painted ceiling decorations by the Crace family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised, and that space is now taken up by Frederic, Lord Leighton’s painting of Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence (1853–55), lent by the Royal Collection in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, the modernist design of the <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibule</b> {{takes the form of a}} double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are {{three-dimensional}} versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The ticket hall beyond is octagonal with a central roof light of the same shape. The ticket hall originally had a pair of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E
50|$|The mall {{received}} an extensive renovation in 2011, including altering {{the food court}} dining area and new <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibules.</b> In June 2012, the area's first Microsoft Store opened at the mall in the former Talbots space.|$|R
25|$|Other {{improvements}} included new finishes throughout, new <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibules</b> {{to improve}} the air lock between the building interior and exterior, new baggage claim devices, updated retail areas, new exterior glazing and a common design for ticket counters that includes sunshade devices.|$|R
50|$|The station {{originally}} had two <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibules,</b> one at either end. The southern vestibule, located {{between the old}} and new buildings of the State Library, is shared with Borovitskaya. The temporary northern vestibule, which served Biblioteka Imeni Lenina and Aleksandrovsky Sad, was removed in the 1940s.|$|R
25|$|When {{constructed}} in 1937, {{the building had}} three storeys, with an exterior made up of reinforced concrete with brick panelling. The main entrance doors were panelled with hammered pewter – a white alloy that resembles tin. The company's name was executed in hammered pewter, {{another example of the}} architect using tin as a motif for the company. Dadoes for the staircase and <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibule</b> were made of a new material, Marbrunite, in multiple colours. A motor car garage was incorporated into the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|The station {{building}} {{was designed by}} well known Glasgow architect James Miller who designed many other Caledonian Railway stations, including Botanic Gardens which was the next stop on the line. It was in a style similar to other stations designed by Miller at the time. It was destroyed by a fire started by children while abandoned in August 1968. The outer walls with some decorative stonework {{as well as the}} base of an <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibule</b> with the pattern and fragments of the black and white checked floor tiles remain. Above the station site and mouth of the tunnel is Caledonian Mansions which was built by the Caledonian Railway company on land it purchased for tunnel construction. The company's monogram is still visible {{on the east side of}} the mansions on Caledonian Crescent, just uphill from the station site.|$|E

500|$|The Chalke Gate (...) , was {{the main}} {{ceremonial}} <b>entrance</b> (<b>vestibule)</b> to the Great Palace of Constantinople in the Byzantine period. The name, which means [...] "the Bronze Gate", was given to it either because of the bronze portals or from the gilded bronze tiles used in its roof. The interior was lavishly decorated with marble and mosaics, and the exterior façade featured a number of statues. Most prominent was an icon of Christ which became a major iconodule symbol during the Byzantine Iconoclasm, and a chapel dedicated to the Christ Chalkites was erected in the 10th century next to the gate. The gate itself {{seems to have been}} demolished in the 13th century, but the chapel survived until the early 19th century.|$|E

50|$|The {{floor plan}} of the {{original}} part of the former residence was rectangular with a one storeyed rectangular wing to the rear, with projecting windows and <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibules</b> {{from most of the}} facades. To the rear of the ground floor of the original footprint of the building, additions have been made over time and this wing is now an amalgam of differently aged and constructed sections.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} located at the Metro line's {{intersection}} with Barklaya Street, which crosses the platform on an overpass. <b>Entrance</b> <b>vestibules</b> are located on the upper level, above the platform. Canopies (supported by white marble pillars) and the road overpass provide some shelter to waiting passengers, but constant exposure to the elements has left the station in a state of disrepair. A project that involves renovating and enclosing the station is currently under way.|$|R
50|$|At a maximum, three Dm12 units can be coupled into a {{train to}} {{increase}} capacity. Each car has two passenger compartments, two <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibules</b> and a driver's cabin {{at each end of}} the car. The driver cabins have air conditioning. There are two places for wheelchair-using passengers, the unit has lifting platforms for wheelchair access and the toilet is designed to be accessible to the disabled. The heating of the passenger compartments uses waste heat from the diesel engines.|$|R

50|$|In the 1980s work {{commenced}} on the full-scale {{restoration of}} the building, opening up the side <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibules</b> and restoring {{a number of the}} reception rooms to their original design. These reception rooms are named for former local government areas subsumed into Greater Brisbane in 1925, such as the Sherwood Room, or the Ithaca Room. From 2003 the Museum of Brisbane (which has galleries positioned {{on both sides of the}} building's entrance from King George Square) has replaced administration offices.|$|R
50|$|An ATM {{vestibule}} is {{an enclosed}} area with automated teller machines that is accessible {{from the outside}} of a building, but typically features no further <b>entrance</b> beyond the <b>vestibule.</b> There may be a secure <b>entrance</b> to the <b>vestibule</b> which requires a card to open.|$|R
50|$|These lengths {{allowed for}} {{compartments}} or seating bays 6 ft wide, plus space for toilets and entrance vestibules; a typical design of Mark 1 vehicle, the TO (Open Third class), had eight seating bays, three <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibules</b> {{and a pair}} of toilets at one end. This provided reasonable space. Care was taken to ensure that passengers could enjoy an unobstructed view out of the train from all seats. Seats were aligned to windows and on the long-distance design of Mark 1, the windows had a low sill, just 25 in above the floor.|$|R

5000|$|The Titanic and Olympic both {{featured}} duplicate <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibules</b> {{on their}} {{port and starboard}} sides within the D-Deck Reception Rooms. There were sets of double gangway doors within the hull, screened by wrought-iron grilles. These were partially enclosed areas in the same white Georgian-style paneling; each vestibule contained a large sideboard for storing china. One set of French doors led into the Reception Room, {{but there was also}} a broad arched entryway leading to the elevators. Separate corridors led off of the vestibules to the First-Class staterooms in the forward part of D-Deck.|$|R
50|$|By 1829 the {{new church}} {{had more than}} tripled in size. In 1856 part of the {{congregation}} broke away to form the Cornwall Presbyterian Church when they disagreed with the prevailing abolitionist sentiment, and the strictness of Jonathan Silliman, the church's longtime pastor. Nine years later, in 1865, the remaining members raised funds to build the bell tower and new <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibules.</b> Further renovations came in 1891, when local contractor H. R. Taylor was hired {{to build a new}} chapel, named after The Rev. Jonathan Silliman, pastor from 1835-61. Electric lights were installed in the church sanctuary at that time.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is essentially rectangular in plan, running east west, with shallow transepts toward {{the western end}} of the north and south facades. Semi-octagonal recesses are found as small <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibules</b> on the transept ends, as the sanctuary and vestry of the church, as altar recesses in the side chapels flanking the principal altar and in a baptistry toward the eastern end of the southern facade. The burnt-orange terracotta-tiled roof is generally gabled with hips to the polygonal projections. The {{building is}} constructed from re-inforced concrete the exterior is rendered with textured stucco, except to mouldings which are smoothly rendered.|$|R

50|$|Typical of the Art Deco style, {{the architects}} {{designed}} an opulent interior. Six marble types, including St. Genevieve Golden Vein, Rose, Champlain Black, Eagle Grey Tennessee, Eagle Pink Tennessee, and Verde Antique, are {{used on the}} richly appointed interior walls and floors. Ceilings are ornate plaster with medallions and stepped molding covered with aluminum leaf. <b>Entrance</b> <b>vestibules</b> lead to public lobbies with marble walls. Marble mosaic medallions are inset {{in the north and}} south lobby floors. A gilded plaster ceiling medallion of the United States Seal is centered in the lobby and framed by step moldings covered with aluminum leaf and gold stars.|$|R
50|$|Kutuzovskaya (Кутузовская) is a Moscow Metro station. It was {{completed}} in 1958 as the first westward extension of the newly created Filyovskaya Line, which also included the reopening of four older stations which had been closed since 1953. Kutuzovskaya was the first permanent grade-level Metro station, part of a cost-cutting experiment which was ultimately doomed by Moscow's harsh climate. Kutuzovskaya's side platforms and curving layout are both unusual features. A large percentage of both platforms is covered by Kutuzovskiy Prospekt, an avenue which crosses over the station midway along its length. <b>Entrance</b> <b>vestibules</b> {{on either side of}} the overpass allow passengers to change platforms.|$|R
50|$|The {{stained glass}} in the <b>entrance</b> <b>vestibules</b> and {{elsewhere}} in the interior complements the use of sculpture externally. Depicted in stained {{glass in the}} William Street vestibule is a sower, a reaper, a pioneer and squatter. The glass in the George Street vestibule depicts a tiller and a herdsman. A marble tablet set into the wall of this entrance is inscribed with the message sent by King George V to the people of Australia on 25 April 1916, establishing the Anzac Day tradition. An honour board commemorating Lands Department staff who served in the First World War is located in the corridor on the first floor.|$|R
