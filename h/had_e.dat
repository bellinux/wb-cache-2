30|$|We also {{compared}} the amino acid polymorphism of some biologically important sites of these Guangdong H 7 N 9 viruses. Generally, these viruses {{did not show}} much amino acid variation. All the novel strains possessed 186 V and nine of them possessed 226 L, with one exception A/Chicken/Guangdong/SD 1 / 2013 (H 7 N 9), holding 226 Q. This implies that the novel human strains are prone to bind to mammalian receptors (Shi et al., 2013). The four human strains still possessed 292 R in NA and 31 N in M 2, indicating they are sensitive to oseltamivir and insensitive to adamantine. As for the position 627 in PB 2, all the avian isolates <b>had</b> <b>E,</b> while two human isolates <b>had</b> <b>E</b> and the remaining two human isolates possessed K.

A dieta cetogênica (DC) tem alto teor de gordura e baixo de carboidratos e proteínas, sendo usada no tratamento da epilepsia refratária. Analisamos os efeitos da DC em 54 crianças do Instituto da Criança da Universidade de São Paulo. Eficácia, tolerabilidade e efeitos adversos foram estudados. A DC foi considerada eficaz (E) quando houve redução de crises > 75 % e boa (B) quando a redução foi entre 50 - 75 %. Correlacionamos, quando possível, esses resultados com a síndrome epiléptica e com a idade dos pacientes. Observamos resultados (E) em 57, 4 %, 63, 8 %, 71, 8 % e 62, 1 % dos pacientes no 2 º, 6 º, 12 º e 24 º meses, respectivamente e (B) em 31, 4 %, 25, 5 %, 25, 6 % e 37, 9 %, respectivamente.

Mutations associated with other investigational HIV IN inhibitors were also identified. This suggests that HIV strains may vary in their natural susceptibility to HIV IN inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Association between {{dementia}} and tooth loss {{has been}} shown although {{the nature of that}} association is not clear.

Dental status of 67 patients with dementia was recorded. DNA was isolated from buccal swabs and genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP. The majority of participants <b>had</b> <b>E</b> 3 /E 4 genotype (55. 2 %) and these heterozygotes were significantly more frequent than any other genotype (p< 0. 001). There was no significant association between dental status and genotype.

40|$|Objective: Cerebral hydatid {{disease is}} a rare manifestation of {{echinococcosis}} but it constitutes {{a significant part of}} all intracranial mass lesions. This study aims to determine the clinical, radiological and surgical features of brain hydatidosis and share our experience. Method: Medical records of ten patients with cerebral hydatid disease were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical presentations, radiological examinations, treatment modalities and outcomes of the patients were analyzed. Results: All patients were admitted from the rural areas. Nine patients <b>had</b> <b>E.</b> Granulosus cyst and one patient <b>had</b> <b>E.</b> Multilocularis cyst. The cyst was solitary in nine patients and multiple in one. Multiple organ involvement was found in one patient. Cysts were located in the right cerebral hemisphere in five patients, left cerebral hemisphere in four patients and posterior fossa in one. All patients were treated surgically. Complications related to surgery were observed in four patient. All patients improved after the treatment. There were no recurrences or residual cysts among the patients. Conclusion: Hydatic disease should considered in the differential diagnosis of intracranial space occupying lesions in developing countries. Early diagnosis of cerebral hydatid cysts may prevent serious life-threatening complications of this disease. Outcome is favourable when the cyst is completely removed without rupture...|$|E
