The green tubes are received by the drill pipe manufacturer from the steel mill. The ends of the tubes are then upset to increase the cross sectional area of the ends. The tube end may be externally upset (EU), internally upset (IU), or internally and externally upset (IEU). Standard max upset dimensions are specified in API 5DP, but the exact dimensions of the upset are proprietary to the manufacturer. After upsetting, the tube then goes through a heat treating process. Drill pipe steel is commonly quenched and tempered to achieve high yield strengths (135 ksi is a common tube yield strength).|$|E

5000|$|The {{first of}} the [...] "flying" [...] IAe 33 prototypes, (No. 02) built in 1950, {{completed}} its maiden flight on 27 June of that year, with Captain Edmundo Weiss at the controls. On the second flight, ex-Focke-Wulf test pilot Otto Behrens encountered severe lateral stability problems at speeds over 700 km/h {{and returned to the}} airfield as a precaution. Landing at very high speed, the aircraft bounced with sufficient force to cause the right main undercarriage strut to fail. During repairs to the aircraft, in order to rectify the [...] "tricky" [...] landing characteristics, the front undercarriage strut was increased in length, which served to alter the angle of incidence of the aircraft, while the shock absorbers were adjusted to have a greater [...] "throw". Although never considered docile, the modifications improved the takeoff, landing and low-speed characteristics of the IAe 33. More serious aerodynamic problems persisted, stemming from tip stall— in which the wingtip stalled before the wingroot resulting in an unpredictable [...] "rolling moment"— leading to a change in the wing leading edge near the wingroot, while the rudder was modified in an attempt to resolve the interminable lateral instability issues. In addition, the canopy was reinforced with two external frames and a small fairing was installed above the engine exhaust.Tank, himself a capable development test pilot, took over the test program to investigate the aircraft's stalling characteristics, although the requisite airframe changes took several months to complete, with the Pulqui II N. 02(m) so modified not able to undertake its third proving flight until 23 October. During the ensuing high-altitude test, on two successive occasions, the IAe 33 stalled inadvertently, although Tank had sufficient height at 9,000 m for recovery. Adding ballast to the nose of the aircraft cured the problem. On 8 February 1951, Tank publicly demonstrated the IAe 33 before Perón at the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires. The audience also included government officials, legislators and the foreign diplomatic corps in the military attaches of the embassies, along with a large crowd of spectators. Both the IAe 27 Pulqui I and IAe 33 Pulqui II flew during the demonstration.With the successful completion of the proving test flights, the Argentine Air Force requested a pre-production order of 12 IAe 33 aircraft. In 1951, the air force established a team of service pilots to test fly the new aircraft in a series of acceptance flights. The first flight by Commander Soto on 31 May 1951 revealed severe vibration at about 1000 km/h.

40|$|A {{modification}} of hinge joints in articulating cranes is proposed {{in order to}} reduce the impact load arising from the joint looseness. The idea is to provide an additional support for the <b>joint</b> <b>pin</b> using elastic elements. As the contact surfaces of the pin and the eyes of the joint wear out these elements start absorbing the shock load, caused by developed looseness in the joint. The dynamics and stress analysis of an articulating crane with one loose joint is performed to illustrate the difference between the classic and modified joint assembly. The numerical simulations are performed using the developed software KBCrane. The simulation results demonstrate a decrease in peak boom stress and cargo acceleration by up to 2. 9 and 10. 3 times respectively in a crane with modified hinge joint compared to a crane with classic hinge joint...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} {{structural}} joints {{is one of}} the critical challenges for the development of composite lightweight aircraft and motorsport structures. Despite the universal reliance upon mechanical fastening and adhesive bonding, the disadvantages of both when applied to high stiffness composites are considerable. For bolting and riveting these include added weight as laminates are thickened to account for stress concentrations. For bonding these include chemical uncertainties of the bonding process, inability to inspect for adhesive application quality and vulnerability to catastrophic failure. These concerns stimulated the drive for the development of new hybrid metal/composite joints which combine onlythe advantages of adhesive bonding and of mechanical interlocking by means of the pin-locking concept. This research project investigated the performance of several hybrid joint configurations obtained with the permutations of two different plate designs (double-scarf and double-stepped) and two surface feature shapes (spike and “shark teeth” pins). Tensile mechanical performance testing using the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique was carried on to examine the influence of the metal fitting geometry on the joint performance and strain distribution. The pins were manufactured using the processes of micro-machining (MM) and electron beam melting (EBM). The experimental results show a progressive pin failure advancing {{from the end of the}} overlap. Both surface features provide an increase in mechanical performance of the <b>joint.</b> <b>Pin</b> geometry such as the diameter, base width, length and shape critically affect the strength of the joint. The highest values of tensile strength are obtained with shark teeth pins which cause a severe reduction in stress concentration at the joint overlap edges and provide a more even strain distribution across the joining area increasing the joint strength. The plate design affects the strain distribution at high loads and can be modified so as to reduce the peel stress. The manufacturing process (EBM or MM) does not affect joint strength significantly (for spike pins) and the process choice can be made on economic grounds. The results provide a strong basis for more detailed stepped lap joint optimisation using tailored surface features designs to assist with the provision of robust, safe, very high strength and weight optimised joints...|$|E

40|$|There are an innumerable {{number of}} {{precision}} automotive assemblies which use <b>pinned</b> <b>joints</b> for alignment. Many of these suffer from poor performance and cost/quality issues because <b>pinned</b> <b>joints</b> are inherently over-constrained. This paper introduces the Quasi-Kinematic Coupling (QKC) {{as a solution}} for precision (better than 10 microns) automotive assemblies. For these applications, QKCs require fewer parts, have a lower total cost, and provide sub-micron repeatability. This paper covers design and manufacturing considerations for automotive QKCs. Proof of concept is demonstrated via a case study on the block-main bearing assembly of a Ford six cylinder engine. Repeatability tests yield average QKC bearing center line repeatability of 0. 65 microns at the outer journal bearings as compared to 4. 85 microns for <b>pinned</b> <b>joints.</b> This QKC uses 60 % fewer precision features, costs 36 % less, and allows feature size and placement tolerance ranges which are twice as wide {{as those of the}} previous <b>pinned</b> <b>joints.</b> NOMENCLATURE Gmax Maximum gap between block and bedplate Gmin Minimum gap between block and bedplate Ka Stiffness in axial direction Kc Stiffness perpendicular to bearing center line Ra Repeatability in axial direction Rc Repeatability perpendicular to bearing center line δa Alignment error in axial direction δc Alignment error perpendicular to bearing center line δGMS Gap margin of safety δv Controllable gap variatio...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>joints</b> {{are found}} in many large {{articulating}} structures. They tend to be under high load and articulate slowly; so, the joints typically operate in the boundary or mixed lubrication regimes. This means that the operating torque depends on the respective proportions of liquid and solid contact between the joint mating faces. In this article, a mixed lubrication model of a grease-lubricated landing gear joint is established to determine a theoretical Stribeck curve, frictional torque and lubricant film thickness under different loads. Parameters describing <b>pin</b> <b>joint</b> working conditions, geometry, lubricant properties and pin/bush texture are used.

The changing proportions of these two parts indicate transformations between different lubrication regimes. Experiments on an instrumented <b>pin</b> <b>joint</b> have been carried out to compare with the predicted friction and torque performance.
