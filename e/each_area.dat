An {{ordinary}} man, Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and gasps for breath after sprinting.

5|$|In Abzû, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of a diver in a vast ocean—after waking up {{floating}} on the ocean's surface, the diver begins exploring the surrounding underwater environments filled with plant and animal life, in addition to uncovering ancient technology and submerged ruins. In a few areas, the diver is also able to explore land-based environments above the water. As the game progresses, the diver unlocks new areas and pursues the secrets behind the forces harming the local environment. The diver's course through the game follows a linear path through interconnected areas filled with marine life. The player directs the diver through the environments using full analogue control, able to interact with the environment to solve switch or item-based puzzles, and sit on pedestals within <b>each</b> <b>area</b> to observe the surrounding sea life. The diver can accelerate, and interact with marine life using sonar chimes. The diver can grab onto the bodies of larger marine animals and ride on them. <b>Each</b> <b>area</b> sports hidden collectables for the diver to find.|$|E

5|$|Upon death, the Slugcat {{returns to}} the last {{hibernation}} save point and loses any map progress made since. The player also loses a karma point, which are indicated {{at the bottom of}} the screen. The player needs to meet a karmic threshold to reach specific areas of the game. Karma is restored upon reaching a new hibernation area, and the player can shield their current karma level by eating a yellow flower. The flower appears at the start of <b>each</b> <b>area</b> and is re-planted wherever the Slugcat dies.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} churches, <b>each</b> <b>area</b> {{has its own}} characteristics. Most of Bath's Grade I listed {{buildings}} are made from the local golden-coloured Bath Stone, and date from the 18th and 19th centuries. Their dominant architectural style is Georgian. In the Mendip district, the greatest concentrations of these cluster around the cathedral and abbey in Wells and in Glastonbury. North Somerset features bridges and piers along with a selection of Manor houses. The Sedgemoor district has many buildings related to trade and commerce centred on Bridgwater; while in South Somerset abbeys, priories and farmhouses predominate. Taunton Deane includes the defensive Taunton Castle, similarly Dunster Castle and related buildings in Dunster feature in West Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Choice is a {{significant}} aspect of the game, requiring a non-linear design to accommodate the customized characters. Level design began {{with a list of}} factors such as Disciplines, stealth and feats. <b>Each</b> <b>area</b> had to be viable for a shooting character (sufficient ammunition), a discipline-focused character (sufficient blood sources to keep the powers fueled) and a melee specialist (to reach enemies without being killed), with stealth options and option combinations. Level design began with a focus on stealth, taking into consideration the positioning of guards and the character's potential stealth capability at that point in the game. Then direct, combat-heavy and dialog paths were added. The amusement arcade area was to feature playable versions of Activision arcade games such as Pitfall!, though the idea was abandoned due to time constraints.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann did {{not make}} policy, but acted in an {{operational}} capacity. Specific deportation orders came from Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Eichmann's office was responsible for collecting information on the Jews in <b>each</b> <b>area,</b> organising the seizure of their property, and arranging for and scheduling trains. His department was in constant contact with the Foreign Office, as Jews of conquered nations such as France could not as easily be stripped of their possessions and deported to their deaths. Eichmann held regular meetings in his Berlin offices with his department members {{working in the field}} and travelled extensively to visit concentration camps and ghettos. His wife, who disliked Berlin, resided in Prague with the children. Eichmann initially visited them weekly, but as time went on, his visits tapered off to once a month.|$|E

5|$|Journeys {{story is}} told wordlessly through {{gameplay}} and using cutscenes. The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time. Scattered throughout the ruins {{at the end of}} <b>each</b> <b>area</b> are stones at which the traveler rests; these stones give the traveler the vision of meeting a larger, white-robed figure in a circular room, with art on the walls describing {{the rise and fall of}} the civilization mirroring the player's journey. The player must also contend with the ancient automatons left over from a war which ended the civilization, and which still roam the city looking for intruders.|$|E
5|$|Levels in {{the game}} include a mixture of platforming, {{swimming}} and on-rails levels. They are based around several returning themes including forests, cliff-sides, factories and mountain tops. The level design is more diverse compared to its predecessors, which includes more complex puzzles and obstacles. Every level has an enemy called a Koin; each of these enemies bears the DK Coin of their respective level, holding it as a shield. As these enemies always face towards the player, they must be defeated by throwing a steel barrel over them so it bounces off a wall behind {{them in order to}} strike them from behind. The game overworld is also more complex, allowing players to explore between <b>each</b> <b>area</b> instead of forcing them along a linear path. To achieve this, the game includes several vehicles such as a speedboat and hovercraft which can be used to traverse the overworld and access different worlds.|$|E
5|$|Odin Sphere is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) side-scrolling action role-playing game where the player takes control of five different characters across six playable scenarios. Areas within levels are circular stages allowing movement {{left or right}} with exits leading to other areas; the main goal in <b>each</b> <b>area</b> is to eliminate all enemies and proceed to the next area. Combat—which uses a beat em up-style battle system—takes place within these areas, and revolves around the player character {{using a combination of}} physical attacks and Psypher skills, skills tied to each character's magical weapon. Combination attacks are triggered by attacking enemies continuously. Jumping can be used to reach airborne enemies within stages. At the end of each battle, grades are awarded based on the battle time, damage taken from enemies, and the amount of damage dealt. The amount of in-game currency the player receives as a reward after each battle depends on the battle grade.|$|E

5|$|The US {{casualty}} count at Yongsan is also {{difficult to}} know, as the division's scattered units were engaged {{all along the}} Naktong Bulge without communication and total casualty counts in <b>each</b> <b>area</b> could not be ascertained.

This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 17,498 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, most of which probably occurred at Yongsan.|$|E
