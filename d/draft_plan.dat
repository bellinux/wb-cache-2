5|$|A {{state highway}} was routed through {{downtown}} starting on May 13, 1913, {{when the system}} was created. It was first a part of M-15 when the highway system was signed in 1919, and then later as US41/M-28 after {{the creation of the}} United States Numbered Highway System in 1926. (Under the original 1925 <b>draft</b> <b>plan</b> for the U.S. Highway System, US102 was the number assigned to run through Marquette.) The streets have been paved since at least the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person who}} {{took up the}} {{initiative}} in the late 1950s was Rangvald Iversen, who was plant manager at Norwegian Talc at Knarrevik. The plant had large costs freighting their products across the sound on the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry. In 1958, he took the initiative to conduct a traffic count, which along with estimates of increased traffic from other places that had replaced a ferry with a bridge, would give estimates for the revenue from tolls. Norwegian Talc also paid for a <b>draft</b> <b>plan</b> for a bridge. In 1959, Iversen presented an estimate that a bridge would cost NOK15.5 million, and on 19 December 1959, the council voted unanimously to recommend that a committee be established to continue work on the bridge plans. In 1960, the bridge {{was included in the}} road plan for Hordaland.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increase}} in population after protective legislation was put into place, the Department of Conservation developed a management plan for the Kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990. A <b>draft</b> <b>plan</b> was made available to the public for comment in 1991, and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters, and instead favored the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd. However, core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option. Trial musters were conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and were successful, although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses.|$|E

5|$|From 1911 to 1917, {{money was}} {{collected}} for interior furnishings, which were relatively sparse {{apart from the}} impressive main altar. (These original furnishings remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the <b>draft</b> <b>plan</b> were abandoned: the floor was not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the façade. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some claim they were built in 1923, but others argue {{that they were not}} completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that argue for an earlier construction date state that they were damaged during World WarII and left dismantled for some time.|$|E
5|$|Queen's was {{a result}} of an {{outgrowth}} of educational initiatives planned by Presbyterians in the 1830s. A <b>draft</b> <b>plan</b> for the university was presented at a synod meeting in Kingston in 1839, with a modified bill introduced through the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada during a session in 1840. On 16 October 1841, a royal charter was issued through Queen Victoria establishing Queen's College at Kingston. Queen's resulted from years of effort by Presbyterians of Upper Canada to found a college for the education of ministers in the growing colony and to instruct the youth in various branches of science and literature. They modelled the university after the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow. Classes began on 7 March 1842, in a small wood-frame house {{on the edge of the}} city with two professors and 15 students.|$|E
5|$|The 1925 <b>draft</b> <b>plan</b> for the {{establishment}} of the US Highway System would have replaced M-15 with three different US Highways. Between Menominee and Powers, M-15 was to be replaced by US41. East of Powers to Rapid River, the trunkline would have been US2. The next segment between Rapid River and Covington was planned as US102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was planned as US41 In between Powers and Covington, US41 was planned to follow US2 west to Iron Mountain and then route of the modern US141 between Powers and Covington. When the system was announced on November 11, 1926, US41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M-15. The original map showed US41 following an unbuilt alignment between Powers and Marquette, but the US41 designation was instead routed to follow the former M-15.|$|E

5|$|The {{first state}} {{trunkline}} highway designated {{along the path}} of the modern US41 was M-15, in use as far back as 1919. The 1925 <b>draft</b> <b>plan</b> for the establishment of the US Highway System would have replaced M-15 with three different US Highways. Between Menominee and Powers, M-15 was to follow the route that US41 follows today. East of Powers to Rapid River, the trunkline would have been just US2. The next segment between Rapid River and Covington was planned as US102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was planned as US41. In between Powers and Covington, US41 was planned to follow US2 west to Iron Mountain and then route of the modern US141 between Powers and Covington. When the system was created on November 11, 1926, US41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M-15.

The six <b>draft</b> <b>plans</b> have significantly improved on DOD's original plan for tracking inventory.

These <b>draft</b> <b>plans</b> also lack detailed performance measures for monitoring progress and determining the effectiveness of the actions after they are implemented. They do not address how DOD will ensure appropriate coordination among the military services and DOD commands in the implementation of the corrective actions or how DOD will monitor future progress.
