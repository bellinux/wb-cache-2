5|$|Criticism {{focused on}} {{particular}} {{aspects of the}} game. Miller considered the inability to save progress a drawback since gamers will {{have to play the}} entire game <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sitting</b> if they wish to complete it. Rignall described the audio and visuals as being outdated in comparison to games on the Mega Drive and Super NES (the latter platform having already been launched in other regions by the time Super Mario Bros. 3 was released in Europe).|$|E
5|$|In the {{two years}} {{following}} the release of Horse in 1941, Kurosawa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career. Towards the end of 1942, {{about a year after}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his Musashi Miyamoto-inspired judo novel, Sanshiro Sugata, the advertisements for which intrigued Kurosawa. He bought the book on its publication day, devoured it <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sitting,</b> and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights. Kurosawa's initial instinct proved correct as, within a few days, three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights. Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.|$|E
5|$|Stroheim {{was known}} to exaggerate events from his life and create myths about himself, such as his fictitious aristocratic origins and {{military}} record in Austria. He claimed that shortly after having moved to the US in the early 1910s, {{he had found a}} copy of McTeague in a motel in New York and had read it <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sitting.</b> He also said that wanting to adapt the book inspired him to make a career in filmmaking. Georges Sadoul later stated that Stroheim had first read the novel in 1914, while living in poverty in Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sitting</b> and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E

50|$|On cruises all {{accommodation}} {{was sold}} as one class although many staterooms, both on A deck and R deck were usually allocated to Cabin Class. Even some cabins on B deck were sold on cruises. Both restaurants served the same menu <b>in</b> just <b>one</b> <b>sitting</b> and passengers were allocated {{to a restaurant}} dependent upon the locations of their staterooms. On short cruises to the Caribbean and South America, every cabin was offered for occupation and often, as on transatlantic crossings, there would be two sittings for luncheon and dinner.|$|R
25|$|Some smaller {{tools were}} made from large flakes that had been struck from stone cores. These flake tools and the {{distinctive}} waste flakes produced in Acheulean tool manufacture suggest a more considered technique, one that required the toolmaker to think one or two steps ahead during work that necessitated a clear sequence of steps to create perhaps several tools <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sitting.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the smaller oil was intended as an anatomical study or an experiment in emotional tone that Eakins decided not to submit to the Academy. The small size, , was used by Eakins for only two other portraits. Of frontal format, it is more directly confrontational than the Academy's painting, and appears to have been left unfinished. The artist may have been wearing a gray sweater seen previously in an 1895 photograph. Eakins' student Charles Bregler recalled that the painting was made <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sitting.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{interiors}} were graced with statues, mirrors, tapestries, gilding, {{and various}} {{portraits of the}} Imperial family. The interiors of her sister ships were also placed {{in the hands of}} Poppe. The first class salon was noted for its tapestries and its blue seating. The smoking room, a traditionally male preserve, was made to look like a typical German inn. The dining room, capable of holding all passengers <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sitting,</b> rose several decks and was crowned with a dome. The room also had columns and had its chairs fixed to the deck, a typical feature of ocean liners of the era.|$|E

25|$|He was {{especially}} {{well known in}} the affluent communities of Long Branch, Nantasket Beach, Richfield Springs and other resorts frequented by New York high society. It was at these and similar areas that he directed his organization in swindling the wealthy residents. Miller spent at least half the year in high-class barrooms, restaurants and hotels, while he operated his organization during the summer. Although he is thought to have amassed at least several hundred thousand dollars in his lifetime, he spent much of his fortune living an extravagant lifestyle. He also incurred heavy gambling losses, especially on horse racing where he lost $20,000 in one day, and gave up playing faro when he lost $18,000 <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sitting</b> at a Saratoga gambling resort.|$|E
25|$|Back in London, Sargent {{was quickly}} busy again. His working methods were by then well-established, {{following}} {{many of the}} steps employed by other master portrait painters before him. After securing a commission through negotiations which he carried out, Sargent would visit the client's home {{to see where the}} painting was to hang. He would often review a client's wardrobe to pick suitable attire. Some portraits were done in the client's home, but more often in his studio, which was well-stocked with furniture and background materials he chose for proper effect. He usually required eight to ten sittings from his clients, although he would try to capture the face <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sitting.</b> He usually kept up pleasant conversation and sometimes he would take a break and play the piano for his sitter. Sargent seldom used pencil or oil sketches, and instead laid down oil paint directly. Finally, he would select an appropriate frame.|$|E

5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3, is a {{painting}} by James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The work shows two women dressed <b>in</b> white, <b>one</b> <b>sitting</b> on a sofa and the other resting on the floor. The model on the sofa is Joanna Heffernan, the artist's mistress. By calling the painting Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler intended to emphasise his artistic philosophy of corresponding arts, inspired by the poet Charles Baudelaire. The presence of a fan on the floor shows the influence of Japonisme, which was a popular artistic trend in European art at the time. Whistler was also greatly influenced by his colleague and friend Albert Joseph Moore, and their works show considerable similarities.|$|R

40|$|Brevity {{understood}} both {{as reading}} time {{but also as}} the convergence between the time of action {{and the time of}} narration is certainly one of the peculiarities of the short story. In Saadat Hasan Manto, briefness is a very specific stylistic and expressive trait. He was not only a quick writer, able to complete his stories frequently <b>in</b> just <b>one</b> <b>sitting,</b> he was also a master of conciseness. Manto translated his ethical attitude towards the tragic matter of his narration into a praxis of pursued succinctness. For him: removing reference, denying identification and stripping his texts to the bare bones was not simply his personal way of experimenting with the modernist aesthetics, it was a determined tactic to convey a sense of general moral unease and a sort of frozen discomfort...|$|R

500|$|Clocking in at {{over two}} hours in length and {{containing}} 34 tracks, The Astonishing was planned as an immersive experience that would be best enjoyed as a full album {{as opposed to a}} collection of singles. The album plays out similarly to a film, with Loudwire observing, [...] "It’s an enormous amount of music to absorb <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sitting,</b> but when you think about it, most movies are around {{two hours in}} length, and The Astonishing is very much like a movie in the way it delivers the storyline."

50|$|The only {{financial}} institution under Islamic Governance (Prophethood and Caliph Period) was Baitulmaal (public treasury) wherein the wealths were distributed instantly {{on the basis}} of need. During Prophethood the last receipt was tribute from Bahrain amounting eight hundred thousands dirham which was distributed <b>in</b> just <b>one</b> <b>sitting.</b> Though the first Caliph earmarked a house for Baitulmaal where all money was kept on receipt. As all money was distributed immediately the treasury generally remained locked up. At {{the time of his death}} there was only <b>one</b> dirham <b>in</b> the Baitulmaal. The second caliph besides developing the Central Baitulmaal also opened Baitulmaal at state and headquarters levels.
