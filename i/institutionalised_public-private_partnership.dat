It starts by analysing the mixed company model from a theoretical point of view, in particular the potential for internal regulation and the achievement of relational agreements. Then, after discussing the practicalities of crafting this type of governance structure, the examination of four Portuguese case‐studies is provided. The empirical evidence on mixed companies operating in the water, waste, transportation and education sectors shows that the extreme complexity involved in the whole life‐cycle management of these companies, usually leads to poor outcomes from a social welfare point of view...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} study documents in-depth {{the exploration}} of the Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) between the Dayton Regional STEM School (DRSS) and their industry partners as well as the establishment of a framework for evaluating and assessing PPPs. The <b>public-private</b> <b>partnership</b> agreements were studied in order to answer the over-arching research question: How is an effective <b>public-private</b> <b>partnership</b> established, assessed, and evaluated in education? A descriptive case study methodology was used to study DRSS 2 ̆ 7 <b>public-private</b> <b>partnership</b> agreements to determine if goals and objectives were established and whether or not the partnerships met those goals and objectives. This case study also included the development and testing of a proposed evaluation framework that will allow for consistent, systematic inquiry that can produce defensible assertions regarding the assessment and evaluation of <b>public-private</b> <b>partnerships</b> in education. Results of the case study support the findings that utilization of an evaluation framework can serve to make <b>public-private</b> <b>partnerships</b> more successful.
