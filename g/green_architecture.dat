25|$|<b>Green</b> <b>architecture</b> also {{seeks to}} reduce waste of energy, water and {{materials}} used during construction. For example, in California nearly 60% of the state's waste comes from commercial buildings During the construction phase, one {{goal should be}} {{to reduce the amount of}} material going to landfills. Well-designed buildings also help reduce the amount of waste generated by the occupants as well, by providing on-site solutions such as compost bins to reduce matter going to landfills.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{concept is}} natural building, {{which is usually}} {{on a smaller scale}} and tends to focus on the use of natural {{materials}} that are available locally. Other related topics include sustainable design and <b>green</b> <b>architecture.</b> Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Although some green building programs don't address the issue of the retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction.|$|E

40|$|With new {{technologies}} and the growing focus on <b>green</b> <b>architectures,</b> temperature and power consumption have become a major issue {{to be considered in}} systems design. Systems Architects should apply Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques in order to model systems at design phase and to verify 'green' requirements both at design and execution phases. In fact, violations of this kind of properties is a problem because they should infringe national or international directives about power and thermal management, and even be symptoms of incorrect behaviors at run-time. In this paper a MDE methodology is used in order to evaluate thermal consumption of a service provider at design time. It exploits formal models for verification and generates observers to monitor abnormal thermal behaviors of the system during execution. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Climate Group {{notes that}} energy {{consumption}} by ICT activities represented 2 % of global human activity in 2009 (Smart, 2012) [1]. ICT {{is therefore a}} sector contributing both to natural resource depletion and to greenhouse gas emission. Moreover, ICT generates considerable quantities of electronic waste, it emits radio waves (including GSM and WiFi) that can adversely affect human and animal health, and it {{can have an impact}} on the natural beauty of the landscape (e. g. antennas). A new challenge for ICT engineers is therefore to be able to design ICT more efficiently by considering environmental constraints.

The objective of this paper is to apply these commandments to ICT, by focusing on <b>green</b> network <b>architecture</b> design. The main developments in this research are the proposed relationships between the ten commandments and the networking domain and metrics for assessing both the project-system and the system-of-interest when designing <b>green</b> network <b>architectures...</b>|$|R
