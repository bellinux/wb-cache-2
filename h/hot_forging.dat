40|$|AbstractNi–P coated Si 3 N 4 {{reinforced}} Al 6061 composites were fabricated by stir casting technique. Silicon nitride particles were {{varied in}} steps of 2 from 6 wt. % to 10 wt. %. Cast matrix alloy and developed composites were <b>hot</b> <b>forged</b> at a temperature of 500 ̊C using a 300 T hydraulic hammer. Both as cast, <b>hot</b> <b>forged</b> matrix alloy and its composites were subjected to microstructural studies and fatigue strength tests. Microstructural studies reveal even distribution of silicon nitride particles with excellent bond between the matrix and reinforcement in both as cast and <b>hot</b> <b>forged</b> condition. It is observed that, increased content of reinforcement in both as cast and <b>hot</b> <b>forged</b> composites do result in significant improvement in fatigue strength. However, when compared with as cast matrix alloy and its composites, <b>hot</b> <b>forged</b> alloy and its composites exhibit higher fatigue strength.

25|$|Some metals may {{be forged}} cold, but {{iron and steel}} are almost always hot forged. <b>Hot</b> <b>forging</b> {{prevents}} the work hardening that would result from cold forging, which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece. Also, while work hardening may be desirable in some circumstances, other methods of hardening the piece, such as heat treating, are generally more economical and more controllable. Alloys that are amenable to precipitation hardening, such as most aluminium alloys and titanium, can be hot forged, followed by hardening.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{following}} forging processes can be performed at various temperatures; however, they are generally classified by whether the metal temperature is above or below the recrystallization temperature. If the temperature is above the material's recrystallization temperature it is deemed hot forging; if the temperature is below the material's recrystallization temperature but above 30% of the recrystallization temperature (on an absolute scale) it is deemed warm forging; if below 30% of the recrystallization temperature (usually room temperature) then it is deemed cold forging. The main advantage of <b>hot</b> <b>forging</b> {{is that it can}} be done more quickly and precisely, and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the recrystallization process. Cold forging typically results in work hardening of the piece.|$|E
25|$|Production forging {{involves}} significant {{capital expenditure}} for machinery, tooling, facilities and personnel. In {{the case of}} <b>hot</b> <b>forging,</b> a high-temperature furnace (sometimes {{referred to as the}} forge) is required to heat ingots or billets. Owing {{to the size of the}} massive forging hammers and presses and the parts they can produce, as well as the dangers inherent in working with hot metal, a special building is frequently required to house the operation. In the case of drop forging operations, provisions must be made to absorb the shock and vibration generated by the hammer. Most forging operations use metal-forming dies, which must be precisely machined and carefully heat-treated to correctly shape the workpiece, as well as to withstand the tremendous forces involved.|$|E

25|$|Forging is a {{manufacturing}} process involving {{the shaping of}} metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or <b>hot</b> <b>forging</b> (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Forging {{has been done by}} smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery. Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength; such forgings usually require further processing (such as machining) to achieve a finished part. Today, forging is a major worldwide industry.|$|E

It is then descaled with rollers, sheared into blanks, and transferred through several successive forming stages, during which it is upset, preformed, final forged, and pierced (if necessary). This process can also be coupled with high-speed cold-forming operations. Generally, the cold forming operation will do the finishing stage so that the advantages of cold-working can be obtained, while maintaining the high speed of automatic <b>hot</b> <b>forging.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{is presented in}} the paper for predicting involute profile deflection in <b>hot</b> precision <b>forging</b> of gears. This model is a function of a number of material and processing parameters, including the thermal expansion of the die, thermal contraction of workpiece, elastic expansion of the die during forging, and workpiece recovery after ejection. To improve the accuracy of the <b>hot</b> <b>forged</b> gear tooth, an equation set to define modified involute that is used to design the die tooth has been proposed based on the model. The distribution of deflection along the involute was also predicted using the commercial FE code, PRO-E. The deflection characteristic of the toothed die through the tooth width was analyzed by combining the theoretical method and FEM to investigate the non-uniform deflection. The dimension of the forged gears was measured using a gear measurement machine WGT 3000. A close agreement between predicted and measured tooth involute profiles was obtained, which validated the involute deflection prediction model. The measured lead error also verified the model for deflection non-uniformity through the tooth width.

40|$|Conventional {{quenched}} and tempered steels {{have long}} been used to fabricate mechanical components, such as plates, shafts, and axles. All of these components are mainly fabricated employing medium carbon <b>hot</b> <b>forged</b> steels in the {{quenched and tempered}} condition. In the last decade, thermomechanical forging at intermediate (warm) temperatures of microalloyed medium carbon steels is increasingly adopted to reduce or eliminate quenching and tempering heat treatments in <b>hot</b> <b>forged</b> components. However, {{the use of these}} steels is still limited, being difficult to achieve a toughness comparable to that of fully heat treated ones. In an effort to improve toughness, an experimental campaign was performed to assess strength and toughness properties of three selected microalloyed medium carbon steels after thermomechanical forging simulations at warm temperatures, performed on a thermal and mechanical Gleeble 3800 ® apparatus. Microstructures and mechanical properties of these steels are shown to be highly dependent upon steel composition and thermomechanical schedule. The experimental results suggest that thermomechanical schedules can be designed to produce microalloyed medium carbon steels with refined microstructures, and therefore to realize improved strength and machinability; yet, toughness is still the most critical property as compared to that of quenched and tempered steel...|$|R
