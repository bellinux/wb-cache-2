40|$|The authors {{provide an}} {{empirical}} framework {{for assessing the}} effects of tax policy on an array of producer decisions about output supplies and input demands in Mexico, Pakistan, and Turkey. They specify and estimate a dynamic production structure model with imperfect competition for selected industries in these countries. The model results suggest that tax policy affected production and investment and further that selective tax incentives such as investment tax credits, <b>investment</b> <b>allowances,</b> and accelerated capital consumption (depreciation) allowances are more cost effective at promoting investment than more general tax incentives such as corporate tax rate reductions. The long run cost effectiveness of these incentives - except corporate tax rate reductions, which proved cost ineffective in all cases - varies by country. In Turkey, <b>investment</b> <b>allowances</b> and capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In Mexico, neither investment tax credits nor accelerated capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In contrast, in Pakistan, both investment tax credits and accelerated capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In the intermediate run, defined as tax policy impact after one year, only the <b>investment</b> <b>allowances</b> and accelerated capital consumption allowances available to Turkish industries proved cost effective. To make selective tax incentives more effective, investmenttax credits must be refundable and carrying forward <b>investment</b> depreciation <b>allowances</b> must be permitted. If stimulating investment expenditure is the sole objective of tax policy, reducing the corporate tax rate is not a cost effective instrument to achieve this objective.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} two empirical {{questions about}} tax incentives: (1) are incentives used as tools of tax competition and (2) how effective are incentives in attracting investment? To answer these, we prepared a new dataset of tax incentives in over 40 Latin American, Caribbean and African countries {{for the period}} 1985 – 2004. Using spatial econometrics techniques for panel data to answer the first question, we find evidence for strategic interaction in tax holidays, {{in addition to the}} well-known competition over the corporate income tax rate. We find no evidence, however, for competition over <b>investment</b> <b>allowances</b> and tax credits. Using dynamic panel data econometrics to answer the second question, we find evidence that lower corporate income tax rates and longer tax holidays are effective in attracting FDI, but not in boosting gross private fixed capital formation or growth.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to show that the scheme of <b>investment</b> <b>allowances</b> {{outlined}} below would be preferable to the present system of special depreciation allowances as a means of encouraging investment by primary producers, especially investment by low-income farmers. The need for increased primary production for balance of payments reasons is assumed and increased investment is the major means of bringing this about. (1) The main determinant of the ability of farmers to invest is the excess of their disposable incomes over the costs of maintaining a required standard of life. (2) The effectiveness of the above schemes depends largely upon the extent to which they increase these surpluses. The empirical studies to date suggest that special depreciation allowances have not been very effective in encouraging investment in primary production, especially by low-income farmers. (3) Furthermore, it appears that low-income farmers are not always aware of the existence of special depreciation allowances. (4) Their effectiveness is even further reduced by this ignorance. The article is in four sections. Section 1 contains a description of special depreciation allowances and of the proposed scheme of <b>investment</b> <b>allowances.</b> In the remaining sections the impact of both schemes on investment is analysed for different situations, and the relative merits of the two schemes are assessed.

40|$|This paper assembles a new dataset on {{corporate}} income tax regimes in 50 emerging and developing economies over 1996 - 2007 and analyzes their impact {{on corporate}} tax revenues and domestic and foreign investment. It computes effective tax rates {{to take account of}} complicated special regimes, such as partial tax holidays, temporarily reduced rates and increased <b>investment</b> <b>allowances.</b> There is evidence of a partial race to the bottom: countries have been under pressure to lower tax rates in order to lure and boost investment. In the case of standard tax systems (i. e. tax rules applying under normal circumstances), the effective tax rate reductions have not been larger than those witnessed in advanced economies, and revenues have held up well over the sample period. However, a race to the bottom is evident among special regimes, most notably in the case of Africa, creating effectively a parallel tax system where rates have fallen to almost zero. Regression analysis reveals higher tax rates adversely affect domestic investment and FDI, but do raise revenues in the short-run.

40|$|This {{document}} {{contains two}} short {{papers on the}} theoretical structure of FH-ORANI. The first paper is concerned with local ownership shares for fixed capital in individual industries. The second {{is concerned with the}} taxation of earnings of fixed capital. Each paper identifies shortcomings in the current treatment, proposes a new treatment, describes its computer implementation, and presents illustrative simulation results. The first paper proposes two changes relating to local ownership of fixed capital. * In calculating industry shares in aggregate capital stocks, we assume uniformity across industries not in pre-tax rates of return, but in post-tax rates. * In determining local ownership shares for individual industries, we do not assume changes in shares to be uniform across industries, but do require them to be jointly consistent with the change in the economy-wide average local ownership share. Illustrative simulation results show that the new treatment greatly increases the sensitivity of foreign income payments to changes in the economy-wide local ownership share. The second paper proposes several changes relating to taxation of earnings of fixed capital. * Tax reductions arising from depreciation and investment allowances are not apportioned between fixed capital, working capital, and land, but are allocated entirely to fixed capital. * The share of tax on earnings of fixed capital in total tax on non-labour income is not fixed, but varies in response to changes in the composition of non-labour income. * Investors treat the reduction in tax arising from the <b>investment</b> <b>allowance</b> not as an augmentation to their income, but as a partial offset to the purchase cost of capital. Illustrative simulation results show that the new treatment greatly increases the sensitivity of capital usage to changes in the depreciation and <b>investment</b> <b>allowance.</b> ...|$|E

This paper proposes Jorgenson's method as an appropriate TFP measurement for the construction industry. The method is less restrictive than the conventional Chau's approach, as it does not impose the Hick Neutral Technical Change assumption. Jorgenson's method is then applied to estimate TFP growth {{in the construction industry}} of Singapore over 1984 - 1998. TFP growth is found down by 1. 53 % per annum over this period, indicating that the performance of TFP in the construction industry lags behind the rest of economy. TFP growth is also found to be fluctuating over time and tends to move in tandem with the construction business cycle. As a monitor of progress towards TFP achievement, factors influencing TFP growth in the construction industry of Singapore over 1984 - 1997 are identified. Seven factors are found to be significantly related to TFP growth. Among them, economies of scale, R&D by the industry, <b>investment</b> <b>allowance</b> granted and labour unions are leading contributors to TFP growth; while foreign worker, construction accidents and pre-cast are major hampers.

40|$|The {{effect of}} tax {{policy on the}} process of capital {{accumulation}} has long been an important subject of policy debates and academic research. The tax policy debate in the 1980 s has been largely motivated by a concern over the rate of capital accumulation in the United States. Tax rules can affect the nation’s capital formation by influencing the return to saving and to investing in plant and equipment. However, the presence of international capital mobility requires policymakers to design tax incentives from a different perspective from that which would be taken in the case of immobile capital. Savings incentives and investment incentives can no longer be treated as alternative devices to enhance domestic capital formation. Part of domestic savings may flow into investment projects abroad, while domestic investment incentives can bring in more foreign capital.
