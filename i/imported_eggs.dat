A total of 1680 chicken eggs (10 eggs were locally produced and 10 eggs were imported) were collected biweekly from retail stores in different seven popular regions of Baghdad city during the period from January 14 th to July 15 th of 2010.

The number of incidents reported to the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority in 2003 (582, including 324 outbreaks) was similar to 2002 (585, including 349 outbreaks). At the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, for 13 % a probable cause for the foodborne infections and intoxications was found. Bacillus cereus (4. 1 %) was most frequently reported, followed by Salmonella (1. 3 %). It was indirectly estimated that 8 % of reported outbreaks were of viral origin. At the Inspectorate for Health Care, the causative agent was reported for 80 % of the outbreaks. Salmonella was most frequently identified (41 %), followed by norovirus (23 %) and Campylobacter (12 %). The relative role of norovirus as causative agent has clearly increased since 2000, due to more frequent testing of stool samples. However, the increase in 2003 is also caused {{by the emergence of}} a novel genetic variant of norovirus in the season of 2002 / 2003, with epidemic spread throughout Europe.

40|$|Quarantine Station Stakeholder Group, {{to reconsider}} {{the length of the}} post-arrival {{quarantine}} (PAQ) period for chicks hatched from <b>imported</b> <b>eggs.</b> The Torrens Island Avian Quarantine Station Stakeholder Group is made up of users of the quarantine station and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS). Their request arose from a desire to achieve higher throughputs at the Torrens Island quarantine station in particular, {{in order to reduce the}} backlog of applications for space in the facility. The request stated that reducing the PAQ period from 12 weeks post-hatch to 9 weeks post-hatch would allow an additional consignment to be accommodated, every 2 years. The request also provided information suggesting that such a reduction in PAQ period could be achieved without increasing the quarantine risk to Australia. Copies of the request, and supporting submissions from Dr Peter Scott, consulting veterinarian to Hy-line Australia Pty. Ltd. and Dr Peter Groves, Veterinary Consultant of Zootechny Pty. Ltd., are attached at Appendices 1 to 3 respectively. At the time of writing, there have been a total of 26 successful imports through the Torrens Island Quarantine station.

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1969. Bibliography: leaves [157]- 163. ix, 163 l illus., tablesThe {{many changes}} taking place in the economy of Hawaii {{as well as in the}} {{industry}} itself lead to a questioning of the future of the industry in Hawaii. The major objective of the study was to evaluate the competitive position of the Hawaii egg industry with respect to California. A survey of 14 egg ranches on Oahu was conducted from which the cost of producing eggs in Honolulu county was determined. The information gathered provided the basis for studying production factors affecting the competitive position of the Hawaii industry. Four production factors were investigated in depth~ feed cost, flock replacement cost, labor cost, and the effect of increased flock size. Some of the facts uncovered by the study were: Feed and flock replacement costs are higher in Hawaii. Most of the differences in cost were due to transportation. Labor cost in Honolulu was significantly higher than the three California counties used for comparison. However, since local producers received higher prices for eggs and poultry meat, net farm income per layer was higher in Hawaii. Increased flock size could reduce production cost per layer, while the attrition of ranches with small flocks could add to the industry's competitive strength. Marketing factors affecting the competitive position of the egg industry were categorized under two groups~ the length and complexity of the marketing channel, and the competitive marketing actions of producers. It was found that transfer cost, which raises the price of production inputs, also raises the price of mainland eggs in Hawaii. The longer, more complex marketing channel of mainland eggs further increases the price of <b>imported</b> <b>eggs.</b> However, in spite of the higher marketing costs, mainland eggs can be sold at lower prices because of the lower cost of production. Current freight rates prohibit the importation of table eggs by air. While it may be physically possible to fly eggs in the cargo holds of the jumbo jets, it is doubtful that untreated shell eggs will be flown to Hawaii. The principal conclusion drawn from the available data is that competitive action by ranchers, advertising laws in Hawaii, and consumers' preferences for local eggs are factors which combine to maintain current competitive strength. Hawaii poultry ranchers will be able to maintain the 95 percent of the fresh egg market in Hawaii...|$|E

These factors include consumer response to changes in import prices and income. In this study the authors develop economic models of import demand for three main product groups in Oman: meats, dairy and eggs, and live animals. These product groups have been identified as major sources of protein for the Omani population. In addition, these products have a history of domestic production and potential for reducing dependence on food imports. The results indicate that the estimated price elasticity of demand for meat products is elastic, which implies that an increase in price Will result in a decrease in revenues for meat import businesses However, the estimated price elasticity for <b>imported</b> dairy and <b>egg</b> products is inelastic. This implies that an increase in import price will result in an increase in revenues for dairy and <b>egg</b> <b>import</b> businesses. The estimated income elasticities for meat products and dairy and egg products were found to be less than one, suggesting that they are normal goods.

Poultry operations in Iceland provide an excellent opportunity to study this possibility, since breeding flocks are established solely from <b>eggs</b> <b>imported</b> from grandparent flocks in Sweden. This leaves limited opportunity for grandparents and their progeny to share isolates through horizontal transmission. While Campylobacter was not detected in all grandparent flocks, 13 of the 16 <b>egg</b> <b>import</b> lots consisted of eggs gathered from one or more Campylobacter-positive grandparent flocks. No evidence of Campylobacter was found by PCR in any of the 10 relevant quarantine hatchery fluff samples examined, and no Campylobacter was isolated from the parent birds through 8 weeks, while they were still in quarantine rearing facilities. After the birds were moved to less biosecure rearing facilities, Campylobacter was isolated, and 29 alleles were observed among the 224 isolates studied. While three alleles were found in both Sweden and Iceland, in no case was the same allele found both in a particular grandparent flock and in its progeny.

The seasonal decline in rates of parasitism was not significantly related to increasing plant leaf area, vigor of released parasitoids, or ambient temperature.
