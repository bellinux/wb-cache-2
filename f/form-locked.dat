40|$|AbstractA new wire joining {{process for}} wires with sub-millimeter diameters {{applying}} the rotary swaging was investigated. The basic {{idea is to}} join two wire ends by a tube segment. In the study different material combinations using steel (AISI 304) and copper (CW 004 A) were examined. Further the realization of a <b>form-locked</b> joint was investigated. The formed samples were tested by optical microscopy and tensile testing and compared to spot welded samples...|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} study is performed with 2 D-mathematical models for heat shield designs using carbon fibre composites and tungsten monoblocks, which are <b>form-locked</b> to the coolant tube instead of metallurgically bonded. The geometrical boundary {{conditions and the}} overall shape correspond to the design for the ITER divertor vertical target. Steady state thermo-mechanical analyses {{have been carried out}} for a limited number of cases to investigate the effects of the particular features of the proposed connection. The results demonstrate the principal feasibility of this approach and open prospects for further improvements. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device (1) for measuring electric current, comprising {{at least one}} substrate material (10) on which at least one optical sensor is arranged in <b>form-locked</b> manner, which sensor contains at least one optical waveguide (21) {{with at least one}} Bragg grating (3), the substrate material (10) containing or consisting of a piezoelectric material. The invention further relates to a method for measuring an electric current, in which an electric field (E) is generated in a piezoelectric substrate material (10) by the current to be measured and the deformation of the substrate material (10) is determined by means of at least one optical sensor (2) ...|$|E
40|$|Many plasma-facing {{components}} in today's experiments are inertially cooled. Graphite tiles are {{mounted on a}} water-cooled steel plate using a spring and bolt mechanism. When exposed to high heat flux, such a shield can take loads {{only for a few}} seconds without becoming overheated. To operate in high intensity long pulsed/steady-state conditions, new actively cooled heat shields of brazed and non-brazed types are under development. With clamped (<b>form-locked)</b> monoblock tiles a prototype of non-brazed heat shield structure underwent its first high heat flux tests for divertor applications in the Julich MARION ion source [1]. The test results are encouraging, and validated a finite element model as discussed in this paper. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The <b>form-locked,</b> {{force-fit}} and materially bonded {{integration of}} temperature-sensitive actuators and sensors in complex metal parts or metallic monolithic structures {{is still a}} dissolved problem. On the one hand, embedded actuators and sensors require an optimum shape and material connection to optimally low loss coupling the desired measuring gradient (gradient force) to the sensor and to low loss coupling the actuating gradient (gradient force) into the structure where the actuator/sensor is embedded in. On the other hand, the actuators/sensors need to be materially bonded at interfaces with its surrounding structure with thermal protection from laser melting process. Such a strategy assumes that the actuator/sensor is coated by a thermal-shielding multi-material/multi-layer protection system preferably from ceramic and metallic material components. The integration interface between actuator/sensor system and surrounding structure is thereby designed {{in such a way}} that the main flow of energy is topically focused on this interface and distributed away from and around the actuator/sensor system. In this way, the total energy input into the temperature-sensitive actuator/sensor system is reduced. Also addressed are laser scanning patterns for less topical temperature load. In this article solutions for above described problems for a monolithic and function-preserving integration of actuator/sensor systems inside and outside laser beam melted components are discussed. These mechatronic systems can be used for various applications such as medical implants and industrial parts...|$|E
40|$|Load-adapted local {{reinforcements}} {{are used}} in the automotive industry in terms of lightweight construction and improvement of properties of mechanically loaded components. This can be done by the conventional way of separately formed reinforcement parts that are joined during the assembly process, or in the modern form of tailored products. In this report the research results of joining local reinforcements during the process of hydroforming are shown. Thereby, component and reinforcement are joined by a form lock in the hydroforming process, that ensures handling stability from the removal out of the shaping die until the end of curing of the previously applied adhesive on the reinforcement. This joining method is challenged to work within the circumstances of the hydroforming process, the requirements of a combined process and the potential of the adhesives. Major design criteria are the shaping of the <b>form-locked</b> joint and design of the adhesive bond. The demand on the <b>form-locked</b> joint is, to ensure handling stability until the adhesive layer has completely cured. When designing the form elements it is necessary to find a compromise between the maximum possible clamping of the parts {{on the one hand and}} minimal influence on the thickness profile of the hydroforming part on the other hand. By comparing different design alternatives in experiment and simulation it was determined that a sufficient handling stability is achieved best by using existing undercuts in the hydroforming profile by an embracing reinforcement and combining this undercut advantageously with an additional form element in the profile. To determine the best possible adhesive bond, the properties of several adhesives were tested and compared and also different adhesive systems were evaluated in terms of their process capability. An adhesive was supposed to be found, that can be applied previously, is compatible to hydroforming and contamination and achieves maximum strength in the cured state. In addition, the adhesive has to fill a diverging gap between reinforcement and hydroforming part. In this research project none of the adhesives available on the market could meet all general requirements. The research institutes see great potential in a development of pre-applicable melting adhesives towards greater flexibility and formability. Due to the experiments and testing of component properties, the feasibility of the method was successfully demonstrated. The reinforcement and the hydroforming part can be joined without adapting the hydroforming process and the handling stability of the reinforcement is given by the form-lock, generated in the hydroforming process. To create an adhesive bond, pre-applicable adhesives can be used advantageously. The locally reinforced hydroformed components show a significant increase in load capacity in the 3 -point bending test. In the fatigue test with local tension loads on the reinforced area of the component, an improvement of life expectancy was detected. In the crash test, local reinforcements also contribute to an improvement of the component behaviour. The risk of corrosion is minimized when the adhesive layer is optimal developed, resulting in passing the corrosion test after the EDP coating of the parts...|$|E
