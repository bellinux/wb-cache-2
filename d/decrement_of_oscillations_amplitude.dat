The increase <b>of</b> <b>oscillation</b> <b>amplitude</b> in the tube brings about the nonlinear phenomena of wave motion, such as mean pressure distribution along the tube axis, acoustic streaming, and thermoacoustic effect. The large amplitude pressure fluctuation and the thermoacoustic effect generated by finite amplitude standing wave induced in the closed tube are principal physical phenomena in the engineering applications of the finite amplitude wave motion to acoustic compressor and thermoacoustic refrigerator.

[URL] magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are emerging as a major nanoplatform for regenerative neurology, particularly as transfection agents for gene delivery. Magnetic assistive technology, particularly the recent innovation of applied oscillating magnetic fields, can significantly enhance MNP-mediated gene transfer to neural cells. While transfection efficiency varies with oscillation frequency in various neural cell types, the influence <b>of</b> <b>oscillation</b> <b>amplitude</b> {{has not yet been}} investigated.
