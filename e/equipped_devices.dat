The use of active {{noise reduction}} (ANR) systems, however, was not demonstrated until much later. Recent advances in technology have made the use of active noise reduction systems in personal hearing protection devices (HPDs) practical.

It seeks to return the k objects most similar to the query, subject to not only their spatial and textual properties, but also the coherence of their semantic meanings. To achieve that, we propose novel indexing structures, which integrate spatial, textual and semantic information in a hierarchical manner, so as to prune the search space effectively in query processing.
