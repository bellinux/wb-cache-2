Neste estudo, foram utilizados extratos de alecrim e antioxidantes sintéticos para retardar a oxidação do biodiesel metílico do óleo de algodão. Este biodiesel foi aditivado e armazenado em depósitos de aço carbono. Durante o armazenamento, foi observada a melhor estabilidade oxidativa de biodiesel adicionado com TBHQ e com a mistura de extrato de alecrim com TBHQ. Estas formulações antioxidantes protegeram o biodiesel por 90 dias, enquanto que o extrato etanólico de alecrim protegeu por 60 dias e o antioxidante sintético BHT não cumpriu os parâmetros estabelecidos pela Agência Nacional do Petróleo,Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis. O extrato etanólico de alecrim pode ser considerado promissor para manter a qualidade do biodiesel. Além disso, o perfil térmico obtido por análise termogravimétrica mostrou que o extrato etanólico de alecrim pode ser considerado um termoestável, uma vez que mostrou uma perda de massa, provavelmente, acima de 190 °C.

Concerning the stabilization by antioxidants, there was a lack of antioxidant effect of evaluated compounds when Rancimat assays were performed at 70 Â°C, whereas an antioxidant effect began to evidence at 60 Â°C, and a clearest antioxidant protection was measured at 50 Â°C for the mixture of the SER plus Î±-tocopherol in both EE and TAG forms. This selected binary mixture efficiently stabilized the Ï‰ 3 -TAG concentrate throughout 50. days of storage conditions, whereas the stabilization of Ï‰ 3 -EE concentrate was worse.

Também foram testados esses mesmos hidrolatos e os óleos essenciais na germinação dos esporos do fungo. Todos os tratamentos foram realizados in vitro, cultivando-se o fungo em meio de cultura BDA acrescido de 100 &# 956;L dos compostos vegetais. No teste de inibição da germinação, todos os óleos essenciais impediram a germinação do fungo. No entanto, os hidrolatos não tiveram esse efeito. No teste de crescimento micelial, os óleos essenciais de todas as plantas inibiram completamente o crescimento do fungo, exceto o óleo da goiaba branca. Os extratos aquosos, a manipueira, o óleo resina e os hidrolatos, também não foram eficientes sobre o crescimento do patógeno. Esses resultados indicam o potencial antifúngico de alguns óleos essenciais de plantas medicinais. The {{objective}} of the work was to evaluate the effect of extracts and essential oils of fourteen medicinal and or native plants popularly known in the North of Minas Gerais, on the germination of spores and the mycelial growth of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides fungus.

The same hydrolates and essential oils were also tested on the germination of the fungus spores. All the treatments were carried out in vitro, cultivating the fungus in PDA supplemented with 100 &# 956;L of the vegetal compounds. In the germination inhibition test, all the essential oils prevented the germination of the fungus. However, the hydrolates did not have this effect. In the mycelial growth test, the essential oils of all of the plants completely inhibited the fungus growth, except the white guava oil. The watery extracts, the cassava manipueira, the oil resin and hydrolates were also not efficient in preventing the growth of the pathogen. These results indicate the fungitoxic potential of some essential oils of medicinal plants. CNP...|$|E

International audienceThis paper illustrates {{the application of a}} recently proposed protocol allowing the scale-up prediction on hydrostatic countercurrent chromatography columns (centrifugal partition chromatographs or CPC). A commercial <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) was used as the starting material containing 0. 48 % of carnosol, an active pharmaceutical ingredient with great potential. After a rapid method development on a small-scale 35 -mL CPC instrument that allowed for the determination of the solvent system and maximum sample concentration and volume, the purification was transferred on two larger instruments using the "free space between peaks" method. The method takes into account the technical limitations of the larger instruments, such as pressure and/or maximum centrifugal field, and allows, by simply running an analytical-sized injection on the large scale rotor, to give an accurate prediction of the maximum sample load and best throughput. The 0. 27 g <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> <b>extract</b> maximum load on a 35 -mL CPC was transferred as a 1. 9 g load on a 254 -mL medium size CPC and 9 g load on a 812 -mL CPC. The maximum process efficiency of 3. 1 mg of carnosol per hour obtained on the small 35 -mL column was transferred on the 254 -mL CPC giving 8. 3 mg/h and, on the larger 812 -mL column 49. 4 mg of carnosol could be obtained per hour. If the scaling-up in CPC instruments is not directly homothetic, it can be highly predictable through a few simple experiments...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{current study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate the protective activity <b>of</b> olive and <b>rosemary</b> leaves extracts on experimental liver cirrhosis induced by thioacetamide (TAA) in Wistar male rats. Highly significant decline in the values of body weight gain and highly statistically increase of liver/body weight ratio were noted in rats treated with TAA. Furthermore, the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin were statistically increased. Additionally, light microscopic examination of liver sections from rats treated with TAA showed a marked increase in the extracellular matrix collagen content and bridging fibrosis was prominent. There were bundles of collagen surrounding the lobules that resulted in large fibrous septa and distorted tissue architecture.

40|$|The {{potential}} anti-listerial {{benefits of}} essential oils and herbs in fresh-cut produce systems were investigated. Interactions with modified atmospheres and product types {{were examined in}} detail, including effects on quality. A strong anti-listerial response from rosemary herb was discovered during maceration and the chemical basis of this determined for future exploitation. The anti-listerial properties of essential oils (thyme, oregano and rosemary), under a range of storage atmospheres (air, 5 %CO 2 / 2 %,O 2 / 93 %N 2 and 20 %CO 2 / 1 % O 2 / 79 %N 2) and temperatures (4 and 8 °C), were examined using a model vegetable system. Effectiveness was in the order thyme EO> oregano EO> rosemary EO, and greatest under 20 %CO 2 / 1 %O 2 / 79 %N 2 and at 4 °C. When headspace volatiles from the EOs were tested there was little anti-listerial effect, suggesting that the EOs needed to be {{in direct contact with}} cultures. When applied to modified atmosphere packaged fresh-cut vegetables (lettuce, cabbage, coleslaw mix and carrots), the effectiveness was in the order thyme EO > oregano EO > rosemary EO > basil EO. Applying undiluted EOs directly to the fresh produce had a detrimental effect on appearance. A product effect was seen with EOs and herbs having increased anti-listerial activity on shredded cabbage and carrot. Diluting the EOs, or using them diluted in combination, reduced adverse sensory effects, but also eliminated the anti-listerial effects. In general, use of the fresh herb equivalents of the EOs was ineffective. However, while commercial rosemary EO was relatively ineffective, freshly macerated rosemary herb had very strong anti-listerial effects. To investigate this further, the chemical composition and anti-listerial activity <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> oil obtained by different extraction methods (CO 2 extraction, hydrodistillation, solvent extraction) was determined. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy identified the main components present as camphor, verbenone, borneol, bornyl acetate and caryophyllene. All of these individual components showed anti-listerial activity, however principal component analysis showed verbenone to be highly correlated with anti-listerial kill rate. The hydrodistillate, which had the highest antilisterial activity, contained the highest levels <b>of</b> verbenone. The <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> macerated <b>rosemary</b> herb had more than twentyfold the level of verbenone found in the unmacerated rosemary extract. When headspace analysis was carried out on uncut, freshly chopped and macerated rosemary herb, the relative levels of verbenone were 0, 6 and 118 ppm. The strong anti-listerial activity <b>of</b> the macerated <b>rosemary</b> may be explained by the higher concentration of verbenone present in these <b>extracts.</b> Simulation <b>of</b> maceration by stomaching in industrial production <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> EOs is likely to greatly enhance their anti-listerial effectiveness...|$|R
