5000|$|The {{political}} {{aspect of}} GATT Article XX aside, there are technical legal problems involved with invoking the {{clause in the}} first place. The wording in the relevant sections of GATT Article XX means {{that it must be}} proved that it is [...] "necessary" [...] to restrict a product in order to protect human, animal or plant life or health. For a state to legally take unilateral trade restrictive measures under these sections, the 'necessity test' must first be passed. There are three components. Firstly, it must be determined whether the interests protected are vital. Secondly, there is an assessment {{as to whether or not}} alternative measures are reasonably available and thirdly it is determined whether these alternate measures are less inconsistent with GATT (are the measures being proposed 'necessary' to combat the risk?). This means that a link must be established between both the targeted risk, the product being targeted and the trade measures being undertaken, with the burden of proof is solely upon the party seeking to uphold the clause. According to Black's Law dictionary, 'necessary' does not have to carry the meaning 'indispensable' but can refer to the most appropriate or convenient option. In the Korea- Beef case it was taken to mean 'nearly indispensable', and this definition has become a benchmark by which other cases are evaluated. Context is very important, and the greater the risk posed by a product the more lenience is granted when proving a link. For example, if there is a danger to human life, the evaluation is less stringent. However it is still extremely difficult to justify cases of labour standards abuse under GATT XX. Even if the necessity test is satisfied, the chapeau to Article XX must also be satisfied- the laws must not be applied in a manner so as to constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination, nor be a <b>disguised</b> <b>restriction</b> on international trade. This last requirement is particularly important because there is often a suspicion that the insertion of labour standards into free trade agreements/other measures, for example, are really disguised restrictions on trade.|$|E
5000|$|Russian Ombudsman Vladimir Lukin {{reported}} in 2006, that suggesting that {{freedom of speech}} is non-existent in Russia would be an exaggeration, the constitutional right for speech freedom is basically observed, {{as well as that}} there was no institutionalised censorship. Apparently for these very reasons journalists and publishers seldom appeal to the commissioner protesting restrictions of their right of seeking, receiving, transferring, publishing or distributing information. Yet <b>disguised</b> <b>restrictions</b> exist to a considerable degree, they are often put through the economic pressure on mass media by the authorities and loyal business. The so-called [...] "self-censorship" [...] which induces journalists to refrain from disseminating information which, in their opinion, may not please the authorities, is also widespread. So in many places the right to praise the authorities is ensured, while the opposite right is just formally declared.|$|R
40|$|Trade {{treaties}} {{have introduced}} {{the principle that}} similar risks should be treated similarly, and that countries must achieve internal consistency in the levels of protection they afford against certain hazards within their territories. The {{problem is that there}} is no agreement on when risks are 2 ̆ 2 similar 2 ̆ 2 or when levels of protection are 2 ̆ 2 consistent. 2 ̆ 2 The danger is that in resolving these issues, international trade institutions will infringe on the political sovereignty of their Members. This Article proposes a science-based solution. A substantial body of scientific research establishes that a person 2 ̆ 7 s judgments about the risk posed by a hazard are influenced by a number of factors, including certain characteristics of the hazard itself, scientific uncertainty in the evidence about the risk. This Article argues that such factors should also be relevant to deciding whether a country is being consistent in setting its levels of protection. International trade institutions that ignore such factors imperil their own success and legitimacy, and do so unnecessarily. General and specific empirical studies can provide a neutral means of deciding whether levels of protection are risk-based or are merely <b>disguised</b> <b>restrictions</b> on international trade...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks into}} the {{proliferation}} of privately-formulated environmental product standards and analyses whether Indian industry has a legal recourse under the WTO dispute settlement mechanism if such standards are used as <b>disguised</b> <b>restrictions</b> on trade. The paper highlights {{some of the issues}} faced by Indian manufacturers when confronted with voluntary product requirements such as eco-labeling, packaging and recycling requirements in markets of key export interest to them and highlights the role of non-state actors in the formulation of such environmental product standards. Since some of these product standards are capable of being misused as protectionist devices, the paper examines whether the WTO dispute settlement mechanism can be used to resolve an issue which cannot be directly attributed to governmental action (or inaction). In doing so the paper studies the representations made by India and other developing countries at meetings of various WTO Committees; and past decisions of WTO Panels and the Appellate Body to establish the magnitude of the problem and look for possible legal solutions. The paper looks at the issue from a developing country perspective- the assumption being that developing countries are standard-takers, not standard-setters; and are unable to afford the costs of compliance associated with voluntary environmental standards. The analysis focuses predominantly on the use and interpretation of the GATT Agreement and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and discusses a possible legal strategy that may be adopted in any future dispute.

Information about international trade agreement were collected and discussed to explain the role of The World Trade Organization (WTO) and The Agreement on the application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures, in regulating livestock trade and how these measures may act as a technical barriers to sheep trade. Results showed that about 4. 4 % to 14. 5 % from the monthly exports of sheep were rejected in the year 2005 due to sanitary measures, which may be used as a <b>disguised</b> <b>restriction</b> to trade...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper will}} analyse some recent {{developments}} {{as to the}} acceptability of trade restrictive measures aimed at protecting the environment under WTO rules, and more specifically under Article XX of the GATT. In that regard, the necessity test included in Article XX (b) of the GATT constitutes the first legal benchmark that any trade-restrictive measure aimed at {{the protection of the}} environment will have to pass. As will be seen from the recent AB ruling in Brazil – retreated tyres, more attention is progressively being given to environmental considerations through the interpretation of this ‘necessity test’, i. e. the assessment of what constitutes a necessary restriction or not. The second legal test is included in what is commonly called the “chapeau ” or introductory clause of Article XX. This clause prohibits any measure which pursues one of the objectives listed in the same article to be applied in a manner which would constitute an unjustifiable or arbitrary discrimination or a <b>disguised</b> <b>restriction</b> on international trade. Following the Brazil – retreated tyres ruling, it appears that this test will in fact be the most important one as a means to evaluate a State’s good faith in enacting such trade-restrictive measures. In view of these developments in judicial interpretation, it may be anticipated that the EU would probably have more freedom in the future in order to enact trade restrictive measures aimed at protecting the global environment without being found in breach of its WTO obligations. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} three theoretical {{essays on}} the economic applications of product quality regulation in WTO Agreements: Economic Applications of the WTO Consistency Requirement Article 5. 5 (consistency) of the SPS Agreement requires countries to avoid arbitrary distinctions in health protection on goods {{that are associated with}} the same disease, if such distinctions result in discrimination or a <b>disguised</b> <b>restriction</b> on trade. For a bound tariff, a marginally binding consistency constraint improves welfare but welfare is reduced if the constraint is interpreted too strictly. When tariffs are negotiated subject to consistency, the welfare effects of consistency depend on whether trade negotiators are myopic or forward-looking. Public Opinion, Product Quality Regulation and Trade attempts to answer the following questions. Should governments be forced to admit products that science deems healthy, but consumers do not? Are consumer fears sufficient to justify a ban on a healthy import or should the fears refect scientifically proven risk? To what extent can regulatory authorities exploit these fears for protectionist purposes? In an adverse selection model, consumers have imperfect information with regard to government type and import product quality. The government of the country exporting the product of uncertain quality has an incentive to commit to a strategy where it recognises the importing country's right to ban the unhealthy import but tariff retaliates if the importing country bans a healthy import. Under such a strategy first best is achieved; consumers learn product quality and consumption distortions associated with consumer fear are eliminated. Allowing the importing Asymmetric Information and Country-of-Origin Labelling concerns information asymmetries as a rationale for trade policy when adverse selection is an international problem. Firms in countries North and South choose between producing high or low quality. Those choosing low quality take advantage of adverse selection problems, while those choosing high quality do so to establish reputations and earn positive profits in subsequent periods when information is perfect. Cross-country differences in the relative costs of producing high quality result in different average qualities and prices in autarky. Trade is welfare deteriorating (improving) for the North (South). Allowing the Northern government the option of origin-labelling eliminates the international externalities associated with trade when adverse selection is a transnational problem, and is unambiguously welfare improving for the North...|$|E
50|$|Sanitary and {{phytosanitary}} (SPS) {{measures are}} {{measures to protect}} humans, animals, and plants from diseases, pests, or contaminants. The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures {{is one of the}} final documents approved {{at the conclusion of the}} Uruguay Round of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. It applies to all sanitary (relating to animals) and phytosanitary (relating to plants) (SPS) measures that may have a direct or indirect impact on international trade. The SPS agreement includes a series of understandings (trade disciplines) on how SPS measures will be established and used by countries when they establish, revise, or apply their domestic laws and regulations. Countries agree to base their SPS standards on science, and as guidance for their actions, the agreement encourages countries to use standards set by international standard setting organizations. The SPS agreement seeks to ensure that SPS measures will not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against trade of certain other members nor be used to <b>disguise</b> trade <b>restrictions.</b> In this SPS agreement, countries maintain the sovereign right to provide the level of health protection they deem appropriate, but agree that this right will not be misused for protectionist purposes nor result in unnecessary trade barriers. A rule of equivalency rather than equality applies to the use of SPS measures.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relation between}} trade and climate change from a Developing country point of view regarding the next meeting of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen in December. Trade measures related to mitigation and adaptation to the climate change are reviewed; their effects and the arguments used to justify their application are analyzed; the possible links between these measures and WTO rules are presented; the way Developing countries could face the effects of those measures is discussed, and finally the present debate at the multilateral level is summed up. Some of these measures {{are included in the}} European Union legal framework and in an Act that has so far been approved by the United States House of Representatives. These measures are also being discussed in multilateral negotiations. In this sense, the new scheme to deal with climate change that is expected to be approved in Copenhagen for an effective, complete and sustained implementation of the Convention after 2012 could include compromises that drive to measures with impacts on international trade. Furthermore, in the private sector, requisites and standards are being developed, which although voluntary in nature, will impact on trade flows. That is why it is important that all these measures be in conformity with Convention and WTO principles and rules to avoid being used as a <b>disguised</b> trade <b>restriction.</b> Besides, with the aim of minimizing the negative impacts of mitigation measures on Developing countries and fulfilling the least costly adaptation of their economies, an effective technology and financial resource transference to Developing countries from Developed countries should be assured...|$|R
40|$|Examining Board: Professor Marise Cremona, European University Institute (Supervisor) Professor Bruno De Witte, European University Institute Professor Sara Poli, Università di Pisa Dr Anne Thies, University of Reading. Defence date: 5 September 2013 First made {{available}} online on 22 January 2016. With the growing awareness in EU external relations {{that the existence}} of Member States' competence does not necessarily allow them to freely exercise such competence, the duty of sincere cooperation laid down in Article 4 (3) TEU is increasingly becoming the focus of academic attention. In light of the vast potential of the duty to encroach on Member State prerogatives, in combination with a number of striking developments in the Court's case law in the field of external relations, particularly in recent years, the question arises whether Article 4 (3) TEU is slowly turning into an instrument for the Union institutions to achieve a loss of national competence, <b>disguised</b> as <b>restrictions</b> on the Member States' freedom to exercise their powers. This thesis investigates which role Article 4 (3) TEU has really played in governing the relationship between the EU and the Member States in external relations. It sets out to answer the positive question of which concept of federalism dominates the exercise of external powers. Building on this foundation, the thesis ultimately endeavours to provide an answer to the normative question regarding the vision of federalism best suited to the needs of both the Member States and the EU when acting on the international scene. In order to answer these questions, the thesis seeks to transpose Halberstam's theory of the political morality in federal systems to the field of EU external relations. Looking at the interpretation given to Article 4 (3) TEU, both in its detailed reasoning and {{as part of a broader}} picture may then allow us to appreciate the construction of the loyalty obligation as the reasoned outcome of a constitutional process involving the EU institutions, the Court of Justice and the Member States themselves. It will be argued that instead of pursuing political harmony between the Member States and the Union by way of creeping competence, Article 4 (3) TEU emphasises cooperation, compliance and complementarity in areas where the rigid division of competence would otherwise render the system of external relations ineffective...|$|R
