40|$|Objective—To {{develop new}} electrocardiographic (ECG) {{criteria}} for the differentiation between counterclockwise and clockwise atrial <b>flutters.</b>  Background—Traditionally, the ECG differentiation between counterclockwise and clockwise atrial <b>flutters</b> {{is based on the}} <b>flutter</b> wave polarity in the inferior leads. However, determination of <b>flutter</b> wave polarity is subjective and sometimes difficult, especially in <b>flutter</b> waves of undulating pattern.  Patients—The study comprised 37  consecutive patients with drug resistant atrial flutter; 30  had counterclockwise and 17  had clockwise atrial <b>flutter</b> (10  had both forms of atrial <b>flutter).</b> The isthmus dependence was confirmed by entrainment study and catheter ablation. The ECG patterns of both types of atrial <b>flutter</b> were compared and the <b>flutter</b> wave polarity in the inferior leads was determined by four independent cardiologists.  Results—The <b>flutter</b> wave polarity in the inferior leads appeared negative in 24, positive in one, and equivocal in five of the counterclockwise atrial flutters; polarity appeared negative in one, positive in 10, and equivocal in six of the clockwise atrial <b>flutters.</b> However, the aVF/lead I <b>flutter</b> wave amplitude ratio was >  2. 5 in all counterclockwise but <  2. 5 in all clockwise atrial <b>flutters.</b> The <b>flutter</b> wave nadirs in the inferior leads corresponded to the upstrokes in V 1 in all counterclockwise atrial <b>flutters,</b> but corresponded to the downstrokes in V 1 in all clockwise atrial <b>flutters.</b>  Conclusions—The <b>flutter</b> wave polarity in the inferior leads does not correlate well with the <b>flutter</b> wave rotating direction. However, counterclockwise and clockwise atrial <b>flutters</b> can be differentiated by new ECG criteria with high accuracy.    Keywords: atrial flutter;  radiofrequency catheter ablation;  electrocardiograph...|$|R

5|$|The European {{storm petrel}} can be {{distinguished}} from related Western Palaearctic species by the white bar on its underwing and its distinctive <b>fluttering</b> flight. Compared to Leach's storm petrel, band-rumped storm petrel, and the recently described Monteiro's storm petrel, it is also smaller, darker, shorter-winged and has a square tail. Wilson's storm petrel lacks an underwing bar, and has long legs with the feet visible beyond the tail.|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{aeroelastic}} {{behavior of}} an elastically supported airfoil is studied {{in order to}} investigate the possibilities of increasing critical <b>flutter</b> speed by exploiting its chord-wise flexibility. The flexible airfoil concept is implemented using a rigid airfoil-shaped leading edge, and a flexible thin laminated composite plate conformally attached to its trailing edge. The <b>flutter</b> behavior is studied {{in terms of the}} number of laminate plies used in the composite plate for a given aeroelastic system configuration. The <b>flutter</b> behavior is predicted by using an eigenfunction expansion approach which is also used to design a laminated plate in order to attain superior <b>flutter</b> characteristics. Such an airfoil is characterized by two types of <b>flutter</b> responses, the classical airfoil <b>flutter</b> and the plate <b>flutter.</b> Analysis shows that a significant increase in the critical <b>flutter</b> speed can be achieved with high plunge and low pitch stiffness in the region where the aeroelastic system exhibits a bimodal <b>flutter</b> behavior, e. g., where the airfoil <b>flutter</b> and the plate <b>flutter</b> occur simultaneously. The predicted <b>flutter</b> behavior of a flexible airfoil is experimentally verified by conducting a series of systematic aeroelastic system configurations wind tunnel <b>flutter</b> campaigns. The experimental investigations provide, for each type of <b>flutter,</b> a measured <b>flutter</b> response, including the one with indicated bimodal behavio...|$|R
40|$|Emergence of <b>flutter</b> compromises {{not only}} the {{long-term}} durability of the wing structure, but also the operational safety, flight performance and energy efficiency of the aircraft. Effectual means of <b>flutter</b> prevention are, therefore, mandatory in the certification of new flight vehicles. This work intends to address the <b>flutter</b> phenomenon highlighting the above issues, and reviews {{some of the most}} recent theoretical and experimental developments in <b>flutter</b> analyses. In the following subsections, theoretical, computational and experimental <b>flutter</b> for composite structures is pursued. In particular, panel <b>flutter,</b> thrust-induced <b>flutter,</b> wing/store-type <b>flutter,</b> non-linear <b>flutter,</b> damaged panel <b>flutter,</b> <b>flutter</b> in compressed flow and <b>flutter</b> control via neural networks are covered. Effects of fibre/ply orientation on <b>flutter</b> are also briefly covered. The review further looks into aerothermoelastic behaviour of composite structures buckling problem and hopf bifurcation point determination. Analysed <b>flutter</b> of actively/passively controlled composite structures is critically reviewed due to the emphasized importance in modern structures. It is appreciable that the knowledge gained from the study of flexible structures and unsteady airflows in aircraft can be transitioned back to more traditional <b>flutter</b> studies. It is hoped that this review work will stimulate research and collaborations that will lead to significant progress in the understanding of this dynamically rich and potentially important area of enhancement of <b>flutter</b> prediction, suppression and control of active and passive composite aircraft structures.

5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating <b>fluttering</b> butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to a dozen or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E
5|$|Male masked shrikes sing from perches {{in their}} territories from early April, {{sometimes}} chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male's courtship display, usually accompanied by singing, {{starts with the}} bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and {{is followed by the}} shrike stepping down its branch and bowing, either on the move or while temporarily halted. The male may also give a <b>fluttering,</b> zigzagging flight display. The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and bowing on the move appear to be confined to this species.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid <b>fluttering</b> or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. This method of feeding flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae storm petrels however. Northern storm petrels also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Studies were {{performed}} using bipolar atrial wire electrodes to record atrial electrograms and to pace the atria in 27 patients who developed atrial <b>flutter</b> after open heart surgery. Two types of atrial <b>flutter,</b> classic or type I atrial <b>flutter,</b> and type II atrial <b>flutter,</b> were identified. Both types of atrial <b>flutter</b> {{were characterized by}} uniformity of the beat-to-beat atrial cycle length, morphology, polarity, and amplitude of the recorded bipolar atrial electrogram. Both types sometimes manifested a beat-to-beat electrical alternans, which in turn was sometimes associated with an alternans in beat-to-beat cycle length. The initial basis of separation of types I and II atrial <b>flutter</b> was that type I atrial <b>flutter</b> was always influenced by rapid atrial pac-ing from the high right atrium, and type II atrial <b>flutter</b> was not. Two additional observations suggested that types I and II atrial <b>flutter</b> were different, although related, rhythms: 1) In four patients, type II atrial <b>flutter</b> was present after termination of rapid atrial pacing used to treat type I atrial flutter; 2) in two patients, type II atrial <b>flutter</b> changed to type I atrial <b>flutter</b> in a one-step fashion. The range of rates of {{the two types of}} atrial <b>flutter</b> were also different type I atrial <b>flutter</b> was slower (range 240 - 338 beats/min) than type II (range 340 - 433 beats/min). We concluded that type II atrial <b>flutter</b> is a distinct rhythm which may be intermediate between classic, or type I, atrial <b>flutter</b> and atrial fibrillation.

5|$|The European {{storm petrel}}, British storm petrel or just storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) is a seabird in the {{northern}} storm petrel family, Hydrobatidae. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Hydrobates. The small, square-tailed bird is entirely black except for a broad white rump and a white band on the underwings, and it has a <b>fluttering,</b> bat-like flight. The large majority of the population breeds on islands off the coasts of Europe, with the greatest numbers in the Faroe Islands, United Kingdom, Ireland and Iceland. The Mediterranean population is a separate subspecies, but is inseparable at sea from its Atlantic relatives; its strongholds are Filfla Island (Malta), Sicily and the Balearic Islands.|$|E
5|$|The adult has {{two pairs}} of long, narrow, multiveined, {{translucent}} wings and a long, slender abdomen. Although they somewhat resemble dragonflies or damselflies, they belong to a different infraclass of winged insects. Antlion adults are easily distinguished from damselflies by their prominent, apically clubbed antennae which are {{about as long as}} the head and thorax combined. Also, the pattern of wing venation differs, and compared to damselflies, the adults are very feeble fliers and are normally found <b>fluttering</b> about at night in search of a mate. Adult antlions are typically nocturnal, and rarely seen by day.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with <b>fluttering</b> {{interspersed}} with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not {{look as if they}} are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E
40|$|Stall <b>flutter</b> is an {{aeroelastic}} phenomenon resulting in unwanted oscillatory loads on the blade, such as wind turbine blade, helicopter rotor blade, and other flexible wing blades. Although the stall <b>flutter</b> and related aeroelastic control {{have been studied}} theoretically and experimentally, microtab control of asymmetric limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) in stall <b>flutter</b> cases has not been generally investigated. This paper presents an aeroservoelastic model to study the microtab control of the blade section undergoing moderate stall <b>flutter</b> and deep stall <b>flutter</b> separately. The effects of different dynamic stall conditions and the consequent asymmetric LCOs for both stall cases are simulated and analyzed. Then, {{for the design of}} the stall <b>flutter</b> controller, the potential sensor signal for the stall <b>flutter,</b> the microtab control capability of the stall <b>flutter,</b> and the control algorithm for the stall <b>flutter</b> are studied.

Open-loop <b>flutter</b> test results agreed well with predictions from classical <b>flutter</b> theory, and gentle low speed <b>flutter</b> was demonstrated. Closed-loop wind tunnel testing using a linear quadratic Gaussian controller proved that <b>flutter</b> could be suppressed successfully, allowing the <b>flutter</b> boundary of the model to be increased significantly. <b>Flutter</b> suppression was demonstrated up to a speed 54 m/s, an increase of 116...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{predictions}} for very large {{wind turbine blades}} have indicated that <b>flutter</b> may be a significant concern.

Previous <b>flutter</b> predictions were performed with a NASTRAN based <b>flutter</b> prediction tool that was originally developed for vertical-axis wind turbine blades.

5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and <b>fluttering,</b> especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E
5|$|Breeding is {{normally}} from late May to August, {{but may be}} significantly earlier in northwest Africa or western Pakistan. Returning males arrive about {{two weeks before the}} females and establish territories which they patrol with wings held in a V-shape and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Fights may take place in flight or on the ground. The male's display flight involves a similar wing and tail position with frequent wing clapping as he follows the female in a rising spiral. If she lands, he continues to display with bobbing and <b>fluttering</b> until the female spreads her wings and tail for copulation. Mating occasionally takes place on a raised perch instead of the ground. In good habitat, there may be 20pairs per square kilometre (50per square mile).|$|E
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, <b>fluttering</b> their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E

40|$|Background: Right atrial <b>flutter</b> {{cycle length}} can prolong in the {{presence}} of antiarrhythmic drug therapy. We hypothesized that the cycle length of right atrial isthmus dependent <b>flutter</b> would correlate with right atrial cross-sectional area measurements. Methods: 60 patients who underwent ablation for electrophysiologically proven isthmus dependent right atrial <b>flutter,</b> who were not on Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic drugs and had recent 2 -dimensional echocardiographic data comprised the study group. Right atrial length and width were measured in the apical four chamber view. Cross-sectional area was estimated by multiplying the length and width. 35 patients had an atrial <b>flutter</b> rate ≥ 250 bpm (Normal <b>Flutter</b> Group) and 25 patients had an atrial <b>flutter</b> rate < 250 bpm (Slow <b>Flutter</b> Group). Results: Mean atrial <b>flutter</b> rate was 283 bpm in the normal <b>flutter</b> group and 227 bpm in the slow <b>flutter</b> group. Mean atrial <b>flutter</b> cycle length was 213 ms in the Normal <b>Flutter</b> Group and 265 ms in the Slow <b>Flutter</b> Group (p< 0. 0001). Mean right atrial cross sectional area was 1845 mm 2 in the Normal <b>Flutter</b> group and 2378 mm 2 in the Slow <b>Flutter</b> Group, (p< 0. 0001). Using linear regression, CSA {{was a significant predictor of}} cycle length (β = 0. 014 p = 0. 0045). For every 1 mm 2 increase in cross-sectional area, cycle length is 0. 014 ms longer. Conclusion: In the absence of antiarrhythmic medications, right atrial cross sectional area enlargement correlates with atrial <b>flutter</b> cycle length. These findings provide further evidence that historical rate-related definitions of typical isthmus dependent right atrial are not mechanistically valid...|$|R
