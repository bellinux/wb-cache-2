Ruggieri said that high rise-time pulses breaks down skin tissue, decreasing its resistance and increasing current through the body.

50|$|Another arena where {{consumer}} {{organizations have}} operated is food safety.

50|$|The {{owner of}} the mine, Mr. Shafer said that, ``If the mine is reopened, every safety {{precaution}} would be taken of course. Upon {{the recommendation of the}} state mine inspector, nothing but <b>electric</b> <b>safety</b> lamps would be used in the future.`` The mine then reopened on December 28, 1933, after a service was held four days earlier to remember and honor the men who died in the disaster exactly one year before and to commemorate the rescue mine workers who helped uncover the bodies of the men trapped in the mine. The mine started up with success and by March 7, 1934, 65 men were back working in the mine again. In that year, a new company owned by Glen Shafer from Pana, Springfield called the Erie Sootless Coal Company of Moweaqua opened the mine after the summer. It no coal was brought up after March 1935 and the shafts were officially closed in 1936, but were never sold. The mine faced lots of destruction from different people who would vandalize the site. The tipple was mostly torn down by June 1940 and the remaining pieces of the structure blew over due to harsh winds and ruined the engine room five months later. The mine was finally destroyed in October 1941 due to rotting wood in the timbers holding up the mine walls and ceiling and the shaft collapsed on itself creating a sink hole eighty feet wide.|$|E
5000|$|Gustave Trouvé next invented his “Photophore”, or {{battery-powered}} frontal headlamp, {{which he}} developed for a client, Dr Paul Hélot, an ear-nose-and throat specialist of Rouen. This wearable, direct shaft, lighting {{system could be}} oriented by head movements, so freeing the hands of its wearer. A file of correspondence between these two men enables one to place this invention during 1883. Trouvé soon modified their frontal headlamp both for use by miners, rescue workers, and later by speleologists, in dark surroundings, but also by tinting the light with various colors as theater jewelry for artiste troupes in Paris and Europe. The latter became known as “luminous electric jewels” and was the forerunner of today's wearable technology.In 1884, Trouvé fitted an electric boat with both electric horn and a bow-mounted frontal headlamp, the first time such electrical accessories had ever been fitted on any mode of transport. He developed a portable <b>electric</b> <b>safety</b> lamp. [...] In 1887, Trouvé, whose brand name was Eureka (Greek: εὕρηκα =“I have found”, translated into French “J’ai trouvé), developed his auxanoscope, an electric slide projector for itinerant teachers (1887).Around the same period, Trouvé, a confirmed bachelor uninterested in commercialization, turned his fertile mind skywards. Convinced that the future lay with heavier-the-air machines, he flew a tethered model electric helicopter, the ancestor of the Sikorsky Firefly. [...] He next built an ornithopter, the wings of which flapped using a rapid succession gun cartridges, enabling it to make a noisy {{but at the time}} unheard-of flight of 80 meters.|$|E
