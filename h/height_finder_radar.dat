25|$|This {{provided}} a practical detection range of 100 miles, {{just enough to}} cover the Hanoi urban area and the main MiG base at Phúc Yên. A major disadvantage of this arrangement, however, was that most MiG contacts were beyond the 70-mile range of the Big Eye's APS-45 <b>Height</b> <b>Finder</b> <b>radar,</b> so that they were unable to provide this crucial data to USAF strike forces. Furthermore, technical shortcomings in the EC-121D's systems precluded either controlling a fighter intercept or identifying a specific flight under attack.|$|E

Once these problems were solved, {{the first of}} twenty units in the continental United States became operational at Charleston, Maine, in 1963. The last unit was installed at Bellefontaine, Ohio, a year later. All AN/FPS-27 radars were installed at sites which had AN/FPS-6, AN/FPS-26, or AN/FPS-90 <b>height</b> <b>finder</b> <b>radars.</b> The 3-D functionality of the AN/FPS-27 was not available to the AN/FYQ-47 Common Digitizer {{for use in the}} Semi-Automated Ground Environment (SAGE) system.|$|R

50|$|Radar systems {{operated}} {{and maintained}} by the 689th included the FPS-24 search radar and the FPS-26A and FPS-90 <b>height</b> <b>finder</b> <b>radar.</b> The FPS-24 was housed in a 5 story tall (85 ft) building with two separate transmitters, a receiver, and special receiver equipment to provide counter measures against enemy jamming. In addition, the radar antenna was housed beneath a rigid radome about 145 ft in diameter and 100 ft tall. Three separate radomes were installed in the period from 1962 to 1965. All three were destroyed by high winds, the last in 1968. As a result, the FPS-24 was removed and a FPS-27 search radar requiring a much smaller radome was installed. Both <b>height</b> <b>finder</b> <b>radar</b> antennas were protected by smaller, inflatable radomes. Each <b>height</b> <b>finder</b> <b>radar</b> was installed in its own building. The FPS-26A radar was later modified beginning in 1967 to an FSS-7 Sea Launched Ballastic Missile (SLBM) detector. All three radar buildings were connected together so that 689th personnel could walk {{between them and the}} Operations building and be protected from adverse weather conditions.|$|E
50|$|A radar {{tower is}} a tower whose {{function}} is to support a radar facility, usually a local airport surveillance radar, and hence often at or {{in the vicinity of}} an airport or a military air base. In addition, radar towers are used for the installation and operation of search and <b>height</b> <b>finder</b> <b>radars</b> at military radar stations where the mission is to support air defense missions. These missions were characterized as Aircraft Control & Warning (AC&W) or Long Range Surveillance in support of the Semi-automatic Ground Environment (SAGE).|$|R

50|$|Primary {{radar systems}} at Mt Hebo AFS {{included}} the FPS-24 search radar, and the FPS-26A and FPS-90 <b>height</b> <b>finder</b> <b>radars.</b> The FPS-26A was modified between 1967 and 1970 into the FSS-7 Sea launched ballistic Missile (SLBM) sensor and tracking radar. When the third FPS-24 radome {{was destroyed in}} 1968, the FPS-24 was replaced by an FPS-27 search radar with a smaller radar antenna and radome. Connectivity to the SAGE system was through the FST-2B. Ground to air radio communications were provided in two ways. First was digital data sent to the aircraft (F-106) via the GKA-5 digital data link system's modified GRT-3 UHF radio. Second was voice communications using the sites analog single channel GRT-3 transmitters, GRR-7 receivers and GRC-27 multi-channel (transmit and receive capable) UHF radios. All radio equipment was located at the Ground-to-Air Transmitter Receiver (GATR) site. The largest building on the radar site was the 64 ft, 85 ft FPS-24 radar tower. Surrounding this tower was a Radome Support Structure with a 140 ft, 96 ft radome to protect the 85.5-ton FPS-24 antenna from snow, ice, and high winds.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Standard devices used by {{military}} personnel that may pose electromagnetic hazard include: radars, missile systems, radio navigation systems and radio transceivers. The {{aim of this}} study has been to evaluate the exposure of military personnel to electromagnetic fields. Material and Methods: Occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields was analyzed in the work environment of personnel of 204 devices divided into 5 groups (surface-to-air missile system radars, aircraft and helicopters, communication devices, surveillance and <b>height</b> <b>finder</b> <b>radars,</b> airport radars and radio navigation systems). Measurements were carried out at indicators, device terminals, radio panels, above vehicle seats, in vehicle hatches, by cabinets containing high power vacuum tubes and other transmitter components, by transmission lines, connectors, etc. Results: Portable radios emit the electric field strength between 20 – 80 V/m close to a human head. The manpack radio operator’s exposure is 60 – 120 V/m. Inside vehicles with high frequency/very high frequency (HF/VHF) band radios, the electric field strength is between 7 – 30 V/m and inside the radar cabin it ranges between 9 – 20 V/m. Most of the personnel on ships are not exposed to the electromagnetic field from their own radar systems but rather by accidental exposure from the radar systems of other ships. Operators of surface-to-air missile systems are exposed to the electric field strength between 7 – 15 V/m and the personnel of non-directional radio beacons – 100 – 150 V/m. Conclusions: In 57 % of military devices Polish soldiers work in the occupational protection zones. In 35 % of cases, soldiers work in intermediate and hazardous zones and in 22 % – only in the intermediate zone. In 43 % of devices, military personnel are not exposed to electromagnetic field.
