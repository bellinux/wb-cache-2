In Lines International, Justice Judith Prakash noted that were it the case that statutory bodies could not formulate policies or guidelines except through duly promulgated regulations, [...] "then everything would come to a grinding halt while policy decisions had to be communicated to the Attorney-General's Chambers, then drafted into regulations and then the drafts approved by the organisation concerned before being sent on to Parliament and effected by gazette notification.

Striker Teddy Sheringham gave the visitors a deserved lead, before Arsenal were awarded a penalty when Pirès was adjudged to have been fouled in the penalty area by Dejan Stefanović. Henry scored, and though their performance noticeably improved in the second half, the game ended in a draw. Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp complained about the penalty decision post-match and felt Pirès [...] "…was {{going to get a}} yellow card [...]" [...] The player himself denied accusations that he deceived the referee: [...] "I did not dive and I am not a cheat.

Brown, discussing the proposal through a spokesperson, {{said that he}} is [...] "opposed to higher taxes, especially {{in the midst of a}} severe recession". He also opposes it on the grounds that the tax would likely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher service and ATM fees. In September 2010, Brown opposed a Senate bill creating a $30 billion government fund aimed at encouraging lending to small businesses. The bill combines the fund with $12 billion in new tax breaks. Brown criticized the bill for including a provision much like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, stating: [...] "Banks making lending decisions with government funds <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to get our economy moving again." ...|$|E

An EP, 4 x 4, followed in March 1992 with [...] "This <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> Home" [...] released as a single in August.

They should welcome the creation of Reform and Conservative day schools and not see them as a threat to their own. In many communities, Orthodox day schools, or Orthodox-oriented community day schools, have large numbers of students from non-Orthodox families.

2500|$|In a {{briefing}} to the Board of Governors on this report in early September 2012, IAEA Deputy Director General Herman Nackaerts and Assistant Director General Rafael Grossi displayed satellite images for its member states which allegedly demonstrate Iranian efforts to remove incriminating evidence from its facility at Parchin, or a [...] "nuclear clean-up." [...] These images showed a building at Parchin covered in {{what appeared to}} be a pink tarpaulin, as well as demolition of building and removal of earth that the IAEA said would [...] "significantly hamper" [...] its investigation.

[...] There was similar ill-feeling between Trulli and Button after their collision on lap two.

Button defended his actions and suggested that Trulli had moved slightly towards him although he believed he took the right line. He also believed Trulli moved towards him under braking.|$|E

2500|$|Martin Horwood, MP for Cheltenham, Sandiford's {{most recent}} UK residence, {{expressed}} his shock at the sentence. [...] "The {{days of the}} death penalty ought to be past. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that a country that now values democracy and human rights should really be behaving." [...] The sentence was also condemned by the anti–death penalty charity Reprieve, which has taken up her case. The organisation's Harriet McCulloch said, [...] "She is clearly not a drug king pin - she has no money to pay for a lawyer, for the travel costs of defence witnesses or even for essentials like food and water. She has cooperated fully with the Indonesian authorities but has been sentenced to death while the gang operating in the UK, Thailand and Indonesia remain free to target other vulnerable people." [...] Tim Hancock, Campaigns Director of Amnesty International UK also criticised the sentence. [...] "It is extremely sad to hear that judges have decided to give Lindsay Sandiford a death sentence – {{despite the fact that the}} prosecution weren't even asking for it.

2500|$|His {{first article}} criticising {{practical}} Zionism, called [...] "Lo ze haderekh" [...] (This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way)</b> published in 1888 appeared in HaMelitz. In it, {{he wrote that}} the Land of Israel will not be capable of absorbing all of the Jewish Diaspora, not even a majority of them. [...] Ahad Ha'am also argued that establishing a [...] "national home" [...] in Zion will not solve the [...] "Jewish problem"; furthermore, the physical conditions in Eretz Yisrael will discourage Aliyah, and thus Hibbat Zion must educate and strengthen Zionist values among the Jewish people enough that they will want to settle the land despite the greatest difficulties. [...] The ideas in this article became the platform for Bnei Moshe Sor (sons of Moses), a group he founded that year. B'nei Moshe Sor, active until 1897, worked to improve Hebrew education, build up a wider audience for Hebrew literature, and assist the Jewish settlements. [...] Perhaps more significant was Derekh Kehayim (1889), Ha'am's attempt to launch a unique movement from a fundamentalist perspective incorporating {{all the elements of}} a national revival, but driven by force of intellect.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{time after}} the start of Gheorghe Tătărescu's premiership and Ion Inculeț's {{leadership}} of the Internal Affairs Ministry, repression of the Legion ceased, a measure which reflected Carol's hope to ensure a new period of stability. In 1936, during a youth congress in Târgu Mureș, Codreanu agreed to the formation of a permanent Death Squad, which immediately showed its goals with the killing of Mihai Stelescu by a group deemed Decemviri (led by Ion Caratănase), neutralizing the Crusades campaign of exposing the Guard's weaknesses, and silencing Stelescu's claims that Codreanu was hypocritical in his official display of ascetism, politically corrupt, uncultured, and a plagiarist. In 1936, Codreanu published an essay entitled [...] "The Resurrection of the Race", where he wrote:"I will under underline this once again: we are not up against a few pathetic individuals who have landed here by chance and who now seek protection and shelter. We are up against a fully-fledged Jewish state, an entire army which has come here with its sights set on conquest. The movement of the Jewish population and its penetration into Romania are being carried out in accordance with precise plans. In all probability, the 'Great Jewish Council' is planning {{the creation of a new}} Palestine on a strip of land, starting out on the Baltic Sea, embraces a part of Poland and Czechoslovakia and half of Romania right across to the Black Sea...The worse thing that Jews and politicians have done to us, the greatest danger that they have exposed our people to, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they are seizing the riches and possessions of our country, destroying the Romanian middle class, the way they swamp our schools and liberal professions, or the pernicious influence they are having on our whole political life, although these already constitute mortal dangers for a people. The greatest danger they pose to the people is rather that they are undermining us racially, that they are destroying the racial, Romano-Dacian structure of our people and call into being a type of human being that is nothing, but a racial wreck." [...] The year was also marked by the deaths and ostentatious funerals of Moța (by then, the movement's vice president) and Vasile Marin, who had volunteered on Francisco Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War and had been killed in the Majadahonda battle. Codreanu also published his autobiographical and ideological essay Pentru legionari ("For the Legionaries" [...] or [...] "For My Legionaries").|$|E
