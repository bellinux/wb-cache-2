5|$|<b>Discovery</b> {{procedures}} for defendants began with adoption of state {{laws in the}} 1920s. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures. In 1962, for example, the California Supreme Court ordered reciprocal <b>discovery</b> rules, without an initial law requiring it. However, a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system. Not only did both sides refuse to share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an unworkable position for both sides. In 1974, the California Supreme Court ordered the legislature to create the <b>discovery</b> system, ending the state's experiment with judicial <b>discovery</b> rule-making.|$|E

Because of {{the motion of the}} Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact <b>discovery</b> position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the <b>discovery</b> longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.|$|E

The first <b>discovery</b> of the element was claimed by the Soviet Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in 1968, followed in 1970 by the American University of California. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the <b>discovery</b> claims by the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party, resulting in credit for <b>discovery</b> being officially shared between both teams.

5|$|In 1610, Galileo Galilei {{discovered}} the four largest moons of Jupiter (now {{known as the}} Galilean moons) using a telescope; {{thought to be the}} first telescopic observation of moons other than Earth's. One day after Galileo, Simon Marius independently discovered moons around Jupiter, though he did not publish his <b>discovery</b> in a book until 1614. It was Marius's names for the four major moons, however, that stuck—Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. These findings were also the first <b>discovery</b> of celestial motion not apparently centered on Earth. The <b>discovery</b> was a major point in favor of Copernicus' heliocentric theory of the motions of the planets; Galileo's outspoken support of the Copernican theory placed him under the threat of the Inquisition.|$|E
