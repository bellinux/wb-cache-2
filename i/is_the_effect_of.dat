The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50µg, mostly in liver and kidneys and with about 8µg/L being dissolved in the blood. Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and therefore is normally not a part of human diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium. Insoluble salts of samarium are non-toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic.|$|E

25|$|A {{good example}} of the use of {{probability}} theory in equity trading <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices, which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole. An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commodity's prices up or down, and signals other traders of that opinion.

The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing, on policy, and on peace and conflict.|$|E

The theme of gender also touched off a feminist debate when it was first published, over depictions of the ambisexual Gethenians.|$|E
500|$|The {{animals are}} {{vulnerable}} to bushfires due to their slow movements and the flammability of eucalypt trees. The koala instinctively seeks refuge in the higher branches, where it is vulnerable to intense heat and flames. Bushfires also fragment the animal's habitat, which restricts their movement and leads to population decline and loss of genetic diversity. [...] Dehydration and overheating can also prove fatal. Consequently, the koala is vulnerable {{to the effects of}} climate change. Models of climate change in Australia predict warmer and drier climates, suggesting that the koala's range will shrink in the east and south to more mesic habitats. Droughts also affect the koala's well-being. For example, a severe drought in 1980 caused many Eucalyptus trees to lose their leaves. Subsequently, 63% of the population in southwestern Queensland died, especially young animals that were excluded from prime feeding sites by older, dominant koalas, and recovery of the population was slow. Later, this population declined from an estimated mean population of 59,000 in 1995 to 11,600 in 2009, a reduction attributed largely to hotter and drier conditions resulting from droughts in most years between 2002 and 2007. [...] Another predicted negative outcome of climate change <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> elevations in atmospheric [...] levels on the koala's food supply: increases in [...] cause Eucalyptus trees to reduce protein and increase tannin concentrations in their leaves, reducing the quality of the food source.|$|E
