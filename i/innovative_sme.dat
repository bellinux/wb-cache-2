40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore the process of {{strategic}} renewal implementation within an <b>innovative</b> <b>SME</b> operating in a growing industry, and the implications on its competitive advantage. In addition, the study seeks to identify the main causes of strategic renewal within this context.   Problem: Strategic researches have investigated to some point the process of strategic renewal, which has been widely recognized as critical for the sustained success of organizations. Even though there have been studies investigating strategic renewal {{and the need for}} it in today's competitive business environment, these publications have not dealt with the case of an <b>innovative</b> <b>SME</b> operating in a rapidly growing industry. Therefore, the authors of this thesis have identified a gap in the literature on the process of strategic renewal in that specific context. This created the incentive to explore how an <b>innovative</b> <b>SME</b> can drive and generate sustained competitive advantage to ensure its survival and further expansion in a competitive business environment.   Method: In order to fulfil the {{purpose of this}} qualitative research, an abductive approach that was based on a single case study was undertaken. This was an instrumental case study, thus the primary data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with representatives of the management of Infobric AB, where the phonomena of strategic renewal and sustained competitive advantage were explored.   Analysis: This research contributes to the academic field of strategy as it proposes a strategic renewal framework for innovative SMEs operating in rapidly growing industries. It aims to illustrate the necessity of this process to managers for sustaining or increasing their industry competitiveness. The authors suggest that the forces causing the urge for renewal process in an SME's strategy are both external and internal. It is also proposed that a strategic renewal implementation process occurs according to the following framework: recognition of threat/opportunity; evaluation; plan of action; implementation of renewal through new market entry; new product development; and new management system.   Conclusion: The conclusion of this research is that an <b>innovative</b> <b>SME</b> operating in a rapidly growing industry can gain sustained competitive advantage through strategic renewal implementation. The studied company Infobric AB is characterized as an <b>innovative</b> <b>SME</b> that is a market leader, flexible in their strategy, and responsive to environmental changes. Thus, the suggested strategic renewal framework is aimed to assist managers of companies that are characterized in the same manner and operate in fast developing and competitive business environments...|$|E

Based on a unique data set of <b>innovative</b> <b>SMEs</b> with default years of 2005 – 2008, we show that, although the value of the patent portfolio always reduces the PD, its dimension reduces the firm’s riskiness only if coupled with an appropriate equity level...|$|R

40|$|Purpose:  The {{aim is to}} try {{to build}} a model for {{measuring}} and assessing the simultaneous effect of the three components of the intellectual capital (IC) management on the growth of <b>innovative</b> <b>SMEs.</b> In this first stage of research, the model was tested in a representative sample of <b>innovative</b> <b>SMEs</b> from Galicia, where the performance construct was the cumulative growth measured in a three years period. Design/methodology/approach:  This empirical work has been designed with the aim of (1) selecting the best variables from each IC component (human capital-HC, structural capital-SC, relational capital-RC) at <b>innovative</b> <b>SMEs</b> for explaining cumulative growth; and (2) assessing how much the IC management at <b>innovative</b> <b>SMEs</b> could contribute to their growth. A structural equation model is developed and tested. It allows the identification of the key variables that <b>innovative</b> <b>SMEs</b> are encouraged to manage (17 variables in the current stage) for boosting their growth. Findings:  In the Galician case, HC is the basic, starting point for the SMEs’ growth. HC seems {{not to be able to}} directly influence on growth if not through SC and, in a very low degree, through RC. Thus, the key seems to be the SMEs’ capability for transforming valuable knowledge from the HC into organisational value (i. e., SC). Research limitations/implications:  The limited sample of 140 SMEs and the regional scope (Galician region) may limit the possibility for directly spreading findings. However, the double test developed (cumulative growth measured in two year and in three year period) and the improved overall goodness fit indexes, both allow pointing out to a future research where final variables can be set. Practical implications:  Results could allow SMEs practitioners a better understanding about variables of IC on which they ought to focus their management efforts. In the case of public decision-makers, outcomes could inform about the key aspects that they should improve for playing a more decisive role in the <b>innovative</b> efforts of <b>SMEs.</b> Originality/value:  The originality of this research could be twofold: the medium-term perspective for assessing impacts, and the inclusion of the agents from the system of innovation in the RC component. The latter has allowed assessing the contribution of the institutional system for supporting innovation in the case of SMEs. The former has allowed identifying cause-effect interactions among IC components to explain growth. </p...|$|R

Using data from the Community Innovation Survey on 2, 087 German {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs), we observe significant disparities at each stage of the innovation process. Whereas family SMEs have a higher propensity to invest in innovation at all, conditional on investing in innovation, these companies do so less intensively than their non-family counterparts. Family SMEs further tend to outperform non-family SMEs in terms of process innovation outcomes when controlling for innovation investment. Given the level of product and process innovation, however, family SMEs underperform regarding labor productivity in comparison to non-family SMEs. These findings complement previous empirical research by illustrating how the presence of a dominant family relates to innovation inputs and outputs of SMEs in Europe's largest economy and its <b>innovative</b> <b>SME</b> sector...|$|E
40|$|In {{my paper}} on "The {{financial}} {{system and its}} significance for the development and growth of <b>innovative</b> <b>SMEs</b> in the regional context" (presented at the ersa 97 conference) I investigated the process of financing <b>innovative</b> <b>SMEs</b> during their different phases of development and the impact financial institutions have on their growth {{over and above the}} pure provision of capital. I argued that a financial system has to consist of different types of actors able to deal with the different financial needs of <b>innovative</b> <b>SMEs</b> during their development phases and has to be characterised by well established networks between these actors to fulfil its capital providing function and that this function is inseparably connected with its supervising and resource creating powers which in turn have a major influence on the development and growth of <b>innovative</b> <b>SMEs</b> in the regional context. Based on the results of this previous work, additional theoretical and empirical studies, available secondary data and a survey of Austrian equity capital suppliers conducted by the author, the current paper analyses the specific Austrian situation: The capabilities of the financial system to support SMEs' growth and the potential effects recently implemented measures and initiatives to improve SMEs' access to financial resources could actually have. I will argue that the main obstacles to provide growth capital to <b>innovative</b> <b>SMEs</b> are caused by the Austrian financial system being strongly credit-based, the procedures used by Austrian banks to provide credits and above all the insufficient availability of equity-based financial instruments. Recently established initiatives and support programmes to activate equity capital markets are useful but they do not fully exhaust potentials available and they do not cover regional dimensions of the financing process, which are so essential in supporting SMEs growth. Therefore the paper will propose several new instruments, designed to close existing gaps and to cope with the drawbacks of the current situation, e. g. : Existing guarantee schemes should be supplemented by elements offering incentives for private Venture Capital Funds to provide more early stage financing. And Existing regional equity capital funds supplying public money should provide incentives for private funds to co-invest in young high-tech firms, thereby supporting the development of financial networks, which improve risk-sharing procedures and accelerate flows of information and know-how between financial actors. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} the orchestrating process of networks of independent small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). The existing literature on network orchestration is developed for large networks with a dominant hub firm managing up to 500 members. We argue that SME networks need a somewhat different approach to orchestration. We find the literature on communities of practice appropriate to that aim. The empirical base is a longitudinal study {{of the development of}} HealthInnovation, a regional network of independent SMEs. Originally, the network emerged as “a good idea” in the regional university, but it soon proved to be poorly rooted in the regional industry and in the public sector. Nonetheless, as a result of intensive orchestration, it has become a dynamic and innovative network with several important results: two new firms, several new research and innovation projects, {{and the development of a}} new subject at the university. In this study, we ask: What are the processes of successfully orchestrating <b>innovative</b> <b>SME</b> networks?

40|$|Local {{innovation}} {{networks have}} been considered to be particularly important to innovation and technological change and to the growth prospects of regions and cities in Germany. Accordingly, innovation {{is a process that}} results from various (economic and social) interactions of different institutions located in a given region. Consequently, when analysing the local (or regional) innovation system, one should not only investigate the (horizontal and vertical) relations among firms but also the contacts with universities and other research institutions. Furthermore, the role of government agencies and interest groups that provide financial support as well as commercial and technical information should also be taken into account {{in the context of the}} regional innovation system. However, the review of relevant theoretical and empirical investigations related to the German experience shows that such innovation and R&D cooperation networks appear to be less significant than expected. In particular those high-tech firms in small-sized German cities have a direct access to the international innovation network, which quite often has made a more crucial contribution to their business performances than the regional and national ones have done. In general various regional technology policy measures adopted in German states (provision of research infrastructure, establishment of technology centres, <b>innovative</b> <b>SME</b> support programmes, etc.) have been more successful in already economically better-off large cities but failed to establish a significant intra-technological cooperation among partners in the rather less-developed areas which lack sufficient know-how, a socio-cultural and institutional infrastructure and a certain degree of entrepreneurial tradition.
