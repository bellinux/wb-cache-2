The melting point of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons.

5|$|Chemically, {{actinium}} {{is similar}} to lanthanum, which <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E

5|$|Cheddar is {{recognised}} as a village. The adjacent {{settlement of}} Axbridge, although {{only about a}} third the population of Cheddar, is a town.

While Axbridge grew in importance as a centre for cloth manufacturing in the Tudor period and gained a charter from King John, Cheddar remained a more dispersed mining and dairy-farming village. Its population grew {{with the arrival of the}} railways in the Victorian era and the advent of tourism.|$|E
5|$|Cooperativity is {{observed}} when two synapses are activated by weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging {{does not explain}} how multiple weak stimuli can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to schizophrenia <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E

Pyramid Head is also seen {{controlling}} the carousel where Heather and Alessa face off against each other, then it kills the cult leader Claudia Wolf after the amulet shows her inner, monstrous nature.|$|E
5|$|Like the lanthanides, all {{actinides}} {{are highly}} reactive with halogens and chalcogens; however, the actinides react more easily. Actinides, {{especially those with}} {{a small number of}} 5f-electrons, are prone to hybridization. This <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the similarity of the electron energies at the 5f, 7s and 6d shells. Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides.|$|E
5|$|Solid xenon {{changes from}} face-centered cubic (fcc) to {{hexagonal}} close packed (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155GPa. When metallized, xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is unusual for a metal and <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state.|$|E

A total of 33 % {{of the variance in}} self-defeating patterns <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> attachment anxiety and avoidance; 39 % of the variance in self-esteem and 13 % of the variance in social self-efficacy <b>were</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> self-defeating patterns and/or attachment anxiety; 50 % of the variance in depression <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> attachment anxiety, self-defeating patterns, and self-esteem; 45 % of the variance in interpersonal distress <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> attachment anxiety and avoidance, self-defeating patterns, and social self-efficacy...|$|R
5|$|The name Efa first appears during Roman rule, {{some time}} {{after the end of}} the 1st century, when a Roman {{fortress}} and small Jewish settlement were established not far from Tel Shikmona. Haifa is also mentioned more than 100 times in the Talmud, a work central to Judaism. Hefa or Hepha in Eusebius of Caesarea's 4th-century work, Onomasticon (Onom. 108, 31), is said to be another name for Sycaminus. This synonymizing of the names <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> Moshe Sharon, who writes that the twin ancient settlements, which he calls Haifa-Sycaminon, gradually expanded into one another, becoming a twin city known by the Greek names Sycaminon or Sycaminos Polis. References to this city end with the Byzantine period.|$|E
5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries manorial homes, {{including}} Cranham Hall, became attractive {{properties for}} merchants from the City of London. Initial attempts {{to expand the}} suburban estates from Upminster in the early 20th century ran into problems {{because of the lack}} of water supply. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. In the 1930s land was used to develop some council housing and following the sale of the Benyon estate the pace of new building quickened. Cranham's location on the very edge of London's urban sprawl <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the halting effect on suburban house building of the introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt and World War II. Thereafter building took place within the area bounded by the Southend Arterial Road in the north and St Mary's Lane in the south; and there were 615 council houses built by 1971.|$|E
40|$|The authors use the {{techniques}} of decomposition analysis to explain differences in survival rates between different groups of 1 st year undergraduate students at the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland and explain {{how much of the}} overall inequality in survival rates can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> inequality within groups and how much can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> inequality between groups. They find that 45. 1 % of the observed difference of 8. 2 points in survival rates between female and male students can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> gender whereas only 1. 4 % of the observed difference of 7. 4 points in survival rates between Protestant and Catholic students only 1. 4 % can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> religion. Therefore, attribute differences <b>are</b> important in <b>explaining</b> differences in survival rates between males and females, but not between Protestants and Catholics. When looking at how much of the overall inequality in survival rates could <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> inequality within groups and how much by inequality between groups; they find that the best explanation for the observed inequality in the distribution of survival probabilities was given by the type of course studied accounting for nearly 2 / 3 of the inequality between students. ...|$|R

5|$|The best-known {{feature of}} the Church of Christ Pantocrator is the rich and {{colourful}} decoration of its exterior walls. The most lavishly decorated part {{of the church is}} the east side with the apse, and as a whole all sides of the church exhibit different ornamentation. Interchanging strips of three or four rows of bricks and carved stones, which create an optical pattern, are the most basic type of decoration used. Rows of blind arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics and brick swastika friezes run along the east wall. Ousterhout likens the appearance of the church's superimposed arcades to an aqueduct; an earlier example of that configuration can be observed in the Cappadocian church of Çanlı Kilise near Aksaray, Turkey. The inclusion of swastikas in the decoration is considered unusual and curious to tourists. It <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the medieval use of the swastika {{as a symbol of the}} Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the badnjak <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the events {{surrounding}} the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According to the Gospel of Luke , Mary Theotokos gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. By Holy Tradition, the manger was located in a cave near that town. An angel of the Lord appeared {{to a group of}} shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night in that region, and told them that the Savior was born at Bethlehem. They went there and found the baby lying in the manger, as the angel described to them. By folk tradition, the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} stable {{value of the}} currency in the 1990s compared to the 1980s <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> Peter D. Little in Somalia: Economy without a State as resulting {{from the lack of}} a central government printing currency to pay for civil and military expenditures. Traders avoid the need to carry large amounts of Somali shillings by converting them to U.S. dollars and then wiring them to money houses in Somalia. Because identification can be easily forged, those seeking to pick up wired money are required to answer questions about their clan and kinship relations. Private remittance companies known as hawala assist in the transfer of money. One of the largest such companies, Al Barakaat, was shut down in 2001 by a U.S.-led initiative due to alleged terrorist ties; the company's communications business, with more than 40,000 subscribers, was also shut down.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of antimony is characteristic of a nonmetal. Antimony has some definite cationic chemistry, SbO+ and Sb(OH)2+ being present in acidic aqueous solution; the compound Sb8(GaCl4)2, which contains the homopolycation, Sb82+, was prepared in 2004. It can form alloys {{with one or more}} metals such as aluminium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, lead and bismuth. Antimony has fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. Like arsenic, antimony generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. The +5 state is less stable than the +3, but relatively easier to attain than with arsenic. This <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the poor shielding afforded the arsenic nucleus by its 3d10 electrons. In comparison, the tendency of antimony (being a heavier atom) to oxidize more easily partially offsets the effect of its 4d10 shell. Tripositive antimony is amphoteric; pentapositive antimony is (predominately) acidic. Consistent with an increase in metallic character down group 15, antimony forms salts or salt-like compounds including a nitrate Sb(NO3)3, phosphate SbPO4, sulfate Sb2(SO4)3 and perchlorate Sb(ClO4)3. The otherwise acidic pentoxide Sb2O5 shows some basic (metallic) behaviour in that it can be dissolved in very acidic solutions, with the formation of the oxycation SbO. The oxide Sb2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Antimony has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoantimony chemistry).|$|E
5|$|The great {{rarity of}} the proton-rich 136Ce and 138Ce <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that}} they cannot be made in the most common {{processes}} of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron, the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture). This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called p-nuclei, and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration. 140Ce is the most common isotope of cerium, as it can be produced in both the s- and r-processes, while 142Ce can only be produced in the r-process. Another reason for the abundance of 140Ce {{is that it is a}} magic nucleus, having a closed neutron shell (it has 82 neutrons), and hence it has a very low cross-section towards further neutron capture. Although its proton number of 58 is not magic, it is granted additional stability, as its eight additional protons past the magic number 50 enter and complete the 1g7/2 proton orbital. The abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources, because 138Ce and 140Ce are the daughters of the long-lived primordial radionuclides 138La and 144Nd, respectively.|$|E
