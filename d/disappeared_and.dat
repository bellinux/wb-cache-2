5|$|A book by Van der Sloot and {{reporter}} Zvezdana Vukojevic, De zaak Natalee Holloway (The Case of Natalee Holloway) {{was published}} in Dutch in April 2007. In the book, Van der Sloot gives his perspective of the night Holloway <b>disappeared</b> <b>and</b> the media frenzy that followed. He admits and apologizes for his initial untruths, but maintains his innocence.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: tarsometatarsus. The {{third and}} most {{conspicuous}} {{portion of the}} bird's leg, from which the toes spring; the foot. In birds, the true tarsus has disappeared, with the proximal tarsals having fused with the tibia, the centralia having <b>disappeared,</b> <b>and</b> the distal bones having fused with the metatarsals to form a single tarsometatarsus bone, effectively giving the leg a third segment.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 15th century central English {{authority}} in Ireland had all but <b>disappeared</b> <b>and</b> a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as The Pale, and under the provisions of Poynings' Law of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the attacks, some news reports mistakenly reported Shehri as a trained pilot and son of a Saudi diplomat, who was still alive and well. The Shehri family in Khamis Mushait spoke to the media, denying those early reports, saying that the Shehri brothers had <b>disappeared</b> <b>and</b> have not been heard from since.|$|E
5|$|New villages appeared, {{consisting}} of timber houses built {{side by side}} in equal parcels of land. For instance, the scarcely inhabited forests of the Western Carpathians (in present-day Slovakia) developed a network of settlements under Béla IV. Huts <b>disappeared,</b> <b>and</b> new rural houses {{consisting of}} a living room, a kitchen and a pantry were built. The most advanced agricultural techniques, including asymmetric heavy ploughs, also spread throughout the kingdom.|$|E

50|$|Troxler's fading, {{discovered}} by Troxler in 1804, {{is a very}} similar phenomenon in which an object away from one's focus of attention <b>disappears</b> <b>and</b> reappears irregularly. There is no necessity for a moving background for this illusion to occur. Other similar phenomena in which salient stimuli <b>disappear</b> <b>and</b> reappear include binocular rivalry, discovered as early as 1593, monocular rivalry, and flash suppression.|$|R

5|$|According to the Barcoor Manuscript, {{written in}} Kannada by a Mangalorean Catholic from Barcoor {{after his return}} from Seringapatam, 20,000 of them (one-third) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill {{treatment}} by the soldiers. At the camp at Jamalabad fort, Mangalorean Catholic leaders were thrown down from the fort. All Christian churches in South Canara, except the Hospet Church at Hospet and the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet, were razed {{to the ground and}} all land owned by the captured Christians was taken over by Tipu and distributed among his favourites. After they were freed, all their belongings had <b>disappeared</b> <b>and</b> their deserted lands were cultivated by the Bunts.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century wore on, workhouses {{increasingly}} became refuges for the elderly, infirm {{and sick}} {{rather than the}} able-bodied poor, and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals. Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions {{under the control of}} local authorities. It was not until the National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last vestiges of the Poor Law <b>disappeared,</b> <b>and</b> with them the workhouses.|$|E

5|$|By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves <b>disappeared</b> <b>and</b> {{sides were}} cut away and tightened. With the {{development}} of new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the album's release in late August 1994, Edwards was hospitalised at the private Priory Hospital in Roehampton. He rejoined the band to tour during the autumn of 1994. Other band members felt that his {{drinking}} was under control at this point, but his eating continued to be a problem and he continued to self-harm. On 1 February 1995, he <b>disappeared</b> <b>and</b> is presumed to have committed suicide. His car was found close to the Severn Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Except for chemicals, {{all of the}} old {{industries}} have <b>disappeared</b> <b>and</b> there has been diversification, in particular because of the close links to the motorway system {{and the development of}} warehousing and distribution centres. A new town was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and areas of private housing have been established farther to the east; this has resulted in the population more than doubling from around 26,000 to its present level of 70,000.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Walter Lowenfels jokingly {{suggested}} that Aldington should {{produce a new}} Imagist anthology. Aldington, by now a successful novelist, took up the suggestion and {{enlisted the help of}} Ford and H.D. The result was the Imagist Anthology 1930, edited by Aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell, who had died, Cannell, who had <b>disappeared,</b> <b>and</b> Pound, who declined. The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the Imagists in the history of 20th-century poetry.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 Pracheachon's spokesperson, Non Suon, criticized Sihanouk {{for failing}} to tackle inflation, unemployment, and {{corruption}} in the country. Non Suon's criticisms gave Sihanouk the impetus to arrest Pracheachon leaders, and according to him, he had discovered plans by their party to monitor local political developments on behalf of foreign powers. In May 1962 Tou Samouth, Pracheachon's secretary-general, <b>disappeared,</b> <b>and</b> its ideological ally, the Communist Party of Kampuchea, suspected that Samouth had been secretly captured and killed by police. However, Sihanouk allowed Sangkum's left-wing politicians to run again in the 1962 general elections, which they all won. He even appointed two left-wing politicians, Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan, as secretaries for planning and commerce, respectively, after the election.|$|E

5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 years ago as the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes <b>disappeared</b> <b>and</b> the region became {{increasingly}} arid.

Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E

However, Christin has written a 270-page Valérian and Laureline novel, Valérian et Laureline: Lininil a disparu (Valérian and Laureline: Lininil Has <b>Disappeared),</b> <b>and</b> indicated that Valérian and Laureline will continue to live on in a yet unspecified form.|$|E
5|$|Political {{and social}} trends {{of the late}} 1970s shifted away from the early 1970s hippie attitudes that had led to the genre's {{development}} and popularity. The rise in punk cynicism made the utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of purchasing quality instruments and the time investment of learning to play them were seen as barriers to rock's energy and immediacy. There were also changes in the music industry, as record companies <b>disappeared</b> <b>and</b> merged into large media conglomerates. Promoting and developing experimental music {{was not part of}} the marketing strategy for these large corporations, who focused their attention on identifying and targeting profitable market niches.|$|E
