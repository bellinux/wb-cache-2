At the same time, since the portion of UBS's operating income denominated in foreign currencies {{is greater than the}} portion of operating expenses so denominated, the UBS was also adversely affected, with further implications emanating from changes <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> as applied to equity and capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> between two countries, the forward exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the forward rate is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting the interest rate differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or discount is calculated.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an actual}} loan, the US$25 per basis point is earned or lost {{at the end}} of the three-month loan, not up front. That means that the profit or loss per 0.01% change <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> as of the start date of the loan (i.e., its present value) is less than US$25. Moreover, the present value change per 0.01% change <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is higher <b>in</b> low <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> environments and lower <b>in</b> high <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> environments. This is to say that an actual loan has convexity. A Eurodollar future pays US$25 per 0.01% change <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> no matter what the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> environment, which means it does not have convexity. This is one reason that Eurodollar futures are not a perfect proxy for {{expected}} <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> This difference can be adjusted for by reference to the implied volatility of options on Eurodollar futures.|$|R
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Panel “A” of Tables  7 and 8 that {{conventional}} index (KSE- 100) is significantly affected by the changes <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and exchange rate. The estimated parameters for exchange <b>rate</b> and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> are 0.659 and 0.0033, respectively. This result fits well with stock valuation model that argues that discounted present values of a firm’s future cash flows are represented in stock prices. The stock prices usually reduce with an increase <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and eventually the returns. Therefore, it can be safely said that changes <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is a major factor behind the instability of conventional stock index and, accordingly, investors are also more sensitive towards fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> Perhaps, the conventional stock market must be stabilized by the government by controlling <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> This finding is consistent with the study Yusof and Majid (2007) who document that Malaysian conventional market is affected by higher <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R

Furthermore, interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of ABS, which can affect yields. Home equity loans {{tend to be the}} most sensitive to changes <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> while auto loans, student loans, and credit cards are generally less sensitive to interest rates.|$|E

25|$|Adjustable rate {{mortgages}} are typically, but not always, {{less expensive}} than fixed-rate mortgages.

25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 1980s, the yen failed to rise in value even though current account {{surpluses}} returned and grew quickly. From ¥221 in 1981, the average value of the yen actually dropped to ¥239 in 1985. The rise in the current account surplus generated stronger demand for yen in foreign-exchange markets, but this trade-related demand for yen was offset by other factors. A wide differential <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> with United States interest rates much higher than those in Japan, and the continuing moves to deregulate the international flow of capital, led to a large net outflow of capital from Japan. This capital flow increased the supply of yen in foreign-exchange markets, as Japanese investors changed their yen for other currencies (mainly dollars) to invest overseas. This kept the yen weak relative to the dollar and fostered the rapid rise in the Japanese trade surplus that took place in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|More than 6000 {{occupational}} schemes were {{in place}} in the UK in 2015, of which over 5000 were in deficit. The total shortfall of the schemes was over 360 billion pounds as of February 2015. A large number of UK employers offer their employees access to a defined benefit occupational pension scheme, often based on final salary. In such an arrangement, the employee was typically promised a pension of a fixed proportion of their salary in the period leading up to retirement. The proportion would depend on the number of years of service with the employer. Post retirement increases are typically partly discretionary. The amounts payable are restricted by taxation rules, the maximum being typically either a pension of one-sixtieth of final salary for each year of membership or a pension of one-eightieth of their salary per year of membership plus a tax free lump sum of three-eightieths. With increases in longevity and reductions <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> such arrangements were becoming progressively unaffordable. So following a review by a Pensions Commission, to get a given income, the length it is necessary to pay into a pension in the public sector is linked to longevity.|$|E
