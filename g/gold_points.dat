6000|$|If Anne of Austria, {{the mother}} of Louis XIV., was a bibliophile, she may be {{suspected}} of acting on the motive, [...] "Love me, love my books." [...] About her affection for Cardinal Mazarin {{there seems to be}} no doubt: the Cardinal had a famous library, and his royal friend probably imitated his tastes. In her time, and on her volumes, the originality and taste of the skilled binder, Le Gascon, begin to declare themselves. The fashionable passion for lace, to which La Fontaine made such sacrifices, affected the art of book decorations, and Le Gascon's beautiful patterns of <b>gold</b> <b>points</b> and dots are copies of the productions of Venice. The Queen-Mother's books include many devotional treatises, for, whatever other fashions might come and go, piety was always constant before the Revolution. Anne of Austria seems to have been particularly fond of the lives and works of Saint Theresa, and Saint Francois de Sales, and John of the Cross. But she was not unread in the old French poets, such as Coquillart; she condescended to Ariosto; she had that dubious character, Theophile de Viaud, beautifully bound; she owned the Rabelais of 1553; and, what is particularly interesting, M. de Lignerolles possesses her copy of 'L'Eschole des Femmes, Comedie par J. B. P. Moliere. Paris: Guillaume de Luynes, 1663.' In 12 [degree sign], red morocco, gilt edges, and the Queen's arms on the covers. This relic is especially valuable when we remember that 'L'Ecole des Femmes' and Arnolphe's sermon to Agnes, and his comic threats of future punishment first made envy take the form of religious persecution. The devout Queen-Mother was often appealed to by the enemies of Moliere, yet Anne of Austria had not only seen his comedy, but possessed this beautiful example of the first edition. M. Paul Lacroix supposes that this copy was offered to the Queen-Mother by Moliere himself. The frontispiece (Arnolphe preaching to Agnes) is thought to be a portrait of Moliere, but in the reproduction in M. Louis Lacour's edition it is not easy to see any resemblance. Apparently Anne did not share the views, even in her later years, of the converted Prince de Conty, for several comedies and novels remain stamped with her arms and device.|$|E

Conversely, if the exchange rate fell below the lower limit of the determined rate, countries would find it cheaper to import gold than to sell bills to foreign creditors.|$|E
40|$|We report first-principles {{calculations}} of the inelastic current-voltage (I-V) {{characteristics of a}} <b>gold</b> <b>point</b> contact and a molecular junction in the nonresonant regime.

Due to the quasi-one-dimensional nature of these systems, specific modes with large longitudinal component dominate the inelastic I-V curves. In {{the case of the}} <b>gold</b> <b>point</b> contact, our results are in good agreement with recent experimental data. For the molecular junction, we find that the inelastic I-V curves are quite sensitive to the structure of the contact between the molecule and the electrodes thus providing a powerful tool to extract the bonding geometry in molecular wires.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of silver through quartz at high temperatures leads to {{contamination of the}} platinum sensing element of high temperature platinum resistance thermometers. While some protection of the PRT element may be afforded by the application of appropriate electric fields, the contamination of the quartz elements of silver fixed points causes their premature failure. Contamination {{is evidenced by the}} yellowish colour imparted to the glass by the silver particles growing within the quartz glass matrix. The presence of silver as the contaminating element has been confirmed unambiguously through energy dispersive x-ray analysis and secondary ion mass spectrometry. To mitigate the risk of silver contamination, the <b>gold</b> <b>point</b> is proposed as an alternative calibration point. PRT resistance ratios measured at the freezing points of silver and gold in different laboratories at different times are highly correlated. This suggests that the ITS- 90 reference function might be extrapolated to 1064. 18 0 C (the <b>gold</b> fixed <b>point).</b> However, it remains unclear from the gold and silver PRT resistance ratios from the literature whether extrapolation of the reference function leads to the correct value at the <b>gold</b> <b>point.</b> A direct comparison of <b>gold</b> fixed <b>points</b> may be required to resolve the inconsistencies. Additional PRT data may help resolve the discrepancy. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
