5|$|In 1901, {{the ship}} {{exchanged}} 16 of her 47mm <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> {{an equal number}} of QF 12 pounder 12 cwt guns. This raised the number of crewmen to 652 and later to 741.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{was also}} {{equipped}} with four twin 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy {{had called for}} two anti-aircraft <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> the O'Brien-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines. From sources, it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for O'Brien {{or any of the}} other ships of the class.|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom only {{deployed}} this <b>gun</b> <b>for</b> coast defence, {{and soon}} discarded it {{in favour of}} the similar QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss <b>gun</b> <b>for</b> both coast defence and naval use.|$|R

5|$|Some Canadian and British {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} temporarily equipped with M7 Priest self-propelled <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> the D-Day landings, {{which had been}} replaced by towed 25-Pounder field guns. Simonds had the Priests converted into Kangaroo Armoured Personnel Carriers, which would allow infantry to follow the tanks closely on any terrain. Permission was first requested from the Americans, from whom the M7s had been borrowed, to convert them into APCs.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began with}} the French army outnumbered. Napoleon had some 72,000 men and 157 <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> the {{impending}} battle, with about 7,000 troops under Davout still far to {{the south in the}} direction of Vienna. The Allies had about 85,000 soldiers, seventy percent of them Russian, and 318 guns.|$|E
5|$|The similar Dardanelles <b>Guns</b> (<b>for</b> the location) {{were created}} by Munir Ali in 1464 and were still in use during the Anglo-Turkish War (1807–09). These were cast in bronze into two parts, the chase (the barrel) and the breech, which {{combined}} weighed 18.4tonnes. The two parts were screwed together using levers to facilitate moving it.|$|E

5|$|Voss scored rapidly during February and March 1917; of the 15 {{victories}} {{credited to}} his jasta (squadron) during March, 11 fell under his <b>guns.</b> <b>For</b> his feats, {{he was awarded}} the Knight's Cross with Swords of the House Order of Hohenzollern on 17 March. The following day, Voss downed two British aircraft in ten minutes. The first one burned; the second aircrew downed protested they had been strafed by Voss after crashlanding within German lines.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{artillery}} guns were deployed, including heavier weapons, such as cannons, culverins and demi-cannons, and smaller pieces such as sakers, minions and falcons. Some older <b>guns,</b> <b>for</b> example slings and bases, were also deployed, but were less effective than newer weapons {{such as the}} culverin. With sites equipped with several tiers of weapons, the heaviest guns would typically be placed higher up in the fortification, with the smaller weapons closer to the ground. It is uncertain how far the guns of the period would have reached; analysis {{carried out in the}} 16th and 17th century on the ranges of artillery suggested that the largest weapons, such as a culverin, could hit a target up to between 1,600 and 2,743 metres (5,200ft and 8,999ft) away.|$|E
5|$|Between 1761 and 1790, 14-15 turumas were built, {{including}} Amphion, {{a modified}} version used by King Gustav III as both a pleasure craft and command ship. The turuma was among the heaviest in the arsenal of the archipelago fleet {{and a number of}} them served in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90. It had three masts, two decks and was equipped with 16–22 pairs of oars along with a crew of about 220–260. Its length was 35–39m, width 9m and the draft 3,3m. The armament consisted of 24–28 heavy guns with up to 24 swivel <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> close-quarter combat.|$|E

5|$|In early 1916, the {{battalion}} sailed to Alexandria on the Empress of Britain. From Alexandria, it travelled by train to bivouac at Tall al Kabir. At this time, {{the battalion}} received 367 reinforcements from Australia before undertaking defensive duties around Gebel Habieta, guarding the Suez Canal. In February, the AIF was re-organised and expanded. This saw the veteran battalions split to provide cadres for new battalions {{and as a}} part of this process, the 15th Battalion provided personnel to the 51st Battalion, by transferring the even numbered sections to the new battalion. At this time, the battalion received four Lewis <b>Guns</b> <b>for</b> organic direct fire support.|$|E
5|$|It was {{to prove}} this revolutionary {{technology}} that Dreadnought was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, {{and was the first}} large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the wings, giving her at her launch twice the broadside of any other warship. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76mm) quick-firing <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship in a gun battle, and conceivably win.|$|E
5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. The Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. Another problem were the 305mm guns and turrets as the armament factories were focused on the higher-priority <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Prototypes of neither had been completed {{by the time the}} Germans invaded. The situation was not much better for the smaller guns as mountings for both the 152mm and 100mm guns were still incomplete on 22 June 1941 and all of these programs were terminated quickly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 13 May 1915, Blamey, in his {{capacity}} as 1st Division intelligence officer, led a patrol consisting of himself, Sergeant J. H. Will and Bombardier A. A. Orchard, behind the Turkish lines in an effort to locate the Olive Grove guns that had been harassing the beach. Near Pine Ridge, an enemy party of eight Turks approached; when one of them went to bayonet Orchard, Blamey shot the Turk with his revolver. In the action that followed, six Turks were killed. He withdrew his patrol back to the Australian lines without locating the <b>guns.</b> <b>For</b> this action, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1870s, {{following}} the Italian fleet's defeat at the Battle of Lissa, the Italians began a large naval expansion program, at first aimed at countering the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The Italias were the second {{class of the}} programme, which also included the , designed in the mid-1870s by Insp Eng Benedetto Brin. The ships were authorized in 1875, with funding allocated to begin construction the following year. They were faster and more seaworthy than the preceding Caio Duilio class, owing to their higher freeboard. Brin intended them {{to be capable of}} fighting successfully against any foreign warship in service, and so he opted for very large <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> the main battery.|$|E
5|$|That evening, around 23:00, the 9th Infantry Battalion's {{rear echelon}} at Barara, along the Toko–Mosigetta–Buin Road, came under attack. Under {{the command of}} the {{battalion}} second-in-command, and possessing only four Bren light machine <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> direct fire support, they were nevertheless able to hold off the initial attack. Following this, sporadic fighting continued into the early morning, when at 04:45 on 29 March a force of about 100 Japanese attacked the position supported by sustained machine gun and rifle fire. Rushing the Australian position with bayonets, they were beaten back by stiff defence and fell back from the position, leaving behind 23 dead but taking their wounded with them. Four Australians were wounded in this encounter.|$|E

5|$|The {{armament}} of the Montana-class battleships {{would have}} been similar to the preceding Iowa-class battleships, but {{with an increase in}} the number of primary guns and more potent secondary <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> use against enemy surface ships and aircraft. Had they been completed, the Montanas {{would have been}} gun-for-gun the most powerful battleships the United States had constructed, and the only US battleship class that would have come close to equaling the Imperial Japanese Navy battleships Yamato and Musashi in armament, armor, and displacement.|$|E
5|$|The navy {{has looked}} into {{creating}} precision guided artillery rounds {{for use with}} the current fleet of cruisers and destroyers. The most recent attempt to modify the <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> longer range came with the Advanced Gun System mounts that were to be installed aboard the Zumwalt-class destroyers, although the navy {{has been involved in}} the Long Range Land Attack Projectile and Ballistic Trajectory Extended Range Munition projects for over 10 years in an effort to develop Extended Range Guided Munitions.|$|E
5|$|The seven {{surviving}} {{ships were}} withdrawn from front-line service in 1916 and disarmed, {{with the exception}} of Medusa, which retained six of her guns, and Thetis, which was rearmed with nine 10.5cm U-boat <b>guns</b> <b>for</b> use as a gunnery training ship. The remaining seven cruisers survived the war and went on to serve in the new Reichsmarine, except for Gazelle, which was broken up for scrap in 1920. The ships remained in service throughout the 1920s, but were all withdrawn by the early 1930s. Niobe was sold to Yugoslavia in 1925 and renamed Dalmacija, while Nymphe and Thetis were scrapped in the early 1930s. Arcona, Medusa, and Amazone were used as barracks hulks {{for the rest of the}} 1930s.|$|E
