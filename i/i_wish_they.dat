25|$|Changmarín {{used his}} {{writings}} as his main weapon for resistance. For years, he used politically charged décimas as means {{to educate the}} people about identity and the struggle at hand. Que se vayan del Canal (<b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> would just leave from the Canal) and Quiero Sembrar un Maíz (I want to plant corn in the Canal Zone) were the songs of the protests against the constant abuse by the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Asked {{if he had}} any regrets, he said: [...] "If I {{had seen}} the banking crisis coming. Nobody advised me, no economist, all those people now writing books saying 'I told you so' – none of them." [...] On Anglo Irish Bank, he said: [...] "I can {{honestly}} say that not once did anyone or any delegation that came in to see me ever say, ‘Watch out for Anglo’ ... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> had have." [...] Referring to the [...] "great economic storm" [...] currently under way in Ireland, he warned against excessive pessimism: [...] "Some gains have been lost, but in truth many remain. I dearly wish there was no crisis. I realise {{that it would have been}} better if some things had been done differently, but I will not denigrate the good that has been done," [...] he added.|$|E
2500|$|On October 17, 2008, Bachmann gave an {{interview}} on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews {{in support of the}} presidential campaign of Senator John McCain that brought the Minnesota 6th Congressional District race national attention. During the interview she criticized Barack Obama for his association with Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers, saying [...] "...usually we associate with people who have similar ideas to us, and it seems that it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs, and values, and thoughts are... I am very concerned that he [...] may have anti-American views." [...] She noted the bombing campaign orchestrated by Bill Ayers before discussing his association with Barack Obama, arguing that [...] "Bill Ayers is not someone the average American wants to see their president have an association with." [...] Matthews followed up by asking [...] "But he [...] is a Senator from the State of Illinois; he's {{one of the members of}} Congress you suspect of being anti-American. How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American? You've already suspected Barack Obama, is he alone or are there others?" [...] Bachmann answered, [...] "What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> would... I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out are they pro-America, or anti-America. I think people would love to see an exposé like that." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{his playing}} career at West Chester, Iacone noted that he regretted that many of the eastern schools refused to play West Chester: [...] "That really bothers me. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> played us. Possibly they are just afraid of being beaten." ...|$|R
6000|$|I was {{too much}} flattered to make an {{exposure}} and throw the merchandise on the angel's hands. I was hot, vexed, confused, but still happy; but I hated the other boys for taking such an absorbing interest in the proceedings. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> were in Jericho. I felt exquisitely mean when I said cheerfully: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tush, {{the thing}} to pardon would be having {{accepted}} one. <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> would leave us in peace! What was it this time?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{not in that}} dress," [...] said Eugenie, aghast. [...] "They will arrest you." [...] "Oh, how <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> would!" [...] cried Virginia. And {{her eyes}} flashed so that Eugenie was frightened. [...] "How <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> would!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'If {{they must}} splash, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> would splash us with clean water,' {{said the old}} lady, wiping her dress with her handkerchief.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some {{sacrifice}} {{there must}} be. Give me time--give me time, I'll manage it. <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> hadn't seen you {{there in the}} Bois." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those are {{the very}} things <b>I</b> most <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> had left us," [...] said Clayton, [...] "and the fact that <b>they</b> <b>wished</b> for them and them alone is most sinister." ...|$|R
6000|$|Another still! {{and still}} another! [...] A little lamb, and then its mother! [...] It was a vein that never stopp'd, [...] Like blood-drops {{from my heart}} they dropp'd. [...] Till thirty were not left alive [...] They dwindled, dwindled, one by one, [...] And I may say that many a time [...] <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> all were gone: [...] They dwindled one by one away; [...] For {{me it was a}} woeful day.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm sure, doctor, I'm very--I'm very----" [...] he grew inarticulate. [...] "Here {{are your}} three guineas, Dr. Pritchard. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> were three hundred." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> had {{the reward}} that every kind and generous heart would be {{inclined}} to bestow upon them!' said the gratified Mrs. Bardell.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{give you}} his story. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could. <b>They</b> all said {{afterwards}} {{that it was}} the best of the lot--the most ghastly and terrible--but I could not make any sense of it myself. It seemed so incomplete.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{will soon}} shut up forever. <b>I</b> half <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> {{would do it}} at once, I wonder whether I will get any ease before there is an end of me." ...|$|R
2500|$|In March 2014, Ellison {{was asked}} by comedian Bill Maher, [...] "Then why doesn't your party come out against the Second Amendment? It's the problem." [...] Ellison responded, [...] "I sure <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> would. <b>I</b> sure <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{should never}} have gone away. I'm out of {{practise}} in lying. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> would get it over! Just a block more and--my baby!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{more on a}} {{level with}} the others," [...] said Mr. Ogilvie politely; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> were all as forward as this little fellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lady Bertram, [...] "but I wish he was {{not going}} away. They are all going away, I think. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> would stay at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, no, my dear; Adrian is all right, {{thanks to}} Fergus again," [...] said her uncle. [...] "He is the boy's great protector; <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> could be always together." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{got your}} {{delightful}} note yesterday at Turin, {{and it made}} me wish to run back through the tunnel directly instead of coming on here. But I had a wonderful day, the Alps clear all the morning all round Italy--two hundred miles of them; and then in the afternoon blue waves of the Gulf of Genoa breaking like blue clouds, thunderclouds, under groves of olive and palm. But <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> were my sparkling waves of Coniston instead, when I read your letter again.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, {{things that}} are done, and done all the time. I feel sad for our poor people; they love me dearly, {{and they are all}} good and kind to me. <b>I</b> <b>wish,</b> papa, <b>they</b> were all free." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{have been}} telling the señor,” Hurka said, “and {{he is ready to}} make the attempt at once; but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that <b>they</b> had given you a day or two longer, for there will be extra {{vigilance}} to-night.” ...|$|R

6000|$|She looked up, amazed again. 'I must! I don't like it! But I couldn't {{ever have}} a happy Christmas if I didn't tell! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> would come that I might have it over.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How cunning they are! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> {{would let}} me put them with the kits, and have a nursery full of babies. Wouldn't it be nice to see them all grow up?" [...] said Daisy.|$|E
50|$|Elizabeth Bishop {{knew that}} her type of poem was hard to do well, and she {{published}} sparingly. Elizabeth Smither, by comparison, publishes prolifically. In each book {{there are some very}} good poems, the kind that you rediscover later with delight. But many of the poems in The Lark Quartet, {{as much as we can}} see where they want to go, don’t quite make it. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> had been left longer and worked harder so that their quickness and lightness at the level of ideas could ripen into something more lasting in language.|$|R
50|$|Tommy Kirk starred {{and later}} {{recalled}} about the movie:This was his Kelly's {{attempt to do}} a sympathetic dramatisation of a Lieutenant Calley-type character (My Lai massacre) coming home and portraying his bitterness, alienation and unhappiness at being fingered as a murderer, a baby killer and a monster. That's who I played. I'm not completely embarrassed by the film, but after I saw it, <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> would have cut some things. Some of it was pretty stinko. Other things weren't so bad. The movie {{as a whole was}} a failure, but it wasn't trash.|$|R
60|$|No, {{let me be}} honest. When I went in I {{had seen}} {{that there was a}} deucedly pretty girl sitting in that {{particular}} seat, so I had taken the next one. What happened now was that I began, as it were, to drink her in. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> would turn the lights up so that I could see her better. She was rather small, with great big eyes and a ripping smile. It was a shame to let all that run to seed, so to speak, in semi-darkness.|$|R
