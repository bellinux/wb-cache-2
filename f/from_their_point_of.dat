5|$|The main {{characters}} in the Five Nights at Freddy's series are generally security guards working at a Freddy Fazbear's Pizza or related location. None of them have distinct personalities {{and most of the}} gameplay takes place <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. In Five Nights at Freddy's, the guard's name is Mike Schmidt. In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the guard is named Jeremy Fitzgerald for all of the main five nights and the bonus sixth night, though he is replaced in the custom seventh night by another guard, Fritz Smith. The security guard for Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction in Five Nights at Freddy's 3, is unknown. The main character of Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is an unnamed boy, who experiences nightmares of the animatronics. The player in Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location is a technician who has their name jokingly autocorrected to Eggs Benedict. The technician's name is assumed, although not confirmed to be, Mike.|$|E

25|$|In {{regions of}} Iraq and Syria under ISIL, {{there have been}} reports of floggings as well as {{execution}} against people who engage in adultery. The method of execution was typically through stoning.

Latoya Peterson, writing in Slates Double X, argued that Mad Men was glossing over racial issues.|$|E
50|$|The Bouma {{sequence}} is deposited during waning flow as turbidity currents move downslope. In other words, flows steadily lose energy as they react {{to changes in}} the slope of the surface over which they travel, and/or as flows move from being confined within a channel to unconfined when they exit the channel and spread out. Surges and/or hydraulic jumps caused by changes in slope can reinvigorate flows briefly to increase flow energy, but ultimately energy decreases as flows move away <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> origin.|$|R

40|$|According to van Eemeren (Strategic {{maneuvering}} in argumentative discourse. Extending the pragma-dialectical {{theory of}} argumentation.

This is why they have to maneuver strategically to reconcile their pursuit of effectiveness with the maintenance of reasonableness (p. 40). In pragma-dialectical terms, this means that in their strategic maneuvering they try to be convincing by combining artful rhetorical operating systematically with complying fully with the dialectical rules for critical discussion...|$|R

25|$|Electrospinning is a {{very old}} {{technique}} whereby a fluid is held in a container in a manner such that {{it is able to}} flow out through capillary action. A conducting substrate is positioned below, and a large difference in electrical potential is applied between the fluid and the substrate. The fluid is attracted to the substrate, and tiny fibres jump almost instantly <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> emission, the Taylor cone, to the substrate, drying as they travel. This method has been shown to create nano-scale fibres from both silk dissected from organisms and regenerated silk fibroin.|$|E
25|$|The {{ascension}} of the Macedonian dynasty in 867 {{marked the}} end of the period of political and religious turmoil and introduced a new golden age of the empire. While the talented generals such as Nicephorus Phocas expanded the frontiers, the Macedonian emperors (such as Leo the Wise and Constantine VII) presided over the cultural flowering in Constantinople, known as the Macedonian Renaissance. The enlightened Macedonian rulers scorned the rulers of Western Europe as illiterate barbarians and maintained a nominal claim to rule over the West. Although this fiction had been exploded with the coronation of Charlemagne in Rome (800), the Byzantine rulers did not treat their Western counterparts as equals. Generally, they had little interest in political and economic developments in the barbarian (<b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view) West.|$|E

25|$|Mackworth {{headed the}} county {{sequestration}} committee, which confiscated and leased out the estates of royalist landowners, pending their reaching {{a settlement with}} the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents, based at Goldsmiths' Hall. Mackworth's dealings with the Ottley family are fairly well known <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, as their correspondence is preserved. The county committee began felling Francis Ottley's trees in retribution for his burning of houses while governor or Sheriff. This was quickly forbidden by the Committee for Compounding {{but it seems that}} Mackworth and the county committee were slow to comply. In April 1647, a letter from Lucy Ottley, the wife of Sir Francis, to Richard Ottley, their eldest son, mentioned moves by Mackworth and others to prosecute Sir Francis, but the details are unknown and nothing seems to have come of it. Mackworth's name heads the signatories on the document releasing Ottley's lands from sequestration in March 1648, although the financial details were far from settled. Ottley was accused of involvement in the attempted royalist uprising of that summer but apparently never apprehended. There were legal proceedings between Mackworth and Ottley in February 1649, but their nature is not known, although there was apparently difficulty in securing legal officials not related to either party. Sir Francis completed his business with the compounding Committee in the summer and died later in the year.|$|E

500|$|Other {{conspiracy}} theories {{point to the}} British, the German Abwehr intelligence agency or the Poles themselves, some of whom (especially {{under the command of}} General Anders) had shown animosity toward Sikorski for, at least <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, his policy of [...] "colluding" [...] with Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, which reached new heights by the Germans' April 1943 discovery of mass graves filled with thousands of Polish prisoners of war murdered by the Soviets at Katyn Forest in 1940. Most notably though, in 1967 the controversial British historical writer David Irving published a book dedicated to this incident, and suggesting British complicity in the incident. Meanwhile, it seems unlikely to some that the Nazis — dedicated adversaries of Sikorski and vice versa — who had secret agents of the Abwehr just across the border in neutral Spain, would have wanted to murder Sikorski, as he was worth more to them alive instead of dead.|$|E

50|$|The {{first people}} to visit Castle Hill were {{probably}} hunters and gatherers of the Mesolithic age, camping amongst the forests which at that time covered the land.

The hillfort was constructed in the early Iron Age, around 555 BC taking up the whole hilltop. Modifications were made around 43 AD to improve the defences, probably in response to the threat from the Roman invaders.|$|R

5000|$|The dynamic {{programming}} method breaks this decision problem into smaller subproblems.

(See Bellman, 1957, Chap. III.3.)In computer science, a problem that can be broken apart like this is said to have optimal substructure. In the context of dynamic game theory, this principle is analogous to the concept of subgame perfect equilibrium, although what constitutes an optimal policy in this case is conditioned on the decision-maker's opponents choosing similarly optimal policies <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> view.|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of object-oriented programs {{differs from that}} of procedural programs, requiring special compilation techniques to obtain efficiency. Object-orientation introduce additional layers of abstraction which separate the implementations of data structures and algorithms <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> use. The result is smaller functions, increased data dependence of control flow, and an increase in potential aliasing. We present an automatic interprocedural optimization framework, which resolves these differences through interprocedural analysis and transformation; enabling a dynamically-typed pure object-oriented language to match the performance of C on a set of standard procedural benchmarks. For two standard object-oriented benchmarks we also compare this framework to the supplied annotations (e. g. inline, virtual and templates) for the hybrid OO-procedural language C++ [51], and show that the framework obtains up to 6 times the performance of the annotated C++ code...|$|R
