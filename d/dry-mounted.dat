50|$|Flush mount albums have hard covers with thick, {{unbending}} pages. They {{consist of}} photographic prints that were <b>dry-mounted</b> on cardboard. The covers are mostly made of leather, leatherette or glass. The photos lie completely flat and extend {{across the whole}} page. Flush mount albums are usually designed in magazine-style. They are most often used for special occasions such as weddings and anniversaries {{due to the fact}} that they are produced at a higher quality and are more expensive to produce than coffee table books.|$|E
50|$|The typical Chinese {{navigational compass}} {{was in the}} form of a {{magnetic}} needle floating in a bowl of water. According to Needham, the Chinese in the Song Dynasty and continuing Yuan Dynasty did make use of a dry compass, although this type never became as widely used in China as the wet compass. Evidence of this is found in the Shilin guangji ("Guide Through the Forest of Affairs"), published in 1325 by Chen Yuanjing, although its compilation had taken place between 1100 and 1250. The dry compass in China was a dry suspension compass, a wooden frame crafted in the shape of a turtle hung upside down by a board, with the lodestone sealed in by wax, and if rotated, the needle at the tail would always point in the northern cardinal direction. Although the European compass-card in box frame and dry pivot needle was adopted in China after its use was taken by Japanese pirates in the 16th century (who had in turn learned of it from Europeans), the Chinese design of the suspended dry compass persisted in use well into the 18th century. However, according to Kreutz there is only a single Chinese reference to a <b>dry-mounted</b> needle (built into a pivoted wooden tortoise) which is dated to between 1150 and 1250, and claims that there is no clear indication that Chinese mariners ever used anything but the floating needle in a bowl until the 16th century.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{techniques}} for radioautography used in biological and medical research {{can be classified}} into three categories, i. e., macroscopic radioautography, light microscopic radioautography and electron microscopic radioautography. The routine techniques used in these three procedures are described. With regard to macroscopic radioautography, whole body radioautography is a standard technique which employs freezing and cryosectioning and can demonstrate organ distributions of both soluble and insoluble compounds. In contrast, in light and electron microscopic radioautography, soluble and insoluble techniques are separated. In order to demonstrate insoluble labeled compounds, conventional chemical fixations such as formalin for light microscopy or buffered glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide for both light and electron microscopy followed by dehydration, embedding and wet-mounting applications of radioautographic emulsions can be used. For the demonstration of soluble labeled compounds, however, cryotechniques such as cryofixation, cryosectioning, freeze-drying, freeze-substitution followed by dry-sectioning and <b>dry-mounting</b> radioautography should be employed both for light and electron microscopy. The outlines of these techniques, which should be utilized in various fields of biological and medical research, are described in detai...|$|R
5000|$|The {{liquid compass}} is a design {{in which the}} {{magnetized}} needle or card is damped by fluid to protect against excessive swing or wobble, improving readability while reducing wear. A rudimentary working model of a liquid compass was introduced by Sir Edmund Halley {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society in 1690. [...] However, as early liquid compasses were fairly cumbersome and heavy, and subject to damage, their main advantage was aboard ship. Protected in a binnacle and normally gimbal-mounted, the liquid inside the compass housing effectively damped shock and vibration, while eliminating excessive swing and grounding of the card caused by the pitch and roll of the vessel. The first liquid mariner's compass believed practicable for limited use was patented by the Englishman Francis Crow in 1813. [...] Liquid-damped marine compasses for ships and small boats were occasionally used by the Royal Navy from the 1830s through 1860, but the standard Admiralty compass remained a <b>dry-mount</b> type. [...] In the latter year, the American physicist and inventor Edward Samuel Ritchie patented a greatly improved liquid marine compass that was adopted in revised form for general use by the United States Navy, and later purchased by the Royal Navy as well.|$|R

40|$|The loss of "bound" S 35 {{that occurs}} during various {{mounting}} procedures used in autoradiography was studied in healing surface wounds of rats treated with either methionine-S 35 or Na 2 S 35 O 4. Valid autoradiography of bound S 35 in this tissue {{is not possible}} until 48 hours after radiosulfate and 24 hours after radiomethionine injection, when the S 35 is almost entirely bound in large protein and polysaccharide molecules. Autoradiograms of S 35 given in both the organic and inorganic form reveal substantial over-all loss of the bound isotope from sections subjected to contact with solvents prior to autoradiography. A comparison of autoradiograms prepared by <b>dry-mounting</b> sections of frozen-dried tissue with autoradiograms of wet-mounted sections of the same tissue suggest that the loss {{is proportional to the}} extent of the contact with solvents. Evidence suggests that loss of the isotope occurs during contact of the ribbon or section itself with solutions after fixation and cutting and prior to radiation exposure. No appreciable loss of the bound isotope seems to occur during contact of the intact tissue specimen with a variety of fluid fixatives except for a marginal zone at the excision edges of the tissue. The potential hazard of displacement of the isotope during fixation, however, remains. Technics which prevent loss of the isotope and fogging of the nuclear emulsion permit the use of thinner sections and emulsion films and the fine resolution of image rendered possible by the physical properties of S 35...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to compare two different methods of evaluating bull sperm morphology, bright-field (BF) microscopy of eosin–nigrosin (EN) stained <b>dry-mount</b> semen smears and differential interference phase contrast (DIC) microscopy of wet-mount semen 'fixed' in isotonic formal saline, both at 1000 ×. Ejaculates (n = 72) were evaluated, representing both pre- and post-breeding season ejaculates collected from 40 2 -yr-old beef bulls via electro-ejaculation. For both methods, 200 sperm were counted in random fields with defects categorized as major (MAD) and minor (MID). Sperm abnormalities were also placed into two other categories: those considered to be most influenced by process (wet or dry, METHDEF) and those with depictions that could be influenced by optics (BF or DIC, OPTIDEF). Differences (P 0. 05) in percent normal sperm 69. 1 / 70. 4 or sperm head defects 7. 5 / 8. 3. Acrosome, tail and droplet defects were observed in 98. 2 / 80. 5, 86. 1 / 100 and 98. 2 / 94. 4 percent of bulls for DIC and BF, respectively (P < 0. 05). As percent normal sperm did not differ between methods, bright-field microscopy assessment of EN preparations was considered to be a satisfactory method to categorize breeding soundness of bulls. However, DIC was more effective in visualizing major defects, while BF (which included stained smear preparation) was considered to cause more minor defects. Thus DIC was considered to be the preferred method of semen assessment for accurate assessment of sperm morphology in bulls...|$|R
5000|$|In 1857, one of Ritchie's {{induction}} coils was {{exhibited in}} Dublin, Ireland {{at a conference}} of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and later at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. [...] Intrigued, Ruhmkorff himself procured {{a sample of the}} Ritchie induction coil and used it as a basis for revising his own design. [...] The German inventor was later awarded a scientific prize by Napoleon III. Disappointed in not receiving recognition for his improvements, Ritchie turned his attention to navigational instruments. Ritchie began making marine bearing compasses for the U.S. Navy before the American Civil War. At the time, British Admiralty <b>dry-mount</b> nautical compasses were considered by all navies and merchant shipping companies as the technological standard of the day. Ritchie thought they could be improved upon, and by 1860 had received a U.S. patent for the first successful and practicable liquid-filled marine compass suitable for general use, a development that has been described as the first major advance in compass technology in several hundred years. [...] With the damping provided by the liquid, together with a gimbal mounting, the floating indicator or card of the Ritchie compass remained relatively stable even when a ship's deck pitched and rolled during periods of severe weather. In Ritchie's third patent application (#38,126) dated April 7, 1863, several features that contributed to the success of his compass are revealed, including a floating card of nearly the same specific gravity as the liquid, an air-tight metallic case, and an elastic chamber that served as a diaphragm, compensating for temperature changes and resultant unequal expansion of the liquid and the bowl.|$|R
40|$|The {{location}} of three radioactively labelled extracellular-space indicators ([3 H]methoxy-inulin, [3 H]-D-mannitol and sodium [MS]sulphate) in the superior cervical sympathetic and nodose ganglia of cats was studied using an autoradiographic technique. The technique {{was designed to}} eliminate movement of soluble, diffusible substances in tissues after excision, and to provide high autoradiographic resolution. Ganglia were rapidly excised after administration of the radioactive compounds in vivo, and frozen in liquid propane. Frozen sections were cut at — 60 °C at a thickness of 07 - 0 - 8 /t. The frozen sections were freeze-dried, <b>dry-mounted</b> on dried, photographic emulsion-coated microscope slides, and exposed at — 15 °C until develop-ment. The highest densities of silver grains in the autoradiographs were associated with regions of the tissue containing the greatest amounts of connective tissue. Lowest densities occurred beneath neurons and myelinated nerve fibres. The silver grain density beneath neuron peri-karya was between 10 % and 15 % of that associated with plasma. Attempts were made to determine the source of these subneuronal silver grains. The results suggested {{that they could not}} be ascribed to the following: background; chemographs and pressure artefacts; spread of radiation from radioactive material outside the perikarya; and in vitro trans{{location of}} radio-active material into the neurons or into the emulsion beneath the neurons. It was concluded that the subneuronal grains reflected a small amount of intraneuronal penetration of the compounds in vivo. There was very little difference between inulin, mannitol and sulphate with regard to the proportion of intracellular activity. Except for this small amount of intracellular radioactivity, the findings accord with the view that inulin, mannitol and sulphate are confined predominantly to the extracellular fluid...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{cellular}} and subcellular localization of {‘H]progesterone or its metabolites {{was observed}} in autoradiograms of guinea pig cervix prepared 15 and 30 mm after the injection of labeled progesterone. Radioactivity {{was found to be}} concentrated in nuclei of epithelial cells of the cervical canal and in basal cells of the tubular glands, in connective tissue cells of the lamina propria and in smooth muscle cells of the muscular layer. Mucus secreting cells showed little or no radioactivity. Preinjection of unlabeled progesterone inhibited the nuclear concentration of radioactivity, whereas cortisol had no effect. The results demonstrate for the first time progestin target cells in the cervix, supporting the concept of a direct action of progestins on these tissues. The local actions of progestins on repro-ductive organs have been given special at-tention in order to circumvent or minimize systemic and central effects of contracep-tives. The contraceptive actions of proges-tins on the cervix have been suggested to be due to alterations in the cervical mucus and, in turn, to effects on sperm capacita-tion (Pincus, 1956; Roland, 1968; Klopper, 1970). Zanartu (1969) studied the effects of various oral gestagens on cervical mucus and sperm penetration and found a change of the cervical mucus toward progesta-tional-like appearance with increased hos-tility to sperm penetration. Although pro-gestational effects on the cervix have been observed, no selective accumulation of pro-gesterone has been reported so far. Re-cently, progestin target cells have been identified in the rat uterus (Stumpf and Sar, 1973) and in the guinea pig oviduct, uterus, vagina (Sar and Stumpf, 1974) and hypothalamus (Sar and Stumpf, 1973), using <b>dry-mount</b> autoradiography. The pre-sent report for the first time describes a selective cellular and subcellular concentra-tion of [H]progesterone or its metabolites in guinea pig cervix...|$|R
