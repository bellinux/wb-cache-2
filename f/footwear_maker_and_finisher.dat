Four diets treatments in each period were used containing graded levels of enzyme mixture (0, 50, 100, 150 mg/kg).

The effects of pelleted grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> diets containing 0, 7. 5, 15, 30, or 60 % "fines " were also comparatively evaluated. Lower body weights and poorer feed conversion resulted when birds were fed the all-mash diets, but mortality, carcass grades, and monetary returns were not affected significantly (P<. 05). Similarly, as levels of fines in pelleted grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> diets increased, feed conver-sion was adversely affected and body weights tended to be lower, but mortality, carcass grades, and monetary returns were unaffected (P<. 05).

40|$|Three hundred Dako broiler chicks of {{both sexes}} each having average initial weight of 86. 4 g were {{randomly}} distributed into five treatments with two replicates each with 30 birds.

40|$|AbstractAn 80 day {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the growth promoting effects of a unique mannose rich fraction (MRF) derived from yeast cell walls of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, relative to copper and tylosin in commercially housed grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> pigs. 1008 male grower pigs (29. 7 ± 1. 99 kg live weight) were randomly allocated to four treatment groups of 252 pigs. There were 12 replicates for growth rates (21 pigs per pen) and 6 replicates for feed intake and FCR (42 pigs per feeder). The dietary treatments consisted of a control (CON, containing no growth promoting feed additives), copper (COP, containing 200 ppm of copper as copper sulphate in both grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> pigs), MRF (containing 400 ppm and 200 ppm of Actigen™ (Alltech Biotechnology, Nicholasville, KY) in grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> diets respectively), <b>and</b> tylosin (TYL, containing 40 g and 20 g of tylosin in grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> diets respectively). Growth performance and mortality were monitored over the grower (d 0 – 38) <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> (d 39 – 80) periods. Slaughter characteristics (carcass weight and backfat thickness at the P 2 position) were recorded at d 80. Mannose rich fraction pigs grew faster (P< 0. 01) than CON or COP pigs during the grower phase. Mannose rich fraction and TYL pigs also tended to (P= 0. 08) have better FCR during the grower phase than those on the CON and COP treatments. No significant treatment effects were observed for growth performance during the finisher phase or over the entire study (d 0 – 80). However, MRF pigs had a significantly higher (P< 0. 01) dressing percentage and heavier carcass weight than pig on all other treatments. There was no influence of growth promoting feed additives on backfat thickness. Overall, MRF was as effective as tylosin and more effective than copper as a growth promoter in grower pigs. Mannose rich fraction inclusion was able to enhance the yield of saleable pork, and was the most effective growth promoting option tested...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Information on {{physical}} properties of broiler chickens diets {{is not available}} in literatures and such information is important for design and construction of poultry equipments. Some physical properties of starter, grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> diet of broiler chickens, namely: gravimetrical (bulk density, true density and porosity) and frictional properties (coefficient of friction filling angle of repose, empting angle of repose and pouring angle of repose) were studied. Effect of height of falling diets to the containers at 150, 250 and 350 mm and volume of the containers at 500, 600, 1, 100 and 2, 000 mL on bulk density and porosity of diets were studied. Results indicated that true density of the starter; grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> diets were 1, 442. 574, 1, 512. 694 and 1, 541. 320 kg m 3, respectively. A comparison between the three levels of height of falling for three diets indicated that with increasing height of falling, bulk density were increased and porosity were decreased. The coefficient of friction of starter, grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> diet on different surfaces changed from 18. 033 to 26. 743 °, 18. 083 to 27. 193 ° and 18. 293 to 27. 570 °, respectively. The values obtained for pouring angle of repose of starter diet on iron, plywood and galvanized surfaces were 34. 40 °, 36. 05 ° and 30. 22 °, respectively. The corresponding values for grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> diets were 38. 71 °, 39. 62 °, and 33. 72 ° and 36. 66 °, 38. 21 ° and 33. 62 °, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Fifty {{crossbred}} (Large White x Landrace x Duroc) female finisher pigs {{were used}} to determine the effect of nutritional manipulations on intramuscular fat deposition. The main nutritional treatments were (i) Control (pigs fed a commercial grower diet), (ii) - 15 % P:DE (pigs fed a 15 % reduced protein:digestible energy diet during the grower phase), (iii) - 30 % P:DE (pigs fed a 30 % reduced P:DE diet during the grower phase), (iv) + 6 % Fat (pigs fed diet supplemented with 6 % additional fat during the grower phase), and (v) -Vit A (pigs fed a control diet with no supplemented Vit A in the mineral vitamin premix during the grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> phase). Pigs fed the 30 % reduced P:DE diet had an inferior feed to liveweight gain (feed conversion ratio, FCR) for the combined grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> growth period (P = 0. 036) compared with the other dietary treatments. There {{were no significant differences in}} average daily gain (ADG) or voluntary feed intake (VFI) for the grower, <b>finisher,</b> <b>and</b> the combined grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> phases, or liveweight at slaughter between the dietary treatments. Pigs fed the 15 % (1. 9 %) and 30 % (2. 7 %) reduced P:DE diet, and the Vit A-restricted diet (2. 0 %), had significantly higher intramuscular fat (IMF) levels compared with pigs fed the other diets. Pigs fed the control diet had higher (P = 0. 002) carcass dressing percentage compared with pigs fed the other diets. There were no significant dietary effects on total fat tissue (P = 0. 661), total lean muscle tissue (P = 0. 637), and total bone mineral (P = 0. 367) content. In conclusion, these data indicate that feeding pigs grower diets with 15 % and 30 % reduced P:DE, <b>and</b> grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> diets restricted in Vit A, improved the IMF levels in the Longissimus muscle. The increase in IMF levels in pigs fed the 15 % reduced P:DE diet, <b>and</b> grower <b>and</b> <b>finisher</b> diets restricted in Vit A, improved the IMF levels without having a detrimental effect on growth performance and carcass quality...|$|R
