5|$|Based only on {{uncertain}} {{descriptions of}} the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608, Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification. He later made improved versions with up to about 30x magnification. With a Galilean telescope, the observer could see magnified, upright images on the earth—it was what {{is commonly known as}} a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time {{he was one of those}} who could construct telescopes good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> purpose. On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to Venetian lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger).|$|E

More positively, Stephen wrote that she loved the bravery in [...] "both the humour and pathos that Steph's manipulation of her cancer brings." ...|$|E
500|$|Cleave {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in West Africa, which he credits for having partially inspired The Other Hand. Further inspiration came from Cleaves's temporary employment while studying experimental {{psychology at the}} University of Oxford. During the summer, Cleave painted underpasses, gardened and picked up litter, and hoped to use this experience to write a book. His final job was at Campsfield House in Oxfordshire, an immigration detention centre. Cleave spent three days serving food to residents from war zones including Somalia, Eritrea and the Balkans. He explained: [...] "I got talking {{with some of them}} and said why are you here? Why are you in prison? It's not illegal and yet we concentrate them in these places. It's a text-book definition of a concentration camp. The conditions are appalling. I was shocked <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> {{to be the end of}} my light comedy book of my amusing summers working as a labourer." [...] Cleave believes he would not have written the novel were he not a parent, as he does not wish for his children [...] "to grow up into a world that is callous and stupid." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a more {{negative}} review, Scott Mendelson of Forbes commended MacFarlane's {{decision to make}} an unconventional western comedy, but summarized the film as [...] "just ambitious <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> to be genuinely disappointing." [...] Michael O'Sullivan at The Washington Post was mixed, deeming the film a [...] "broad, wildly hit-or-miss satire," [...] remarking that he found few of the jokes in the film funny. [...] "Spiritually, it's closer to a mid-range crowd-pleaser such as City Slickers than Blazing Saddles, too enamoured of genre convention {{to reach for the}} comic dynamite," [...] wrote Mike McCahill at The Guardian.|$|E
2500|$|The South African team {{received}} US$100,000 and {{a trophy}} {{for being the}} champions. Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, handed over the trophy and the cash award. Cronje said: [...] "it feels good to win this tough tournament. There were no second chances in this knock-out format, so I think we did well to play three good matches. We knew we were among the top there, but this has renewed our confidence for next year's World Cup." [...] The West Indian team received US$60,000 for being the runners-up. Lara said: [...] "not many expected us to reach the final but we showed we were good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> I am happy the boys fought till the end, {{it was a very}} close game. It's all about taking your chances and the South Africans took theirs well and deserved to win." ...|$|E
2500|$|Criticisms {{directed}} against Esperanto and other early auxiliary languages {{in the late}} 19th century included the idea that different races have sufficiently different speech organs that an international language might work locally in Europe, but hardly worldwide, and the prediction that if adopted, such an auxlang would rapidly break up into local dialects. Advances in linguistics have done away with the first of these, and the limited but significant use of Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua on an international scale, without breakup into unintelligible dialects, has shown that either a rapid break-up into dialects shall not happen too soon in the future, or that there is enough constant 'standardisation' to reduce {{the diversity of the}} language. Subsequently, much criticism has been focused either on the artificiality of these auxlangs, or on the argumentativeness of auxlang proponents and their failure to agree on one auxlang, or even on objective criteria by which to judge auxlangs. [...] However, probably the most common criticism is that a constructed auxlang is unnecessary because natural languages such as English are already in wide use as auxlangs and work well <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> purpose.|$|E

2500|$|Like all of Vancouver, the West End was {{originally}} a forested wilderness. The area was purchased in 1862 by John Morton, Samuel Brighouse, and William Hailstone, three men {{known as the}} [...] "Three Greenhorn Englishmen," [...] or just the [...] "Three Greenhorns," [...] owing {{to the belief that}} the naive men paid too much for the remote land. The men had plans to establish a brickworks on the shore of Coal Harbour, and their land claim {{was originally}} staked with the hopeful intent of mining for porcelain clays, but the grade of clay was not fine <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> use. When those plans failed (a lack of transportation being a key factor) they sold {{a good portion of the}} area, by then known as the Brickmaker's Claim, to Victoria investors who in turn tried to promote its development as New Liverpool. The only thing that happened with that scheme was a subdivision plan registered with the Land Titles office in New Westminster. Another name used for the property was the Brighouse Estate (Brighouse as a name came to refer to a particular part of Richmond, where [...] "Greenhorn" [...] J. Morton also owned property). One of the partners, observant that brick was a valuable building commodity despite the abundance of timber in the region, moved the brick-clay operations to Sumas Mountain, establishing the community of Clayburn, now a neighbourhood of Abbotsford.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Norwood {{introduced}} her rap alter ego Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009), {{the result of}} artistic experimentation with the musician, who had tapped her for her rhyming ability after seeing a video on YouTube that Norwood had uploaded and showed her rapping freestyle. Norwood, who had initially thought of rapping as a hobby and fun for friends, felt encouraged by Timbaland to write and perform her own verses on at least three tracks for his album, two of which eventually {{made it to the}} track lisiting. In December 2009, the producer revealed his intentions to reteam with her on her next project, producing the bulk of an album that he envisioned to be “half singing, half rapping”. Norwood confirmed his idea in an interview she held at the release party of Shock Value II: [...] "What I'm doing on the [...] album is a little bit different than what everybody knows me for. Timbaland endorsed that [...] He really gave me a shot to be different and be versatile. I can't thank him <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> This is a wonderful opportunity." [...] Though Norwood went on to record several other rap songs the following months and hoped it would eventually lead to a signing with Timbaland's Mosley Music Group, plans for hip hop-oriented album under his imprint were eventually abandoned as the singer felt the sound would not aim at her core audience. Approached on the subject, she later dismissed the idea of recording a rap album, stating that “it was a hobby. I was convinced to do it professionally, which I never should have listened to that advice.” ...|$|E
