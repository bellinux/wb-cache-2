25|$|A {{video game}} for Superleague Formula {{was made by}} Media Game and <b>Image</b> <b>Space</b> Incorporated and {{released}} for PC on 31 October 2009, although it was originally announced {{to be released in}} September. The game, released for download by the series' official website, featured 18 clubs and 6 circuits from in the 2009 season. During the 2009 Donington round some star drivers tested out the new game and gave it positive feedback.|$|E
25|$|The {{sarcophagus}} measures 1.53m {{in height}} and {{is made from}} Proconnesian marble, a medium characterized by dark gray stripes and a medium to coarse grain. It is decorated in a very high relief with many elements of the composition cut completely free of the background. Overlapping figures entirely fill the <b>image</b> <b>space,</b> allowing no room to depict a background. In many battle sarcophagi the side panels show more tranquil scenes, but here the battle continues round both sides.|$|E
25|$|The carving is so {{deep that}} the forms are almost {{completely}} offset from the background resulting in three, or even four, layers of various figures and forms. What is more, overlapping figures fill the <b>image</b> <b>space</b> entirely, allowing no room to depict a background. Thus, the sense of space has been eliminated, giving rise to chaos {{and a sense of}} weary, open-ended victory. The effect of movement in the scene is evident and, unlike many battle sarcophagi which have more tranquil scenes on the side panels, the battle events continue {{all the way around the}} sarcophagus. The perspective constructed is also notable, although certainly not linear.|$|E

2500|$|Scenes {{showing the}} shepherds {{at the side}} of the crib are a {{different}} subject, formally known as the Adoration of the shepherds. [...] This is very commonly combined with the Adoration of the Magi, which makes for a balanced composition, as the two groups often occupy opposite sides of the <b>image</b> <b>space</b> around the central figures, and fitted with the theological interpretation of the episode, where the two groups represented the peoples of the world between them. This combination is first found in the 6th-century Monza ampullae made in Palestine.|$|E

25|$|Extended {{consciousness}} is an animal's autobiographical self-perception. It {{is thought to}} arise in the brains of animals which have a substantial capacity for memory and reason. It does not necessarily require language. The perception of a historic and future self arises from a stream of information from the immediate environment and from neural structures related to memory. The concept was popularised by Antonio Damasio and is used in biological psychology. Extended {{consciousness is}} said to arise in structures in the human brain described as <b>image</b> <b>spaces</b> and dispositional <b>spaces.</b> <b>Image</b> <b>spaces</b> imply areas where sensory impressions of all types are processed, including the focused awareness of the core consciousness. Dispositional spaces include convergence zones, which are networks in the brain where memories are processed and recalled, and where knowledge is merged with immediate experience.|$|R

40|$|JPEG-based protections can be {{obtained}} by regarding microdata as an image that is transformed by means of a lossy JPEG compression-decompression process. Here we propose a general model that decouples JPEG-based methods into two parts. First part encompasses transformations between data and <b>image</b> <b>spaces.</b> Second part consists in the image transformation itself. Under this general model, we first explore different maps between data and <b>image</b> <b>spaces.</b> In our experiments, quantization using histogram equalization, in combination with JPEG-based methods, outperform other approaches. Secondly, image transformations other than JPEG can be utilized. We illustrate this point by introducing JPEG 2000 as a valid alternative to JPEG. Finally, we experimentally analyze the effectiveness of the generalized JPEGbased method, comparing it with well-known state-of-the-art protection methods such as rank swapping, microaggregation and noise addition. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{the concept and}} an implementation of geospatial 3 D <b>image</b> <b>spaces</b> as new type of native urban models. 3 D <b>image</b> <b>spaces</b> are based on collections of georeferenced RGB-D imagery. This imagery is typically acquired using multi-view stereo mobile mapping systems capturing dense sequences of street level imagery. Ideally, image depth information is derived using dense image matching. This delivers a very dense depth representation and ensures the spatial and temporal coherence of radiometric and depth data. This results in a high-definition WYSIWYG (“what {{you see is what}} you get”) urban model, which is intuitive to interpret and easy to interact with, and which provides powerful augmentation and 3 D measuring capabilities. Furthermore, we present a scalable cloud-based framework for generating 3 D <b>image</b> <b>spaces</b> of entire cities or states and a client architecture for their web-based exploitation. The model and the framework strongly support the smart city notion of efficiently connecting the urban environment and its processes with experts and citizens alike. In the paper we particularly investigate quality aspects of the urban model, namely the obtainable georeferencing accuracy and the quality of the depth map extraction. We show that our image-based georeferencing approach is capable of improving the original direct georeferencing accuracy by an order of magnitude and that the presented new multi-image matching approach is capable of providing high accuracies along with a significantly improved completeness of the depth maps...|$|R
5000|$|Optical spaces {{extend to}} {{infinity}} in all directions. The object space {{does not exist}} only on the [...] "input" [...] side of the system, nor the <b>image</b> <b>space</b> only on the [...] "output" [...] side. All optical spaces thus overlap completely. Typically, the origin and {{at least some of}} the coordinate axes of each space are different. It may not be possible to discern from an illustration to which space a point, ray, or plane belongs unless some convention is adopted. A common convention uses capital letters to label points and lower case letters to indicate distances. Unprimed letters indicate object space and primed letters <b>image</b> <b>space.</b> Intermediate spaces are indicated by additional primes. The same letter is used to indicate a conjugate relationship either between points or distances. The only exception is the use of F and F' to indicate respectively object and <b>image</b> <b>space</b> focal points (which are not conjugate). The term [...] "object point" [...] does not necessarily refer to a point on a specific object but rather to a point in object space; similarly for [...] "image point".|$|E
