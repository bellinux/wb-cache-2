5000|$|<b>Explosion</b> <b>welding</b> {{can produce}} a bond between two metals that cannot {{necessarily}} be welded by conventional means. The process does not melt either metal, instead plasticizing the surfaces of both metals, causing them to come into intimate contact sufficient to create a weld. This is a similar principle to other non-fusion welding techniques, such as friction welding. Large areas can be bonded extremely quickly and the weld itself is very clean, {{due to the fact}} that the surface material of both metals is violently expelled during the reaction.|$|E
50|$|Many metals can be forge welded, {{with the}} most common being both high and {{low-carbon}} steels. Iron and even some hypoeutectic cast-irons can be forge welded. Some aluminum alloys can also be forge welded. Metals such as copper, bronze and brass do not forge weld readily. Although {{it is possible to}} forge weld copper-based alloys, it is often with great difficulty due to copper's tendency to absorb oxygen during the heating. Copper and its alloys are usually better joined with cold welding, <b>explosion</b> <b>welding,</b> or other pressure-welding techniques. With iron or steel, the presence of even small amounts of copper severely reduces the alloy's ability to forge weld.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{other forms}} of welding such as arc welding (which was {{developed}} in the late 19th century), <b>explosion</b> <b>welding</b> was developed relatively recently, in the decades after World War II.

Since the extreme heat involved in {{other forms of}} welding did not play a role, it was concluded that the phenomenon was caused by the explosive forces acting on the shrapnel. These results were later duplicated in laboratory tests and, not long afterwards, the process was patented and put to use.|$|E

50|$|Diffusion bonding is {{primarily}} {{used to create}} intricate forms for the electronics, aerospace, and nuclear industries. Since this form of bonding takes {{a considerable amount of}} time compared to other joining techniques such as <b>explosion</b> <b>welding,</b> parts are made in small quantities, and often fabrication is mostly automated. However, due to different requirements, some of the time interval could be accomplished in few minutes. In an attempt to reduce fastener count, labor costs, and part count, diffusion bonding, in conjunction with superplastic forming, is also used when creating complex sheet metal forms. Multiple sheets are stacked atop one another and bonded in specific sections. The stack is then placed into a mold and gas pressure expands the sheets to fill the mold.

Today vessels in the USA require BPVC stamping but the BPVC is not just a domestic code, many other countries have adopted the BPVC as their official code. There are, however, other official codes in some countries (some of which rely on portions of and reference the BPVC), Japan, Australia, Canada, Britain, and Europe have their own codes. Regardless of the country nearly all recognize the inherent potential hazards of pressure vessels and the need for standards and codes regulating their design and construction.|$|E
50|$|Welding {{processes}} can {{generally be}} grouped into two categories: fusion and diffusion welding. Fusion welding involves localized melting of the metals at the weld interfaces, and {{is common in}} electric or gas welding techniques. This requires temperatures {{much higher than the}} melting point of the metal in order to cause localized melting before the heat can thermally conduct away from the weld, and often a filler metal is used to keep the weld from segregating. Diffusion welding consists of joining the metals without melting them, welding the surfaces together while in the solid state. In diffusion welding, the heat source is often lower than the melting point of the metal, allowing more even heat-distribution thus reducing thermal stresses at the weld. In this method a filler metal is typically not used, but the weld occurs directly between the metals at the weld interface. This includes methods such as cold welding, <b>explosion</b> <b>welding,</b> and forge welding. Unlike other diffusion methods, in forge welding the metals are heated to a high temperature before forcing them together, usually resulting in greater plasticity at the weld surfaces. This generally makes forge welding more versatile than cold-diffusion techniques, which are usually performed on soft metals like copper or aluminum. In forge welding, the entire welding areas are heated evenly. Forge welding can be used for a much wider range of harder metals and alloys, like steel and titanium.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{pulse welding}} (MPW) {{is a solid}} state welding process that uses {{magnetic}} forces to weld two workpieces together. The welding mechanism is most {{similar to that of}} <b>explosion</b> welding.Magnetic pulse <b>welding</b> started in the early 1970s, when the automotive industry began to use solid state welding. The biggest advantage using magnetic pulse welding is that the formation of brittle intermetallic phases is avoided. Therefore, dissimilar metals can be welded, which cannot be joined by fusion welding. With magnetic pulse welding high quality welds in similar and dissimilar metals can be made in microseconds without the need for shielding gases or welding consumables.|$|R

Smaller distance promotes the formation of waves with lower parameters (of length and height), whereas greater distances allow forming the bond of a more pronounced, repetitive wavy character, however, increasing the quantity of the fusion zone at the same time. Also, the initial distance between the materials to be joined makes for the strengthening in the areas adjacent to bond boundary.
