5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in <b>developing</b> countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in <b>developing</b> countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the <b>developing</b> world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many <b>developing</b> countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some <b>developing</b> countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most <b>developing</b> countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in <b>developing</b> countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in <b>developing</b> countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many <b>developing</b> nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in <b>developing</b> countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if <b>developing</b> countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

40|$|Firms have {{to invest}} in foreign markets to {{maintain}} their competitive advantage, but a popular location for foreign direct investment (FDI) may not be suitable for everyone. Available literature as to location choice is mainly based on <b>developed</b> countries and large multinational enterprises (MNEs). However, this study investigates the location choice behaviour of firms originating in newly industrialized economies (Taiwanese firms) investing in emerging countries (China and Vietnam). According to the national economic development of China (further divided into South China and East China) and Vietnam, we divide the location into more <b>developed</b> and less <b>developed</b> regions. Through an empirical firm-level data collection and conditional logit analysis, this study found that: (1) firms with stronger ownership advantages prefer to invest in more <b>developed</b> than less <b>developed</b> regions; (2) firms occupying favourable positions in their network prefer to invest in more <b>developed</b> than less <b>developed</b> regions; (3) firms {{with a high degree}} of networking prefer to invest in less <b>developed</b> than more <b>developed</b> regions; (4) firms choose to invest in more <b>developed</b> than less <b>developed</b> regions to gain access to a large market; and (5) firms with strong resource-seeking motives prefer to invest in more <b>developed</b> than less <b>developed</b> regions to access their resources.
