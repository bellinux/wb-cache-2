2500|$|Since its {{inception}} in 2000, the Cuban Day Parade of New Jersey {{has become a major}} annual event in North Hudson, beginning in North Bergen and traveling south to its end in Union City. Union City has historically been a family-oriented city predominantly made up of brownstones, two-family homes and locally owned businesses. Beginning approximately in 2003, it underwent a period of development of modestly sized residences, spurred by similar development in neighboring Hoboken, and the city's attempt to attract developers to what had historically been a town unfriendly to them, according to Mayor Brian P. Stack. Through approval of varied construction projects {{to address the needs of}} residents of <b>different</b> <b>incomes,</b> improved rent control laws and community input on such issues, this [...] "Hobokenization" [...] resulted in positive comparisons with the redeveloped Hoboken of the mid-to-late 1990s, with new restaurants, bars and art galleries cited as evidence of renewal. The city recorded $192 million in new construction in 2007, and 600 certificates of occupancy, with 500-700 projected for 2008–2009, compared with previous years, in which 50 certificates was considered a high amount. This development continued for several years, reaching a milestone in 2008 with the completion of Union City's first high-rise condominium tower, The Thread, whose name evokes the city's historical association with the embroidery industry. Other such buildings have followed, such as the Altessa, Park City Grand, and The Lenox. In 2015 the AARP ranked Union City #6 on its list of the best small cities to live in.|$|E
60|$|When {{that problem}} is at last faced, the {{question}} of the proportion in which the national income shall be distributed can have only one answer. All our shares must be equal. It has always been so; it always will be so. It is true that the incomes of robbers vary considerably from individual to individual; and the variation is reflected in the incomes of their parasites. The commercialization of certain exceptional talents has also produced exceptional incomes, direct and derivative. Persons who live on rent of land and capital are economically, though not legally, in the category of robbers, and have grotesquely <b>different</b> <b>incomes.</b> But in the huge mass of mankind variation Of income from individual to individual is unknown, because it is ridiculously impracticable. As a device for persuading a carpenter that a judge is a creature of superior nature to himself, to be deferred and submitted to even to the death, we may give a carpenter a hundred pounds a year and a judge five thousand; but the wage for one carpenter is the wage for all the carpenters: the salary for one judge is the salary for all the judges.|$|E

50|$|Open {{spaces in}} urban environments, such as parks, playgrounds, and natural areas, can provide many health, cultural, recreational, and {{economic}} {{benefits to the}} communities nearby. However, access to open spaces can be unequal for people of <b>different</b> <b>incomes.</b> In California’s two largest metropolitan regions, Los Angeles County in Southern California and the Bay Area in Northern California, access to green space and natural areas varies with the predominate races and classes of the communities. This also holds true in San Diego County in Southern California. Both expanding urbanization and diminishing funding for open space tend to widen these gaps in accessibility. Because open space is associated with various mental and physical benefits, a lack of it can pose health consequences. However, {{more research is needed}} to determine how environmental inequalities translate into long-term health inequalities.|$|E
5000|$|Linked {{processing}} {{of the data}} for housing allowances and for sickness insurance {{has taken place in}} Sweden since 1979. This has created, in the words of Eckart Kuhlborn, [...] "a crime prevention eldorado" [...] by making it possible to identify households which have reported <b>different</b> <b>incomes.</b> A check of 70% of the households that received both kinds of payments showed that 2.7% had cheated by giving false information about their incomes. The next year, the figure had decreased to 1.2%. As the check was discussed in the mass media before it was executed the first year, recipients of housing allowances may have been aware of the risk with cheating, so a higher level of fraud before the check - and a greater preventive effect - cannot be ruled out. Neither can it be known how many were smart enough to under-report their income to all the relevant bodies (although under-reporting incomes to sickness insurance authorities would mean a smaller dole in case of sickness).|$|E

5000|$|A guide book {{or travel}} guide is [...] "a book of {{information}} about a place, designed {{for the use of}} visitors or tourists". An early example is Thomas West's guide to the Lake District, published in 1778. Thomas West, an English priest, popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the Lake District of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed: to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations. [...] To this end he included various 'stations' or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities. [...] Published in 1778 the book was a major success.It will usually include full details relating to accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities.

40|$|Equal {{access to}} {{healthcare}} facilities and high-level {{quality of care}} are important strategies to eliminate the disparity in outcome of care. However, the existing literature regarding how urban or rural dwelling patients with <b>different</b> <b>income</b> level select healthcare providers is insufficient. The {{purposes of this study}} were to examine whether differences of healthcare provider selection exist among urban and rural coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) patients with <b>different</b> <b>income</b> level. If so, we further investigated the associated impact on mortality. A retrospective, multilevel study design was conducted using claims data from 2007 - 2011 Taiwan's Universal Health Insurance Scheme. Healthcare providers' performance and patients' travelling distance to hospitals were used to define the patterns of healthcare provider selection. Baron and Kenny's procedures for mediation effect were conducted. There were 10, 108 CABG surgeries included in this study. The results showed that urban dwelling and higher income patients were prone to receive care from better-performance providers. The travelling distances of urban dwelling patients was 15 KM shorter, especially when they received better-performance provider's care. The results also showed that the difference of healthcare provider selection and mortality rate existed between rural and urban dwelling patients with <b>different</b> <b>income</b> levels. After the procedure of mediation effect testing, the results showed that the healthcare provider selection partially mediated the relationships between patients' residential areas with <b>different</b> <b>income</b> levels and 30 -day mortality. Preferences of healthcare provider selection vary among rural and urban patients with <b>different</b> <b>income,</b> and such differences partially mediated the outcome of care. Health authorities should pay attention to this issue, and propose appropriate solutions to eliminate the disparity in outcome of CABG care...|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews {{methods of}} {{comparing}} income tax progression. Section II deals with local measures of tax progression, Section III with global measures of tax progression, and Section IV with uniform tax progression. It is shown {{that all of}} this measures have specific drawbacks: they either ignore the income distribution altogether, aggregate over income intervals with pro-gression and regression, or they require that the same income distribution holds for comparisons of different tax schedules. However, realistic comparisons of tax progression ask for comparisons of different tax schedules associated with <b>different</b> <b>income</b> distributions. This is addressed in Section V for uniform tax progression with <b>different</b> <b>income</b> distributions. A respective condition of higher progression turns out as the sum of elasticities of the tax schedule and the density function of the income distribution.
