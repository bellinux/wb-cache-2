50|$|Other {{energetic}} {{materials in the}} vicinity of the pit also influence its safety. US missile propellants come in two general classes. The class 1.3, fire hazard but very difficult to impossible to detonate; an example is 70% ammonium perchlorate, 16% aluminium, and 14% binder. The class 1.1, both fire and detonation hazard, is a <b>double-base</b> <b>propellant</b> based on cross-linked polymer, containing 52% HMX, 18% nitroglycerine, 18% aluminium, 4% ammonium perchlorate, and 8% binder. The 1.1 propellant has 4% higher specific impulse (about 270 s versus 260 s), giving an 8% longer range for constant burning time. The insensitive high explosives are also less powerful, necessitating larger and heavier warheads, which reduces the missile range - or sacrificing some yield. The safety/performance tradeoff is especially important for e.g. submarines. As of 1990, the Trident SLBMs used both detonable fuel and non-insensitive explosives.|$|E
50|$|Detonation {{velocities}} are {{of limited}} value {{in assessing the}} reaction rates of nitrocellulose propellants formulated to avoid detonation. Although the slower reaction {{is often described as}} burning because of similar gaseous end products at elevated temperatures, the decomposition differs from combustion in an oxygen atmosphere. Conversion of nitrocellulose propellants to high-pressure gas proceeds from the exposed surface to the interior of each solid particle in accordance with Piobert's law. Studies of solid single- and <b>double-base</b> <b>propellant</b> reactions suggest reaction rate is controlled by heat transfer through the temperature gradient across a series of zones or phases as the reaction proceeds from the surface into the solid. The deepest portion of the solid experiencing heat transfer melts and begins phase transition from solid to gas in a foam zone. The gaseous propellant decomposes into simpler molecules in a surrounding fizz zone. Energy is released in a luminous outer flame zone where the simpler gas molecules react to form conventional combustion products like steam and carbon monoxide. The foam zone acts as an insulator slowing the rate of heat transfer from the flame zone into the unreacted solid. Reaction rates vary with pressure; because the foam allows less effective heat transfer at low pressure, with greater heat transfer as higher pressures compress the gas volume of that foam. Propellants designed for a minimum heat transfer pressure may fail to sustain the flame zone at lower pressures.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were two}} types of {{cartridge}}. The [...] "normal" [...] cartridge contained three cloth charge bags (coloured red, white and blue). White or blue bags would {{be removed from the}} cartridge to give [...] "charge one" [...] or [...] "charge two", leaving all three bags in the cartridge case gave [...] "charge three". The cartridge case was closed at the top with a leatherboard cup. The second type of cartridge was [...] "super", which provided one charge only. The cup could not be removed from the cartridge case. In 1943, an incremental charge of 5.5 oz of cordite ("super-plus") was introduced to raise the muzzle velocity when firing armour-piercing shot with charge super; this required a muzzle brake to be fitted. Adoption of [...] "upper-register" [...] (high-angle) fire needed more charges to improve the range overlap. This {{led to the development of}} the [...] "intermediate increment" [...] of 4oz cordite, which was introduced in 1944. The bags were striped red and white to indicate that they should only be used with charges one and two. When one bag was used with charge 1 it provided charge 1/2. When one was added to charge 2 it provided charge 2 1/3, and two bags, charge 2 2/3. This allowed a range of seven different charges instead of four.There were many marks of cartridge, mostly differentiated by propellant type. <b>Double-base</b> <b>propellant</b> (nitrocellulose/nitroglycerine) was the UK standard but one mark used US single-base (nitrocellulose only). However, triple-base nitrocellulose/nitroglycerine/picrite was used throughout the war and eventually replaced all others.|$|E

5000|$|Solid {{propellants}} {{are either}} [...] "composites" [...] composed mostly of large, distinct macroscopic particles or single-, double-, or triple-bases (depending {{on the number}} of primary ingredients), which are homogeneous mixtures of one or more primary ingredients. Composites typically consist of a mixture of granules of solid oxidizer (examples: ammonium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate, potassium nitrate) in a polymer binder (binding agent) with flakes or powders of energetic compounds (examples: RDX, HMX), metallic additives (examples: aluminium, beryllium), plasticizers, stabilizers, and/or burn rate modifiers (iron oxide, copper oxide). Single-, double-, or triple-bases are mixtures of the fuel, oxidizer, binders, and plasticizers that are macroscopically indistinguishable and often blended as liquids and cured in a single batch. Often, the ingredients of a <b>double-base</b> <b>propellant</b> have multiple roles such as RDX which is both a fuel and oxidizer or nitrocellulose which is a fuel, oxidizer, and plasticizer. Further complicating categorization, there are many propellants that contain elements of double-base and composite propellants, which often contain some amount of energetic additives homogeneously mixed into the binder. In the case of gunpowder (a pressed composite without a polymeric binder) the fuel is charcoal, the oxidizer is potassium nitrate, and sulphur serves as a catalyst. (Note: sulphur is not a true catalyst in gunpowder as it is consumed to a great extent into a variety of reaction products such as K2S.) During the 1950s and 60s researchers in the United States developed ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP). This mixture is typically 69-70% finely ground ammonium perchlorate (an oxidizer), combined with 16-20% fine aluminium powder (a fuel), held together in a base of 11-14% polybutadiene acrylonitrile (PBAN) or Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (polybutadiene rubber fuel). The mixture is formed as a thickened liquid and then cast into the correct shape and cured into a firm but flexible load-bearing solid. Historically the tally of APCP solid propellants is relatively small. The military, however, uses a wide variety of different types of solid propellants some of which exceed the performance of APCP. A comparison of the highest specific impulses achieved with the various solid and liquid propellant combinations used in current launch vehicles is given in the article on solid-fuel rockets.|$|E

40|$|The current MK 66 2. 75 inch Rocket Motor <b>double-base</b> <b>propellant</b> {{contains}} the lead-based ballistic modifier LC- 12 - 15 {{to achieve the}} desired plateau and mesa burning rate characteristics. The use of lead compounds poses {{a concern for the}} environment and for personal safety due to the metal's toxic nature when introduced into the atmosphere by propellant manufacture, rocket motor firing, and disposal. Copper beta-resorcylate (copper 2, 4 -di-hydroxy-benzoate) was successfully used in propellant as a simple modifier in the mid 1970 's. This and other compounds have also been mixed with lead salts to obtain more beneficial ballistic results. Synthesized complexes of lead and copper compounds soon replaced the mixtures. The complexes incorporate the lead, copper lack of organic liquids, which allows for easier propellant processing. About ten years ago, the Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), initiated an effort to develop a lead-free propellant for use in missile systems. Several lead-free propellant candidate formulations were developed. About five years ago, NSWC, in conjunction with Alliant Techsystems, Radford Army Ammunition Plant, continued ballistic modifier investigations. A four component ballistic modifier system without lead for double-base propellants that provide adequate plateau and mesa burn rate characteristics was developed and patented. The ballistic modifier's system contains bismuth subsalicylate, 1. 5 percent; copper salicylate, 1. 0 percent, copper stannate, 0. 77 percent; and carbon black, 0. 1 percent. Action time and impulse data obtained through multiple static firings indicate that the new lead-free <b>double-base</b> <b>propellant,</b> while not a match for NOSIH-AA- 2, will be a very suitable replacement in the 2. 75 inch Rocket Motor.

A comprehensive study showed that an increased rate of stabilizer depletion occurred in propellants containing monobasic copper salicylate. The study also showed that propellants containing a mixture of bismuth subsalicylate and copper salicylate, had only about one-half the stabilizer depletion rate than those with copper salicylate alone. The copper salicylate catalyzes the decomposition of nitroglycerin, which triggers a chain of events leading to the increased rate of stabilizer depletion.

The calculated results are consistent with the experimental data, so the reliability of the models is confirmed. The temperature distribution and the extent of the afterburning of the plume are distinct for the propellants of different energy characteristics, therefore the plume radiation varies for different propellants.
