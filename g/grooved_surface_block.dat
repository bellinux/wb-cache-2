40|$|The {{impact of}} water drops on a <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> exhibiting {{hydrophobic}} features is studied experimentally. The <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> {{is made of}} stainless steel and is comprised of a structure of unidirectional grooves. The groove structure yielded contact angles 135 ô and 107 ô for water on the surface perpendicular to the groove direction and parallel to the groove direction respectively compared to 80 ô on a smooth stainless steel surface. The influence of groove structure on the drop impact process is studied by comparing the experimental results of drop impact on the <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> with those obtained for the smooth <b>surface.</b> The <b>groove</b> structure alters {{the shape of the}} liquid lamella spreading on the <b>grooved</b> <b>surface.</b> For the impact of high inertia drops on the <b>grooved</b> <b>surface,</b> the droplet liquid flowing inside the grooves ejects out as tiny droplets during early stages of the impact. On the <b>grooved</b> <b>surface,</b> the impacting drop spreads along the groove direction in a similar manner as observed on the smooth surface, and the solid pillars of the <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> hinder the spreading of droplet liquid perpendicular to the groove direction.

Aiming for the application in a dipole-type magnetic field, various shapes of triangular <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces</b> have been studied at KEK. The grooves tested here have vertex angles of 20 − 30 °, depths of 2. 5 − 5. 0 mm, and vertex roundness of 0. 05 − 0. 2 mm. In a laboratory, the secondary electron yields (SEY) of small test pieces were measured using an electron beam in a magnetic-free condition. The <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces</b> clearly had low SEY compared to flat surfaces of the same materials. The grooves with sharper vertexes had smaller SEY.

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} the coalescence of two droplets on decimillimeter-scaled <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{by using a}} high-speed camera and compared the coalescence process of isometric/anisometric droplets on parallel/vertical <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces.</b> During the experiment, a syringe needle was inserted {{from the bottom of}} the substrates in order to obtain a horizontal coalescence of a preplaced static droplet and a slowly growing quasi-static droplet. The results show that the whole coalescence process can be divided into the coalesce process and the oscillation process. When the droplets are isometric, on parallel <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces,</b> due to the guiding effect of grooves, they oscillate sharply by the direction of grooves, accompanied by reciprocating contact line. On vertical <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces,</b> limited by the energy barrier of vertical grooves, the oscillation of droplet is weaker and the contact line is almost fixed, while the vertical amplitude of oscillation is distinct. Different phenomena are observed when the droplets are anisometric: the smaller droplet is attracted to the other side, resulting in an asymmetrical coalescence process. Besides, the height of liquid bridge, the lasting time of coalescence and the length of contact line increase as the overall volume of the two droplets increases...|$|R

40|$|This paper reports an {{experimental}} investigation of low Weber number water drops impacting onto solid surfaces exhibiting anisotropic wetting. The wetting anisotropy {{is created by}} patterning the solid surfaces with unidirectional parallel grooves. Temporal measurements of impacting drop parameters such as drop base contact diameter, apparent contact angle of drop, and drop height at the center are obtained from high-speed video recordings of drop impacts. The study shows {{that the impact of}} low Weber number water drops on the <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> exhibits beating phenomenon in the temporal variations of the dynamic contact angle anisotropy and drop height {{at the center of the}} impacting drop. It is observed that the beating phenomenon of impacting drop parameters is caused by the frequency difference between the dynamic contact angle oscillations of impacting drop liquid oriented perpendicular and parallel to the direction of grooves on the <b>grooved</b> <b>surface.</b> The primary trigger for the phenomenon is the existence of non-axisymmetric drop flow on the <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> featuring pinned and free motions of drop liquid in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the grooves, respectively. The beat frequency is almost independent of the impact drop Weber number. Further experimental measurements with solid <b>surfaces</b> of different <b>groove</b> textures show that the <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> with larger wetting anisotropy may be expected to show a dominant beating phenomenon. The phenomenon is gradually damped out with time and is fully unrecognizable at higher drop impact Weber numbers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a numerical analysis and experimental study on condensation heat transfer and fluid flow for filmwise condensation on trapezoid <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces.</b> First, a physical model was properly simplified {{based on some}} reasonable assumptions. Then, the coupled non-linear governing equations for the mass transfer, fluid flow, and two-dimensional thermal conduction were developed. The relationship between z-coordinate and heat transfer was obtained by solving the equations numerically. The influences of groove length and basic angle were discussed. The calculation {{results showed that the}} heat flux decreased with increase in groove length, and the decline range also decreased gradually. The calculation results also suggested that the heat flux through groove with α[*]=[*] 60 ° was lower than the groove with α[*]=[*] 75 ° {{at the top of the}} groove, while the opposite conclusion was obtained at the low parts. The distributions of wall temperature and heat flux on trapezoid groove were also studied systematically. The distribution of surface temperature and heat flux presents obvious lateral inhomogeneity, and the maximum wall temperature and heat flux were both obtained in region II. The thermal resistance of groove with α[*]=[*] 60 ° was lower but the liquid-discharged ability was better than that of groove with α[*]=[*] 75 °. In order to validate the feasibility and reliability of the present analyses and to further investigate the heat transfer performance of trapezoid <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces,</b> experiments were carried out with three condensing plates including two trapezoid <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces</b> in different physical dimensions and one smooth surface. The experimental data obtained under various schooling were compared with the calculations, and the experimental results for different condensing plates are all in good agreement with the numerical model, with a maximum deviation less than 15 %. Moreover, the trapezoid grooves can enhance the condensation heat transfer by 1. 5 – 2. 5 times higher than the smooth surface.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of a liquid drop {{with a solid}} surface is being actively studied to understand practically encountered scenarios such as the impact of fuel spray droplets onto the walls of engine combustion chamber, the formation of thermal barrier coating on the surfaces of turbine blades, the process of ink-jet printing, etc. The surface topography of solid surface {{is one of the}} major parameters influencing the dynamics of drop-surface interaction process. Understanding the precise role of surface topography features such as micro asperities and grooves on the spreading and receding processes of impacting liquid drops is crucial for the improvement in abovementioned applications. Recent developments in the fabrication of micro- and nano-structures on solid surfaces provide fabulous opportunities to investigate the role of single/multiple micro asperities and grooves on the dynamics of impacting drops. The thesis deals with an experimental work on the impact of water drops on stainless steel surfaces comprising unidirectional parallel grooves. A group of six target <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces</b> covering a wide range of surface wettability were considered. The target surfaces were prepared using the techniques of photolithography, electro discharge machining, and laser machining. Scanning electron microscope and optical surface profilometer were used to characterize the groove texture geometrical parameters of the target <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The experiments of drop impact were carried out in an experimental apparatus consisting of a liquid drop generator, a substrate table, and a digital video imaging system. Free-falling distilled water drops released from a certain height were allowed to impact normally on the target surfaces. The image sequences of drop impact dynamics were constructed from the images captured using the digital video imaging system. Majority of the drop impact experiments were captured using a high speed video camera operating with frame speed ranging from 3000 to 10000 fps. For the target <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the impact dynamics was analyzed for the impacting drop liquid oriented both in the direction perpendicular to the grooves () and in the direction parallel to the grooves (||) via independent test runs. The captured digital frames were used to deduce the temporal variation of impacting drop parameters such as drop contact diameter, drop contact angle, and drop height at the center of impacting drop with the aid of image processing software. The impacting drops were characterized in terms of Weber number, We expressed in terms of drop impact velocity and drop diameter measured just before the start of impact process. The study covered We ranging from 1. 8 to 170. In general, the groove texture on the solid surface influences the drop impact process for all We examined in the study. The effect is more pronounced for the receding of impacting drops. For high We drops, the groove texture enhances the perturbations seen at the periphery of spreading lamella. The study showed quantitatively that the drop impact process on a target <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> comprising unidirectional parallel grooves develops a non-axisymmetric drop flow on the <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> exhibiting different spreading and receding processes of impacting drop liquid in the directions perpendicular () and parallel (||) to the grooves. The maximum spreading diameter reached immediately after the completion of early inertia-dominated spreading in is less than that obtained in || due to the loss of drop kinetic energy caused by the pinned motion of drop liquid in. The non- axisymmetric drop flow on the target <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> develops a difference between the frequencies of contact angle oscillation of impacting drop liquid in  and ||. The frequency difference in contact angle oscillation causes the beating phenomenon in the temporal variation of the contact angle anisotropy, Δθ and drop height at the center of impacting drop, Z. For a given target <b>grooved</b> <b>surface,</b> the experimental measurements suggested that the beat frequency is almost independent of We. The temporal variation of Δθ and Z do not show the traces of beating phenomenon for the impact of high We drops. Owing to the non-axisymmetric drop flow, the final equilibrium drop shape is eccentric for the impact of low We drops and approaches a circular shape for the impact of high We drops. The role of groove texture geometrical parameters is seen in the drop impact process via the surface wettability especially for the impact of low We drops.
