40|$|Procedures for {{and results}} of aeroservothermoelastic studies are described. The {{objectives}} {{of these studies}} were to develop the necessary procedures for performing an aeroelastic analysis of an aerodynamically <b>heated</b> <b>vehicle</b> and to analyze a configuration in the classical cold state and in a hot state. Major tasks include {{the development of the}} structural and aerodynamic models, open loop analyses, design of active control laws for improving dynamic responses and analyses of the closed loop vehicles. The analyses performed focused on flutter speed calculations, short period eigenvalue trends and statistical analyses of the vehicle response to controls and turbulence. Improving the ride quality of the vehicle and raising the flutter boundary of the aerodynamically-heated vehicle up to that of the cold vehicle were the objectives of the control law design investigations...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} National AeroSpace Plane (NASP) {{is designed}} to travel at speeds up to Mach 25. Because aerodynamic heating during high-speed flight through the atmosphere could destiffen a structure, significant couplings between the elastic and rigid body modes could result in lower flutter speeds and more pronounced aeroelastic response characteristics. These speeds will also generate thermal loads on the structure. The purpose {{of this research is}} develop methodologies applicable to the NASP and to apply them to a representative model to determine its aerothermoelastic characteristics when subjected to these thermal loads. This paper describes an aerothermoelastic analysis of the generic hypersonic vehicle configuration. The steps involved in this analysis were: (1) generating vehicle surface temperatures at the appropriate flight conditions; (2) applying these temperatures to the vehicle's structure to predict changes in the stiffness resulting from material property degradation; (3) predicting the vibration characteristics of the heated structure at the various temperature conditions; (4) performing aerodynamic analyses; and (5) conducting flutter analysis of the <b>heated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Results of these analyses and conclusions representative of a NASP vehicle are provided in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Melting of {{the snow}} and ice (S/I) on a road and the {{subsequent}} refreezing often cause traffic accidents. These phase changes tend to occur after traffic jam below the freezing point and is changeable to ‘black ice’. However, the consideration about {{the relation between the}} <b>vehicle</b> related <b>heats</b> (<b>vehicle</b> <b>heats)</b> and ‘black ice’ has been inadequate. There are many road freezing forecasting (RFF) models, but most of them have not given careful consideration to the thermal influence of vehicles on the S/I conditions. We have developed an extended RFF model in consideration of three kinds of <b>vehicle</b> <b>heats,</b> i. e. tire frictional <b>heat,</b> <b>vehicle</b> radiant <b>heat</b> and sensible <b>heat</b> due to <b>vehicle</b> passage and it is named <b>vehicle</b> <b>heat</b> RFF (VHRFF) model. Numerical simulations using the VHRFF model were conducted to understand the influence of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>heats</b> on the S/I conditions associated with traffic stop and go at a traffic light. The numerical results could show that the <b>vehicle</b> <b>heats</b> have the potential to melt and to freeze the S/I on a road surface, and inferred that the melting and refreezing eventually induce the formation of ‘black ice’ on the road...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{examining}} the thermal influence of <b>vehicle</b> related <b>heats</b> (<b>vehicle</b> <b>heats)</b> {{on the road}} surface temperature and evaluating the validity of a vehicle road freezing forecasting (VRFF) model proposed by the present authors. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>heats</b> consist of the tire frictional <b>heat,</b> the <b>vehicle</b> radiant <b>heat</b> emitted downward {{from the bottom of}} a vehicle and the <b>vehicle</b> sensible <b>heat</b> due to vehicle-induced wind. In order to calculate the road surface temperature in a vehicle-passage area, the three <b>vehicle</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes are included in a heat balance equation of the road surface layer in addition to metrological heat fluxes. A thermography observation targeted a roadway near a traffic light in Fukui city that has two-three lanes each way. Stopping and starting of vehicles (vehicles stop and go) are repeated due to the traffic light on only one side all day. It was shown that the difference in the road surface temperature on the lane between with and without the vehicles stop and go became clear as an atmospheric temperature fell. For example, the former was about 3. 5 °C higher than the latter in the nighttime. This is caused by the tire frictional <b>heat</b> and the <b>vehicle</b> radiant <b>heat.</b> he validity of the VRFF model was identified by comparing the calculated road surface temperature with the experimental one obtained from the thermography observation. The VRFF model could reproduce almost the same temperature rise due to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>heats</b> as the outcome of the thermography observation...|$|R

This paper describes the model development and experimental validation of the Fusible Heat Sink technology. The model developed was intended to meet the radiation and heat rejection requirements of a nominal MMSEV mission. Development parameters and results, including sizing and model performance will be discussed. From this flight-sized model, a scaled test-article design was modeled, designed, and fabricated for experimental validation of the technology at Johnson Space Center thermal vacuum chamber facilities. Testing showed performance comparable to the model at nominal loads and the capability to maintain heat loads substantially greater than nominal for extended periods of time...|$|R
