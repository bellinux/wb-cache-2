40|$|Bathsheba 2 ̆ 7 s {{actions in}} 2 Sam. 11. 2 - 4 {{identify}} crucial aspects of her character. Past commentators interpret these words {{in connection with}} menstrual purification, stressing the certain paternity of David 2 ̆ 7 s adulterine child. This article demonstrates that the participles rōheset and mitqaddesšet and the noun mittum 2 ̆ 7 ātāh do not denote menstrual cleansing. Bathsheba 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>washing</b> is an innocent bath. She is the only individual human to self-sanctify, placing her {{in the company of}} the Israelite deity. The syntax of the verse necessitates that her action of self-sanctifying occurs simultaneously as David lies with her. The three focal terms highlight the important legitimacy of Bathsheba before the Israelite deity, her identity as a non-Israelite, her role as queen mother of the Solomonic line, and her full participation in the narrative...|$|R
40|$|A novel ansamycin, {{rifamycin}} W, {{was isolated}} from a mutant strain of Nocardia mediterranei. The metabolic origin of rifamycin W was studied by 13 C {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy. Examination of the proton-decoupled pulse and Fourier transform 13 C spectra of rifamycin W biogenetically enriched with [1 - 13 C]-, [2 - 13 C]-, and [3 - 13 C]propionate and with [1 - 13 C]acetate has revealed that the alignment of acetate and propionate units corresponds to that previously proposed for rifamycin <b>S.</b> <b>Washed</b> mycelium from a rifamycin B-producing strain of N. mediterranei transformed rifamycin W into rifamycin B. We suggest that rifamycin W is a normal intermediate in the biosynthesis of the other rifamycins. These results, together with the structural similarity of rifamycin W to the streptovaricins, reinforce our hypothesis that a common progenitor {{is involved in the}} biogenesis of all naphthalenic ansamycins...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} new surface {{to ensure a}} proper spacing between immobilized biomolecules. While DNA microarray on this surface provided each probe DNA with ample space for hybridization with incoming target DNAs, the microarray showed enhanced discrimination efficiency for various types of single nucleotide polymorphism. The high discrimination efficiency holds for all tested cases (100 :, 1 for internal mismatched cases; 100 :, 28 for terminal mismatched ones). In addition, by investigating influence of hybridization temperature and washing condition on the fluorescence intensity and the discrimination efficiency with and without controlled mesospacing, {{it was observed that}} the nanoscale-controlled surface showed good discrimination efficiency {{in a wide range of}} temperature (37 – 50 C), and hybridization behavior on the surface was in agreement with the solution one. Intriguingly, it was found that washing process after the hybridization was critical for the high discrimination efficiency. For the particular case, washing process was so efficient that only 30 <b>s</b> <b>washing</b> was sufficient to reach the optimal discrimination ratio...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects of}} cool water washing on the microbial quality of shell eggs. Six dual tank wash water temperature schemes were examined for their ability to reduce naturally occurring aerobic bacteria and inoculated Salmonella Enteritidis (SE). The wash water schemes were: T 1 = 48. 9 o C; T 2 = 48. 9 o C, 23. 9 o C; T 3 = 48. 9 o C, 15. 6 o C; T 4 = 23. 9 o C; T 5 = 15. 6 o C; and T 6 = 23. 9 o C, 15. 6 o C. All wash water tanks were maintained from 10. 5 - 11. 5 pH throughout the study. Eggs were exposed to the wash water temperature schemes in a pilot egg washer with recirculating wash water tanks. The total amount of time eggs were exposed to the wash water combinations was 60 <b>s.</b> Following <b>washing,</b> all eggs were sprayed with a 48. 9 o C, 200 ppm chlorine rinse solution. Eggs were stored and sampled for 9 wks. External aerobic populations were lowest for T 1 (typical U. <b>S.</b> <b>wash</b> water configuration), followed by T 2 and T 3. Aerobic surface contamination was greatest in T 5 eggs. All treatments reduced SE levels in a similar manner as detected by shell and membrane emulsion and egg contents pools after enrichment. Commercial application of cool water shell egg processing will be investigated to determine the potential of this technology to enhance the safety and quality of shell eggs...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} devoted to an {{investigation}} on a Four Species (S 1, S 2, S 3, S 4) Syn Eco-System with Commensal Prey-Predator pair with Prey-Predator pair of Hosts (Host of <b>S</b> 1 <b>washed</b> out states). The System comprises of a Prey (S 1), a Predator (S 2) that survives upon S 1, two Hosts S 3 and S 4 for which S 1, S 2 are Commensal respectively i. e., S 3 and S 4 benefit S 1 and S 2 respectively, without getting effected either positively or adversely. Further S 3 is Prey for S 4 and S 4 is Predator for S 3. The pair (S 1, S 2) may be referred as 1 st level Prey-Predator and the pair (S 3, S 4) the 2 nd level Prey-Predator. The model equations of the system constitute a set of four first order non-linear ordinary differential coupled equations. In all, there are sixteen equilibrium points. Criteria for the asymptotic stability of four of these sixteen equilibrium points: Host of <b>S</b> 1 <b>washed</b> out states is established. The system would be stable if all the characteristic roots are negative, in case they are real, and have negative real parts, in case they are complex. The linearized equations for the perturbations over the equilibrium points are analyzed to establish the criteria for stability and the trajectories are illustrated...|$|R
