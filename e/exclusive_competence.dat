Hessen is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) or the center-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).

25|$|EU {{member states}} retain all powers not {{explicitly}} handed to the European Union.

In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, it is {{suggested}} that the management of the CFP could be improved through the application of the theory of subsidiarity—the principle that political decisions should be handled at the lowest, least-centralised competent level. The subsidiarity principle was introduced into EU policies as part of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty; however, it does not apply to areas such as the CFP over which the Community retains <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence.</b> A partial devolution of authority, for example involving Member States in the decision-making process and delegating the day-to-day management of fisheries to industry-based organisations, could potentially facilitate the inclusion of industry concerns into the CFP, involving those directly affected by the policy in management decisions and creating to a CFP which encourages compliance and collaboration.|$|E

The reform abolishes concurrent competence between State and regions on one hand, but on the other it limits many areas of <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> for the State to [...] "general and common dispositions" [...] only (which was defined as [...] "concurrent competence" [...] in the pre-reform Constitution).|$|E

It also reflects a non-traditional conception of Europe's world role as a global [...] "civilian power", exercising collective influence in the functional spheres of trade and diplomacy, as an alternative to military dominance.

2500|$|The US Supreme Court {{policy of}} preemption, {{developed}} from 1953, means that states cannot legislate where the NLRA 1935 does operate. The NLRA 1935 contains no clause requiring preemption as is found, for example, in the Fair Labor Standards Act 1938 §218(a) where {{deviations from the}} minimum wage or maximum hours are preempted, unless they are more beneficial to the employee. The first major case, Garner v Teamsters Local 776, decided a Pennsylvania statute was preempted from providing superior remedies or processing claims quicker than the NLRB because [...] "the Board was vested with power to entertain petitioners' grievance, to issue its own complaint" [...] and apparent [...] "Congress evidently considered that centralized administration of specially designed procedures was necessary to obtain uniform application of its substantive rules". In San Diego Building Trades Council v Garmon, the Supreme Court held that the California Supreme Court was not entitled to award remedies against a union for picketing, because if [...] "an activity is arguably subject to §7 or §8 of the Act, the States {{as well as the}} federal courts must defer to the <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> of the National Labor Relations Board". This was true, even though the NLRB had not given any ruling on the dispute because its monetary value was too small. This reasoning was extended in Lodge 76, International Association of Machinists v Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, where a Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission sought to hold a union liable for an unfair labor practice, by refusing to work overtime. Brennan J held that such matters were to be left to [...] "be controlled by the free play of economic forces". While many of these judgments appeared beneficial to unions against hostile state courts or bodies, supportive actions also began to be held preempted. In Golden State Transit Corp v City of Los Angeles a majority of the Supreme Court held that Los Angeles was not entitled to refuse to renew a taxi company's franchise license because the Teamsters Union had pressured it not to until a dispute was resolved. Most recently in Chamber of Commerce v Brown seven judges on the Supreme Court held that California was preempted from passing a law prohibiting any recipient of state funds either from using money to promote or deter union organizing efforts. Breyer J and Ginsburg J dissented because the law was simply neutral to the bargaining process. State governments may, however, use their funds to procure corporations to do work that are union or labor friendly.|$|E

Although the result isthat the trade agreement with Singapore is‘mixed’, and therefore {{also needs to be}} ratified by all the 28 member states, this Opinion may actually contribute to the credibility and effectiveness of the EU’s trade policy. In line with the EU’s broadened trade competences, brought about by the Treaty of Lisbon, the Court confirmed that the EU has the <b>exclusive</b> <b>competences</b> to realise almost all its broad trade-related objectives in ‘EU-only’ FTAs, covering trade in goods, services, intellectual property rights, public procurement and sustainable development. If investor-state dispute settlement and portfolio investment are excluded, such future EU FTAs will not be jeopardised by 28 additional – and sometimes unpredictable – ratification procedures in the memberstates. The Commission should therefore pursue ‘EU-only’ FTAs and cover portfolio investment and investor-state dispute settlement, such as the new Investment Court System, in separate agreements, or not at all. Member states on the other hand should refrain from deliberately making EU FTAs mixed, as this would contradict the spirit of the Lisbon Treaty and the Court’s case-law...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} how the European Union operates in international negotiations resulting in a multilateral environmental agreement (MEA). As the European Community (EC) does not have <b>exclusive</b> <b>competences</b> on environmental issues, MEAs are mixed agreements, meaning that both the EC and the member states are a party to it. As a result, the EC and the member states participate in the negotiations. While the EC participation is regulated in article 300 TEC, which appoints the Commission as the negotiator, there is no legal framework at the EU level for the member states part (Delreux T., 2006). However, practice learns that the member states often decide to pool their voices and delegate negotiation autonomy to the Presidency or another member state. From a legal perspective, this generates a hybrid {{situation in which the}} Commission should negotiate for issues falling under EC competences and the member states separately (or via the Presidency or a third member state, if they want) for the issues of national competence. The two case studies in this paper on two negotiations on international chemicals management (PIC and POPs) point out that this hybrid situation is not always followed in practice. As speaking with a single voice is considered to increase the EU’s bargaining power, the EU negotiation arrangement and the question ‘who negotiates on behalf of the EU?’ become particularly relevant. To frame this question theoretically, I rely on principal-agent theory. The next section applies this model to the EU decision-making process during negotiations resulting in MEAs. Moreover, I extent the traditional model in a twofold way. Firstly, I introduce private information for the principals, the compellingness of the external environment and the cost of no agreement to understand this process. Secondly, I broaden the model for <b>exclusive</b> EC <b>competences</b> to shared competences and mixed agreements. In section 3, I apply this model on two international chemicals negotiations {{of the end of the}} 90 s: the Rotterdam PIC Convention and the Stockholm POPs Convention.

Clark, elected as a Whig {{but now a}} Republican, {{had to cope with}} a hostile majority in the Erie Canal Board {{at a time when the}} political situation was very unstable and party feeling rose high. In June 1856, a majority of the Canal Board, including Treasurer Clark, exchanged the workplace of two resident engineers attached to the Canal. The members of the Canal Board, including the Treasurer, were accused by Lt. Gov. Henry J. Raymond and State Engineer Silas Seymour of having committed an illegal act, having meddled in the <b>exclusive</b> <b>competences</b> of the State Engineer. On June 23, 1856, Treasurer Clark was suspended by Governor Clark, since the State Constitution provided for the possible suspension of the Treasurer but not the other state officers. Soon after, the Treasurer answered the accusation in a letter to the Governor, arguing that the Canal Board had powers to supersede the State Engineer, and that the Treasurer could not be suspended for acts committed as an ex officio member of any executive board, but only for his acts as Treasurer regarding the public funds, and the suspension was revoked.|$|R
40|$|Following the {{inclusion}} of the Common Commercial Policy in the <b>exclusive</b> <b>competences</b> of the European Union, a handful of policy adjustments have occurred. Among these adjustments, investment protection has been a remarkable one - given its new, exclusive framework and an already established, state-level practice. As the new policy stands, Bilateral Investment Treaties, which had been negotiated and executed by the EU Member States in the pre-Lisbon period, can now only be negotiated and executed by the EU. These prospective ‘EU BITs’, inter alia, aim for an even stronger mechanism for the protection of investors both in the EU and in third states. A strong protection mechanism inevitably calls for a strong Dispute Settlement Mechanism, and the establishment of a DSM may prove to be challenging. The EU currently faces several questions on its path to a tangible and reliable ‘EU BIT’, and arguably the most outstanding one is the question of the DSMs to be incorporated in these new agreements. What are the alternatives of a DSM for these new BITs? Which alternatives are currently utilizable and which ones are not? What are the current problems that the EU face, and how can those problems be tackled? Is the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes an alternative, and if not, why? Following a thorough overview, this paper aims to analyse the DSM alternatives for the EU {{to be used in the}} new EU BITs and ultimately provide a solid DSM proposal...|$|R
