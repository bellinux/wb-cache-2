5|$|During a raid {{against a}} group of surface elves, Drizzt finds himself unable to {{participate}} in the slaughter with his fellow drow. He pretends to kill an elf child, but actually helps her to escape. When the deception is discovered, Zaknafein is sacrificed in Drizzt's stead to appease Lloth, the drow's goddess. Following a war against another House, Drizzt curses his family and the evil drow ways and escapes Menzoberranzan into the Underdark. At this time he also acquires the statuette that allows him to summon the magical panther Guenhwyvar. Guenhwyvar travels by Drizzt's side as he makes <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the Realms.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} to Erfurt in Germany when Brand was four. Brand {{attended}} school until 1923 {{and said he had}} completed his Abitur. When he was 19 he went to stay with an uncle in New York, then worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the United States, washing dishes and working on roads and in mines. He joined the Communist Party, worked for the Comintern as a sailor, and sailed to Hawaii, the Philippines, South America, China, and Japan. In or around 1930 he returned to Erfurt, where his father had founded another telephone company. Brand took a job with the company and became a functionary with the Thuringian KPD (Communist Party of Germany).|$|E
5|$|Defrance had an {{extensive}} and successful military {{career in the}} French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. After the First Battle of Zurich, he refused a battlefield promotion to brigadier general, asking instead for a cavalry regiment; he received command of the 12th Regiment of Chasseurs-a-Cheval (light cavalry) as Chef-de-Brigade, a rank equivalent to colonel. He led this brigade in the campaigns of 17991800 in southwestern Germany and northern Italy. By 1805, he had been promoted to brigadier general. At the Battle of Austerlitz and the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt, he commanded a cavalry brigade of carabiniers in Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty's First Division. By the Battle of Borodino in September 1812, he had been promoted to general of division, commanding the 4th Cuirassier Division of Nansouty's reserves, where they charged the Shevardino redoubt. He fought <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> Germany to the Rhine River after the French loss at Leipzig and participated in the Six Days Campaign.|$|E
60|$|The Angel-that-had-been-Quinston {{smiled and}} passed on <b>his</b> <b>way,</b> pursued <b>across</b> {{the breadth of}} the Horse Guards Parade by a {{tiresome}} little sparrow that cheeped incessantly and furiously at him.|$|R
60|$|He was Mulligan Jacobs; and {{he picked}} <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back <b>across</b> {{the wreck of the}} bridge where the fore-topgallant-yard still lay, and came up to me unafraid, as implacable and bitter as ever.|$|R

5|$|From there, Crash {{crosses to}} the second of Cortex's islands. Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} {{and there is nothing}} more than a jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple at the start of a creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to the Cortex Island. Crash then navigates the Cortex Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E

25|$|Ney {{has been}} praised for his {{remarkable}} {{handling of the}} rearguard. For the loss of 229 men he had held Wellington up for an entire day, giving Masséna the time he needed to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the Mondego River. Wellington himself believed the entire French army was upon him, and was disappointed to discover that it was merely a rear-guard.|$|E
60|$|He {{thought it}} quite natural {{that she should}} dismiss him with a curt and condescending nod, and when she had swept majestically out of the room, he made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> humbly <b>across</b> the hall, then by the garden door out towards the tumble-down barn where he had {{tethered}} his old mare.|$|R
60|$|At such a time, when {{moon and}} stars threw a faint and mysterious {{light over the}} {{sleeping}} woods, and not a sound, save the cry of a restless bird, broke the silence, a young countryman made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> rapidly <b>across</b> the horse-shoe meadow to the bend of the stream under Red Scar.|$|R
500|$|... {{the loss}} of a {{distinguished}} researcher, teacher, leader and mentor." [...] In a short obituary of Moser as part of their report on the Eighth International Symposium on Arctic-Alpine Mycology, mycologists Cathy Cripps and Joe Ammirati called him a [...] "gentlemanly scholar" [...] who [...] "led us in <b>his</b> quiet <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the tundra and down many dichotomous paths".|$|R
25|$|One {{newcomer}} to the city was Davis Hanson Waite, a native of Jamestown, New York, who had, on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the country, served in the Wisconsin and Kansas state legislatures. He bought the house and settled in, starting the Aspen Weekly Times, a newspaper still published today. He remained involved in politics, and in 1892 was elected Governor of Colorado.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} ship set sail from Nantes, a severe storm drove the vessel back ashore. Convinced that his holy {{passenger}} caused the tempest, the captain refused further attempts {{to transport the}} monk. Columbanus made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> Gaul to visit King Chlothar II of Neustria at Soissons where he was gladly received. Despite the king's offers to stay in his kingdom, Columbanus left Neustria in 611 for the court of King Theudebert II of Austrasia in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of the Merovingian Franks.|$|E
25|$|Baillie {{attempted}} {{to cover the}} Ribble and Darwen bridges on the Wigan road, but Cromwell had forced <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> both before nightfall. Pursuit was at once undertaken, and not relaxed until Hamilton had been driven through Wigan and Winwick to Uttoxeter and Ashbourne. There, pressed furiously in rear by Cromwell's horse and held up in front by the militia of the midlands, the remnant of the Scottish army laid down its arms on 25 August. Various {{attempts were made to}} raise the Royalist standard in Wales and elsewhere, but Preston was the death-blow. On 28 August, starving and hopeless of relief, the Colchester Royalists surrendered to Lord Fairfax.|$|E
6000|$|... "What was that?" [...] {{asked the}} capitaine in a hoarse voice. He made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> half <b>across</b> the little garden, {{and he also}} was within forty or fifty yards of the flat rock. But Adolphe was unable to answer him. He had fainted and the lamp had fallen from his hands and rolled {{to the bottom of}} the steps.|$|R
50|$|In December 1975 the Referee's Committee of the Scottish Football Association {{ordered the}} closure of Christie Park for two months {{following}} an incident in which a referee was knocked to the ground by a supporter making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> home <b>across</b> the pitch after a match. The club were also fined £100 and ordered to have Police on duty at all future matches.|$|R
50|$|This bloodshed went on {{unchecked}} until General Anthony Wayne {{came on the}} scene. After {{mopping up}} at Fort Recovery, he built a stockade which was unsuccessfully stormed by the Indians. He made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> diagonally <b>across</b> Mercer County to the St. Marys where he built Fort Adams, a temporary relay station and supply depot, east of U.S. Route 127, North of Mercer. Wayne and his army dealt the Indians many defeats.|$|R
25|$|By then, his {{stepmother}} had died, and {{his father}} moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma {{to go back to}} the oil business. Gable toured in stock companies, as well as working the oil fields and as a horse manager. He found work with several second-class theater companies, thus making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the Midwest to Seaside, Oregon, working as a logger, and to Portland, Oregon, where he worked as a necktie salesman in the Meier & Frank department store. In Portland, he met Laura Hope Crews, a stage and film actress, who encouraged him to return to the stage with another theater company. Twenty years later, Crews played Aunt Pittypat alongside Gable's Rhett Butler in Gone With the Wind (1939).|$|E
25|$|In February 1921, {{the same}} Lt Pearson and the 12th were again {{involved}} in a record-setting attempt, this time a planned transcontinental flight with only two stops {{to be completed in}} less than 24 hours. The flight was to be from Pablo Beach, Florida (near Jacksonville), to Rockwell Field, San Diego, with en-route servicing at Fort Worth and Biggs Field. Lt Pearson left Douglas for Florida on 7 February, but he was forced down in the desert with a broken crankshaft. Repairs were made the next day on the scene, and he flew on Biggs Field on the 9th, departing the next day for Kelly Field, San Antonio, but he didn’t make it. For the next six days, aircraft from five Texas bases searched for him in vain. Then, on the 16th, he arrived at Sanderson Border Patrol station on horseback, having made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> country from his crash site in Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Lescun, {{with about}} 400 heavy cavalry under his command, had {{meanwhile}} reached the bridge {{south of the}} park and fought <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> it and into the Imperial camp beyond. [...] Colonna responded by detaching some cavalry under Antonio de Leyva to halt the French advance, while Francesco Sforza came up the road towards the bridge, aiming to surround Lescun. [...] Pontdormy held off the Milanese, allowing Lescun to extricate himself from the camp; the French cavalry then retraced its path and rejoined {{the main body of the}} army.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he tried}} to find <b>his</b> <b>way</b> {{straight}} <b>across</b> the garden, but he {{became more and more}} puzzled. Presently he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her.|$|R
50|$|J. M. W. Turner, {{the celebrated}} painter, arrived at High Force at 10:00 a.m. on 3 August 1816 to sketch the scene. He then {{travelled}} upstream to Cauldron Snout and eventually made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Dufton, <b>across</b> the fells, in inclement weather.|$|R
60|$|One glance was {{sufficient}} {{to show that it}} was Hiram Griffin, and even then when my mind was in such a whirl, I said to myself that he must be a keen lad who could find <b>his</b> <b>way</b> thus deftly <b>across</b> a strange town.|$|R
500|$|Everett made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> western Europe, visiting London and {{the major}} Dutch cities {{en route to the}} German city of Göttingen. [...] There he entered the {{university}}, where he studied French, German, Italian, along with Roman law, archaeology, and Greek art. [...] He was a disciplined student, but he and George Ticknor, with whom he had traveled, were also quite sociable. [...] Everett noted that they were viewed by many at the university as curiosities, and were often the focus of attention. [...] He was granted a Ph. D in September 1817, which he {{believed to be the first}} such degree awarded to an American.|$|E
500|$|Sorkin's nearly decade-long {{collaboration}} in television with director Thomas Schlamme began in early 1998 {{when they found}} they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced Sports Night. Their successful partnership in television {{is one in which}} Sorkin focuses on writing the scripts while Schlamme executive produces and occasionally directs; they have worked together on Sports Night, The West Wing, and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing. In response to what he perceived as unfair criticism of The Newsroom, Jacob Drum of Digital Americana wrote, [...] "The essential truth that the critics miss is that The Newsroom is Sorkin being Sorkin as he always has been and always will be: one part pioneer; one part self-conscious romantic; two parts actual Lewis & Clark-style pioneer, trapping <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> an old, old idea of an America that can always stand to raise its game—but most importantly, spinning a good yarn while he does so." ...|$|E
500|$|Rupert {{responded by}} making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> Parliamentary held {{territory}} to the King at Newark with Prince Maurice and around a hundred men, fighting {{their way through}} smaller enemy units and evading larger ones. [...] King Charles attempted to order Rupert to desist, fearing an armed coup, but Rupert arrived at the royal court anyway. After a difficult meeting, Rupert convinced the King to hold a court-martial over his conduct at Bristol, which exonerated him and Maurice. After a final argument {{over the fate of}} his friend Richard Willis, the governor of Newark, who had let Rupert into the royal court to begin with, Rupert resigned and left the service of King Charles, along with most of his best cavalry officers. Earlier interpretations of this event focused on Rupert's concern for his honour in the face of his initial dismissal by the King; later works have highlighted the practical importance of the courts martial to Rupert's future employability as a mercenary in Europe, given that Rupert knew that the war by this point was effectively lost. Rupert and Maurice spent the winter of 1645 in Woodstock, examining options for employment under the Venetian Republic, before returning to Oxford and the King in 1646. Rupert and the King were reconciled, the Prince remaining to defend Oxford when the King left for the north. After the ensuing siege and surrender of Oxford in 1646, Parliament banished both Rupert and his brother from England.|$|E

50|$|After {{a period}} of silence, Carter tells Bird to hide and starts down the stairs. Sade in the {{meanwhile}} makes <b>his</b> <b>way</b> barefoot <b>across</b> the roof. He ends {{up at the top}} of the stairs, where he is surprised by Carter, and falls down the glass-strewn stairs. Fed-up, Sade plans to set the house on fire, but changes his mind and calls Carter's wife on Carter's cell phone which he had found earlier. Resting again, the men engage in another argument.|$|R
50|$|The Demolition String Band, Skanatra, The Health & Happiness Show, The Karyn Kuhl Band {{and many}} more. Donovan was {{scheduled}} to perform one year, but due to predicted inclement weather the festival had to be rescheduled. Since Donovan was already on <b>his</b> <b>way,</b> flying <b>across</b> the Atlantic, a special concert was held at DeBaun Auditorium in Hoboken just for his performance. Backed by band put together by Hoboken's own James Mastro, it was truly a memorable performance. What a great night.|$|R
2500|$|Mitterrand {{built up}} a {{resistance}} network (ref unknown), composed mainly of former POWs.

He returned to New York to add one more radical trade-unionist to the new Communist leadership." ...|$|E
