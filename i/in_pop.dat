5|$|Demi's Birthday Suit, or The Suit, was a trompe-l'œil body {{painting}} by Joanne Gair photographed by Annie Leibovitz that was {{featured on the}} cover of the Vanity Fair August 1992 issue to commemorate and exploit the success of Leibovitz's More Demi Moore cover photo of Demi Moore one year earlier.

5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music {{became one}} of the best-selling albums {{recorded}} by a black musician of the time, as well as one of the best-selling country albums, shipping at least 500,000 copies in its first three months of release. This achievement was {{due in part to the}} mainstream promotional efforts Modern Sounds had received from ABC prior to and following release. The album proved to be a crossover hit as well, as distributors claimed the record had been selling <b>in</b> <b>pop,</b> R and country music markets; at the time, often referred to as white and black markets during the period.|$|E

5|$|Deep Purple's {{members were}} {{experienced}} musicians with different musical backgrounds: Lord had trained in classical music and {{had played in}} jazz and blues rock ensembles, Blackmore and Simper came from session work <b>in</b> <b>pop</b> rock, Paice and Evans from beat bands. However, no one was an accomplished songwriter. The only one with experience in musical composition was Lord, who treated the arrangements and wrote {{the bulk of the}} music for the first album, with some guitar riffs added by Blackmore. The album shows the potential of the band but does not focus on a distinct sound. Clearly identifiable on the album are the musical styles which were developing in the UK in that period and that influenced the young musicians in Deep Purple, a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock, pop rock and hard rock, the latter mostly evident in Blackmore's guitar parts.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Guy Lombardo {{and the decline of}} the Royal Canadians' special, New Year's Rockin' Eve grew in popularity, and became {{ingrained}} <b>in</b> <b>pop</b> culture—even prompting Clark himself to make appearances on other programs in parody of his role. To this day, New Year's Rockin' Eve has consistently remained the highest-rated New Year's Eve special broadcast by the United States' major television networks; its 2012 edition peaked at 22.6 million home viewers—not including viewers watching from public locations, which were historically not measured by Nielsen. Dick Clark hosted New Year's Rockin' Eve annually from 1973 through 2004, and served as a Times Square correspondent alongside Peter Jennings for ABC News's special coverage of year 2000 celebrations.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 {{he began}} to tour Europe and the Americas playing Indian {{classical}} music and increased its popularity there in the 1960s through teaching, performance, and his association with violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Beatles guitarist George Harrison. His influence on the latter helped popularize the use of Indian instruments <b>in</b> <b>pop</b> music throughout the 1960s. Shankar engaged Western music by writing compositions for sitar and orchestra, and toured {{the world in the}} 1970s and 1980s. From 1986 to 1992, he served as a nominated member of Rajya Sabha, the upper chamber of the Parliament of India. He continued to perform until the end of his life. In 1999, Shankar was awarded India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, after {{a series}} of festivals where he sang {{together}} with The Blue Workers, Pascu had a solo recital at Braşov's Golden Stag Festival, and was awarded the Best Album trophy by the music magazine Actualitatea Muzicală, for Maşina cu jazzolină. He was also the opening act for Western rock groups touring Romania: the British bands Jethro Tull, Beats International and Asia, and Germany's Scorpions. As a television actor, Pascu was also taking part in the development of Romania's advertising industry. He was chiefly remembered <b>in</b> <b>pop</b> culture as the spokesman for Connex, one of the first mobile phone operators in Romania, with the catchphrase Alo, Maria? ("Hello, Maria?").|$|E
5|$|The mid-1980s {{also saw}} Gospel music see its {{popularity}} peak. A {{new form of}} gospel had evolved, called Contemporary Christian music (CCM). CCM had {{been around since the}} late 1960s, and consisted of a pop/rock sound with slight religious lyrics. CCM had become the most popular form of gospel by the mid-1980s, especially with artists like Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, and Kathy Troccoli. Amy Grant was the most popular CCM, and gospel, singer of the 1980s, and after experiencing unprecedented success in CCM, crossed over into mainstream pop in the 1980s and 1990s. Michael W. Smith also had considerable success in CCM before crossing over to a successful career <b>in</b> <b>pop</b> music as well. Grant would later produce CCM's first #1 pop hit ("Baby Baby"), and CCM's best-selling album (Heart In Motion).|$|E
5|$|Zappa uniquely {{contributed to}} the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, {{sampling}} radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also {{contributed to the}} radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard <b>in</b> <b>pop</b> music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.|$|E
5000|$|Poses <b>in</b> <b>popping</b> make {{heavy use}} of angles, style {{movements}} and sometimes facial expressions. Common facial expressions include [...] "stank faces," [...] and feigned expressions of concentration and seriousness. The lower body has {{many ways to}} move around from basic walking and stepping to the more complex and gravity defying styles of floating and electric boogaloo. Movements and techniques used <b>in</b> <b>popping</b> are generally focused on sharp contrasts and extremes, being either robotic and rigid or very loose and flowing.|$|R

40|$|Ñuñas, popping beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), {{burst and}} expand when heated rapidly. Differences in seed {{microstructure}} between popping and conventional (non-popping) bean genotypes conceivably contribute to <b>popping</b> <b>in</b> ñuñas. However, the microstructural characteristics which {{contribute to the}} popping attribute and sites of expansion have not been identified. Seeds and excised cotyledons of unpopped and popped ñuñas were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Protoplasts of unpopped ñuñas were similar to protoplasts of conventional beans. Intercellular spaces of unpopped ñuñas were occuled by schizogenous cell walls. The occluded form of intercellular spaces differed distinctively from the open form <b>in</b> <b>popped</b> ñuñas and untreated conventional beans. The expansion of cotyledon mesophyll <b>in</b> <b>popped</b> ñuñas came primarily from expansion of cell walls and secondarily by expansion of the intercellular spaces. Cell wall thickness and dimensions of protoplasts were not changed during popping. Expansion of cell walls away from protoplasts created intracellular voids. SEM images indicated that starch granules (grains) <b>in</b> <b>popped</b> ñuñas were generally not altered by popping. Starch granules did not gelatinize or melt during popping as indicated by retention of birefringence. In contrast to popcorn (Zea mays L.), starch granules did not contribute to expansion of popped ñuña cotyledonsPeer-reviewe...|$|R
