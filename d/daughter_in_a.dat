5|$|The Turin {{painting}} was acquired in 1866 {{from the mayor}} of a nearby town. Previously it was owned by a professor living {{in the province of}} Alessandria; he bought it from a former nun in that province. The documentation is sketchy, but suggests the nun possessed it early in the 19th century during the dissolution of convents in the area under Napoleon. That a nun owned the painting three centuries after Adornes purportedly bequeathed a van Eyck St Francis to his <b>daughter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> convent, and that the Adornes family owned property in Alessandria, is suggestive, but no evidence exists to confirm a connection.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 20th century Janáček {{composed}} choral church music including Otčenáš (Our Father, 1901), Constitutes (1903) and Ave Maria (1904). In 1901 the first part of his piano cycle On an Overgrown Path was published, and gradually became one of his most frequently performed works. In 1902 Janáček visited Russia twice. On the first occasion he took his daughter Olga to St.Petersburg, where she stayed to study Russian. Only three months later, he returned to St. Petersburg with his wife because Olga had become very ill. They took her back to Brno, but her health worsened. Janáček expressed his painful feelings for his <b>daughter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new work, his opera Jenůfa, in which the suffering of his daughter had transfigured into Jenůfa's. When Olga died in February 1903, Janáček dedicated Jenůfa to her memory. The opera was performed in Brno in 1904, with reasonable success, but Janáček felt this was no more than a provincial achievement. He aspired to recognition by the more influential Prague opera, but Jenůfa was refused there (twelve years passed before its first performance in Prague). Dejected and emotionally exhausted, Janáček went to Luhačovice spa to recover. There he met Kamila Urválková, whose love story supplied the theme for his next opera, Osud (Destiny).|$|E

25|$|Now {{mother and}} father and son are all separated. But the reader or {{listener}} knows that they will be reunited {{at the end of the}} tale, for this is a romance; in essence a comedy, not a tragedy. The baby boy is carried to the kingdom of Israel, where the griffin is spotted landing, stork-like, with the baby. News of this is brought to the king, the child is named Degarébel and he is raised as the king’s son. And his mother, in fact, suffers a curiously similar fate. Having set off again from the rock of seagulls, she is carried in the boat by wind and tide until she is washed ashore in Egypt where she is found by the king of that country. She tells him who she is and is informed by the King of Egypt that she is his niece. Quite quickly, as the tale proceeds, she becomes his <b>daughter,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plotting device that, although clearly inconsistent with the beginning of the tale, has similarities with a new identity, following separation, taken by Emare, and by Sir Degare, by the boy Florent in the romance Octavian and by the blacksmith Sir Isumbras. Fifteen years pass before she is made the high-ranking prize at a tournament for would-be suitors.|$|E

500|$|Cisneros's {{early life}} {{provided}} many experiences she would later draw on as a writer: {{she grew up}} as the only <b>daughter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> family of six brothers, which often made her feel isolated, and the constant migration of her family between Mexico and the United States instilled in her the sense of [...] "always straddling two countries... but not belonging to either culture." [...] Cisneros's work deals {{with the formation of}} Chicana identity, exploring the challenges of being caught between Mexican and Anglo-American cultures, facing the misogynist attitudes present in both these cultures, and experiencing poverty. For her insightful social critique and powerful prose style, Cisneros has achieved recognition far beyond Chicano and Latino communities, to the extent that The House on Mango Street has been translated worldwide and is taught in American classrooms as a coming-of-age novel.|$|E
