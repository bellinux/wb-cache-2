The Huffington Post said that giving the video cameras {{to the students}} was an <b>excellent</b> <b>idea</b> because the depiction of their school-life versus the increasing danger was captured [...] "with neutral equality [...] that the film is able to capture the interiority of its subjects more acutely than a straight-forward examination of violence would". Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent said, [...] "its storyline was governed not by a tick-list of stock narrative dilemmas and secrets but the cruel uncertainties that occupation and insurgency have brought to Baghdad." [...] Time Out New York gave the film five out of five stars, and PopMatters rated it 8 out of 10. The Washington Posts Paul Farhi said, [...] "HBO has carved a niche as the TV home {{of some of the}} most compelling programs about the Iraq war ... Baghdad High does no harm to HBO's burgeoning war cred." [...] Variety, The Christian Science Monitor, LA Weekly, and the Los Angeles Times also praised the film.

Furthermore, these impacts are conditional on two proposed moderators: technology scope and affiliation scope. Empirical evidence supports {{the positive effect of}} knowledge diversity weakening as the scope of technology broadens. The effect also differs depending upon whether the collaboration occurs between organizations, within one organization, or outside any organization. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} one of {{the eight}} units of a professional development program, the Numeracy Infusion Course for Higher Education (NICHE), which introduces research on cognition, including dual-processing theories, to university faculty. Under the dual-processing framework, System 1 (intuition) quickly proposes intuitive answers to judgment problems as they arise, while System 2 (deliberation) monitors the quality of these proposals, which it may endorse, correct, or override. We present several classic questions that demonstrate the pitfalls of overreliance on intuition without analytical thinking, then describe faculty participants’ responses to these questions and their ideas on how to apply cognitive illusion research to quantitative reasoning instruction. The unit has helped generate <b>excellent</b> <b>ideas</b> for quantitative reasoning instruction. A persistent concern shared by many participants, however, is that weakness in basic mathematics and language comprehension among urban public university students might present a challenge in implementing these ideas. ...|$|R
