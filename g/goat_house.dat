40|$|Goats are, {{like most}} farm animals, group living animals. In todays animal {{husbandry}} of goats {{there is considerable}} variation in group size. Larger group sizes are generally associated with less aggressive interactions and more movement activity. In this thesis the main objective {{was to examine the}} effect of group size on social interactions, activity time budgets and movement patterns in Norwegian dairy goats. The experiment was conducted at the goat barn at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU). During this study a total of 90 pregnant goats were used. Out of those 36 were semi-randomly selected to look at the effects of group size. The <b>goats</b> were <b>housed</b> in two different group sizes; 6 and 24, and space per animal was 1. 4 m 2. The goats remained in the same group throughout the experiment. The experiment was performed with three observation periods with both direct observations and video observations of social interactions, activity budget and movement patterns (November, December / January and January / February). A mixed model analysis of variance was used to analyse the effect of group size, week and time on social interactions, activity time budgets and movement patterns. The results show that there was a higher frequency of defensive behaviour (P = 0. 02) and a tendency towards more social activity (P = 0. 07) in <b>goats</b> <b>housed</b> in large group than <b>goats</b> <b>housed</b> in small groups. In small groups, there was a higher frequency of resting than in large groups (P = 0. 01). Goats in large groups were more active and had a higher frequency of moving (P < 0. 0001) and moved generally larger total distances (P < 0. 0001) than goats in small groups. The distance to the "furthest neighbour" was smaller in small groups than in large groups (P < 0. 0001). The goats had a smaller distance to “nearest neighbour” in the first and third time period than during the second in the two first observational weeks (P < 0. 0001). During the first and third time period 57. 7 % ± 1. 9 % and 58. 8 % ± 1. 8 % of the behaviours performed were feeding, whereas 63. 7 % ± 2. 5 % of the behaviours performed in the second time period was resting.  M-H...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to {{evaluate}} Macrocystis pyrifera (MP) meal as a nutritional supplement for goats.

40|$|AbstractThe {{molecular}} epidemiology of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) is constantly changing due to animal movements, cross species transmission {{and because of}} their rapid evolutionary rate. This study reports a comprehensive genetic and phylogenetic analysis based on consensus gag and pol sequences covering 3 kb of the SRLV genome from small ruminants in Québec, Canada. A group of strains obtained from goats originating from different flocks, segregated in a unique clade distinct from currently known SRLV groups. Genetic dissection of the gag gene from these strains revealed that it originated {{as a result of}} a recombination event between parental strains currently circulating in small ruminants of the country. Following HIV nomenclature, we propose to call this group of strains, circulating recombinant form 1 SRLV, or CRF 01 _AB SRLV. In addition, the study confirms the existence of genetically distinct and homogeneous populations of SRLVs infecting sheep and <b>goats</b> <b>housed</b> in single species flocks...|$|R
40|$|Animal losses due to {{abortion}} and malformed offspring during the lambing period 2011 / 2012 amounted to 50 % in ruminants in Europe. A new arthropod-borne virus, called Schmallenberg virus (SBV), {{was identified as}} the cause of these losses. Blood samples were obtained from 40 goat flocks and tested for antibodies against SBV by ELISA, with 95 % being seropositive. The calculated intra-herd seroprevalence (median 36 · 7 %, min-max 0 – 93 · 3 %) was smaller than in cattle or sheep flocks. Only 25 % of the farmers reported malformations in kids. Statistical analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of <b>goats</b> <b>housed</b> indoors all year-round to be infected by SBV than for goats kept outside day and night. The low intra-herd seroprevalence demonstrates that German goat flocks are still at risk of SBV infection. Therefore, they must be protected during the next lambing seasons by rescheduling the mating period, implementing indoor housing, and continuous treatment with repellents or vaccination.

As a result of this, the intruder is able to drag him out of his hiding place and gulp him down. After spending some time looking for the third kid, the wolf tires and, in what is intended as a humiliating gesture, stains the walls with the kids' blood and places their heads on the window sills, modifying their facial expression to seem like they are smiling.|$|R

40|$|Scientific {{research}} on factors causing {{the reduction of}} well-being in sheep and goats is rather recent, as are studies of strategies to minimize the adverse effects of environmental challenges and improper manage-ment practices on flock welfare. Sheep and goats, considered very rustic animals, are reared prevalently under extensive production systems and are widespread mainly in marginal areas. For these reasons, only few studies on the welfare of these species {{have been carried out}} in the past. More recently, the scenario has changed, due to a gradual diffusion of intensive and semi-intensive production systems, especially in dairy sheep and goat breeds, to the growing concern of consumers about the life conditions of farmed animals, and to the issuing of a number of rules and laws on the safety of animal products and well-being of farmed livestock. As a consequence, several research groups have turned their attention to the welfare of sheep and goats. Nevertheless, information on this topic is still scarce. This paper reviews major critical points regard-ing the endangerment of welfare in farmed sheep and goats. Climatic extremes and seasonal fluctuations in herbage amount and quality are discussed as important causes of the reduction of well-being in extensive production systems, which can impair production efficiency of grazing animals and dramatically affect the welfare and health status of sheep and goats.
