In 1912, Pietersburg founded its own congregation, the Pietersburg Hebrew Congregation. A Jewish burial society, a benevolent society and the Pietersburg-Zoutpansberg Zionist Society was formed.

America 2 ̆ 7 s suburban revolution has not left Jewish communities unscathed.

Specifcally, we employ individual-level survey data and county-level expenditure data to examine {{the extent to}} which Hanukkah celebration among U. <b>S.</b> <b>Jews</b> is driven by the presence of Christmas. We find that: (1) Jews with children at home are more likely to celebrate Hanukkah than Jews without children.

(3) Jewish-related expenditures in Hanukkah are higher in counties with lower share of Jews. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that Jews increase religious activity during Hanukkah {{because of the presence of}} Christmas, and this response is primarily driven by the presence of children at home.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the various ways in which Ashkenazi Jewish undergraduate anti-racism peer educators understood and used their Jewish identity in their work with non-Jewish people of color and white Christians. Ashkenazi Jews, who are Jews of Central European heritage, often find themselves questioning the racial space they occupy. The ways in which students of Ashkenazi Jewish identification compare or contrast their historical and current social position with that of communities of color can either facilitate or disrupt their efforts to be effective anti-racist educators. Fifteen Ashkenazi Jews who are peer facilitators in a nationally-recognized social justice program at a university in the Midwest were interviewed. Three data gathering techniques were utilized: demographic intake form, individual interview, and focus group interview. Participants articulated a complex understanding {{of the position of}} Ashkenazi <b>Jews</b> in U. <b>S.</b> -based systems of ethnicity, religion, race and class. Based on these systems, the students claimed that Jews are both insiders and outsiders in American society, targeted and privileged simultaneously in their ethno-religious and class identities. Findings reveal that being Jewish is salient and a distinct identity for this generation of college students; the history of Jewish oppression continues to inform Jewish identity; Jewish students continues to describe a connection with Blacks; and distinctive processes of ethnic and ethno-religious identity development take place for Jewish undergraduates. Findings suggest the need for a new social identity model that addresses the unique racial, ethnic and ethno-religious positionality of Ashkenazi Jewish undergraduates. The author presents a Jewish ethno-religious target development model, along with implications for anti-racism and social justice education and suggestions for further research. ...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} Britainâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 <b>s</b> <b>Jews,</b> both established and refugee, with the host community from 1938 to 1948. The relationship is studied {{in the light of}} events in Europe and the Near East from the 1938 Anschluss to the 1948 founding of Israel and the ways they impacted upon Jews in Britain. The work shows a positive reaction towards Jews in Britain, with few, but specific exceptions. Existing academic work has often concentrated on those exceptions, particularly in the East End of London. This study looks at the wider Jewish experience to show a more peaceful and tolerant coexistence than has formally been presented, especially to recently arrived Jews. The focus of the thesis is on the different personal experiences of Jews in Britain, against the more familiar high political context of the period. The thesis does not dispute the existence of anti-Semitism, but shows that it was limited to traditional geographical areas and has been in many cases confused with a more general xenophobia towards any â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 outsiderâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 or â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 foreignerâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9.

Using different approaches to examine a wide and fragmented cross section of Jews, the thesis shows the internal struggle many faced when dealing with the issues of {{what it meant to be}} British, a Jew and for some, a desire to have a safe homeland in Palestine. Overall, it is a study in the transformation of Jewish society in Britain from being deferential and submissive to one of assertiveness and self-reliance born out of necessity...|$|R

These carefully researched volumes analyze and detail the histories of ethnic groups {{in a state that}} has not been notably associated with traditions of ethnic pluralism. In Oklahoma, where even the Indians have been immigrants, Blacks, Czechs, Germans, Indians, Italians, Jews, Mexicans, Poles, and Germans from Russia are each allotted separate treatment, while the British and Irish are joined together in a single volume. In five succinct chapters, Henry J. Tobias of the University of Oklahoma outlines the story of Jewish immigration from Europe to the United States; describes Jewish patterns of settlement in Oklahoma; depicts the development of Jewish religious, fraternal, and cultural associations; and sketches the relations between Jews and Gentiles. In a brief final chapter Tobias summarizes the social trends of the last three decades. A general bibliographical essay is appended, but there is no index. As elsewhere on the Great Plains, the Jewish population has never been large. With approximately 100 persons shortly after the Run of 1889, 1, 000 to 2, 000 at statehood in 1907, and 7, 800 in 1927, the Jewish population fell to 4, 750 in 1955, sharply paralleling the downward dip in the state as a whole. By 1970, it was estimated at 6, 500. The number of Jews in small towns has thinned out as small businesses have declined.

40|$|I {{begin with}} the problem of method: how to write a study of Renaissance culture which is at once materialist, {{therefore}} relentless in its criticism of religion, and historicist, therefore obliged to proceed immanently through a text 2 ̆ 7 s own terminology without resolving theological propositions into their secular, inevitably modern equivalents. A sixteenth century text should be stripped of its divinity, I argue, only if historical materialism has first been stripped of its secularism. Only then can the theological problems for which I substitute economic, social contradiction remain intact as genuine theological problems. The more Christianity one finds in Marx, in other words, the more economics appears inextricably a part of Christian theology. As a result, the more intelligible and vital will be their constant interpenetration in the literature of the English Reformation. ^ Each chapter treats from a different perspective the conflict between Christianity 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of grace as an unearned gift and its vilification of usury and theft as unearned wealth. This generally took the form of a conflict between “true” Christianity and its variously figured others: Judaism, Protestantism, Catholicism. Luther combined his critique of the latter with an attack on Jewish usury but reserved a legitimate place for the profits of credit under the name of faith. Marx 2 ̆ 7 s allusions to Shylock pepper his analysis of this Lutheran theology of credit and prompt a reinterpretation of The Merchant of Venice centering on the place of the oath in the economics of incarnation. Later I turn to Luther 2 ̆ 7 s impact on the English Bible—Tyndale 2 ̆ 7 s substitution of trespasses for debts in the Lord 2 ̆ 7 s Prayer, the suppression of thievery in Coverdale 2 ̆ 7 s NT—and examine how John Foxe, in the life of Simon Fish, represents the political and economic machinations (monastic dissolution above all) in which these translations participated. Lastly I arrive at Marlowe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Jew</b> of Malta, arguing for Barabas as an effect of the official Biblical, economic, theological consolidation that preceded his first appearance on stage (c 1593) and then, when he finally makes his way into print forty years later, as an indication of the changes played upon the Reformation by a later, revolutionary decade. ...|$|R

Although Leora Bilsky describes it as an 2 ̆ 2 almost forgotten trial, 2 ̆ 2 it has not been forgotten by subsequent writers: it makes an important cameo appearance in Arendt 2 ̆ 7 s Eichmann in Jerusalem; it features prominently in Tom Segev 2 ̆ 7 s The Seventh Million (1991); Yehuda Bauer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Jews</b> for Sale? (1994) takes pains to refute the charges against Kastner; and it inspired two novels - Amos Elon 2 ̆ 7 s Timetable (1980) and Neil Gordon 2 ̆ 7 s cerebral thriller The Sacrifice of Isaac (1995). But the legal opinions have never until now attracted the thought or analysis they warrant, and Bilsky deserves gratitude for remedying this omission. With admirable insight and ingenuity, Bilsky focuses on the construction of the legal opinions as a form of literature. Her reading of Judge Halevi 2 ̆ 7 s and Justice Agranat 2 ̆ 7 s opinions centers on the way in which law is driven by metaphor - in Halevi 2 ̆ 7 s case, the metaphor of contract; in Agranat 2 ̆ 7 s, the metaphor of administrative decision making. Her article is a major contribution {{to our understanding of the}} Kastner case and to the way that, in a situation of intense moral ambiguity, legal analysis can be predetermined by a choice of metaphors. I found Bilsky 2 ̆ 7 s critique of Halevi 2 ̆ 7 s opinion illuminating and accurate, with a few qualifications that I discuss below. Her analysis of Agranat 2 ̆ 7 s opinion and her own view of Kastner (which closely resembles Agranat 2 ̆ 7 s) raise more doubts. At the end of the day, however, I still find myself unable to answer the two basic questions, Who is Kastner? and How shall we judge what he did? I have three aims in this comment: first, to explain the few hesitations I have about Bilsky 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation; second, to place Bilsky 2 ̆ 7 s work in the historiography of the Kastner case by contrasting it with Arendt 2 ̆ 7 s and Segev 2 ̆ 7 s accounts; third, to explain why, at the end of the day, I fear that Kastner himself remains a cipher lost in the gray zone...|$|R
40|$|No {{other ethnic}} group enjoyed {{the level of}} success, {{defined in terms of}} {{economic}} status and social acceptance, attained by Portland Jews {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. Hailing predominantly from the German states of northern and central Europe, the Jewish pioneers transplanted middle class values and mercantile skills in their new home. From a small unstable population of single men in the 1850 s, Portland Jewry grew into an affluent class conscious family oriented community by the mid- 1880 s. The center of Portland 2 ̆ 7 s Jewish life during the formative years was Congregation Beth Israel, the first congregation in the Pacific Northwest. It provided the spiritual and social cement the community needed to meet the challenges of the frontier environment. As the population increased, the institutional structure of the community expanded with a succession of organizations [...] Hebrew Benevolent Association, Hebrew Ladies Benevolent Society, B 2 ̆ 7 nai B 2 ̆ 7 rith, YMHA, to name the most prominent. As the population increased with the immigration of Polish and Prussian Jews in the 1870 s, some internal struggle occurred. The more traditional Jews, primarily from eastern Prussia, formed a new congregation, rejecting the reforming, Americanized Beth Israel. In the 1880 s the split became further institutionalized as the wealthy German Jews established the Concordia Club, a social club for the Jewish elite. Despite this division, Portland Jewry remained fairly homogenous through the 1880 s. The outstanding distinguishing characteristic of the community was its adaptation to American society and its integration into city life. The pioneer Jews sought the same rewards as their gentile neighbors [...] economic success and community stability. They experienced little racial prejudice and moved with no apparent self consciousness in Portland society. Although they were excluded from the Arlington Club, the bastion of the gentile elite, Portland 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Jews</b> maintained close business and social ties with the non-Jewish community. This experience was similar to that in other frontier communities where Jews entered city life early irr its development. While becoming Americcnized, Portland Jewry clung to its cultural heritage. Its organizations and institutions which showed the effects of the frontier environment were still distinctively Jewish. And in business, success was fostered by intra-group and family networking and credit arrangements that were familiar in Europe. The use of 2 ̆ 2 new social history 2 ̆ 2 techniques provides a view of all levels of Jewish society. By using data gathered from federal and county census records, burial records, marriage records, and tax records,as well as institutional records and personal papers, the development of institutional structure, leadership roles, and class divisions can be understood...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} ways of understanding the struggles and delights of an ethnic group is to study the art the group produces. Art –visual, literary, auditory– functions as an expression {{of the history of the}} group. Often, what is considered great art in one culture is disparaged in many others. In my thesis, I will be examining how comics function as an expression of simultaneous pride and shame among Ashkenazi Jews, particularly comics created in the 20 th century. Perhaps comics do not seem like an obvious expression of Eastern European Judaism. After all, there are far more renowned, and even sophisticated works to look at, such as the whimsical art of Marc Chagall and stately rabbinical paintings of Isidor Kauffman, or even the heady philosophical work of Theodor W. Adorno. “Ashkenazi expression” and “comics” do not seem intuitively connected. This disconnect is precisely why I want to explore the relationship between comics and Ashkenazi Jewry. In addition to many {{of the most}} prominent comic creators being Jewish, I posit that there is something inherently yiddish, Jewish, about American comics. The purpose of this essay is not to name individual comic artists in an attempt to prove the Jewishness of the the comic-book industry. Rather, I will explore why Jews of Eastern European descent gravitated toward the comic-book industry in the early to mid 20 th century. I posit that American comics acted as an expression of a pride-shame tension found in American Jews of Eastern European descent. To explore this connection, I will first examine the origins of simultaneous Jewish pride and shame by tracing the roots of Eastern European Jewish self-hatred. Next, I will delve into why comics encapsulate this balance of self-deprecation and self-glorification. I will analyze both the nature of the medium itself, and the circumstances grounding the formation of American comics. Ashkenazi Jews, or Jews of Eastern European, specifically German descent, have been at the center of much scholarly literature. Although an extremely small percentage of the world 2 ̆ 7 s population, the bulk of Jews are Ashkenazi, as opposed to Sefardic. Much literature has been devoted to Ashkenazi Judaism, as the ethnic division has produced an impressive body of scientific and literary accomplishment. Although the countries from which Ashkenazi Jews originate are diverse, the key words surrounding Ashkenazi discourse are reoccurring. Concepts such as “exile,” “self-hatred,” and “Jewish humor” all arise. Another central concept is Yiddishkeit. Yiddishkeit literally translates to “Jewishness” in none other but the language of Yiddish. Yiddish has been the subject of both outward Ashkenazi expression –there is a great deal of Yiddish literature and art– and scholarly examination. Perhaps most recently, Michael Wex published a book called Born to Kvetch, an in-detail study of the history of Yiddish, and how it embodies Ashkenazi culture. Within this book, a particular theme appears: the theme of simultaneously occuring pride and shame. Jews created Yiddish as a result of the primary culture 2 ̆ 7 s rejection. However, after this initial dismissal, great pride emerged out of Yiddish, manifesting itself in rich Yiddish culture. Other scholars have explored the concept of Jewish self-hatred, and the fine line this self-hatred straddles between bona fide self-hatred and isolationist pride. Sander Gilman, who writes extensively about the topic, discusses how language and literature embody this dichotomous tension of pride and shame. While conducting research for the connection between comics and class in 20 th century American, I came to the understanding that many of the founders of and participants in the American comic industry were Jewish. I dug up analyses of specific comics/graphic novels (usually Maus) exploring certain Jewish themes in comics, yet I had a hard time finding extensive research asking the question as to why comics and Jews have such a strong connection. In my thesis, I hope to further this question by not only investigating the circumstances surrounding comics that made Jews turn to the industry, but why comics themselves embody Jewish pride and shame. On a much humbler scale, I hope to accomplish what Wex has in Born to Kvetch, a linguistic analysis that provides insight into the greater ethnic group engaging with it. In chapter one, I will establish the pride-shame dichotomy found in Ashkenazi Judaism. I will first explore several biblical passages, including Lamentations, Micah, and Isaiah. By exploring these instances in the tanach, I will try to establish the uniqueness the Jews feel due to their personal and punitive relationship with God. Throughout these passages, we will see the Jews taking pride in the punishment God doles out for them, because such pain is indicative of the Jews 2 ̆ 7 superiority among other nations. Next, I will provide a brief explanation of why I am choosing to focus on the act of conversion in the Medieval time period as an indicator of Jewish pride and shame. In specific, I will focus on infamous Johannes Pfefferkorn, who converted from Judaism to Christianity. Pfefferkorn is the perfect example of a Jew who both detested his Judaism, yet used it to his advantage to speak authoritatively about Judaism to Christians, as his professed textual knowledge gave him clout. Next, I will give an introduction on the connection between Otherness and language, explaining how Hebrew and the Talmud spurred both fascination and disgust toward Jews from their surrounding neighbors. After segueing into the origins of Yiddish as a language created out of exile, I will explain how though Yiddish originated out of spurning, the language became a source of pride of its rejected roots. I will consider the statements of various Yiddish authors, in particular American immigrant Isaac Bashevis Singer. Through both an analysis of Singer 2 ̆ 7 s self-reflection of his own life and an analysis of his short story, Gimpel the Fool, I will establish the pride Ashkenazi Judaism takes in its outsider status. Singer himself remarks of the positivity of being lonely and different. His character, Gimpel, is a foolish outcast. Much like the Jews in the biblical passages explored earlier in the chapter, he suffers constant misfortune and mockery, yet his very pain is what lends him favor in God 2 ̆ 7 s eyes. In chapter two, I will explore how 20 th century American comics reflect the Ashkenazi dichotomy of pride and shame. Much like Yiddish is not a mainstream language, the idea of comics as mainstream art or literature has been greatly contested. I will try to determine which circumstances surrounding 20 th century comics, and the comics themselves, connect with this pride-shame tension. I will use Paul Buhle 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Jews</b> and American Comics as a frame of reference, since the book often links comics and Yiddish. I will first give a brief history of the American comic-book, starting with the Hogan 2 ̆ 7 s Alley comics strip, and exploring up until the mid 20 th century. By understanding the working-class origins of comics, we can better understand the low-brow perception of them from the standpoint of both their readers and their critics. I will then explain how American comics in the 20 th century contained Jewish themes of pride and shame, despite their characters not being explicitly Jewish. I will more closely explore this idea through an analysis of the character Superman, drawing on both the commentary from the character 2 ̆ 7 s creators and the content clues of the character himself. A true foreigner, Superman masks his real identity, his superhuman powers. While his alias is what makes him exceptional, it is also the thing he abhors the most. Will Eisner, a giant in the world of comics, denies inserting Jewish identity in his own characters. However, his assistant, Jules Feiffer, half-jokingly claimed that his character, Denny Colt, featured in Eisner 2 ̆ 7 s The Spirit series, is in actuality a secret Jew. Instead of focusing on Colt and The Spirit, I will do a close reading of one of Eisner 2 ̆ 7 s other works, A Contract with God, which is an exemplary work of Jewish pride and shame. Contract contains a motif that is similar to that of the biblical passages analyzed in chapter one. The protagonist, Russian-American immigrant Frimme Hershe, has a personal relationship with God that leaves him demoralized and punished. I will then explore the use of visual stereotype in Contract, comparing it to that of Art Spiegelman 2 ̆ 7 s Maus, and contrasting it with that of the film Inglorious Basterds. I will argue that through engaging with Jewish visual stereotypes, the first two reveal them as falsehoods. Thus, through an admittance of these shamed images, the comics mock them. The latter film chooses to ignore stereotypes, thus leaving them extant. I will conclude the chapter by positing that Jews have coped with their constant exile through through the self-deprecation of comics. Buhle mentions that comics about Jewish-American gangsters turned into a source of pride, presumably for Ashkenazi American Jews. The trope, hated by others, was lauded by those it was forced upon. Much like Yiddish, comics may have been born out of exclusion, but they came to be a source of pride among Ashkenazi Jews...|$|R
