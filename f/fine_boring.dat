40|$|BACKGROUND: There are differing views {{regarding}} {{the management of}} oesophageal injuries with some authors advocating mandatory operation while others prefer a selective, conservative approach. This study was undertaken to establish whether conservative management of cervical oesophageal injuries is safe and effective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study carried out over 5 years (1994 - 1998). Of 1358 patients with neck trauma, 220 presented with odynophagia, of whom 28 were shown on contrast swallow to have cervical oesophageal injury (17 stabs, 11 firearms). Median age was 26 years (range, 11 - 44 years). There were 23 males (M:F ratio, 6 : 1). All patients with contained extravasation were managed non-operatively irrespective of the delay from injury to admission. Repair was undertaken in patients with major disruption and those requiring exploration for another reason. Associated tracheal injuries were repaired primarily with or without tracheostomy. Patients were fed using <b>fine</b> <b>bore</b> enteral feeding tubes. Oral feeding was recommenced after a water soluble contrast swallow had confirmed healing. RESULTS: All patients presented with odynophagia. Seven had clinical surgical emphysema, and 15 had retropharyngeal air on lateral neck X-ray. Chest X-ray showed surgical emphysema in 8, haemothorax in 2 and pneumothorax in 2. Seventeen patients were managed non-operatively. Sixteen recovered with no complications, while one developed local sepsis. Eleven patients underwent exploration (debridement in 7 and primary repair in 4). There were 6 associated tracheal injuries, all of whom underwent primary repair with tracheostomy performed in four. Thirteen patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. Median duration of enteral tube feeding was 18 days (range, 5 - 40 days) and median hospital stay was 18 days (range, 6 - 91 days). Two patients with firearm injuries died from associated injuries. CONCLUSION: Non-operative management of penetrating injuries to the cervical oesophagus is safe and effective...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Fine</b> <b>bore</b> {{nasogastric}} tube (NGT) blockages {{can result in}} delays in nutrient provision and poor patient experience. Biofilm development on the internal lumen wall of the tube {{has the potential to}} initiate such blockages, but has been little investigated. Method: The study aimed to investigate the rate of biofilm formation in sterile NGTs in vitro. Short sections of new sterile NGTs were placed in a 6 -well microtiter plate and immersed in a standard commercial enteral feed to which an inoculum was added. This was incubated at 37 °C. The inocula used in the study were prepared from strains ofEscherichia coliand Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The NGT sections were removed after 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 1440 min. Culturable cells were quantified by colony forming units (CFU), and bacterial viability was measured by cell elongation (CE). In addition, the sections were examined directly using episcopic differential interference contrast (EDIC) microscopy. Results: Results from 3 sections at each time point from 11 NGTs for the E. coliinoculum and 3 NGTs for the P. aeruginosainoculum are presented. Mean CE and CFU counts for both the E. coliand P. aeruginosainocula increase from 0 to 1440 min. This demonstrates bacteria attach to the NGT within 15 min of introduction, with generally increasing colonisation over the subsequent time measured, and retain viability. EDIC microscopy was successfully used to directly examine the NGT surface, showing evidence of extensive biofilm formation. Conclusion: The study has demonstrated the development of bacterial biofilms (evidenced by CE, CFU and microscopy) on NGT lumen walls over a 24 h period in the laboratory setting. The presence of biofilms may have the potential to interrupt flow through the lumen and contribute to blockage development. Further studies plan to examine the effect of flushing with water on biofilm development, in particular considering the use of sterile and tap water flushes, and to investigate biofilm presence in used NGTs retrieved from adult patients {{in the course of their}} normal clinical care. <br/...|$|R
