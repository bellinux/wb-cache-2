The discussion at the dialogue table needs to focus on matters of relevance (SJ), especially to the less powerful parties; result in substantial contributions to addressing the issue (SJ), especially by the corporation and government; and be based on sincere relationships over time (SS). Further, the process needs to include stakeholder group based reflections, and if necessary, a challenging strategy, if power dynamics undercut the goodwill of any stakeholder/group in the dialogue process (SS).|$|R

This project aimed to investigate whether different levels of safety culture, based on competency-based training, resulted in different behaviour (physical and cognitive) for patient handling tasks. Sixteen healthcare organisations in the UK participated from the acute and primary healthcare sectors. Archival data for each organisation were benchmarked against the Royal College of Nursing competencies for manual handling. Behavioural data were collected on two patient handling tasks: (1) sitting-to-standing and (2) repositioning-in-sitting using observations (postural analysis) and interviews (verbal protocol analysis). The data were analysed for each organisation and then grouped by task and method into larger data sets. These data sets were triangulated using the <b>key</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>points</b> (from the interview data) as the framework.

The {{purpose of}} this study is to revise the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry's (DWAF's) current Integrated Environmental Management (IEM) {{procedure}} and to develop an Environmental Management Framework (EMF), so as to ensure that the environment is considered in a structured, formal manner at each decision-making stage of the projects development business process. The proposed EMF provides process diagrams that align the IBM principles, the environmental assessment and management tools, and the engineering business process with the project life cycle approach for DWAF's water sector functional areas. <b>Key</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>points</b> are introduced to the business process to ensure that all the specific requirements have been met before continuing to the next engineering stage of the business life cycle. Auditing nodes were identified within the life cycle approach and complement the <b>decision-making</b> <b>points</b> and strengthen the evaluation of environmental compliance and performance. These process diagrams is designed to prompt development planners and implementers to consider the environment at all stages of the business life cycle and practice sound environmental management. The EMF is based on international best practice and follows the Deming model philosophy as well as principles and elements of an environmental management system. The EMF must be an integral part in the way the department conduct its business and not seen as an ad hoc function and the duties of the environmental officer. To conclude, the EMF is the building block and interim management plan for an appropriate environmental management system in the future and the first step towards business excellence for the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry.

40|$|The resource-constrained {{scheduling}} problem (RCSP) involves {{the assignment of}} a limited set of resources to a collection of tasks, {{with the intent of}} satisfying some particular qualitative objective, under a variety of technological and temporal constraints. Real-world environments, however, introduce a variety of complications to the standard RCSP. The dynamic resource-constrained {{scheduling problem}} describes a class of real-world RCSPs that exist within the context of dynamic and unpredictable environments, where the details of the problem are often incomplete, and subject to change over time, without notice. ^ Previous approaches to solving resource-constrained scheduling problems failed to focus on the dynamic nature of real-world environments. The scheduling process occurs away from the environment in which the resulting schedule is executed. Complete prior knowledge of the order set is assumed, and reaction to changes in the environment, if at all, is limited. ^ We have developed a generic, multi-faceted, knowledge-based approach to solving dynamic resource-constrained scheduling problems, which focuses on issues of flexibility during the solution process to enable effective reaction to dynamic environments. Our approach is characterized by a highly opportunistic control scheme that provides the ability to adapt quickly to changes in the environment, a least-commitment scheduling procedure that preserves maneuverability by explicitly incorporating slack time into the developing schedule, and the systematic consultation of a range of relevant scheduling perspectives at <b>key</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>points</b> that provides an informed view of the current state of problem-solving at all times. ^ The Dynamic Scheduling System (DSS) is a working implementation of our scheduling approach, capable of representing a wide range of dynamic RCSPs, and producing quality schedules under a variety of real-world conditions. It handles a number of additional domain complexities, such as inter-order tasks and mobile resources with significant travel requirements. We discuss our scheduling approach and its application to two different RCSP domains, and evaluate its effectiveness in each, using special application systems built with DSS. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Establishing the {{effectiveness}} of patient decision aids (PtDA) requires evidence that PtDAs {{improve the quality of}} the decision-making process {{and the quality of the}} choice made, or decision quality. The aim of this paper is to review the theoretical and empirical evidence for PtDA effectiveness and discuss emerging practical and research issues in the measurement of effectiveness. Methods: This updated overview incorporates: a) an examination of the instruments used to measure five <b>key</b> <b>decision-making</b> process constructs (i. e., recognize decision, feel informed about options and outcomes, feel clear about goals and preferences, discuss goals and preferences with health care provider, and be involved in decisions) and decision quality constructs (i. e., knowledge, realistic expectations, values-choice agreement) within the 86 trials in the Cochrane review; and b) a summary of the 2011 Cochrane Collaboration's review of PtDAs for these key constructs. Data on the constructs and instruments used were extracted independently by two authors from the 86 trials and any disagreements were resolved by discussion, with adjudication by a third party where required. Results: The 86 studies provide considerable evidence that PtDAs improve the decision-making process and decision quality. A majority of the studies (76 / 86; 88) measured at least one of the <b>key</b> <b>decision-making</b> process or decision quality constructs. Seventeen different measurement instruments were used to measure decision-making process constructs, but no single instrument covered all five constructs. The Decisional Conflict Scale was most commonly used (n = 47), followed by the Control Preference Scale (n = 9). Many studies reported one or more constructs of decision quality, including knowledge (n = 59), realistic expectation of risks and benefits (n = 21), and values-choice agreement (n = 13). There was considerable variability in how values-choice agreement was defined and determined. No study reported on all <b>key</b> <b>decision-making</b> process and decision quality constructs. Conclusions: Evidence of PtDA effectiveness in improving the quality of the decision-making process and decision quality is strong and growing. There is not, however, consensus or standardization of measurement for either the decision-making process or decision quality. Additional work is needed to develop and evaluate measurement instruments and further explore theoretical issues to advance future research on PtDA effectiveness...|$|R
