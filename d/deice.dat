In recent years, for {{the high}} voltage {{transmission}} lines suffered serious Icing lead wire dancing, break and tower collapsed, domestic and foreign strengthened the study of high-voltage overhead line <b>deicing</b> methods and put forward a variety of line <b>deicing</b> methods. This paper first introduced thermal ice-melting method, mechanical <b>deicing</b> method, natural <b>deicing</b> method and several common <b>deicing</b> methods and analyzed {{the pros and cons}} of various <b>deicing</b> program. Based on the analysis of <b>deicing</b> methods {{for the high}} voltage transmission lines, a new and simple high voltage transmission line <b>deicer</b> is brought forward.

Seventy three tons were produced of one part CMA and three parts sand <b>deicer</b> which was field tested on I- 280 from I- 80 to the Mississippi River (7, 000 ADT with 50 % trucks).

40|$|Aircraft ground <b>deicing</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role of guaranteeing the aircraft safety. In practice, most airports generally use as many <b>deicing</b> fluids as possible to remove the ice, which causes the waste of the <b>deicing</b> fluids and the pollution of the environment. Therefore, the model of aircraft ground <b>deicing</b> should be built to establish the foundation for the subsequent research, such as the optimization of the <b>deicing</b> fluid consumption. In this article, the heat balance of the <b>deicing</b> process is depicted, and the dynamic model of the <b>deicing</b> process is provided based on the analysis of the <b>deicing</b> mechanism. In the dynamic model, the surface temperature of the <b>deicing</b> fluids and the ice thickness are regarded as the state parameters, while the fluid flow rate, the initial temperature, and the injection time of the <b>deicing</b> fluids are treated as control parameters. Ignoring the heat exchange between the <b>deicing</b> fluids and the environment, the simplified model is obtained. The rationality of the simplified model is verified by the numerical simulation and the impacts of the flow rate, the initial temperature and the injection time on the <b>deicing</b> process are investigated. To verify the model, the semi-physical experiment system is established, consisting of the low-constant temperature test chamber, the ice simulation system, the <b>deicing</b> fluid heating and spraying system, the simulated wing, the test sensors, and the computer measure and control system. The actual test data verify the validity of the dynamic model and the accuracy of the simulation analysis...|$|R

40|$|CFD Simulation of {{windshield}} de-icing {{has gained}} a lot of importance {{over the last few}} years. With stricter regulatory norms, both OEMs and suppliers have to constantly work on improving the defroster design [1], [2]. Experimental testing is extremely time-consuming as well as quite expensive. CFD simulations have been able to shorten the development cycle and reduce cost. Windshield <b>deicing</b> simulations involve both geometrical complexities as well as complex physics. It involves interaction between the airflow and two modes of heat transfer, basically conduction and convection [1]. A variety of factors play a very important role in accurately predicting the <b>deicing</b> process and <b>deicing</b> pattern. These factors include defroster angle with the windshield, mesh size and mesh type near the windshield and defroster outlet, thermal conductivity and specific heat considerations due to composite laminate windshield, effect of the melting of ice due to <b>deicing,</b> turbulence modeling etc. Without considering these effects, the <b>deicing</b> rates cannot be correctly predicted.

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure {{aircraft}} safety during winter conditions, glycol-based <b>deicing</b> and anti-icing fluids are employed prior to takeoff. These products can exert a severe {{impact on the environment}} if allowed to go untreated. The present study is related to the treatment of glycol-contaminated wastewaters by the activated sludge process. The specific objectives of the research were to: (1) determine the effects of process parameters such as biomass concentration, <b>deicing</b> fluid concentration and temperature on the biodegradation kinetics. (2) determine the mechanism of <b>deicing</b> fluid removal and model the reaction rates. (3) determine the effects of microbial changes on the treatment process. (4) evaluate the advantages of a sequencing batch reactor for the treatment of <b>deicing</b> wastes. (5) corroborate our laboratory results with field data from an operating wastewater facility treating <b>deicing</b> wastes. The results from the field show that despite the increases in influent organic matter during the <b>deicing</b> season, there were very little changes in effluent values of organic matter. Furthermore, influent concentrations of <b>deicing</b> fluid between 10 and 30 mg/L were reduced to trace amounts (i. e. below 5 mg/L) throughout the <b>deicing</b> season. However, as witnessed by the high sludge volume index during the <b>deicing</b> season, the presence of <b>deicing</b> fluid creates settling problems in the clarifier. The laboratory batch experiments indicate optimal substrate removal rates at biomass concentrations of 1000 mg/L and 2000 mg/L. Very low biomass levels lead to inhibition whereas a high biomass level of 3000 mg/L is unnecessary since the food to microorganism ratio is such that {{only a fraction of the}} biomass participates in the degradation reaction. With regards to <b>deicing</b> fluid concentration, organic matter removal rates tend to increase as the <b>deicing</b> fluid is increased. However, at the highest level of <b>deicing</b> fluid, certain inhibitory effects are present. As expected, higher temperatures produce much higher removal rates with the ethylene glycol substrate showing less variation with temperature than the other organic compounds present in the wastewater. With regards to the mechanism of removal, the results showed very little adsorption of organic matter onto the biomass within the first hour of contact. In addition, the total organic matter removal (TOC and COD) followed first order kinetics with respect to substrate concentration. Lastly, sequencing batch reactor operation allowed for much higher removal rates as the microbial population is acclimatized to the substrate with increasing cycles. With regards to the microbial population, the Biolog results showed that there was a decrease in the variety of compounds that could be degraded as the biomass was exposed to the <b>deicing</b> fluid. Furthermore, most population changes occurred at the very beginning of the <b>deicing</b> season and in the first half of the SBR experiments...|$|R
