5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a <b>fair</b> <b>chance</b> to show me what he could do. I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was observed on November19 about 800km (500mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The disturbance tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC {{to issue a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone. The circulation associated with the system continued westward, reorganizing on November26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite being located unusually close to the equator, the disturbance maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and diffluence aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a <b>fair</b> <b>chance</b> of developing.|$|E
5|$|In February 1946, Shaughnessy {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} return to Maryland amidst mounting criticism at Pittsburgh, which included the threat of resignation from assistant coaches Charles Hartwig, Bobby Hoel and Stan Olenn. University of Maryland president Dr. H. C. Byrd, himself a former football coach, called Shaughnessy one of the top-three coaches in the nation. Shaughnessy complained {{that he was not}} given a <b>fair</b> <b>chance</b> to succeed at Pittsburgh and that controversy over his role with the Redskins was without basis. The Pittsburgh athletic board had recommended Shaughnessy be retained as coach if he resigned from the Redskins, but he refused.|$|E

5|$|Bart and Lisa suggest Homer have a go at voice acting {{when they}} read {{that there will be}} open auditions. Homer auditions to read for Poochie's voice, and gets the part. He and June Bellamy, his fellow voice actor, make several {{publicity}} stops to promote Poochie, where Homer confronts the show's hardcore fans. Homer invites all of his friends and relatives to the screening of the first Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show. However, the cartoon is full of clichés and asinine antics, and by emphasizing Poochie, contains none of the show's trademark violence. Everyone except Homer finds the episode unimpressive. Meyers is forced to admit that Poochie's debut was a dud, and he decides {{to get rid of the}} character. Homer learns that Poochie will be killed off, and resolves to keep Poochie alive. At his next recording session, rather than reading from the script, he implores the audience, through lines that he wrote, to give Poochie a <b>fair</b> <b>chance.</b> The writing team appears moved by Homer's statement. However, on airing, his statement is dubbed over by Myers and Poochie is killed off in a poorly edited fashion. The in-studio audience cheers wildly as Krusty promises that Poochie is gone for good. Homer feels betrayed but attributes the affair to the nature of show business.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, one of {{the major}} focal points of antifeminism was {{opposition}} to women's suffrage, which began as a grassroots movement in 1848 and spanned for 72 years.

In Sex in Education: or, a <b>Fair</b> <b>Chance</b> for the Girls (1873), Harvard professor Edward Clarke predicted that if women went to college, their brains would grow bigger and heavier, and their wombs would atrophy. Other antifeminists opposed women's entry into the labor force, their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.|$|E
