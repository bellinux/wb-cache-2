Two hundred associated word pairs (thus 400 words) were selected from among the Nelson, McEvoy, and Schreiber (2004) norms, with all associated items being one of three strongest associations of the target word (e.g., table–chair). The words had concreteness levels greater than 3.5 of 7 according to Nelson et al. (2004).

The two items were counterbalanced across study and test phases. For example, for half of the subjects, when table was presented during the study phase, chair served as the lure during the test phase; for the other half, chair served as the target and table as the lure. Thus, all 400 words appeared as both targets and lures across subjects.

Another potential explanation is related to biochemical factors deriving from anaerobic metabolism affecting aerobic pathways. The analysis of other records on skyscrapers showed a relationship between the (minimum) mechanical power and the event duration qualitatively resembling the equation proposed by Wilkie about the maximum mechanical power provided as a function of time. The vertical distance between the two curves is likely to be due by: the internal mechanical work of locomotion (which can be different depending on the speed and stride frequency adopted), and by the use of upper limbs to assist propulsion.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a heavy resistive exercise causes performance enhancement of a slow stretch-shortening cycle exercise and if there is an optimal rest interval. Eighteen subjects performed countermovement jumps (CMJs) before and after a 5 repetition maximum back squat lifting protocol. This procedure was repeated 4 times over 2 days using rest intervals of 30 seconds and 2, 4, and 6 minutes. Flight time and peak ground reaction force (GRF) were the dependent variables. All jumps were performed on a specially constructed sledge and force platform apparatus. Repeated measures analysis of variance found a significant reduction in flight time at the 30 -second and 6 -minute interval (p< 0. 05). No significant difference was found between men and women. Only the men showed an enhancement in jump performance after the 4 minute interval. The improvement window was <b>different</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> and an analysis of the greatest increase and decrease in flight time and peak ground reaction force was conducted, showing a significant decrease for men and women and a significant increase in flight time for men and peak ground reaction force for women.

The individual determination of the intracomplex rest interval may be necessary in the practical setting. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Study of Arterial {{pressure}} and flow variation when external pressure applied {{is critical in}} understanding clinical relevance of pulse. A distributed model of entire human arterial tree proposed to describe the hemodynamic changes due to pressure applied on the brachial artery. Input to this distributed model is from a four element Windkessel model. The morphological changes in both the model with baroreflex, and the experiment were analyzed. It is observed that the pulse morphology changes with the applied pressure in both radial pressure pulse from the model and the finger volume pulse (PPG) from the experiment. The normalized values of pulse height, maximum systolic slope, maximum diastolic slope, and peak to peak interval (PPI) were calculated for each beat. The model with baroreflex parameters are positively correlated with the measured parameters (for maximum systolic slope r = 0. 98; for maximum diastolic slope r = 0. 981; for pulse height r = 0. 97 when P < 0. 05). The PPI variation is <b>different</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> reflecting the reflex properties of the individual. With the integration of baroreflex loop in the model, the experimental parameters are accurately predicted. The model of the baroreflex system considered only the Heart Rate variations. Variable elastance and reflex system with all parameters such as stroke volume, contractility, and peripheral resistance variation should be incorporated in the model in order to accurately predict the experimental results.

40|$|This study {{tested the}} unique {{checking}} constraint hypothesis and the usage-based account concerning why young children produced tense and agreement morphemes variably via three experiments. Experiment 1 investigated whether subject types influenced the production accuracy of auxiliary 2 ̆ 7 is 2 ̆ 7 in three-year-olds through an elicited production task. The {{rate of use}} of auxiliary 2 ̆ 7 is 2 ̆ 7 increased as children 2 ̆ 7 s tense productivity increased, but the pattern was <b>different</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> type. The rate of use increased more rapidly with tense productivity for lexical NP subjects than it did for pronominal subjects. Experiment 2 further examined the role of subject types, predicate types, and predicate word frequency {{on the use of}} copula 2 ̆ 7 is 2 ̆ 7 in three-year-olds via an elicited production task. Overall, the production accuracy of copula 2 ̆ 7 is 2 ̆ 7 was higher with nominal predicates than with permanent- or temporary-adjectival predicates, followed by locative predicates. Children also produced copula 2 ̆ 7 is 2 ̆ 7 more accurately with low-frequency predicate words than with high-frequency predicate words. Moreover, the effect of subject types on the use of copula 2 ̆ 7 is 2 ̆ 7 varied with children 2 ̆ 7 s tense productivity. For sentences with nominal, permanent-adjectival, or temporary-adjectival predicates, children with lower tense productivity used copula 2 ̆ 7 is 2 ̆ 7 more accurately with lexical subjects than with pronominal subjects in. In contrast, children with higher tense productivity produced copula 2 ̆ 7 is 2 ̆ 7 more accurately with pronominal subjects than with lexical subjects. Experiment 3 extended Experiment 1 by exploring the degree of abstractness of representations of auxiliary BE via a structural priming task. The production accuracy of auxiliary 2 ̆ 7 is 2 ̆ 7 in three-year-olds increased above the baseline when the prime-target pair shared the same structure and subject + auxiliary 2 ̆ 7 is 2 ̆ 7 combinations, but not when the prime-target pair only shared the same structure. However, the production accuracy of auxiliary 2 ̆ 7 are 2 ̆ 7 did not change with prime types. These experiments suggest that young children have only lexically-specific representations of auxiliary BE. Frequency, rather than structural properties, of sentence elements influenced the production accuracy of auxiliary and copula 2 ̆ 7 is 2 ̆ 7 in young children. These findings support the usage-based approach that young children use tense and agreement morphemes variably because they have not yet learned adult-like abstract representations and use highly frequent/ lexically-specific constructions for the production of these morphemes...|$|E

Most state-of-the-art systems for monitoring sitting behavior {{are based on}} supervised methods that are limited to a fixed set of classes.

We designed and implemented a system to monitor sitting behavior in an unsupervised manner. Based on the pressure dis-tribution acquired from a pressure mat we generate prototypes of sitting postures. The prototypes are stored in a database and serve as reference for comparing and classifying incoming pressure data. The system relies on only a few, interpretable system parameters and performs in real-time.
