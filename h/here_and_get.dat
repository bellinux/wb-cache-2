5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the song}} {{has never been}} {{performed}} live {{as part of a}} televised performance, the song was featured on the set list of the Loud Tour. Before she performed [...] "Skin", Rihanna appeared on stage with a set similar to that of her performance of [...] "S" [...] remix with Britney Spears at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, wearing a black tuxedo and pink tie to perform a cover of Princes [...] "Darling Nikki", before transitioning into [...] "S". As [...] "S" [...] started, Rihanna removed her tuxedo to reveal a white PVC body suit. After performing [...] "S", Rihanna performed [...] "Skin" [...] while laying on raised platform, and at {{near the end of the}} performance said [...] "this is the part of the show when we like to have a little fun [...] who wants to come up <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> freaky with me?" [...] and takes a man out of the audience and pins them down on the platform, where she provocatively and sexually gyrates and grinds him as they are lowered under the stage as the song's instrumental ends and the lights go out. Rihanna has caused controversy by occasionally opting to perform the act with a woman instead.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the strike}} on the Pentagon by American Airlines Flight 77, Rumsfeld {{went out to}} the parking lot to assist with rescue efforts. He later {{recalled}} that [...] "I wanted to see what had happened. I wanted to see if people needed help. I went downstairs and helped for a bit with some people on stretchers. Then I came back up here and started – I realized I had to get back up <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, dear. Yes, {{we really}} are <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> to rights as fast as possible. But {{it seems to me}} you are rather gorgeous, Jamie. What do you belong to a fire company or a jockey club?" [...] asked Rose, turning up the once chubby face, which now was <b>getting</b> brown <b>and</b> square about the chin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted no}} other help than this,--that I {{might have had}} an {{opportunity}} of meeting Violet <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> of <b>getting</b> from her some answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I say, Johnson,' said he, 'do {{bring me}} some ham and chicken--it's for a lady--I'm wedged up <b>here</b> <b>and</b> can't <b>get</b> out--and, Johnson, some sherry.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Connally's party bolt left a sour {{taste in}} the mouth of at least one {{prominent}} Texas Democrat who stood with George McGovern in 1972: Bob Bullock, the Hillsboro native who served as Texas secretary of state, comptroller and lieutenant governor: [...] "...I got some ideas on Mr. Connally. He ain't never done nothin' but get shot in Dallas. He got the silver bullet. He needs to come back <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> hisself [...] shot once every six months. I attack Connally on his vanity. He's terribly bad [...] vain, y'know..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most notorious}} matchups {{of the era}} took place in 1993, 1995, and 1996, in which Ohio State entered the game each year undefeated. The Buckeyes had a 9–0–1 record heading into the 1993 game and were looking to claim an {{outright}} Big Ten title against a Michigan team that had already lost four times. Michigan receiver Mercury Hayes and running backs Jon Ritchie, Che Foster, and Ed Davis each scored a touchdown as the Wolverines shocked the Buckeyes, 28–0. After the game, Cooper said: [...] "This {{is one of the}} most embarrassing games I've ever been involved with." [...] "They outplayed us on offense, on defense, and in the kicking game. If you'd told me we would come up <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> beat 28–0, I'd have probably stayed home." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the post-fight interview, an {{emotional}} Fury said, [...] "This {{is a dream}} come true. We worked so hard for this. I've done it. It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks very much for having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E
5000|$|Black's favoured {{position}} {{is that of a}} playmaker or trequartista, playing centrally between midfield and attack: [...] "My position was just behind the front striker and in front of the midfield. This is my best position and I enjoyed playing <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> on the ball linking things between midfield and attack." [...] He repeatedly expressed frustration at being dropped or shunted to the wing despite performing well in a central role.|$|R
2500|$|After the contest, Reggie White was so visibly upset, {{he started}} {{shouting}} at television crews who were filming {{him on the}} sidelines. This was the third consecutive year that Dallas eliminated Green Bay from the playoffs (All three games were played in Dallas). [...] "We keep coming down <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> lessons, said Packers coach Mike Holmgren, whose team had lost six {{in a row in}} Dallas since October 1993. [...] "I'm tired of getting lessons." ...|$|R
60|$|My patron {{stopping}} <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> down, or alighting {{from his}} mule, gave {{him to his}} man, and asking me to alight, told me {{this was the first}} night's entertainment I was to meet with in the Andes, and hoped I was prepared for it. I told him, that I might very well consent to accept of such entertainment, in a journey of my own contriving, as he was content to take up with, in compliment to me.|$|R
2500|$|Doug Moon {{left the}} band {{because of his}} dislike of the band's {{increasing}} experimentation outside his preferred blues genre. Ry Cooder told of Moon's becoming so angered by Van Vliet's unrelenting criticism that {{he walked into the}} room pointing a loaded crossbow at him, only to have Van Vliet tell him, [...] "Get that fucking thing out of here, get out of <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> back in your room", which he did. (Other band members dispute this account, though Moon is likely to have [...] "passed through" [...] the studio with a weapon.) Moon was present during the early demo sessions at Original Sound studio, above the Kama Sutra/Buddah offices. The works Moon laid down did not see the light of day, as he was replaced by Cooder when they continued on material at Sunset Sound with Marker. Marker then fell by the wayside when recording was moved by Krasnow and Perry to RCA Studio. This would {{have a profound effect on}} the quality of the Safe as Milk work, as the former studio was 8-track and the subsequent studio a 4-track.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Aunt Roxy," [...] said Mrs. Kittridge, [...] "you {{are on your}} way, are you? Do sit down, right <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a cup {{of strong}} tea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] {{the little}} girl shouted, angrily. [...] "It ain't a book. It's a thing to beat eggs with. Mother said to come <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good!" [...] cried Sam, {{but then}} added quickly: [...] "For gracious sake! don't {{make too much}} noise or you'll {{have one of the}} {{monitors}} <b>here</b> <b>and</b> we'll <b>get</b> some black marks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must part now," [...] said Dain, {{after a long}} silence. [...] "You {{must return}} at once, Nina. I will wait till the brig drifts down <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> shall <b>get</b> on board then." ...|$|R
60|$|DORA. You're {{not a bit}} tired, and you're not crosser {{than two}} sticks; and we'll make you talk, if you were crosser than six. Come <b>here,</b> Egypt; <b>and</b> <b>get</b> {{on the other side}} of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Ralph said; [...] "but I was tremendously shaken, {{and feel}} stiff all over. I will lie {{down by the}} wall, <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a few hours' sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{could put}} {{him into the}} out-house in the field next to the copse, hide his trappings <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> him provender from Ewins's farm. Will that do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, William," [...] says I, [...] "thou showest me plain enough thou hast {{an honest}} meaning; dost thou think it {{practicable}} {{for us to}} put an end to our unhappy way of living <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> off?" ...|$|E
6000|$|With this apology, Mercury directs a scornful and indignant look at {{the young}} man {{of the name of}} Guppy which plainly says, [...] "What do you come calling <b>here</b> for <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> ME into a row?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So that is settled, ma'm. I {{am going}} on to Exeter from <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> shall <b>get</b> her a stock of clothes there, and will bring her back next Saturday. Will it suit you to take her then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} had better keep along the hillside, Zeke. We can travel fast <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> can <b>get</b> so far that when they find the trail in the morning, and follow us, we shall be too far away for them to {{overtake}} us before nightfall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall stay quietly <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a good night's rest; {{and then}} ride out to-morrow {{morning in the}} face of the whole shire. No, not a word! You would not have me sneak away like a coward?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "you {{can come back}} <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> your dinner, {{if you want to}} saw wood for it from ten till twelve, and you get your supper if you'll saw from five to six." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we won't give it up. Let's go in <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> some coffee, {{and think}} it over a bit." [...] They were {{near one of the}} {{principal}} cafés, which was full of people smoking, and drinking the Viennese mélange out of tumblers.|$|E
6000|$|... {Connie} (Softly.) You know he's peculiar. He {{is liable}} to ignore {{everybody}} <b>here</b> this afternoon, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> up <b>and</b> go away abruptly, without saying good-bye.|$|R
5000|$|... “This is {{definitely}} safe where we’re going,” district supervisor Allen Hale said. “But {{once you get}} to the tunnel and someone walks through <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> all the way up, they’re going to want to go in... The ultimate goal … is to have the tunnel open all the way through to the west side to the Blue Ridge Mountains and have a trail connection to U.S. Route 250 on the other side,” Hale said... According to The News & Advance archives, the $450,000 required for Phase II has already been raised. Hale hopes to begin Phase II some time this year. The date for Phase III has yet to be set.|$|R
6000|$|If I hold out, as I hope to do, I {{shall be}} greatly pressed in leaving <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> over to New York before next Saturday's mail from there. Do not, therefore, if all be well, {{expect to hear}} from me by Saturday's mail, but look for my last letter from America by the mail of the {{following}} Wednesday, the 15th. Be sure that you shall hear, however, by Saturday's mail, if I should knock up as to reading. I am tremendously [...] "beat," [...] but I feel really and unaffectedly so much stronger to-day, both in my body and hopes, that I am much encouraged. I have a fancy that I turned my worst time last night.|$|R
6000|$|... "For? You {{know as well}} as I do! Didn't {{you come}} in <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a fedora hat, some shirts and collars and neckties, and a pair of fur-lined gloves, and a lot of underwear? The whole bill came to just twenty-six dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The rope's {{quicker and}} quite as safe," [...] he said. [...] "One of the Mappin boys made that ladder and fixed it wrong. Catch hold <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a turn round your foot; you don't {{want to go}} through the bottom of the can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, countryman," [...] {{said the}} man, [...] "for all that I can see, {{you may as}} well bide a while with us; for, indeed, with leave of my graceless maid, I think we may even end our wild-goose chase <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> us back to the town." ...|$|E
