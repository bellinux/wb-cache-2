5|$|In 1984, Brooks {{founded the}} {{television}} and film company, Gracie Films. Although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> do so, Brooks returned to television in 1987 as the producer of The Tracey Ullman Show. He hired cartoonist Matt Groening to create a series of shorts for the show, which eventually led to The Simpsons in 1989. The Simpsons won numerous awards and is still running. Brooks also co-produced and co-wrote the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie. In total, Brooks has received 47 Emmy nominations, winning 20 of them.|$|E

5|$|Moffat {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} the dream split to Nye, who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they were real. Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who. Moffat also instructed Nye {{to come up with a}} monster, and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine, reflecting his own fear of old people as a child, but he made clear that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> make children scared of their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Infantry Brigade, {{the only}} one trained to NATO standards, was serving in Iraq at the {{beginning}} of the war; on 11 August, the United States Air Force airlifted it to Georgia. The elite Georgian troops were overdue from Iraq and could not participate in the fighting. The presence of prime 2,000 Georgian military and the most Georgian high-level government officials abroad before the war meant that Georgia <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{responded by}} {{launching}} a major offensive in eastern Slavonia, {{from where it}} intended to progress west via Vinkovci and Osijek to Zagreb. The army did not bypass Vukovar, because they wished to relieve the besieged barracks and to eliminate a possible threat to their supply lines. The JNA leadership <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> make Vukovar {{the main focus of}} the offensive but, as happened with Stalingrad in the Second World War, an initially inconsequential engagement became an essential political symbol for both sides.|$|E

5|$|Bill Wood, the Astros' general manager, {{said the}} team {{believed}} Nevin {{was close to}} a major-league level and would require little development in minor league baseball. As evidence for this, the Astros pointed to Nevin's training with the wooden bats used in professional baseball {{in an effort to}} prepare himself for the transition from metal bats. The Astros believed he would be a solid power hitter and have a strong work ethic. Nevin also <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> seek a signing bonus approaching those received by Van Poppel and Taylor. The Astros decided to employ Nevin as a third baseman. Not wanting to draw out his contract negotiations, Nevin signed with Houston in June, receiving a $700,000 bonus.|$|E
5|$|During the House of Representatives {{debate on}} the report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, stated that he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons {{for the presence of}} water after each replenishment, and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended to require fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that his Department <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one engine inoperative in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{independent}} Hollywood producer Robert Lippert {{acquired the}} rights to Caligari from Matray and Universum Film AG for $50,000, and produced a film called The Cabinet of Caligari, which was released in 1962. Screenwriter Robert Bloch <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> write a Caligari remake, {{and in fact the}} title was forced upon his untitled screenplay by director Roger Kay. The film had few similarities to the original Caligari except for its title and a plot twist at the end, in which it is revealed the story was simply the delusion of the protagonist, who believed she was being held captive by a character named Caligari. Instead, he was her psychiatrist, and he cures her {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the allegations, Sony stated that the game was not based on reality, and they believed they had adequate permissions necessary. They later added that the game was purely entertainment and fictional, comparing it to the television programme Doctor Who. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair commented that though companies should have more responsibility and sensitivity to the feelings of others, the issue would be immensely difficult. Although the copyright concerns {{were found to be}} without merit, Sony offered a formal apology to the Church of England and leaders of the cathedral in July 2007, stating that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> cause offence.|$|E
5|$|On 20 April L'Héritier {{was ordered}} to take Hercule on her maiden voyage, the short journey {{northwest}} along the coast to join the main fleet under Vice-Admiral Morard de Galles at Brest, where the crew would be augmented to reach the full complement. On board were surplus naval supplies, including {{a full set of}} rigging for a ship of the line, from the destroyed ship Quatorze Juillet which had caught fire at Lorient earlier in the month. L'Héritier's crew were inexperienced and the captain <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> seek action, remaining close to the coastline during {{the first day of the}} journey. As his ship crossed Audierne Bay between Point Penmarc'h and the Pointe du Raz however sails were sighted to the northwest.|$|E
5|$|The Abbasid {{invasion}} of Asia Minor in 782 {{was one of}} the largest operations launched by the Abbasid Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire. The invasion was launched as a display of Abbasid military might {{in the aftermath of a}} series of Byzantine successes. Commanded by the Abbasid heir-apparent, the future Harun al-Rashid, the Abbasid army reached as far as Chrysopolis, across the Bosporus from the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, while secondary forces raided western Asia Minor and defeated the Byzantine forces there. As Harun <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> assault Constantinople and lacked ships to do so, he turned back.|$|E

5|$|The Bougainville Campaign {{began on}} 1November 1943 when the United States I Marine Amphibious Corps, under Major General Roy Geiger, landed at Empress Augusta Bay {{on the west}} coast of the Japanese-held island. The Allied {{invasion}} aimed to establish a defensive perimeter around Cape Torokina in which airfields would be built to attack the major Japanese base at Rabaul and support other operations in the region. The Allied forces <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> conquer the entire island, however, and the invasion area was selected {{on the grounds that it}} was lightly defended and distant from the main Japanese bases at the northern and southern ends of Bougainville.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture {{the feel of the}} {{original}} game with updated graphics and sounds in the demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving requests from fans, the development team <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> create a complete remake of the original game since they would not have the necessary resources, and because they thought the result would not have been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten scenes to better flow from one to the other.|$|E
