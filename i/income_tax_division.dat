Three (3) new departments were created, namely: 1) Legal, 2) Assessment and 3) Collection. On {{the latter part of}} January of the same year, Memorandum Order No. V-188 created the Withholding Tax Unit, which was placed under the <b>Income</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>Division</b> of the Assessment Department. Simultaneously, the implementation of the withholding tax system was adopted by virtue of Republic Act (RA) 690. This method of collecting income tax upon receipt of the income resulted to the collection of approximately 25% of the total income tax collected during the said period.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> reforms and the {{development}} of Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues in the period of 1983 - 2011.

Then, regarding tax revenues, data shows that the Indonesian's nominal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues have increased considerably during that period; however they {{have not been able to}} increase Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> ratios significantly. This phenomenon indicates that even though the <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> reforms did have positive effects on increasing the <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues, they were not the only factors for the steep increase of Indonesian's nominal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues. This paper shows that Indonesian's relatively high inflation rates and high economic growth during that period have considerably contributed to the steep increases of <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues. At the end, in order to increase the Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues fur- ther, this paper notes that beside tax regulation reform, it is equally necessary to promote public tax awareness, tax authorities' professionalism and integrity, and the implementation of governance practices in Indonesian's bureaucracy...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend the}} celebrated Chamley-Judd result of zero capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> {{and show that}} the steady state optimal capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> is nonzero, in general. In particular, {{we find that the}} optimal plan {{involves}} zero capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> in investment sector and a nonzero capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> in consumption sector. In a two sector neoclassical economy, interdependence of labour and capital margins allows the government to choose an optimal policy that involves nonzero <b>tax</b> on capital <b>income.</b> The distortion created by capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> in consumption sector can be undone by setting different rates of labour <b>income</b> <b>taxes.</b> The optimal plan thus involves zero capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> in both sectors only if optimal labour <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> are equal. This may not be the optimal policy if marginal disutility of work is different across sectors and/or the social marginal value of capital is different across sectors. The difference in social marginal value of capital can be undone by setting different labour <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> across sectors. We also show that if the government faces a constraint of keeping same capital and labour <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> rates across sectors, optimal capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> is nonzero.
