5|$|The {{animals were}} {{restored}} between 1975 and 1977 by Bill and Caroline Von Stein of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Von Steins were experienced with {{other types of}} museum conservation work, but had never restored carousel animals. Because of the animals' poor condition, no attempt was made to restore them to their original paintwork; instead, the restorers were allowed to use their judgment on color choices and other decorations. The museum's only requirements were that they use reasonably natural decorative schemes and no <b>high-gloss</b> paint.|$|E
5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is <b>high-gloss,</b> covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.|$|E
5|$|While the inceptive noir, Stranger on the Third Floor, was a B picture {{directed}} by a virtual unknown, {{many of the}} films noir still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with The Maltese Falcon (1941), John Huston followed with Key Largo (1948) and The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951) and The Wrong Man (1956). Otto Preminger's success with Laura (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a <b>high-gloss</b> 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include Fallen Angel (1945), Whirlpool (1949), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) (all for Fox) and Angel Face (1952). A half-decade after Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend, Billy Wilder made Sunset Boulevard (1950) and Ace in the Hole (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. In a Lonely Place (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, They Live by Night (1948) and On Dangerous Ground (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.|$|E

5000|$|The {{so-called}} First Golden Age of Philippine Cinema commenced in the 1950s {{with the}} flourishing {{establishment of the}} so-called Big Four studios, namely LVN Pictures, Sampaguita Pictures, Lebran International and Premiere Productions, with each studio specializing in different genres. Sampaguita Pictures specialized in <b>high-glossed</b> society pictures and musicals. Premiere Productions and Lebran International specialized in action pictures. LVN, on the other hand, became known for its [...] "superproductions," [...] the Hollywood equivalent of [...] "epic" [...] films that was complemented by the LVN superstars that starred in these films. The various superproductions of LVN were Ibong Adarna (1955), Lapu-Lapu (1955) and the movie classics Badjao (1956), Anak Dalita (1957) and Biyaya ng Lupa (1959). At this time, LVN Pictures emerged as the biggest film studio of the Philippines, releasing 2 to 3 films a month in 1955-1956.|$|R

25|$|Typefaces {{may also}} be {{designed}} differently considering the type of paper on which they will be printed. Designs to be printed on absorbent newsprint paper will be more slender as the ink will naturally spread out as it absorbs into the paper, and may feature ink traps: areas left blank into which the ink will soak as it dries. These corrections will not be needed for printing on <b>high-gloss</b> cardboard or display on-screen. Fonts designed for low-resolution displays, meanwhile, may avoid pure circles, fine lines and details a screen cannot render.|$|E
25|$|Jobs agreed, and Rubinstein {{assembled}} and managed {{a team of}} hardware and software engineers to ready the product on a rushed, eight-month schedule. The team’s engineers needed to overcome a number of hurdles, including {{figuring out how to}} play music off a spinning hard drive for more than 10 hours without wiping out a battery charge. Rubinstein’s production contacts proved invaluable, too; the iPod’s sleek, minimalist design, with its <b>high-gloss,</b> engraveable metal back, was a mass-manufacturing triumph. The success of the first-generation iPod was almost overnight. By 2004 the business became so important to Apple that the iPod was spun off into its own division, which Rubinstein took over.|$|E
25|$|Laca is {{the making}} of wooden items which are then painted and coated with a <b>high-gloss</b> lacquer. The best pieces of this type are made of a wood called linalóe (Bursera aloexylon) which is aromatic. Cheaper ones are made of pine, treated to smell like linalóe. The making of {{lacquered}} items is centered in the municipality of Olinalá, but also {{can be found in}} Temalcalcingo, Ocotepec and Acapetlahuaya. Olinalá’s lacquered items are traditional made with a wood called linaloe, with has a distinctive odor, but due to its relatively scarcity, pine is also being used. Items made include small boxes, chests, trays, masks, frames, jewelry boxes.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were <b>high-gloss</b> wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
500|$|Room Service {{followed}} in 2001 to a mixed response from critics. [...] "Probably the best Roxette album since Joyride," [...] wrote Leslie Mathew of Allmusic, [...] "Room Service is an exciting, immediate, <b>high-gloss</b> pop gem that contains very little filler indeed." [...] Per Bjurman from Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet {{was critical of}} the album. [...] "It is not very good." [...] he wrote. He did praise the three singles, [...] "Real Sugar," [...] "The Centre of the Heart," [...] and [...] "Milk and Toast and Honey," [...] but he ended the review with the prediction: [...] "Roxette is not finished. But soon, I suspect." ...|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 is {{considered}} a key group {{in the development of}} pop punk; the band's combination of pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. The trio has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States, and over 50 million albums worldwide. In 2011, The New York Times asserted, [...] "no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182," [...] and even as the band receded after its 2005 split, [...] "its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of <b>high-gloss</b> Warped Tour punk bands, like All Time Low and The Maine." ...|$|E
500|$|Shoe polish {{is applied}} to the shoe using a rag, cloth, or brush. Shoe polish is not a {{cleaning}} product, and therefore the footwear should be both clean and dry before application. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as spit-polishing or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This achieves the mirror-like, <b>high-gloss</b> finish sometimes known as a spit shine or bull which is especially valued in military organizations. Despite the term, saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water. [...] Polishes containing carnauba wax {{can be used as a}} protective coating to extend the life and look of a leather shoe.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} positive reviews from most music critics. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy was positive, giving the song {{a rating of}} 5 out of 5 stars, praising the [...] "80s-styled funk beats and wildly infectious percussion", the [...] "singalong chorus may be a hasty reminder that his strength lies in fist-clenching". He also wrote that considered the song [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} musical evolutions of 2012." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the song 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing that [...] "The song is about unbridled passion, but as usual with Mars, the aesthetic is tidy and impeccable, pop songcraft polished to a <b>high-gloss</b> gleam: jittery Police-esque rock-reggae verses that erupt, amid thunder-boom synths, into a steamrolling four-on-the-floor chorus." [...] Carl Williott of Idolator also gave the song a positive review, writing that it [...] "shows an interesting musical evolution," [...] and called the song [...] "interesting" [...] and marks it as a shift for Mars and his style.|$|E
500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave [...] "Live While We're Young" [...] {{four out}} of five stars and wrote, [...] "it's little {{different}} from what we've heard before [...] but when you're the world's biggest boyband, it's no bad thing." [...] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times summarised it as a [...] "characteristically peppy piece of <b>high-gloss</b> party pop." [...] Lansky praised its effectiveness and thought it was [...] "perfectly tailored to top the charts." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Popdust acknowledged that [...] "the song is smart to swipe the guitar-only opening pattern from The Clash's [...] "Should I Stay or Should I Go?"—akin to [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] lifting the [...] "Summer Nights" [...] beginning—calling on pop history to get you excited for the song before you even really realise why." [...] Unterberger further highlighted the small lyrical plays for conveying [...] "an incredible amount of urgency and fun without much clunky verbage , making singing along something of an inevitability." [...] A writer for The Huffington Post asserted that the song delivers for fans of their debut album: [...] "a poppy, energetic, happy-go-lucky track." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Linder of IGN commented [...] "2004's Greatest Hits: My Prerogative [...] {{captured}} the highlights from Britney's heyday, but lacks the more mature club-oriented material that she's churned out in recent years. That helps make this collection a justifiable fan purchase". Mike Diver of BBC Online called it [...] "the definitive Britney album" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "these songs don't just make a mark, lingering in the memory– they are essential pieces of {{the past ten years}} of pop history, and deserve better than dismissal by so-called discerning listeners". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called the album [...] "a <b>high-gloss</b> collection of tunes that selectively sums up the career of one of the biggest female pop singers of the past decade. It's a disc that's light on filler [...] and heavy on Spears' more high-energy cuts, which, without question, play to her strengths as a performer". Sputnikmusic stated [...] "This is Britney's second greatest hits, and it's incredibly strong. It focuses mainly on her more upbeat, danceable numbers, with a few slower ones thrown in to change things up without disrupting the constant stream of quality pop songs" [...] and summarized the review adding [...] "As {{one of the most successful}} artists of the decade, is it any wonder this compilation is so good?".|$|E
500|$|In a November 2007 {{interview}} with Paul Cashmere of the website Undercover, Middleton stated {{that a couple}} of songs they had initially written for Vulture Street [...] "were just too Odyssey Number Five based", and that the first track, [...] "Rockin' Rocks", was [...] "probably the start of where we were heading" [...] with the album". Cashmere stated that the album was [...] "the toughest [...] heard Powderfinger sound". Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger's more recent albums, he described Vulture Street as [...] "a rawer, louder" [...] album in comparison to Odyssey Number Five; it highlighted Fanning's [...] "talent as a lyricist" [...] and stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton [...] "dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut". Zuel stated that there is a [...] "real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger," [...] and described [...] "On My Mind" [...] as having [...] "AC/DC meatiness", and [...] "Love Your Way" [...] as [...] "acoustic tumbling into weaving Zeppelin lines". In his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, Zuel described it as [...] " [...] <b>high-gloss</b> and muscular framework," [...] and stated that that was what [...] "American radio considers serious rock." ...|$|E
500|$|A critic {{from the}} Sunday Herald viewed the song as [...] "impressively-lacquered" [...] and wrote that it [...] "undoubtedly [...] tentpole" [...] Saints & Sinners, while Samuel McGuire of the {{newspaper}} deemed it a [...] "gem of a truly wondrous lustre". Nigel Packer of the BBC News called it a highlight on Saints & Sinners, complimenting its acid techno elements. Lindsay Baker of The Guardian cited [...] "Black Coffee" [...] as the album's [...] "particularly infectious" [...] track. R.S. Murthi writing in the New Straits Times described it as [...] "the most endearing" [...] song on Saints & Sinners, likening it to songs by the Cocteau Twins. Eva Simpson of the Daily Mirror regarded the track as sassy and a curtain raiser for the album, noting that Orbit's production [...] "brought the same <b>high-gloss</b> sheen" [...] as [...] "Pure Shores". Adrian Thrills of the Daily Mail found [...] "Black Coffee" [...] and [...] "Pure Shores" [...] brilliantly produced and named them the two best tracks on Saints & Sinners. According to Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald, [...] "Black Coffee" [...] along with [...] "Pure Shores" [...] and [...] "Surrender" [...] "put most [...] in the shade". A writer for the Western Mail said [...] "Black Coffee" [...] was as [...] "equally tremendous" [...] as [...] "Pure Shores". By the end of 2000, the track was included in year-end lists compiled by Dotmusic (number three), and the NME (number 26).|$|E
500|$|... "You and I" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. After hearing the White Tie and Tiara Ball performance, Entertainment Weekly Leah Greenblatt complimented the song for its [...] "torchy, slow-burn cabaret quality" [...] and for lacking [...] "Auto-Tune, fancy production, or performance gimmicks." [...] McCormick, noting {{the differences between}} Gaga's live and studio versions of the song, described the studio version as [...] "bigger, bolder and less quirkily emotive, a custom-built radio rock ballad to induce hand claps in packed stadiums. This is not music for the underground: it is cheesy, <b>high-gloss,</b> pop rock for the mainstream middle, a kind of instant Eighties retro classic to seduce middle-aged rockers – possibly the last demographic to remain sceptical about her appeal." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called the song a confessional power ballad [...] "with a torrid, Sturm und Drang vocal turn". In his review for The Guardian, Tim Jonze said the song [...] "aims for a 'Hey Jude' style singalong but – owing to its determination to have someone playing kitchen sink in the background – ends up as bloated as Oasis' 'All Around the World'." [...] Dan Aquilante of The New York Post wrote a less-than-favorable review of Born This Way but complimented [...] "You and I" [...] and the [...] "uniquely earthy quality" [...] that Lange brought to the album. Kitty Empire said the song is Gaga's [...] "unlikely heartland moment – a bid, perhaps, to locate herself as an all-American balladeer {{as well as an}} art-disco avatar with tent pegs under her skin", referring to the implants featured in the music video for the song [...] "Born This Way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "When {{it comes}} to having inestimable influence, Blink-182 might well be {{contemporary}} punk's version of the Beatles", wrote Scott Heisel in a 2009 Alternative Press cover story on the band. The same magazine later ranked Blink the fourth of the [...] "30 Most Influential Bands of the Past 30 Years," [...] just behind Radiohead, Fugazi, and Nirvana. The new generation of pop punk and alternative rock fans found the Blink sound [...] "hugely influential," [...] with Montgomery writing, [...] "...without them, there'd be no Fall Out Boy, no Paramore, or no Fueled by Ramen Records." [...] In 2011, The New York Times asserted that [...] "no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182," [...] stating that even as the band receded after its 2005 split, [...] "its sound and style could {{be heard in the}} muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of <b>high-gloss</b> Warped Tour punk bands, like All Time Low and The Maine." [...] Maria Sherman of The Village Voice took that sentiment a step further, writing [...] "It's pretty simple: Blink-182 is the most important band of the '90s, dick jokes and all. Apart from the sound, Blink's ideology has been popularized [...] their presence is everywhere." [...] According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker, the group [...] "emerged as a touchstone, spawning more imitators than any American rock band since Nirvana." [...] Bands such as Panic! at the Disco and All Time Low originated covering Blink-182 songs. [...] "Anyone in our genre would be lying if they said they weren't influenced by Blink-182," [...] said Joel Madden of Good Charlotte. Bands such as You Me at Six and 5 Seconds of Summer have also named the band as influences.|$|E

They are used more often for general-purpose body text, such as book printing, in Europe. They remain popular in the printing of Greek, as the Didot family {{were among the first}} to establish a printing press in newly independent Greece. The period of Didone types' greatest popularity coincided with the rapid spread of printed posters and commercial ephemera and the arrival of bold type.

Jackson installed the piece on January 8, 1840. Adjacent to the dining room is a pantry and storage room that leads to an open passageway to the kitchen. This was built separate from the house to prevent risk of fire to the main house, as well as to exclude the noise, heat and odors of cooking. To the right of the entrance hall, and accessed via a side hall, are two bedrooms; these were occupied by President Jackson and his son, Andrew Jackson, Jr. In the west wing is a spacious library and office used by Jackson and others to manage the plantation.|$|E

The Observers Paul Mardles was more critical, accusing Maxwell of exhibiting a [...] "fondness for cliche". Allison Stewart from The Washington Post called the album [...] "cerebral but impersonal" [...] and felt that it [...] "never quite breaks free of its self-imposed restraints". Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt said Maxwell's [...] "sentiments rarely transcend the boudoir — and listeners lulled by the album's unvaryingly sleek, <b>high-gloss</b> beats may just drift off to dreamland before they get there". In the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim DeRogatis wrote that several songs [...] "never rise above the level of pleasant background music", which he nonetheless found [...] "gorgeously recorded, tastefully arranged and beautifully played".|$|E

The tailskid originally fitted {{had been replaced by}} a Dowty manufactured, fully castoring tail-wheel unit. This tailwheel was to be modified several times on the prototype, including using twin tailwheels each smaller than the single wheel which was later standardised. The engine cowlings had been altered slightly and the angled fin tip had become straight topped – the rudder balance was correspondingly reduced in size. Undercarriage fairings had now been fitted to the legs. Although the propeller was still the fixed-pitch, wooden bladed unit the pitch had been changed in an attempt to increase the top speed. Several different types of propeller unit were to be fitted to the prototype.
