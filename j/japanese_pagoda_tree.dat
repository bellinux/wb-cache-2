40|$|Abstract ― To achieve color {{diversification}} of natural dyeing, color mixture dyeing with Indigo and <b>Japanese</b> <b>pagoda</b> <b>tree</b> {{is applied to}} wool and silk fabrics. After dyeing with <b>Japanese</b> <b>pagoda</b> <b>tree</b> extract solution of 5 ~ 25 %(o. w. f.), the indigo dyeing was carried out up to four times. Alternatively after repeat dyeing with indigo one to seven times, the dyeing with <b>Japanese</b> <b>pagoda</b> <b>tree</b> extract solution was applied in 5 steps(5 ~ 25 %). In color mixture dyeing, the dye uptake of wool fabrics appears {{higher than that of}} silk. The sequence of <b>Japanese</b> <b>pagoda</b> <b>tree</b> extract dyeing after Indigo dyeing was generally higher dye uptake compared with that of Indigo dyeing after <b>Japanese</b> <b>pagoda</b> <b>tree</b> extract dyeing.

40|$|Abstract. Observations of Japanese pagoda trees {{indicate}} that they undergo a full cycle of vegetative and gen-erative development without self-renovation. The {{aim of this study}} was to obtain a successive media protocol propagation of <b>Japanese</b> <b>pagoda</b> <b>tree</b> by in vitro cultures. The effects of growth regulators were studied with reference to primary regeneration, shoot multiplication and rooting. As explants source were used the part of shoot of 90 -year-old tree. Explants were placed on MS (Murashige and Skoog 1962) basal medium with the addition of 6 -benzylaminopurine – BAP (1. 0 – 2. 0 mg·dm- 3), thidiazuron – TDZ (0. 1 – 0. 3 mg·dm- 3) and indole- 3 -acetic acid – IAA (0. 5 – 1. 0 mg·dm- 3). BAP was the growth regulator which significantly increased shoot regeneration on initial explants. TDZ in turn, inhibited the formation of adventitious shoots and caused the explants which had been placed on the medium to die. The multiplication of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>pagoda</b> <b>tree</b> by in vitro cultures should be conducted on MS media with the addition of 0. 5 mg·dm- 3 BAP, and they should be rooted on media with the addition of 0. 3 mg·dm- 3 indole- 3 -butyric acid – IBA. It seems, that devis-ing an efficient method of <b>Japanese</b> <b>pagoda</b> <b>tree</b> micropropagation is realistic...|$|E

40|$|Sophoragrin, a mannose/glucose-specific lectin in Sophora japonica (<b>Japanese</b> <b>pagoda</b> <b>tree)</b> bark, was {{the first}} lectin found to show self-aggregation that is {{dependent}} on the sugar concentration accompanying the interconversion between solubility and insolubility [Ueno, Ogawa, Matsumoto and Seno (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 3146 – 3153]. The interconversion is regulated by the concentrations of Ca 2 + and specific sugars: mannose, glucose or sucrose. The specific glycotopes for sophoragrin were found in the sophoragrin subunit and an endogenous galactose-specific lectin, B-SJA-I (bark S. japonica agglutinin I), and the lectin subunit that binds to the glycotope was identified by photoaffinity glycan probes. Remarkably, the insoluble polymer of sophoragrin is dissociated by interaction with B-SJA-I into various soluble complexes. Based on these results, self-aggregation of sophoragrin was shown to be a unique homopolymerization due to the sugar-specific interaction. An immunostaining study indicated that sophoragrin localizes mainly in vacuoles of parenchymal cells coincidently with B-SJA-I. These results indicate that sophoragrin can sequester endogenous glycoprotein ligands via sugar-specific interactions, thus providing new insights into the occurrence and significance of the intravacuolar interaction shown by a legume lectin...|$|E
