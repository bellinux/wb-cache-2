50|$|The {{mixing of}} colored {{physical}} substances corresponds to subtractive color mixing, hence it corresponds to our intuition about mixing colors. To explain the mechanism, {{let us consider}} mixing red paint with yellow paint. The red paint is red because when the ambient light strikes it, {{the composition of the}} material is such that it absorbs all other colors in the visible spectrum except for red. The red light, not being absorbed, reflects off the paint and is what we see. This same mechanism describes the color of all material objects -- note that light is not a material object -- and so applies to the yellow paint as well. Making recourse to the figure above demonstrating additive color mixing, one sees that yellow light is composed of an (additive) mixture of red and green light. When we mix the two paints, the resulting substance has red paint and yellow paint. The yellow paint absorbs all colors except for red and green. However, the red paint will absorb the green reflected by the yellow paint. The red paint can be said to subtract the green from the yellow paint. The resulting paint reflects only red light and so appears red to our eyes. Note however that this description is theoretical and that the mixing of pigments does not correspond to ideal subtractive color mixing because some light from the subtracted color is still being reflected by one component of the original paint. This results in a darker and <b>desaturated</b> <b>color</b> compared to the color that would be achieved with ideal filters.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{assess the}} safety of transcorneal {{electrical}} stimulation (TES) and explore its efficacy in various subjective and objective parameters of visual function in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). METHODS. Twenty-four patients in this prospective, randomized, partially blinded, good-clinical-practice study underwent TES (5 -ms biphasic pulses; 20 Hz; DTL electrodes) 30 minutes per week for 6 consecutive weeks. The patients {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three groups: sham, 66 %, or 150 % of individual electrical phosphene threshold (EPT). Visual acuity (VA), visual field (VF; kinetic, static), electroretinography (Ganzfeld, multifocal), dark-adaptation (DA), color discrimination, and EPTs were assessed at all visits or four times, according to the study plan. RESULTS. TES using DTL electrodes was tolerated well; all patients finished the study. Two adverse (foreign body sensation), but no serious adverse events were encountered. There was a tendency for most functional parameters to improve (8 / 18) or to remain constant (8 / 18) in the 150 % group. VF area and scotopic b-wave amplitude reached statistical significance (P < 0. 027 and P < 0. 001, respectively). Only <b>desaturated</b> <b>color</b> discrimination and VF mean sensitivity decreased. There was no obvious trend in the 66 % group. CONCLUSIONS. TES was found to be safe in RP patients. Positive trends were discovered, but due to the small sample size of this exploratory study, statistical significance was reached only for VF area and scotopic b-wave amplitude. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer duration are needed to confirm the findings and to define optimal stimulation parameters. (ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT 00804102.)

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine {{possible}} persisting effects to color vision in a group from the Royal Australian Air Force who had exposure to formulations containing neurotoxins during F- 111 fuel tank maintenance, relative to two contemporaneous comparison groups. Methods: Color vision was tested in 512 exposed personnel, 458 technical-trade comparisons, and 330 non-technical comparisons using the Ishihara test plates and the Lanthony D- 15 <b>Desaturated</b> <b>Color</b> disk arrangement test. Participants were excluded if they failed the Ishihara test as this indicates congenital color blindness. From the Lanthony results, the type of color deficient vision (CDV) was diagnosed, and additionally, the Bowman’s color confusion index (CCI) was calculated. Regression models were used to examine whether there was an association between color vision deficiencies and F- 111 fuel tank maintenance, adjusting for possible confounders. Results: The CCI ranged from 1 to 2. 8 (median 1. 2, quartiles 1. 1, 1. 4) in the 2, 600 eyes tested. Forty five percent of all participants had blue-yellow CDV in at least one eye. Deficiencies of this nature are caused by environmental exposures. Logistic regression demonstrated statistically significant differences in CCI category in the exposed group versus technical group (odds ratio 1. 7 : 95 % CI 1. 3 – 2. 0) and a blue-yellow confusion in the exposed group versus technical group (odds ratio 1. 4 : 95 % CI 1. 1 – 1. 7). No differences were observed between the exposed group and the non-technical group. Conclusion: The results indicate reduced color discrimination among the exposed subjects compared to one of two control groups.

Absolutely calibrated HDR radiance maps are tone-mapped with Reinhard et al. ’s tone-mapping algorithm [Reinhard et al., 2002], the iCAM 06 image appearance model [Kuang et al., 2007], and our color appearance model (see Fig. 1).

The results appear similar in many cases but there are some distinct differences.

40|$|In {{interest}} of low cost, low power consumption, and compact size, most digital cameras adopt a design of single sensor array {{coupled with a}} color filter array.

Channel crosstalk can <b>desaturate</b> <b>colors</b> and blur image details, but the problem was seemingly overlooked by existing color demosaicking algorithms. To rectify this deficiency we propose a new joint demosaicking and decrosstalk technique that counters the effects of channel crosstalks by adaptive least-squares inverse filtering. The new technique integrates the operations of deconvolution for crosstalk removal and interpolation for color demosaicking, and it introduces a general framework in which any spatially varying crosstalks and varying spatial-spectral correlations can be modeled and factored into the color reproduction.

40|$|Printing with custom inks is of {{interest}} both for artistic purposes and for printing security documents such as banknotes. However, {{in order to create}} designs with only a few custom inks, a general purpose high-quality gamut reduction technique is needed. Most existing gamut mapping techniques map an input gamut such as the gamut of a CRT display into the gamut of an output device such as a CMYK printer. In the present contribution, we are interested in printing with up to three custom inks, which in the general case define a rather narrow color gamut compared with the gamut of standard CMYK printers. The proposed color gamut reduction techniques should work for any combination of custom inks and have a smooth and predictable behavior. When the black ink is available, the lightness levels present in the original image remain nearly identical. Original colors with hues outside the target gamut are projected onto the gray axis or onto <b>desaturated</b> <b>colors.</b> Original colors with hues inside the target gamut hues are rendered as faithful as possible. When the black ink is not available, we map the gray axis G into a colored curve G' connecting in the 3 D color space the paper white and the darkest available color formed by the superposition of the 3 inks. The mapped gray axis curve G' is given by the Neugebauer equations when enforcing equal amounts of custom inks. After lightness mapping, hue and saturation mappings are carried out. When the target gamut does not incorporate the gray axis, we divide it into two volumes, one on the desaturated side of the mapped gray axis curve G' and the other on the saturated side of the G' curve.
