5|$|The tornado {{intensified}} to EF4 {{strength as}} it entered Van Buren County and tore {{through the south}} edge of Clinton, killing three people in the vicinity. One of these deaths occurred at a boat manufacturing plant in town which was destroyed. The plant was completely leveled to the ground, with its metal beam frame severely mangled. Homes in this area were leveled and swept from their foundations, vehicles were wrapped around trees and rendered nearly unrecognizable, a dentists office was obliterated, and trees were debarked. A church and several businesses were damaged as well. 62 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 30 were severely damaged, and 31 sustained minor damage. The tornado maintained EF4 intensity as it continued into Stone County, slamming into the town of Mountain View. The local hospital sustained heavy roof and wall damage, and several doctors offices were destroyed, along with a paint shop, a body shop, and a car parts store. A car dealership was completely flattened, with vehicles being tossed from the sales lot and across the highway. One vehicle was lofted a considerable distance {{through the air and}} over a building before being dropped into a ravine. Surveyors observed a utility pole in this area that was pulled up and jammed back into the ground with wires still attached. The town's fire station was heavily damaged, and one fatality occurred when a house was swept from its foundation. 38 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 15 sustained major damage, and 15 sustained minor damage in the Mountain View area. The tornado weakened slightly to high-end EF3 strength as it crossed into <b>Izard</b> County and impacted the rural community of Zion, killing two people, destroying 43 homes and mobile homes, severely damaging 14, and lightly damaging 36 more. Hundreds of cattle were killed in this area, and a Jeep was stripped down to its frame and tires and found wrapped around the stump of a large tree that was snapped. An unanchored home in the area was swept clean from its foundation as well, leaving only the slab behind. Maintaining EF3 intensity, the tornado then struck the town of Highland in Sharp County, resulting in severe damage. At least 40 businesses along U.S. Route 412 in Highland were damaged or destroyed, including a strip mall, a restaurant, a church, and a car dealership. The local fire station was destroyed along with much of the equipment inside, and multiple vehicles were overturned along the highway. 40 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 8 sustained major damage, and 19 sustained minor damage in the Highland area. Highland High School and two apartment buildings sustained minor damage as well. To the northeast of Highland, the tornado rapidly weakened and dissipated.|$|E

Several measures of visual attention were taken experimentally in a separate testing session. Significant correlations between measures of attention and duration of facial expressions of pain and distress were found at each age level.

In the present study, facial muscle activity was modified (using biofeedback to enhance and suppress muscle tension) and the resultant changes in reported emotions were investigated. It was hypothesized that enhancing the facial expression associated with a particular emotion would increase the intensity of the reported emotion, while suppressing the expression would decrease reported emotional intensity. Using EMG biofeedback, 30 females were individually trained to increase and decrease corrugator and zygomatic muscle activity before beginning and experimental trials. The Positive condition consisted of three images previously rated as "high intensity happy" and the Negative condition consisted of three images previously rates as "high intensity sad. " The target muscles were the zygomatic muscle in the Positive condition and the corrugator muscle in the Negative condition. There were three instruction trials for each of the six images, for a total of 18 trials per subject. The three types of instruction trials were: (a) a Neutral trial, in which the subject was given no instructions about muscle activity and which established normal muscle activity for that image; (b) an Enhancement trial, in which subjects increased tension of the target muscle; and (c) a Suppression trial, in which subjects decreased tension in the target muscle. Following each imagery period, subjects reported emotions on a modified version of <b>Izard's</b> Differential Emotions Scale (DES). The happy (Positive) images resulted in increased zygomatic activity and high ratings for the adjective "happy" on the DES, and the sad (Negative) images yielded increased corrugator activity and high ratings for the adjective "sad. "As predicted, suppression of the zygomatic activity during the Positive images resulted in a decrease in ratings for the adjective "happy," and suppression of the corrugator activity during Negative images resulted in a decrease in ratings for the adjective "sad," relative to the neutral trials. The results of this study indicated that changes in muscle activity associated with facial expression lead to changes in the intensity of the reported emotions, lending significant support to <b>Izard's</b> facial feedback hypothesis...|$|R

Wright and Mischel's (1987) conditional approach to dispositional constructs suggests that aggressive children's hostility would be most evident during object-conflict, and withdrawn children's depressive responses most evident during group entry. Four- and 5 -year-old boys and girls (N = 128) were assigned to aggressive, withdrawn, or control groups according to teachers' behaviour ratings. Interviews about children's emotional experiences in hypothetical object-conflict and group-entry situations failed to yield predicted group and situation differences. However, during semi-structured object-conflict and group-entry situations, aggressive children displayed more intense anger and more frequent anger blends, while withdrawn children were observed to show more intense sadness and more frequent fear-sadness blends. Displays of negative affect were related in theoretically meaningful ways to patterns of children's social behaviour.
