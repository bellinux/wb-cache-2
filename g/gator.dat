5|$|The renovations {{were much}} more {{extensive}} than had initially been proposed, and required more time to be completed. Instead of beginning in early 1995, work would have to begin in 1994, leaving {{the site of the}} 1994 <b>Gator</b> Bowl (played on Dec. 30) in doubt. By the end of January 1994, as the <b>Gator</b> Bowl was being demolished, that doubt was also demolished when a deal was struck to host the <b>Gator</b> Bowl at the University of Florida, in that school's Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. The game's title sponsor, Outback Steakhouse, and its television sponsor, TBS, would remain constant, and both were in their final year of contracts with the <b>Gator</b> Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2006 ACC Championship Game, the <b>Gator</b> Bowl Association, which {{administered}} the ACC Championship Game {{during its first}} two years of existence, was awarded a one-year extension to its two-year contract to host the game. The 2006 game suffered from poor attendance, resulting in over $1million in losses for the <b>Gator</b> Bowl Association. In the off-season, the <b>Gator</b> Bowl Association declared that if sales did not improve for the 2007 ACC Championship game, the game's Jacksonville future would be in jeopardy. Attendance for the 2006 game was low due to high travel costs stemming from Jacksonville's distance from the participating schools, and the 2007 participants—Boston College and Virginia Tech—faced the same problem.|$|E

50|$|The modern post-war {{era of the}} Florida <b>Gators</b> {{baseball}} {{program began}} with head coach Dave Fuller assuming control in 1948.

Ultimately, he became the longest-serving <b>Gators</b> head coach in any sport, and won more games than any other <b>Gators</b> coach, after leading the <b>Gators</b> baseball team for twenty-eight seasons. Fuller brought stability and consistency to the program, and his <b>Gators</b> teams won SEC championships in 1952, 1956 and 1962, and made appearances in the NCAA tournament in 1958, 1960 and 1962.

Though the <b>Gator</b> Bowl offered to pay $115 million for the right to become a Bowl Alliance game, the Orange Bowl was selected in place of the <b>Gator</b> Bowl. This event had repercussions at the end of the season, when the bowl was passed over by high-ranked teams that elected to accept bids to bowls in the new Bowl Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{selection}} to the <b>Gator</b> Bowl was a controversial one.

Instead of attending the <b>Gator</b> Bowl, Syracuse earned a bid to the 2002 Insight Bowl, {{considered to be a}} less prestigious game due to its lesser payout and shorter history. Syracuse fans, coaches, and players were offended that Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the <b>Gator</b> Bowl despite Syracuse's better record due to Tech's reputation for bringing large numbers of fans to bowl games.
