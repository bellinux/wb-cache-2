5|$|On Friday, May 14, the Syrian 1st Infantry Brigade, {{commanded}} by Colonel Abdullah Wahab el-Hakim, was in Southern Lebanon, positioned to attack Malkia. That day Hakim {{was ordered to}} return to Syria, move south across the Golan and enter Palestine south of the Sea of Galilee through Samakh (Tzemah).

5|$|Paetus {{nonetheless}} appeared {{confident of}} victory, {{and followed the}} Parthian declaration of war and capture of Tigranocerta with his own invasion of Armenia, while Corbulo remained at Syria, further strengthening the fortifications in the Euphrates frontier. Paetus <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> legions with him, IV Scythica and XII Fulminata, and advanced towards Tigranocerta. A few minor forts were taken, but a lack of supplies forced him to withdraw westwards for the winter.|$|E
5|$|After his release, Brouthers {{played for}} {{a minor league}} team in Rochester, New York, and on one {{occasion}} in , he hit a game-winning home run in an exhibition game versus the Buffalo Bisons, off future Hall of Fame pitcher Pud Galvin. He hit well enough in the minors to get another shot with the Trojans, which lasted just three games when he <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> hits in 12 at bats, and he was released again.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{rumors that}} the team would be sold and/or relocated, the Mariners—who had <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> winning seasons (1991 and 1993) since {{beginning}} play in 1977—mounted a late-season comeback in 1995 to clinch their first postseason appearance in franchise history. They then mounted a series of comebacks in the ALDS, first overcoming a 2-game series deficit to force a deciding Game 5, then tying Game 5 in the 8th inning to force extra innings, and finally a one-run 11th inning deficit that was overcome by the Double.|$|E

5|$|Cannon had {{a modest}} 1968 {{season in which}} he caught six {{touchdown}} passes—including one of 48 yards {{in the second quarter}} of the famous Heidi Game—but knew he would not be in Oakland much longer. Head coach John Madden had relegated him to running decoy routes by 1969 and he <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> touchdowns. Nevertheless, he was invited as a replacement to play in his second All-Star game. Cannon was released by the Raiders during the 1970 preseason.|$|E
5|$|Empress was {{the largest}} chili parlor chain in Cincinnati until 1949, when a former Empress {{employee}} and Greek immigrant, Nicholas Lambrinides, started Skyline Chili. In 1965, four brothers named Daoud, immigrants from Jordan, bought a restaurant called Hamburger Heaven from a former Empress employee, noticed the Cincinnati chili was outselling the hamburgers on their menu, and changed the restaurant's name to Gold Star Chili. As of 2015 Skyline (over 130 locations) and Gold Star (89 locations) were the largest Cincinnati chili parlor chains, while Empress <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> remaining locations, down from over a dozen during the chain's most successful period.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} {{and without a}} counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather like that of an arthropod but its body, with {{what seemed to be}} fins along its back and belly, looked rather like of a chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, some very good, and reconstructed it as a cephalopod, and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later cephalopods it <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> arms, and its eyes seem mounted on stalks. But it had a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods.|$|E

5|$|Nevin <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> hits in {{his last}} 32 at-bats with the Rangers, though {{both of them were}} home runs. The Chicago Cubs sought a {{slugging}} first baseman to replace the injured Derrek Lee, and the Rangers traded Nevin to Chicago on May 31, 2006. The Rangers received second baseman and outfielder Jerry Hairston, Jr. in return. The Rangers also agreed to pay the difference in the two players' salaries. On August 31, the deadline for trades of players who had cleared waivers, the Cubs traded Nevin to the Twins for cash and a player to be named later. To make room for Nevin, Twins' outfielder Shannon Stewart was placed on the 60-day disabled list.|$|E

5|$|The 1972–73 saw {{upheaval}} at the Bruins. Coach Sinden {{became the}} general manager. Bruins players Gerry Cheevers, Derek Sanderson and Johnny McKenzie joined the upstart World Hockey Association. Coach Tom Johnson was fired fifty-two games into the season, replaced by Bep Guidolin, {{who had once}} coached Orr. The Adams family, which had owned the team {{since its founding in}} the 1920s, sold it to Storer Broadcasting. The Bruins' season came to a premature end in a first-round loss in the 1973 playoffs, losing Esposito to injury in that first round. Orr amassed 101 points during the regular season (he only played 63 games to due injury) but <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> points in the playoff loss.|$|E

5|$|The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, {{the first}} bridge {{to connect the}} two towns, had become {{functionally}} obsolete. Its narrow road <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> lanes with no shoulders. Because of its location near a sharp bend in the Mississippi River, the bridge had become a hazard to river traffic; barges and towboats frequently collided with it. In 1994, a study concluded that a new bridge was needed and the old one should be torn down. Construction was begun in 2001 and the new bridge opened in 2010. In 2011, the process of removing the old bridge began.|$|E
5|$|The neck of Tyrannosaurus rex {{formed a}} natural S-shaped curve {{like that of}} other theropods, but was short and muscular to support the massive head. The forelimbs <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> clawed fingers, along with an {{additional}} small metacarpal representing the remnant of a third digit. In contrast the hind limbs were among the longest in proportion to body size of any theropod. The tail was heavy and long, sometimes containing over forty vertebrae, in order to balance the massive head and torso. To compensate for the immense bulk of the animal, many bones throughout the skeleton were hollow, reducing its weight without significant loss of strength.|$|E

5|$|The {{transfer}} of 750 noncommissioned officers (NCOs) from the 1st Cavalry Division to the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions, a move aimed at strengthening the infantry divisions combat missions in Korea, had weakened the 1st Cavalry Division. It {{had been stripped}} of practically every NCO except the first sergeants of companies and batteries in the division. Even though it had received 1,450 replacements before it left Japan, 100 {{of them from the}} Eighth Army stockade, the division was understrength when it landed in Korea and, like the preceding divisions, it <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> battalions in its three regiments, two firing batteries in the artillery battalions, and one tank company with M24 light tanks.|$|E
5|$|With {{their loss}} to Auburn, Alabama {{completed}} the first winless season in Alabama football history, {{and since then}} they have <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> other winless seasons in 1895 and 1955. The losses of 1893 were attributed to the small stature of the Crimson players {{and not to the}} coaching and training of the team. As such, Abbott returned as head coach for the 1894 season and led Alabama to a winning season that included their first all-time win over Auburn.|$|E
5|$|About 09:00, Marić and Marković went to Zagreb to see Petrović, {{who ordered}} them to {{immediately}} return to their division and continue to resist the Germans. On the return journey, they encountered most of their division withdrawing towards Križevci, {{with the exception of}} the cavalry units still fighting north of Koprivnica. Marić halted the retreat, and established positions around Mali Grabičani, making his headquarters at Križevci. Georgijević dismissed his Croat troops and retreated with the rest of his force towards Zagreb, and the commander of the 104th Infantry Regiment discharged all his troops. In the afternoon, the hard-pressed cavalry units began to withdraw. About 14:00, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment withdrew to Novigrad Podravski via Bregi, but receiving a hostile reception from the Croat population, continued towards Bjelovar. About 18:00, the 1st Squadron of the 81st Cavalry Regiment withdrew via Koprivnica, reaching the rest of the division about 23:00. About 19:00, the Germans occupied Koprivnica without resistance. By evening, Marić's division numbered about 2,000 troops, the 36th Infantry Regiment and 81st Cavalry Regiment were widely dispersed, the 53rd Infantry Regiment had effectively ceased to exist, and his artillery regiment <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> horses to pull guns.|$|E
