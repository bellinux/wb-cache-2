30|$|When {{the sleeve}} is being driven, the sleeve {{transfers}} the periodic vibrating load to the soils around the sleeve (Ekanayake et al. 2013). The strain in the soils around the sleeve continues to increase, and the cohesion and shear strength gradually decrease. Compared to the infinite soils outside the sleeve, the soil plug inside the sleeve undergoes stronger cyclic shear force {{transferred from the}} sleeve wall. Therefore, the fluctuation of the internal shaft resistance is more obvious {{than that of the}} <b>external</b> <b>shaft</b> resistance. As the result, the soil strength and cohesion decrease under cyclic shearing action. Because of the decrease in the soil strength and cohesion, the soil plug becomes partially-plugged, and the penetration resistance of sleeve is much smaller than those by other installation methods.|$|E
30|$|The {{phenomenon}} is well-known, but {{little is known}} about the mechanism of soil plug formation inside pipe piles, especially for the sleeve driven by vibratory hammers. The formation of a soil plug depends upon a number of factors, e.g. installation method, pile diameter, penetration depth, soil density, whereas the investigation on the influencing factors are still not complete. A lot of researches were conducted to evaluate the soil plugging effect during pipe pile driving. Based on the principle of static equilibrium, Randolph et al. (1991) developed the concept of active height of soil plug and established the one-dimensional static equilibrium equation. Holeyman et al. (2013) presented another analytic expression of the shaft resistance of vibratory driven pile taking account of the soil damping. The limitation of the 1  g model test (O’Neill and Raines 1991) is the same with that of the soil samples under low stress, therefore, the ideal stress condition required by the investigation of the soil plug can be achieved by the use of the geotechnical centrifuge. Nicola and Randolph (1997) analyzed the behavior of soil plug during pipe pile driving by model tests. It was found that the height of soil plug decreased with the increase in the relative compactness of the sands during pile jacking, but increased with the relative compactness of the sands during impact pile driving. Experimental studies of Xing et al. (2012) indicated that the height of soil plug inside impact-driven pipe pile increased as the pipe wall thickness decreased. The distribution of the shaft resistance was nonlinear along the pile length, and depended on the impact force and soil conditions. Tan and Lin (2013) found that the soil plug developed from partially plugged mode in the upper soft cohesive soils into fully plugged mode in the underlying medium dense to dense cohesionless soil layers, and the <b>external</b> <b>shaft</b> resistance was about two-thirds of shaft resistance through a series of steel pipe pile static penetration tests. Liyanapathirana et al. (2000) analyzed the behavior of the soil plug during impact pile driving with Eulerian finite element method, and their researches showed that the degree of soil plug inside the sleeve developed from unplugged mode to partially plugged mode. Thongmunee et al. (2011) analyzed the mechanism and influence of soil plugging bearing capacity performance by discrete element method, and their simulated results were consistent with the experimentation results.|$|E
40|$|Different {{practices}} in paleoanthropology and legal medicine raise {{questions concerning the}} robustness of body mass (BM) prediction. Integrating personal identification from body mass estimation with skeleton is not a classic approach in legal medicine. The originality of our study {{is the use of}} an elderly sample in order to push prediction methods to their limits and to discuss about implications in paleoanthropology and legal medicine. The aim is to observe the accuracy of BM prediction in relation to the body mass index (BMI, index of classification) using five femoral head (FH) methods and one shaft (FSH) method. The sample is composed of 41 dry femurs obtained from dissection where age (c. 82 years) and gender are known, and weight (c. 59. 5  kg) and height are measured upon admission to the body leg service. We show that the estimation of the mean BM of the elderly sample is not significantly different to the real mean BM when the appropriate formula is used for the femoral head diameter. In fact, the best prediction is obtained with the McHenry formula (1992), which was based on a sample with an equivalent average mass to that of our sample. In comparison, <b>external</b> <b>shaft</b> diameters, which are known to be more influenced by mechanical stimuli than femoral head diameters, yield less satisfactory results with the McHenry formula (1992) for shaft diameters. Based on all the methods used and the distinctive selected sample, overestimation (always observed with the different femoral head methods) can be restricted to 1. 1 %. The observed overestimation with the shaft method can be restricted to 7 %. However, the estimation of individual BM is much less reliable. The BMI has a strong impact on the accuracy of individual BM prediction, and is unquestionably more reliable for individuals with normal BMI (9. 6 % vs 16. 7 % for the best prediction error). In this case, the FH method is also the better predictive method but not if we integrate the total sample (i. e. the FSH method is better with more varied BMI). Finally, the estimation of the mean BM of a sample can be used with more confidence compared to the estimation of individual BM. The former is very useful in an evolutionary perspective whereas the latter should be used in keeping with the information gathered on the studied specimen in order to reduce prediction errors. Finally, the BM estimation can be a parameter to consider for personal identification. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
50|$|The twenty {{locomotives}} {{incorporated a}} number of modifications to the original design. The boiler was raised by 2 in to 8 ft. The smokebox was extended by 4 in and the chimney moved forward to allow room for the Caprotti valve box and associated steam and exhaust pipes. The locomotives fitted with Timken bearings had large split cannon-type axleboxes between the frames. To allow room for the firebox between the middle and rear axleboxes the spacing between the driving and rear coupled wheels was increased from 8 ft to 8 ft. This gave a longer wheelbase of 27 ft as against the 27 ft of the standard locomotives. The locomotives with plain bearings also had the longer wheelbase. All locomotives had a modified cab and a lowered running plate, necessitating the use of splashers over the wheels. In service, the Caprotti Black Fives were slow in acceleration, but were powerful at high speeds, and coasted freely. The slow acceleration was caused by inefficiencies in the drive and valve events.

During the monsoon period {{there is a}} lot of excess water, and the the plan is to utilize this water in an extra power plant during the monsoon. The same tunnel as for Khimti I is to be used for the whole volume flow. A new external pressure shaft is planned for the water down to the new power house of Kirne. The hydrology is studied in this thesis, and a flow of 11 m 3 /s can be utilized in Kirne through 80 % of the monsoon, through the rest of the period, the flow is lower, on the average. The flow limit is found based on the head loss and surges in the water way. The sediment basin will have to be doubled in size to handle the doubling of the volume flow. The placing of the basin can be on the opposite riverbank of the existing settling basin. Another possibility is to build the planned power plant Khimti II upstream Khimti I, and handle the sediments there. Excavation of a volume of 170 m 3 is necessary at the top of the surge shaft, to give room for the upsurges. The down-surges are reduced by prolonging the opening time of the turbines and valves. The new pressure shaft will be a 1800 meter long <b>external</b> <b>shaft</b> of steel, with an optimal pipe diameter of 2, 16 meter. The shaft will be external due to difficult conditions in the rock, and experiences of the building of Khimti I. It will be shown that the best solution for Kirne is to install one Pelton turbine wiht five nozzles, or two Pelton turbines with three nozzles each, in the power plant. Two Pelton turbines will give a better production than one, but at the same time the costs of the power house, and the turbines will increase. The size of the turbine will be 64 MW for one turbine, and 32 MW each, if two smaller turbines are chosen. The production will be about 240 GWh depending of the flow through the year, which can be up to 30 % less than the average. The income of Kirne will be about 13 - 14 MUSD, depending on the final choices. In order to finish this thesis, a lot of assumptions are made. The power evacuation and agreements with locals and national governments are not investigated. This is done to narrow the scope of the thesis, but at these points, the largest risks of the project are placed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Negative skin {{friction}} (NSF) {{is a common}} problem {{to be considered in}} designing pile foundations located in consolidating ground. Failures of foundations due to either NSF induced compressive axial force (Dragload) or excessive pile foundation settlement (Downdrag) has been widely reported in the literature. The results of eleven centrifuge model tests, numerical simulations and simple analytical solutions were reported which were undertaken to achieve four objectives: first, to investigate response of piles subjected to NSF with different pile tip location with respect to end-bearing stratum layer, and secondly, to study the effect of pile shapes on development of negative shear stress on pile shafts, and thirdly, to investigate and compare behaviour of floating piles subjected to NSF with shielding by either a sacrificing ring or a group of sacrificing piles, and finally, to look at the effect of axial live loads on load transfer mechanism along piles experiencing locked-in NSF [...] In this study, larger downdrag is developed on floating piles and neutral plane (NP) is located lower towards pile tip with stiffer end-bearing layer. Neutral plane locations on a single pile can be estimated by a simple analytical approach considering displacement compatibility, cavity expansion at the pile tip and vertical force equilibrium of piles. It is found that depth of NP increases with increasing end bearing stiffness of pile, interface friction angle and surcharge. Axial load effects on load transfer mechanism of piles with different pile tip location with locked-in dragload are investigated. For single floating piles with Y= 0. 25 D and Y= 1. 00 D, the amount of measured axial load requires to completely overcome the dragload was about 1. 75 Pmax and 1. 44 Pmax, respectively. Unlike single pile, amount of axial load required to eliminate NSF for pile group can be as large as more than 4 times Pmax for the floating pile group. To study the effect of openness of pile sections on load transfer mechanism of NSF, centrifuge and three-dimensional numerical modeling of conventional pile shapes, circular, rectangular with aspect ratio = 2 and H-pile were carried out. Vertical shear mechanism predicts that <b>external</b> <b>shaft</b> friction induced on piles with close sections is insignificant. Only a little reduction in σv̕ result. On the other hand, large reduction in vertical effective stress is experienced by the soil element located at the pan area of an H-pile (open section). Fairly good agreement with centrifuge tests results is made with the analytical prediction by vertical shear mchanism and numerical simulations. The shielding effects on dragload and downdrag are represented quantitatively using two dimensionless terms, Pr and Wr, respectively. The measured Pr of the center pile surrounded by a sacrificing ring with 0. 50 L, 0. 75 L and 1. 00 L length was 42 %, 54 % and 67 %. Correspondingly, measured Wr of the center pile surrounded by a sacrificing ring with 0. 50 L, 0. 75 L and 1. 00 L length was 15 %, 25 % and 50 %. This shows that shielding effect on dragload increase gently with an increase in sacrificing ring length, while the shielding effect on downdrag increase exponentially with an increase in length of the ring. For center pile shielded by means of a group of 3 x 3 sacrificing piles in full length measured Pr and Wr are 47 % and 43 %, respectively. Moreover, the sacrificing ring only occupy one-forth of the material weight of a group of sacrificing piles for the same spacing and provide better shielding effect. Numerical simulations of the centrifuge model tests on center piles revealed that the observed shielding effects on a center pile are attributed to the stress transfer from consolidating soft soil to sacrificing structures. As consolidation proceeds, the relatively stiff sacrificing structure "hang-up" soils, leading to a significant reduction in the σv̕, σh̕ in the soil and thus NSF on center piles. Sacrificing ring provides a better distribution of material to give a larger surface area for hanging up soils. Soils neighboring the center pile are enclosed or isolated by the relatively stiff ring so that stress transfer from far field to the enclosed soils is negligible. This leads to the enhanced reduction in NSF along lengths of the sacrificing ring...|$|E
