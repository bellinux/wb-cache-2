5|$|A {{number of}} {{airlines}} <b>interested</b> in a takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America {{to correspond with}} an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale. Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most <b>interested</b> companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group. In December 2015, Alaska was <b>interested</b> at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, % higher than the day's closure at $38.9. On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion. Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, {{they would have been}} contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.|$|E

5|$|Born in Tokyo, Japan, on July 5, 1968, Ito became <b>interested</b> {{in music}} {{at the age of}} four. He began to learn to play the piano, {{becoming}} <b>interested</b> in it after hearing piano music coming from a classroom he passed by daily with his mother. He was also <b>interested</b> in Electone music, but was discouraged from learning it by a piano teacher. By the time he began composing at the age of ten, he had learned to play alto saxophone, clarinet, and piano, and was <b>interested</b> in becoming a singer/songwriter. When he was close to graduating from college, he decided to pursue a career in composing music; when he asked a professor for advice, the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer, given the recent success in Japan of Dragon Quest III. During March 1990, after applying to several video game companies including HAL Laboratory, Ito began working at Square.|$|E

5000|$|Effective and nominal {{rates of}} <b>interest</b> {{are not the}} same because <b>interest</b> paid in earlier {{measurement}} periods [...] "earns" [...] <b>interest</b> in later measurement periods; this is called compound <b>interest.</b> That is, nominal rates of <b>interest</b> credit <b>interest</b> to an investor, (alternatively charge, or debit, <b>interest</b> to a debtor), more frequently than do effective rates. The result is more frequent compounding of <b>interest</b> income to the investor, (or <b>interest</b> expense to the debtor), when nominal rates are used.|$|R
25|$|The {{effective}} <b>interest</b> rate, effective annual <b>interest</b> rate, annual equivalent rate (AER) {{or simply}} effective rate is the <b>interest</b> rate on a loan or financial product restated from the nominal <b>interest</b> rate as an <b>interest</b> rate with annual compound <b>interest</b> payable in arrears.|$|R

25|$|Compound <b>interest</b> may be {{contrasted with}} simple <b>interest,</b> where <b>interest</b> is not {{added to the}} principal, {{so there is no}} compounding. The simple annual <b>interest</b> rate is the <b>interest</b> amount per period, multiplied by the number of periods per year. The simple annual <b>interest</b> rate is also known as the nominal <b>interest</b> rate (not to be {{confused}} with the <b>interest</b> rate not adjusted for inflation, which goes by the same name).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{stationary}} characteristics of computed real <b>interest</b> rates with nominal <b>interest</b> rates and inflation for 22 OECD countries. Using quarterly data over the 2000 – 2010 period, LM unit root test is employed which endogenously determines {{up to two}} structural breaks in level and trend. The empirical findings suggest a combination of stationary and nonstationary results for real <b>interest</b> rates, nominal <b>interest</b> rates and inflation. Besides, the internal stationarity or nonstationary interactions of real and nominal <b>interest</b> rates are investigated by inflation. The results indicate that stationary nominal <b>interest</b> rates and inflation cause stationary real <b>interest</b> rates. At the same time nonstationary nominal <b>interest</b> rates and inflation could cause a stationary or nonstationary real <b>interest</b> rate with respect to cointegration. Stationary nominal <b>interest</b> rate and nonstationary real <b>interest</b> rate cause to nonstationary real <b>interest</b> rate while nonstationary nominal <b>interest</b> rate and stationary inflation could cause stationary or nonstationary real <b>interest</b> rate. </p...|$|R

25|$|Singer's Practical Ethics (1979) {{analyzes}} {{why and how}} living beings' <b>interests</b> {{should be}} weighed. His principle of equal consideration of <b>interests</b> does not dictate equal treatment of all those with <b>interests,</b> since different <b>interests</b> warrant different treatment. All have an <b>interest</b> in avoiding pain, for instance, but relatively few have an <b>interest</b> in cultivating their abilities. Not only does his principle justify different treatment for different <b>interests,</b> but it allows different treatment for the same <b>interest</b> when diminishing marginal utility is a factor.
