5|$|Washington's second inauguration {{took place}} in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the first at this site) on March 4, 1793. The presidential oath of office was {{administered}} by Supreme Court associate justice William Cushing. Washington's inaugural address was just 135 words, the shortest to date. This inauguration was brief and simple, a sharp contrast to the extravaganza four years earlier, which, in the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many,</b> had all the trappings of a monarchical coronation.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown on Soviet {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was {{in black and white}} as the Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again in black and white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} the inclusion of a short explanatory note {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent mess in the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E

5|$|In November 1558, Henry VIII's elder daughter, Mary I of England, was {{succeeded by}} her only {{surviving}} sibling, Elizabeth I. Under the Third Succession Act, passed in 1543 by the Parliament of England, Elizabeth was recognised as her sister's heir, and Henry VIII's {{last will and testament}} had excluded the Stuarts from succeeding to the English throne. Yet, in the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Catholics, Elizabeth was illegitimate, and Mary Stuart, as the senior descendant of Henry VIII's elder sister, was the rightful queen of England. Henry II of France proclaimed {{his eldest son}} and daughter-in-law king and queen of England, and in France the royal arms of England were quartered with those of Francis and Mary. Mary's claim to the English throne was a perennial sticking point between her and Elizabeth I.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, Yiu Man-tin (姚文田), {{founder and}} chief editor of Morning Bell Press (晨鐘書局) and a Hong Kong resident, {{was arrested in}} Shenzhen {{after he had been}} tricked there. He was known to have been {{preparing}} to publish book by a Chinese writer residing in the US about Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping, entitled Godfather of China, Xi Jinping (中國教父習近平). Yiu was arrested by police in Shenzhen on charges of falsely labelling and smuggling industrial chemicals worth $220,000 in 2010 and was sentenced to prison for 10 years allegedly for smuggling, even though the real reason for the trumped up charges, in the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many,</b> was China's increasing restrictions on political expression under Xi. Two Hong Kong magazine publishers, Wong Kin-man and Wo Chung-hau, were arrested and tried in November 2015 for running an illegal business in China after sending copies of a political magazine to people on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} seizure of power, Gelimer's {{domestic}} position began to deteriorate, as he persecuted his political enemies among the Vandal nobility, confiscating their property and executing many of them. These actions undermined his already doubtful legitimacy in the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many,</b> {{and contributed to}} the outbreak of two revolts in remote provinces of the Vandal kingdom: in Sardinia, where the local governor, Godas, declared himself an independent ruler, and shortly after in Tripolitania, where the native population, led by a certain Pudentius, rebelled against Vandal rule. Although Procopius' narrative makes both uprisings seem coincidental, Ian Hughes points out the fact that both rebellions broke out shortly before the commencement of the Roman expedition against the Vandals, and that both Godas and Pudentius immediately asked for assistance from Justinian, as evidence of an active diplomatic involvement by the Emperor in their preparation.|$|E

25|$|Christianity {{was linked}} even {{more with the}} {{patriotic}} cause when some Christians refused to participate in worship of the Japanese Emperor, which was required by law in the 1930s. Although this refusal was motivated by theological rather than political convictions, the consequent imprisonment of many Christians strongly identified their faith, in the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Koreans, with the cause of Korean nationalism and resistance to the Japanese occupation. Catholics and Methodists complied with demands to attend Shinto ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|Each {{compound}} eye {{is made up}} of up to {{ten thousand}} side-by-side ommatidia. Each eye consists of two flattened hemispheres separated by six parallel rows of specialised ommatidia, collectively called the midband. This divides the eye into three regions. This configuration enables mantis shrimp to see objects with three parts of the same eye. In other words, each eye possesses trinocular vision and therefore depth perception. The upper and lower hemispheres are used primarily for recognition of form and motion, like the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> other crustaceans.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia posed a threat in the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Australians, {{although}} to {{a small group of}} socialists, it was an inspiration. The Communist Party of Australia was formed in 1920 and, though remaining electorally insignificant, it obtained some influence in the trade union movement and was banned during World War II for its support for the Hitler-Stalin Pact and the Menzies Government unsuccessfully tried to ban it again during the Korean War. Despite splits, the party remained active until its dissolution {{at the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tapetum lucidum}} [...] (Latin: [...] "bright tapestry; coverlet", plural tapeta lucida) is {{a layer of}} tissue in the <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> vertebrates. Lying {{immediately}} behind the retina, it reflects visible light back through the retina, increasing the light available to the photoreceptors, though blurring the initial image of the light on focus. The tapetum lucidum contributes to the superior night vision <b>of</b> some animals. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> these animals are nocturnal, especially carnivores, while others are deep sea animals.|$|R

25|$|The {{idea of a}} supercard {{featuring}} the two top promotions of the Monday Night Wars {{was considered to be}} a dream match scenario in the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> fans, as it would allow the fans to see which promotion would be superior in storyline. The angle began when Mr. McMahon's son, Shane McMahon, announced as part of the storyline on WWF's Raw Is War and the final episode of WCW's Nitro (which merged into a simulcast) that he had bought WCW from under his father's nose. This led to several run-in appearances of WCW wrestlers during Raw Is War and SmackDown! over the months after WrestleMania X-Seven.|$|E

Nine days before he was due to take office, Gemayel was assassinated along with twenty-five others in an explosion at the Kataeb party headquarters in Beirut's Christian neighborhood of Achrafieh on September 14, 1982.|$|E
25|$|Many Catholics and nationalists {{believed}} that the IRA {{had been unable to}} defend them during the August 1969 riots. However, it is argued that the IRA's defence of Short Strand redeemed it in the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Catholics and nationalists. Prior to the gun battle, the IRA had been waiting for an opportunity to portray themselves as defenders of the Catholic community, which was only made possible by the over-stretching of British Army forces dealing with rioting throughout Belfast and thus unable to provide protection to the Short Strand. Among republicans, the battle is seen as a key event in the growth of the Provisional IRA.|$|E

25|$|A {{challenge}} for any diving bird {{is the change}} in refraction between air and water. The <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> birds have two foveae (the fovea is {{the area of the}} retina the greatest density of light receptors), and a kingfisher is able to switch from the main central fovea to the auxiliary fovea when it enters water; a retinal streak of high receptor density which connects the two foveae allows the image to swing temporally as the bird drops onto the prey. The egg-shaped lens of the eye points towards the auxiliary fovea, enabling the bird to maintain visual acuity underwater. Because of the positions of the foveae, the kingfisher has monocular vision in air, and binocular vision in water. The underwater vision is not as a sharp as in air, but the ability to judge the distance of moving prey {{is more important than the}} sharpness of the image.|$|E
25|$|During this period, {{the city}} {{continued}} to grow, and {{at an even}} faster pace. By 1920, the population had reached 19,441, tripling in twenty years. The completion of the water tunnel under the mountains to newly completed Gibraltar Reservoir on the Santa Ynez River relieved the water shortages for a time. Also during the teens, a movement for city beautification commenced, led by Bernhard Hoffmann and later by Pearl Chase; their idea was to unify the city's architecture around a Spanish Colonial style, harmonious with the Mission and surviving pueblos. Many of the buildings from the late 19th century were, to their eyes and the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> citizens, ugly, dilapidated, and no different from those in dozens of other run-down western towns. The Lobero Theatre, built {{on the site of}} the original Lobero Opera House in 1924, was an example of the architectural style they promoted, as was the first part of the Santa Barbara Natural History Museum.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, the New Culture Movement fostered an {{intellectual}} atmosphere that promoted Science and Democracy.

The 1923 Anti-Christian Movement attacked missionaries and their followers {{on the grounds that}} no religion was scientific and that the Christian church in China was a tool of the foreigners. Such Chinese Protestants as the liberals David Z. T. Yui, head of the Chinese National YMCA, and Y. T. Wu (Wu Yaozong), Wu Leichuan, T. C. Chao, and the theologically more conservative Chen Chonggui responded by developing social programs and theologies that devoted themselves to strengthening the Chinese nation. Y. C. James Yen, a graduate of Yale University, led a program of Village reform.|$|E
50|$|Due to the Federal Council's unique {{nature as}} a {{voluntary}} grand coalition of political opponents, its operation is subject to numerous constitutional conventions.

In effect, they are expected to publicly support all decisions of the Council, even against their own personal opinion or that of their political party.
