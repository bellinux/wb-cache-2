40|$|Abstract- The {{acoustic}} <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> provides {{extremely valuable}} information for tissue characterization in general, and {{is needed for}} planning of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) therapy in particular. The <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> in tissue is sensitive to changes in temperature and to damage resulting from heating. To date, parametric <b>images</b> of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> from backscattered ultrasound have poor spatial resolution, and are thus inadequate for monitoring and assessment of HIFU. A novel method for detecting changes in attenuation using backscattered ultrasound was developed that could potentially be used for both monitoring and assessment of HIFU therapy. This approach compares the signal energy in an untreated region of sample located behind a region treated with HIFU. The technique was tested by using HIFU to treat a liver sample placed {{on top of a}} well-characterized tissue-mimicking phantom. The signal energy in the phantom was monitored using a clinical ultrasound scanner before, during, and after HIFU exposure of the liver. Results strongly depended on the presence of increased brightness in the sample. For cases without sample brightening, detected signal energy trended {{in a manner similar to}} the temperature. Also, a decrease in signal energy in the phantom after return to baseline temperature compared to initial conditions was detected in all cases, suggesting that the technique was sensitive to permanent changes induced by HIFU in the liver sample.

A {{possible}} {{mechanism to}} explain the correlation between submarine topography and the direct sunlight specially reflected from the sea surface with variable roughness caused by the bottom-current effect was suggested fifteen years ago by Henning et al. in International Journal of Remote Sensing, 9, 45 - 67, after comparing radar satellite image and Skylab satellite photograph of the North American east coast (Nantucket Shoals) with submarine relief features. A case study is {{carried out in the}} famous sand waves field located at the Taiwan banks of Taiwan Strait in August 1998. The TM images, either visible bands (TM 1, TM 2, TN 3) or near infrared bands (TM 4, TM 5, TN 17), shows submarine relief features for sand waves, with wavelength of 300 to 2000 meters, riding on the lager scale sand ridges and channel system. Sea truth data including 660 nm beam <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> profiles were conducted in the same period. We compare signals of TM <b>images,</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> profiles, and sounding maps of the Taiwan Bands. The subsurface upwelling signals with contributions of the water column and the bottom, either estimated by single or quasi-single-scattering theory or revealed by the TM images after removing the contribution of direct sunlight reflected signals from sea surface, were too week to distinguish the ridges and troughs of bedforms especially for red and near infrared bands. However, the direct sunlight specially reflected signals from the sea surface, approximately at same level in water-leaving reflectance not only for visible bands (TM 1, TM 2, TM 3) but also for near infrared bands (TM 4, TM 5, TN 17), was the major submarine bottom topography signals especially for those pixels towards the direction of the sun azimuth. Following a physical description for the lee waves appeared on free surface when the current flows round an underwater obstacle, the direct sunlight reflected signals related wave face slope, is dominated by the height and depth of sand waves and sand ridges, and current speed of the flows over those bedforms. The direct sunlight reflected signals from the sea surface could be regarded as a powerful tool to detect bedforms and other underwater obstacles...|$|R

Quantitative analysis based on fourteen real patient data sets demonstrates that both network approaches can perform better than the standard methods, and the proposed network structure can further reduce the PET quantification error compared to the U-net structure with multiple inputs.

The <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> as well as registration accuracy between SPECT and CT can be influenced by several factors.

METHODS: Effects of (1) misalignments between micro-SPECT and micro-CT through shifts and rotation, (2) globally altered <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and (3) combinations of these were evaluated. Tests were performed with a NEMA NU 4 - 2008 phantom and with rat cadavers containing sources with known activity. RESULTS: Changes in measured activities within volumes of interest in phantom images ranged from < 1. 5 % (125 I) and < 0. 6 % (201 Tl, 99 mTc and 111 In) for 1 -mm shifts to < 4. 5 % (125 I) and < 1. 7 % (201 Tl, 99 mTc and 111 In) with large misregistration (3 mm). Changes induced by 15 degrees rotation were smaller than those by 3 -mm shifts. By significantly altering <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> (+/- 10 %), activity changes of < 5. 2 % for 125 I and < 2. 7 % for 201 Tl, 99 mTc and 111 In were induced.
