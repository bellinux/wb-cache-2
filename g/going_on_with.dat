5|$|Both Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans {{attempt to}} {{diagnose}} what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Michael. They both {{see it as}} a coping mechanism, and both insist that the other reality is a dream. To try to prove this to Michael, Dr. Evans has Michael read a part of the United States Constitution, as if that reality was a dream, Michael could not have done so, unless he had memorized the Constitution. Michael learned that he had alcohol in his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E
25|$|The delays {{became so}} great that even ABC mocked the {{lateness}} with an ad campaign showing network executives waiting impatiently {{for the arrival of}} new episodes at ABC's corporate headquarters. One episode featured television critic Jeff Jarvis in an introduction, sarcastically reminding viewers what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the show's plot since it had been so long since the last new episode.|$|E

This incorporated and publicised many of his own views about how national defence should be conducted, without mentioning any real countries which might take offence.|$|E

25|$|On August 10, 2008, Compass-1 entered Emergency mode. The {{cause was}} unknown and FH Aachen {{put out a}} call to all amateur radio {{operators}} {{to try to find}} out what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the CubeSat. A hard reset occurred, only to bring the satellite into a circle of powering up, turning on the heaters, and then dying again. The only way to exit this loop was to avoid starting the heaters. The team needed as much Telemetry from the ground as possible, which was from amateur radio enthusiasts.|$|E

When she tells him her secret, at first he thinks it is a joke. But, what she said about him and the world would come from someone who had knowledge about the future. Peggy has decided to break up with Charlie'; she {{is the only one who}} wants that.|$|E
25|$|Austria–India {{relations}} {{refers to}} the bilateral ties between Austria and India. Indo-Austrian relations were established in May 1949 by the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru and the Chancellor of Austria Leopold Figl. Historically, Indo-Austrian ties have been particularly strong and India intervened in June 1953 in Austria's favour whilst negotiations were <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Soviet Union about the Austrian State Treaty. There is a fully functioning Indian embassy in Vienna, Austria's capital, which is concurrently accredited to the United Nations offices in the city. Austria is represented in India by its embassy and Trade commission in New Delhi, India's capital, as well as Honorary Consulates in Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Goa.|$|E

25|$|When {{following}} his marriage Chicharro moved to Castellón province {{he remained in}} the same political ambience, becoming president of the local Juventud Jaimista and in 1915 growing to jefe of the Villareal Jaimistas. In 1916 he entered the Castellón Junta Provincial and became its vice-president, <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his Villarreal jefatura duties. The same {{year for the first}} time he launched his bid for the Cortes standing in the Nules district. At that time Valencian Carlism was divided between the mainstream purs and the dissident paquistes, followers of Francisco Giner Lila; Chicharro seemed to have allied with none and unsuccessfully ran a broad conservative ticket, forming part of the contenders loyal to the Murcian party leader, Juan de la Cierva y Peñafiel.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, The Stranger ran {{an article}} on Cantwell's {{opposition}} to {{the inclusion of a}} public option in the health-care reform plan. They reported that: “Seattle congressman Jim McDermott supports it. Washington senator Patty Murray wants it. So does President Barack Obama. So does the often conservative Seattle Times editorial page. So do 72 percent of Americans, according to a recent poll. So what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Washington's junior senator, Maria Cantwell? Why doesn't she want Congress to include a public option—a new government-run health-care plan that will be available to everyone and will compete with private insurance companies to bring down costs—in its health-care-reform package?” Cantwell cited her concerns with getting the bill through the United States Senate as the reason for her opposition.|$|E
25|$|North Dakota was {{far away}} from the centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this did not mean that the local students did not know what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> their peers at schools such as UC-Berkeley. The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} of April, 2010, being blonde again and having left Avrupa Müzik, now {{being part of the}} music label of Poll Production, Yener {{released}} yet another album, called Hande'ye Neler Oluyor? (What's <b>Going</b> <b>On</b> <b>With</b> Hande?). Before she released this album, she has been cited that she would likely return to a more pop-oriented sound, meaning letting go of the prevailing electronic sound of her last three albums and her EP Hande Maxi. Although not a collection of pure electronic songs, the album didn't throw the electronic sound completely overboard — it actually contains no live instrumentation — favouring a more dance-pop oriented album, reminiscing of some songs of her Apayrı-era, over the more Türk pop albums {{in the early days of}} her career.|$|E
25|$|Dido and Aeneas are {{accompanied}} by their train. They stop at the grove to take in its beauty. A lot of action is <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>with</b> attendants carrying goods from the hunt and a picnic possibly taking place, and Dido and Aeneas are together within the activity. This is all stopped when Dido hears distant thunder, prompting Belinda to tell the servants {{to prepare for a}} return to shelter as soon as possible. As every other character leaves the stage, Aeneas is stopped by the Sorceress's elf, who is disguised as Mercury. This pretend Mercury brings the command of Jove that Aeneas is to wait no longer in beginning his task of creating a new Troy on Latin soil. Aeneas consents to the wishes of what he believes are the gods, but is heart-broken that he will have to leave Dido. He then goes off-stage to prepare for his departure from Carthage.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy {{travels to}} Apokolips {{and decides to}} confront Darkseid to {{determine}} his involvement with what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his manifesting powers. Solomon tells {{him that he had}} been turned into a spirit collector by Darkseid, who plans to drain him of all his powers when the time comes. He is then sent back to Earth along with everyone else. Jimmy is later captured by Mary Marvel who intends to deliver him to Darkseid. Darkseid turns Jimmy's powers off and prepares to absorb them, but is attacked by Superman. As they battle, Mary Marvel fights and defeats Donna, Kyle, Forager, Black Canary, and Vixen. Darkseid reactivates Jimmy's power to cause him to emit kryptonite radiation to kill Superman. However, Ray Palmer sneaks inside Jimmy and destroys the circuitry that controls his powers before being overcome by its defenses. Jimmy transforms into a scaled giant and prepares to fight Darkseid. Darkseid fights Jimmy across Metropolis and is about to kill him when Ray Palmer emerges from Jimmy's head, having shut down the device inside Jimmy that was storing the essences of the New Gods. A Boom Tube then opens up and Orion, Darkseid's son, emerges. Orion clashes with Darkseid and kills him after ripping Darkseid's heart from his chest. Soon afterwards Jimmy returns home, where his relationship with Forager deteriorates.|$|E

25|$|The Allies {{had begun}} {{to prepare for the}} {{humanitarian}} aftermath of the war while it was still <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>with</b> the founding of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), on 9 November 1943. However, the beginnings of the agency were plagued by organizational problems and corruption. The military authorities were, in any case, reluctant to yield significant responsibility for the DP assembly centers to a civilian organization, until it became clear {{that there would be a}} need to house and care for the DPs for an extended period of time. At the point when it was supposed to begin its work the UNRRA was woefully understaffed in view of the larger than expected numbers of DPs, and additional staff that were hastily recruited were poorly trained. The agency began to send staff into the field in summer 1945; its mission had been conceived mainly as a support to the repatriation process, including providing medical services, and assuring the delivery of adequate nutrition, as well as attending to the DPs' needs for comfort and entertainment; however, it often fell short of fulfilling these functions. As of 15 November 1945, the UNRRA officially assumed responsibility for the administration of the camps, while remaining generally subordinate to the military, which continued to provide for housing and security in the camps, as well as the delivery of food, clothing, and medical supplies. Over time the UNRRA supplemented the latter basic services with health and welfare services, recreational facilities, self-help programs, and vocational guidance.|$|E

500|$|Tesla's {{demonstration}} of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, {{came at the}} time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thompson-Houston, were trying to grow in a capital intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was even a [...] "War of Currents" [...] propaganda campaign <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Edison Electric trying to claim their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system. Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related polyphase system right away.|$|E

Votta characterized the McKinley victory as [...] "so secondary {{to the point of}} this episode that it feels completely anticlimactic", and VanDerWerff summarized, [...] "When New Directions hoists that trophy aloft at the end, it’s about the least compelling victory for the group yet." ...|$|E
500|$|Callaway {{carefully}} chose actors when casting each role.

Despite auditioning other actors to voice Hippocrates, Callway reprised the role from the pilot; he would later {{say that he had}} difficulty with the medical and technical vocabulary required for the character. Like The X-Files and Stargate SG-1, the show was filmed in Vancouver to take advantage of lower production costs. A majority of the crew had worked on The X-Files. The executive producers were: Trey Callaway, Michael Katleman, Lee David Zlotoff, Joe Voci, and Scott Sanders. Jon Ehrlich composed the show's theme.|$|E
