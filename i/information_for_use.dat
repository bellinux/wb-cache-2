[...] Local SAROPS servers around the United States request environmental {{information from the}} EDS based upon the area of interest. Different environmental products are cataloged on the server ranging from observational systems to modeling products. [...] Observations include sea surface temperature, air temperature, visibility, wave height, global/region tides and currents to name a few. [...] High-resolution model output from operational forecast models like the hybrid coordinate ocean model (HYCOM) and Global NRL Coastal Ocean (NCOM) provide temporally and spatially varying wind and current information. [...] Lastly, the EDS is capable of providing objective analysis tools and aggregation. [...] The list of available products is always changing as researchers in the Navy, local universities and research centers continually improve the accuracy and reliability of products and make them available on a consistent basis.|$|E
