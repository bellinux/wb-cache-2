In the United States, {{the efficiency of}} air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the {{seasonal energy efficiency ratio}} (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> in watt hours (W·h) during the same period.|$|E
50|$|The SEER {{rating of}} a unit is the cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> during the same period. The higher the unit's SEER rating the more energy {{efficient}} it is. In the U.S., the SEER is the ratio of cooling in British thermal unit (BTU) to the energy consumed in watt-hours. The coefficient of performance (COP), a more universal unit-less measure of efficiency, is discussed in the following section.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, such as room {{temperature}} water electrolysis, the electric input {{is larger than}} the enthalpy change of the reaction, so some energy is released as waste heat. In the case of electrolysis of steam into hydrogen and oxygen at high temperature, the opposite is true. Heat is absorbed from the surroundings, and the heating value of the produced hydrogen is higher than the electric input. In this case the efficiency relative to <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> can be said to be greater than 100%. The maximum theoretical efficiency of a fuel cell is the inverse of that of electrolysis. It is thus impossible to create a perpetual motion machine by combining the two processes.|$|E

In assessing the form of this transition and the trend {{that is likely to}} continue in the near future, it is imperative to know the present use of energy in agricultural production in order to formulate rational policy. The objective of the research was to provide an energy and economic efficiency analysis of wheat production in the Balochistan province of Pakistan using gravity and lift irrigation with diesel and <b>electric</b> <b>energy.</b> The applied <b>inputs</b> evaluated were farms irrigated with canal water, farms irrigated with electric motor driven pumps and the farms using diesel engine to pump the irrigation water. The sources of <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> included the human labour, FYM, chemical fertilizer, electrical or diesel pumps used for irrigation and tractor. The results indicate that irrigation using an electric motor and diesel engine is inefficient in term of energy consumption and economic returns at the farm level compared with canal irrigation.

40|$|Purpose. Use {{efficiency}} {{improvement of}} trolley buses in passenger traffic based on power levels of <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> and terms adjustment of their maintenance. Methodology. In {{order to achieve}} this goal conformance of <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> by trolleybus to the transported amount of passengers taking into account characteristics of the route is offered to establish. The major indicators of the trolleybus operation are: speed of a race on lines, number of tractive motor firing, voltage and amperage in the network that were taken with accountants from a dashboard. Research results were tabulated and recorded with DVR. Along with the study of power consumption of <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> by a trolleybus passenger count was carried out too. Findings. The directly proportional dependence between the level of energy consumption by a trolleybus and the number of passengers for constant performance route was determined. Originality. As the criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the trolleybus operation on the route is proposed to use the ratio between electricity consumption and number of passengers for these characteristics of the route. This is confirmed experimentally. The obtained formulas give the possibility to balance the force work and consequently the volume of energy consumption during the trolleybus movement on the rise and the descent. Practical value. The proposed criterion can be used to adjust the terms of maintenance on the individual program, that means individual maintenance (IM). Type of work performed at the IM should be determined on the basis of diagnostic data of the vehicle (V). The principles of IM were formulated: 1) the primary task is planned and preventative strategy to identify and eliminate troubleshooting and technical actions; 2) operational control of the vehicle (V) technical condition on the basis of prediction of its state using the proposed criteria, that takes into account the dependence of power consumption to the number of passengers in the characteristics of the route; 3) individual approach to evaluate the technical condition of each specific vehicle (V); 4) individual prediction of the frequency of the maintenance and vehicle condition...|$|E
40|$|CO 2 {{emission}} certificates internalise {{effects of}} {{fossil fuel consumption}} on global climate and sea levels. If they are only implemented in some countries, then their effectiveness is limited; Consumption, production and investment decisions do not reach the optimal allocation, production with inefficient technologies in non-participating countries can even be increased. Furthermore industry lobbying might result in limited application of CO 2 emission certificates or less ambitious reduction targets. Border tax adjustment {{at the level of}} additional costs incurred for procurement of CO 2 emission permits during production of processed materials using best available technology limits the distortions.

40|$|Microfiltration {{membranes}} of polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) {{are promising}} {{materials for the}} development of functional polymeric membranes. The aim of this work is the investigation of typical plasma processes such as continuous plasma, pulse plasma and plasma graft polymerisation concerning their effect of functionalisation with primary amino groups using a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen, ammonia, allylamine and diaminocyclohexane. The relative amounts of surface-incorporated nitrogen and primary amino groups are determined using electron spectroscopy and the binding of a selective fluorescent probe (Atto Tag FQ). No correlation of the relative amount of surface-bound nitrogen, determined by ESCA, and the relative amount of primary amino groups, determined with Atto Tag FQ, is found. The interpretation of the chemical shift of nitrogen with ESCA is limited. This is due to the unknown ionisation states of the primary amino groups resulting in peak shifts and their overlap with various other nitrogen compounds. The comparison of experiments performed with the same <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> but different powers show that the formation of primary amino groups on the surface of PVDF is higher, the lower the power of the plasma is. The formation of primary amine groups is maximised when a grafting method is applied. We explain this phenomenon as a fragmenting plasma effect. This results in an increased abstraction of hydrogen at higher plasma intensities and an augmented formation of a greater variety of nitrogen compounds. Furthermore the effectiveness of diaminocyclohexane as precursor is higher than allylamine, resulting in a higher grafting density...|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{ferromanganese}} submerged arc furnace was purposed to yield valuable information for exergy calculations. A deeper understanding of at what point exergy is lost in the furnace might yield valuable information for the further optimization of the ferromanganese smelting process. The model is split into two parts covering the coke bed zone and the pre-reduction zone respectively. The coke bed zone model uses the estimated electrode tip position, mass transfer from pre- reduction zone, <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> and energy transfer to heat and chemical reactions as parameters. Hot gas ascending from the coke bed will enter the pre-reduction zone and exchange heat and mass (reaction) with the solid particles in the pre reduction zone. In the pre reduction zone model, the shrinking core model is applied to cover the reduc- tion kinetics of the ore particles. Moreover the Boudouard reaction is included and also decomposition of carbonates. Heat is exchanged with the furnace walls and the gas exits the furnace at the top. Unfortunately the model did not get to start working before the time was up for the work on this thesis. Nevertheless a sound foundation with derivations is given for the time this work should be continued. Matlab&# 174;is used for the calculations of this model. Thermodynamic data was programmed into Matlab to be easily available at any time for the calculations. Programs are written {{to take care of}} isolated parts of the problem to be used when their services are needed. The application of solid state thermoelectric devices on the outer shell of the furnace has the advantages of recycling otherwise lost energy, and in the process increasing the overall exergetic efficiency of the smelter. An additional advantage is the interpretation of the power output from the elements as heat flux, possibly replacing todays heat flux measure- ments. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this Master's Thesis has been to analyze the systems for thermal energy supply at the ZEB Living Lab, at NTNU, Trondheim. The 102 m^ 2 single-family house is {{designed}} and built {{in accordance with the}} Norwegian passive house standard, as a Zero Emission Building. Efficient utilization of on-site renewable heat sources, such as ground and solar heat, are thus essential means to reach this ambitious goal. The thermal energy supply system comprises a 3. 2 kW ground-source heat pump unit, 4. 2 m^ 2 of south façade-mounted solar panels, a 400 l integrated water tank, including two 3. 0 kW back-up heaters, and an hydronic heat distribution system. A combination of theoretical and experimental approaches have been applied in the analyze. Thermal energy and power demands from SIMIEN simulations, resulted in a heat pump power coverage factor of 54 %, at 0 / 35 °C. Energy coverage factors were 70 % and 85 %, with and without DHW heat supply. Corresponding SPF values were 2. 56 and 3. 52. Polysun simulations of the solar thermal system gave an annual solar fraction of 0. 37, and a value of 0. 6 for DHW heating during the summertime. Results and observations from measurements have revealed a potential for improvement of system operating strategies, performance, design and dimensioning. The heat pump system is designed for alternate operation between space and DHW heating, but is currently incapable of the latter. Direct-acting electricity is thus an important heat producer in the system. The solar thermal system is designed for combined space and DHW heating, but is operated too intermittently to provide significant heat input. Low-temperature solar heating is furthermore prioritized by the integrated water tank, which restricts the potential for high-temperature DHW heating during the summer. Field measurements have shown a significant electric power consumption for operation of pumps. The electric power input to the ground circuit pump, for instance, corresponded to 15 % of the power input to the heat pump compressor. This contributed to a 13. 5 % reduction in the heat pump system COP. Replacement of the brine solution is one of the suggested measures to redeem this deficiency. In order to obtain the energy savings necessary to reach the ZEB goal, it is essential that the <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> to pumps and electric heaters is minimized. Meanwhile, the operating time for the heat pump unit and solar thermal system has to be extended. It is also essential that the measuring equipment is fully functional, so that the system energy performance can be documented...|$|E
