500|$|By 01:30, Titanics {{downward}} angle in {{the water}} was increasing and the ship was now listing slightly more to port, {{but not more than}} 5 degrees. The deteriorating situation was reflected in the tone of the messages sent from the ship: [...] "We are putting the women off in the boats" [...] at 01:25, [...] "Engine room getting flooded" [...] at 01:35, and at 01:45, [...] "Engine room <b>full</b> <b>up</b> to boilers." [...] This was Titanics last intelligible signal, sent as the ship's electrical system began to fail; subsequent messages were jumbled and broken. The two radio operators nonetheless continued sending out distress messages almost to the very end.|$|E

500|$|The leafless, spiny stem is the {{characteristic}} {{feature of the}} majority of cacti (and all of those belonging to the largest subfamily, the Cactoideae). The stem is typically succulent, meaning it is adapted to store water. The surface of the stem may be smooth (as in some species of Opuntia) or covered with protuberances of various kinds, which are usually called tubercles. These vary from small [...] "bumps" [...] to prominent, nipple-like shapes in the genus Mammillaria and outgrowths almost like leaves in Ariocarpus species. The stem may also be ribbed or fluted in shape. The prominence of these ribs depends on how much water the stem is storing: when <b>full</b> (<b>up</b> to 90% of the mass of a cactus may be water), the ribs may be almost invisible on the swollen stem, whereas when the cactus is short of water and the stems shrink, the ribs may be very visible.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen {{and we do not}} know why. We were picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to the}} First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been <b>full</b> <b>up</b> I think they would have gone. The Commanding Officer of Fiji told me that the air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Deccan Herald, Anand talked about how the American sitcom Friends influenced the film's two characters revealing he wanted viewers to respond to Akash and Kiara in a similar way. He said: [...] "I remember when I watched Friends I wanted to meet and know every character. That's how I want audiences to feel about Ranbir and Priyanka." [...] He also wanted the two to resonate with the audience the way the characters in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) did. In another interview discussing the film, Anand revealed that he wanted to make it different from his earlier films, aiming for it to be a [...] "subdued romance," [...] which is not sexy. He said: [...] "Everyone is going to be covered up in scarf's and mufflers and over coats and boots. This is a rare instance that you’ll see Indian actors dressed <b>full</b> <b>up</b> without skin show."(sic) In September 2009, it was announced that Sajid Nadiadwala would produce the film as he was highly impressed by the script.|$|E

500|$|... "No Surprises", {{recorded}} {{in a single}} take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys' [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong's 1968 recording of [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] and the soul music of Marvin Gaye. Hoping to achieve a slower tempo than could be played well on their instruments, Godrich had the band record the song at a faster tempo, then slowed the playback for Yorke to overdub his vocals onto, creating an [...] "ethereal" [...] effect. Yorke identified {{the subject of the}} song as [...] "someone who's trying hard to keep it together but can't". The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, [...] "a heart that's <b>full</b> <b>up</b> like a landfill"; according to Yorke, the song is a [...] "fucked-up nursery rhyme" [...] that [...] "stems from my unhealthy obsession {{of what to do with}} plastic boxes and plastic bottles... All this stuff is getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn't rot, it just stays there. That's how we deal, that's how I deal with stuff, I bury it." [...] The song's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, [...] "even when the subject is suicide... O'Brien's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child's prayer." ...|$|E

At that time, it consisted of wrapping cloth around the victim's head, after which the torturers [...] "poured the water softly upon his head until the cloth was <b>full,</b> <b>up</b> to the mouth and nostrils, and somewhat higher, so that he could not draw breath but he must suck in all the water". In one case, the torturer applied water three or four times successively until the victim's [...] "body was swollen twice or thrice as big as before, his cheeks like great bladders, and his eyes staring and strutting out beyond his forehead".|$|E

The undercarriage was extended at too high a speed, and the next flap adjustment {{should have been done}} in two stages. The sudden change of angle caused the nose to pitch downwards and the aircraft to descend more rapidly than was appropriate for the conditions. The Captain and other crew members did not react to this for about 45 seconds, though, until about [...] from the ground they applied full power and <b>full</b> <b>up</b> elevator to try to bring the aircraft up. The accident report states that during this 45-second period, they may have been preoccupied by looking for visual confirmation of their position, such as the runway lights.|$|E

[...] On impact, his helmet was cracked and he was knocked unconscious; upon revival, his automatic parachute was opened and the plane had crashed below him in a ball of fire on the northeast side of Mt. Whitney. [...] In 1964, he was assigned to fly the T-38 with three of the original Mercury Seven Astronauts, Gordon Cooper, Deke Slayton, and Wally Schirra to maintain proficiency and stay current. He also flew the T-38 with Neil Armstrong as well as Pete Conrad, Jr. [...] During his time as a pilot for KANG (Kansas Air National Guard), he also survived a fiery crash in the T-33. [...] In 1956, at McConnell AFB, unable to blow the canopy or jettison the fuel tanks, due to engine malfunction and electrical failure, he and the other pilot, Pat Windsor, had to hand crank the canopy to escape the burning jet. [...] During his flying career, Thomas accumulated 8,000 hours flying more than 116 different aircraft.|$|E
