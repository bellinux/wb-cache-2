50|$|Microcavities {{have many}} applications, {{frequently}} at present in optoelectronics, where vertical cavity surface emitting lasers VCSEL {{are probably the}} best known.

40|$|While light <b>{{emitting}}</b> <b>devices,</b> such as {{laser diodes}} (LDs) and {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs), were first introduced decades ago, they {{have been the subject}} of continuing research and improvements due to their relatively poor performance. Evolution has occurred in both the design of light <b>emitting</b> <b>devices</b> and in the materials from which they are made. This thesis examines new proposals for use of templated arrays of heterostructural semiconductor nanowire light <b>emitting</b> <b>devices,</b> from both engineering and business points of view. The effects of wire spacing and diameter on reliability and performance (both the internal quantum efficiency and the extraction efficiency) are evaluated. Business models for development of nanowire arrays for light <b>emitting</b> <b>devices</b> are discussed. by Ting Zou. Thesis (M. Eng.)

50|$|Furthermore, for {{the higher}} tones, the {{circular}} sound emittance characteristic for organ pipes can only be achieved to a very limited extent as loudspeakers become more directional at higher frequencies. So, in some cases, several loudspeakers are located {{next to each other}} in a (semi) circle to obtain a more even emittance. Another possibility is to install the loudspeaker with the diaphragm facing up, and down and to divert the sound from the loudspeaker using a cone fixed above and below it (a so-called circular emitter). Although the area of even emittance is extended on the horizontal plane, the problem of an even sound distribution cannot be solved in a satisfactory way if the audience is seated at different heights with respect to the <b>emitting</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
