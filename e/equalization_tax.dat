5000|$|The last {{profitable}} decade was the 1960s, before {{competition from}} the Japanese shipbuilding industry became too fierce. When Norwegian shipping companies discontinued refinancing their vessel purchases in the United States capital market (the Interest <b>Equalization</b> <b>Tax),</b> requirements were put on Swedish wharfs to hand out credits with subsidized interests and conditions, like the Japanese industry. Eriksberg succeeded however, unlike its competitors Götaverken and Kockums, to retain high solvency {{and go through the}} last years of the 1960s relatively unhurt. Both Kockums and Götaverken, being public companies, were insolvent and were saved, through a combination of private and state intervention.

50|$|The Werner-Cravatte {{years were}} {{important}} {{from an economic}} point of view as they saw the flourishing of the Luxembourgish financial centre. However, the birth of {{what would become the}} main pillar of the Grand Duchy's economy was not due to the government's policy. At its origin was a measure of the American government to slow the emission of international loans on the financial markets of New York, the Interest <b>Equalization</b> <b>Tax.</b> The reorientation of financial flows which resulted from this {{led to the creation of}} the international Eurodollars market. However, Luxembourg, which did not have a central bank, and where banking and tax laws were very flexible, found itself in a favourable position, while the traditional financial centres such as London, Zurich or Amsterdam were burdened by restrictive regulation. The Grand Duchy's capital gradually became one of the main centres for the Euro-markets, and foreign banks started establishing themselves in Luxembourg. The number of banking institutions grew from 15 in 1960 to 37 in 1970. In this boom phase, the government of the day had little involvement, even though, on occasion it defended the financial centre against European plans for fiscal harmonisation. The financial centre profited from both positive external factors, as well as legislation from 40 years previous, prepared under the then-Minister for Finances Pierre Dupong.|$|E

40|$|The {{equalization}} criterion {{is important}} {{in relation to the}} real estate tax. The amount that the taxpayer must pay to the government should be commensurate with the current market value of the asset. In several European Countries, including Italy, the real estate tax is based on cadastral incomes, which often do not express the assets real market value.
