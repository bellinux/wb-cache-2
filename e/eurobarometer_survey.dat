25|$|The {{opening of}} {{membership}} {{talks with the}} EU in December 2004 was celebrated by Turkey with much fanfare, but the Turkish populace has become increasingly sceptical as negotiations are delayed based on what it views as lukewarm support for its accession to the EU and alleged double standards in its negotiations {{particularly with regard to}} the French and Austrian referendums. A mid-2006 <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>survey</b> revealed that 43% of Turkish citizens view the EU positively; just 35% trust the EU, 45% support enlargement and just 29% support an EU constitution.|$|E
