5|$|Before 1923, Coghlan {{had opposed}} the {{amalgamation}} of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned {{that it would}} make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895–96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in Bechuanaland was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern Bechuanaland. The <b>Dominions</b> <b>Office</b> rejected the claim {{on the grounds that the}} Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory.|$|E
5|$|Coghlan {{directed}} {{his attention to}} Northern Rhodesia. Howard Moffat, his Minister for Mines and Works, had supervised mineral exploration in Northern Rhodesia twenty years earlier and so knew of the rich copper deposits across the Zambezi. However, Moffat's first public claim on the northern territory, in November 1925, was {{on the issue of}} control of the railway, which would grant control of the central African cattle trade. At the 1926 Imperial Conference in London, some degree of control over the railway was granted to Southern Rhodesia. There was also the issue of attracting labour for mines and farms from the far north and this gave impetus to Coghlan's and Moffat's territorial expansionism in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Coghlan called on Britain's Colonial Secretary, Leopold Amery, to give the North entirely to the South or at least the reversionary right to it but Amery refused this request. During his tour of Southern Rhodesia the following year, Amery appeared to give support to its claims to neighbouring territories. But by 1928, after Coghlan's death, both the <b>Dominions</b> <b>Office</b> and the Colonial Office were for maintaining Northern Rhodesia's territory intact, and favoured its association with the East African dependencies of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda.|$|E

25|$|The Government, led by Prime Minister Frederick C. Alderdice, {{called upon}} the British {{government}} to take direct control until Newfoundland could become self-sustaining. The United Kingdom, concerned over Newfoundland's likelihood of defaulting on its loans, asked the government to establish the Newfoundland Royal Commission, headed by a Scottish peer, Lord Amulree. Its report, released in 1933, assessed Newfoundland's political system as institutionally corrupt and its economic future as bleak, recommending the abolition of responsible government, and its replacement by a Commission of the British Government. Acting on the report's recommendations, Alderdice's government voted itself out of existence in December 1933. Appointed as Chair of the Commission of Government in 1934, Anderson found his role as Governor with significantly expanded powers and proved himself up to the job, constantly sending reports back to the <b>Dominions</b> <b>Office</b> and giving advice to the Dominions Secretary {{on how to deal}} with the Commission members.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War {{there was a sense of}} dissatisfaction in how honours were distributed. The effect was the passage of the Nickel Resolution. The resolution created a policy of Canadians not being appointed to peerages or titular honours, and the government of Canada only making recommendation for a handful of non-titular honours. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster reaffirmed the equality of the self-governing dominions of the British Empire, however there was no mechanism to establish honours specific to the dominions. In 1935, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal was established as the first award specifically for service in Canada. The Canadian government managed the creation of this medal by passing the recommendation for creating the honour on to the <b>Dominions</b> <b>Office,</b> who had experience with drafting Royal Warrants. In 1934, King George V signed the Royal Warrant creating the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal. Prime Minister R.B. Bennett countersigned the Royal Warrant 15 December 1934 signifying that the King was acting on the advice of his Canadian Ministry.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wider}} Imperial context, Southern Rhodesia {{occupied}} a category unto itself {{because of the}} [...] "special quasi-independent status" [...] it held. The <b>Dominions</b> <b>Office,</b> formed in 1925 to handle British relations with the dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa and the Irish Free State, also dealt with Southern Rhodesia, and Imperial Conferences included the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister alongside those of the dominions from 1932. This unique arrangement continued following the advent of Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences in 1944. Southern Rhodesians of all races fought for Britain in the Second World War, and the colonial government gradually received more autonomy regarding external affairs. During the immediate post-war years, Southern Rhodesian politicians generally {{thought that they were}} as good as independent as they were, and that full autonomy in the form of dominionship would make little difference to them. Post-war immigration to Southern Rhodesia, mainly from Britain, Ireland and South Africa, caused the white community to swell from 68,954 in 1941 to 221,504 in 1961. The black population grew from 1,400,000 to 3,550,000 over the same period.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the fall}} of France in 1940, the British Admiralty ordered convoys to be re-routed through the {{north-western}} approaches which would take them around the north coast and through the North Channel to the Irish Sea. However, escorting those convoys raised a problem: it became imperative to establish an escort base as far west in the United Kingdom as possible. There was one obvious location: Lough Foyle. However, it remained unclear where the border was between the UK and Ireland in Lough Foyle. On 31 August 1940, Sir John Maffey, the UK's representative to the Irish government, wrote to the <b>Dominions</b> <b>Office</b> in London that: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{fate of the}} Federation was contested {{within the}} British Government by two {{principal}} Ministries of the Crown in deep ideological, personal and professional rivalry - the Colonial Office (CO) and the Commonwealth Relations Office (CRO) (and previously with it the <b>Dominion</b> <b>Office,</b> abolished in 1947). The CO ruled the northern territories of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, while the CRO was formally but indirectly in charge of Southern Rhodesia. The Northern Territories opposed a Southern Rhodesian hegemony, one that the CRO promoted. Significantly, the CO {{tended to be more}} sympathetic to African rights than the CRO, which tended to promote the interests of the Southern Rhodesian (and to a lesser extent, Northern Rhodesian) European settler populations.|$|R

50|$|The FCO {{was formed}} in 1968, from the merger of the {{short-lived}} Commonwealth Office and the Foreign Office. The Commonwealth Office had been created only in 1966, by the merger of the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office, and the Commonwealth Relations Office had been formed by the merger of the <b>Dominions</b> <b>Office</b> and the India Office in 1947—with the <b>Dominions</b> <b>Office</b> having been split from the Colonial Office in 1925.|$|E
50|$|But {{as early}} as November 1934, after Sir John Hope Simpson, who had agreed to Williams's {{suggestion}} that the settlement be named after himself, opening-up Simpson to accusations of favouritism, had returned to England over Christmas to meet with officials at the <b>Dominions</b> <b>Office,</b> it had become apparent that J. O. Williams had lost his government's support. When the <b>Dominions</b> <b>Office</b> {{found out that the}} 400 houses were not being built at Port Hope Simpson and money had effectively been borrowed under false pretences on Simpson's say-so it brought about a complete change in their attitude towards Simpson and Williams.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{pushed for}} greater {{consultation}} and {{voice for the}} dominions, and succeeded in having Richard Casey appointed as a permanent political liaison in London who would have access to British government decisions and act as a conduit between Westminster and Melbourne. He also successfully lobbied {{for the creation of}} a <b>Dominion</b> <b>Office</b> separated out from the Colonial Office to acknowledge the different state of affairs that now existed in the Empire. However, while fellow dominions generally agreed that the imperial system should be modified, not all shared his vision for closer collaboration and strong ties. Canada and the Union of South Africa were instead seeking greater independence from London, and there was little enthusiasm for many of Bruce's more ambitious plans for inter-empire trade and policy cooperation.|$|R
50|$|This {{office was}} divided into two in 1854, and a new Colonial Office was created to deal {{specifically}} {{with the needs of}} the colonies and assigned to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Colonial Office did not have responsibility for all British possessions overseas; British possessions in India and certain other nearby areas were under the authority of the India Office, and certain informal protectorates and other areas—particularly Egypt—were under the authority of the Foreign Office (now the Foreign and Commonwealth Office). In 1907 the Dominion Division of the Colonial Office was created, and from 1925 separate Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs were appointed. After the independence of India in 1947, the <b>Dominion</b> <b>Office</b> was merged with the India Office to form the Commonwealth Relations Office.|$|R
50|$|Southern Rhodesia {{was not one}} of {{the territories}} that were {{mentioned}} in the 1931 Statute of Westminster although relations with Southern Rhodesia were administered in London through the <b>Dominion</b> <b>Office,</b> not the Colonial <b>Office.</b> When the <b>Dominions</b> were first treated as foreign countries by London for the purposes of diplomatic immunity in 1952, Southern Rhodesia was included in the list of territories concerned. This semi-Dominion status continued in Southern Rhodesia between 1953 and 1963, when it joined Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in the Central African Federation, with the latter two territories continuing to be British protectorates. When Northern Rhodesia was given independence in 1964 it adopted the new name of Zambia, prompting Southern Rhodesia to shorten its name to Rhodesia, but Britain did not recognise this latter change.|$|R

2500|$|The event being celebrated was Alexander Graham Bell's [...] "three great {{tests of}} the telephone", which culminated with the call he {{received}} on 10 August 1876 in Paris, from his father and others speaking {{to him from the}} <b>Dominion</b> Telegraph <b>Office</b> in Brantford. For that long distance test the younger Bell set up a telephone using telegraph lines at Robert White's Boot and Shoe Store running through the <b>Dominion</b> Telegraph <b>office</b> in Paris. The normal telegraph line of about 13km (8miles) length between Paris and Brantford was extended a further 93km (58 miles) to Toronto to allow the use of a battery in its telegraph office. A similar celebration organized by the Telephone Pioneers of America had been held earlier on the telephone call's 91st anniversary in August 1967, with the ceremonies being broadcast live from the site by a microwave transmitter.|$|R
50|$|Large-scale {{settlement}} of the region was delayed however due {{to the absence of}} a railway. When the Alberta government announced lucrative bond guarantees to major railway companies in 1909 to extend lines into the Peace River region, several projects were announced.

2500|$|The {{change of}} {{terminology}} from external affairs to foreign affairs recognized, albeit belatedly, a shift {{that had occurred}} many years before. At {{the time that the}} external affairs portfolio was created in 1909, Canada was a self-governing Dominion in the British Empire and did not have an independent foreign policy. Under s. 132 of the Constitution Act, 1867, the federal government had authority to conduct and implement relations with [...] other parts of the British Empire, which were not considered foreign lands. The United Kingdom and other colonial powers still routinely divided their conduct of overseas policy into foreign affairs (e.g. the UK's Foreign Office) and domestic or colonial affairs (the Colonial <b>Office</b> or <b>Dominion</b> <b>Office,</b> which were later reorganized and combined into one department, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office). Diplomacy outside the Empire (e.g. between Canada and its non-Empire neighbours, the United States, Russia, St. Pierre and Miquelon, and Greenland) were conducted by the foreign office of the United Kingdom. Informally, however, Canada had had relations with the United States in particular, with trade and other relationships pre-dating Confederation.|$|R
