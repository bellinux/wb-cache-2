5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the track}} was {{reported}} clear of debris, the safety car was withdrawn {{and the race}} restarted on lap five. Jonathan Palmer, commentating alongside Murray Walker for the BBC, remarked how quick Schumacher was, as {{his time in the}} warm-up session on Sunday morning gave rise to speculation that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> one pit stop and, therefore, race with a heavier car than Senna, who was planning to make two, as was conventional. Martin Brundle had told BBC presenter Steve Rider that McLaren were going to make two stops. On the second lap after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left the road at the Tamburello corner, and after slowing from 190mph (306km/h) to 131mph (211km/h), hit the concrete wall, with debris flying into the path of the other drivers.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man {{contacts}} Mulder, arranging {{a meeting}} at a nearby diner. There Mulder meets his sister Samantha, who calls The Smoking Man her father. Samantha claims to not remember anything about her abduction and is reluctant to stay or tell Mulder where he can find her. The next day, The Smoking Man offers Mulder the truth if he quits the FBI and comes work for him; Mulder refuses. Mulder later meets with Blevins, who now has evidence Skinner was withholding information concerning Ostelhoff's death. Blevins tells Mulder he can help him if he names Skinner as the traitor in the FBI. Later, Mulder meets with Scully, telling her <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the deal with The Smoking Man but now will not after his meeting with Blevins. Despite Scully's pleas, he refuses to name Skinner as the traitor in the FBI.|$|E

25|$|The Jews {{damn near}} owned all of Germany {{prior to the}} war.

25|$|The hoard {{was sold}} by the farmer, J.L.Gibson, to a {{jeweller}} in Derry who sold it to a local antiquarian, Robert Day. He sold it to the British Museum for £600. The museum had undisturbed ownership until the renowned Arthur Evans wrote a paper describing the find in 1897. The drawing of the torc design comes from this paper. The Royal Irish Academy disputed the British Museum's view {{that it was an}} ancient gift to the gods and launched a long running court case. The Academy wanted the finds to be declared treasure trove, that is, buried with the intention of recovery. Day, the antiquarian, was so aggrieved to have his sale disputed that he withdrew a gift <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> to the Irish Academy.|$|E
25|$|Johnson was {{an early}} example of the celebrity athlete in the modern era, {{appearing}} regularly {{in the press and}} later on radio and in motion pictures. He earned considerable sums endorsing various products, including patent medicines, and indulged several expensive hobbies such as automobile racing and tailored clothing, as well as purchasing jewelry and furs for his wives. He even challenged champion racer Barney Oldfield to a match auto race at the Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York one mile (1.6km) dirt track. Oldfield, far more experienced, easily out-distanced Johnson, ending any thoughts the boxer might have had about becoming a professional driver. Once, when he was pulled over for a $50 speeding ticket (a large sum at the time), he gave the officer a $100 bill; when the officer protested that he couldn't make change for that much, Johnson told him to keep the change, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his return trip at the same speed. Johnson was also interested in opera (his favorite being Il Trovatore) and in history — he was an admirer of Napoleon Bonaparte, believing him to have risen from a similar origin to his own. In 1920, Johnson opened a night club in Harlem; he sold it three years later to a gangster, Owney Madden, who renamed it the Cotton Club.|$|E

500|$|Songs {{performed}} {{during the}} tour were [...] "chosen because they fit the performance" [...] and fit Bowie's goal {{to make a}} show that was much more theatrical and had strong dramatic content. When he was asked how <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his rock show [...] "dramatic", he replied, [...] "You'll be surprised {{what you can do}} with a 6-piece rock band and a stage and a couple of lights." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] became world-famous when Peter, Paul and Mary {{issued the}} song {{as a single}} {{three weeks after the}} release of Freewheelin. They and Dylan both shared the same manager: Albert Grossman. The single sold a phenomenal three hundred {{thousand}} copies {{in the first week of}} release. On July 13, 1963, it reached number two on the Billboard chart with sales exceeding one million copies. Dylan later recalled that he was astonished when Peter Yarrow told him <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> $5,000 from the publishing rights.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the spring}} {{training}} in 2006, Feldman was feeling confident that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the parent club's 25-man roster. A week before Opening Day he was called into Manager Buck Showalter's office. But instead of telling Feldman he had made the team, for the first 10 minutes Showalter and the team's pitching coach Mark Connor spoke on and on about how Feldman had had a solid spring training — but needed to work on some things. Feldman couldn't believe it but eventually thought, [...] "Holy smoke, I’m going down [...]" [...] Suddenly, unable to continue the prank any longer, Showalter burst out laughing: [...] "Pack your bags, rookie, you’re coming with us!" ...|$|E

500|$|When {{he started}} classes with this [...] "homemade" [...] knife, his {{instructors}} and fellow students {{were impressed with}} his handiwork {{and asked him to}} make knives for them. Emerson did so and sold these early butterfly knives for just the cost of materials, but he soon raised the price to $50 each, as demand for his knives increased. Emerson went on to make fixed-blade knives on a part-time basis, but upon seeing a Michael Walker handmade folding knife at a gun show, he was so impressed by the quality and design that he decided <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> folding pocketknives from that point on. Emerson contacted Walker and obtained his permission to use the Walker Linerlock mechanism on his own knives. [...] According to a 1990 article by Paul Basch, Emerson said of Walker, [...] "Here was a guy who put everything I was looking for into a knife. It was then I decided to start making knives seriously and locking liners in particular".|$|E

It was to revolve around a new set of characters, led by Kirk's ancestor Tiberius Chase, and be set during the Earth-Romulan War—after the events of Enterprise but before the events of the original series.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter {{had just}} made Dark Star but {{no one wanted to}} hire him as a director, so he assumed that he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the {{intention}} of making Escape later. After the success of Halloween, Avco-Embassy signed him and producer Debra Hill to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was The Fog. Initially, the second film that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> to finish the contract was The Philadelphia Experiment, but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt that something was missing and recalls, [...] "This was basically a straight action film. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see." [...] He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film school days at University of Southern California who played [...] "The Shape" [...] in Halloween. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.|$|E

500|$|Daavettila {{graduated}} from Michigan Tech in 2008 and tried {{out for the}} Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He appeared in two games for the Generals {{at the end of}} the season (for only about three shifts), and did not register a point. Daavettila had not originally planned to pursue a professional hockey career, but said [...] "When I got one skate with Flint, it kind of sparked my interest and I decided to give it a try". During the off-season, Daavettila worked for a structural engineering firm in Saginaw, Michigan. He used vacation time at the start of the next hockey season later in 2008 to try out for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Muskegon Lumberjacks (IHL), though he was rejected by both teams. Tryouts with two more IHL teams, the Kalamazoo Wings and the Bloomington PrairieThunder, did not result in a contract either. Daavettila assumed his hockey career was over and went back to his engineering job, but he continued to skate a couple times a week. He had left an impression on Kalamazoo coach Nick Bootland, however, who called Daavettila back in March 2009 after his team was depleted by injuries. [...] "You could see he had a skill set," [...] said Bootland. [...] "But I thought the way he held on to the puck, he was going to get himself killed. ... You kept thinking <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a mistake. Then he'd pop a guy for a breakaway." ...|$|E
