2500|$|In 2015, in {{the wake}} of revelations of {{widespread}} doping in athletics, Radcliffe said that, unlike some other prominent British athletes, she would not be releasing her blood-test history, and discouraged other athletes from doing so. She was later indirectly identified as a suspected <b>doper</b> by MP Jesse Norman during a parliamentary inquiry into blood doping. In response, Radcliffe issued a statement in which she [...] "categorically denied" [...] cheating in any form and said she has [...] "nothing to hide". Shortly afterwards, her three suspect test results were leaked, though Radcliffe still refused to release her complete blood-test history. In late November 2015, the IAAF declared that the accusation were [...] "based on the gross misinterpretation of incomplete data". The UK Anti Doping Agency, having received Radcliffe's blood test history via the IAAF, stated that [...] "UKAD has come to the same conclusion as the IAAF review that there is no case to answer". It is likely that the first suspicious off-score was caused by faulty equipment. The third suspicious off-score was the direct result of an altitude training trip in Kenya with Mo Farah and other British athletes.|$|E

40|$|There are {{systematic}} {{incentives to}} dope within {{the structure of}} sports tournaments. A simple decision theory model demonstrates {{the nature of these}} incentives and the circumstances in which they are particularly strong. From this model, some empirically testable hypotheses are derived. The most important one, that greater competition between athletes induces more doping, is corroborated by comparing the competitiveness and number of caught <b>dopers</b> in thirteen different athletic sports. The lack of other significant findings may be explained by the decisive role of competitiveness which is more powerful than all other effects and is also a central element of them. ...|$|R

If any change has been noted, the rider cannot race until the markers have returned to normal. Riders are interviewed and tested for illness or doping.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} has been to, through a {{quantitative}} content analysis and a qualitative text analysis, determine which meaning nationality is given in news reports in Swedish daily press, and how it creates the event as a scandal. Focusing on two major scandals in cross country skiing, articles from the Finnish scandal in Lahtis 2001 and the revealing of doped Russian skiers in 2016 has been analysed. The theoretical framework for the study has been Stuart Halls representation theory, the framing theory, and theories regarding media scandals and nationality. The results from the quantitative and qualitative analyses has been divided into four themes: Imagined communities, Us and them, Individual and corporate and Fallen star. The results show that nationality is given meaning through the creation of imagined communities. It creates a gap between us and them, a sense of the nations parting from each other in form of cultural and moral aspects. There is also a difference between the representation of the countries. In the Russian doping scandal, Russia is considered as a doped nation, with a systematic doping where little guilt is to be put on the skiers themselves. In Finland, the nation stands for the people and is not in any ways {{to be associated with the}} doping scandal. Instead, the skiers get all the blame and little notion is made about the doping as being organised. This has also made the scandals to be divided into individual or corporate doping. As for the framing of the event as a scandal, attributes as “cheating” and a portrayal of the skiers as fallen stars is represented. By revealing the names of the suspected <b>dopers</b> it increases the news worth. An unexpected outcome was that the Russian <b>dopers</b> was not mentioned by name as often as the Finnish, which could enhance the event as a scandal even more. Furthermore, doping scandals could be studied in many different ways and is an interesting subject to immerse oneself in...|$|R

40|$|Orthopositronium (o-Ps) {{formation}} and decay can replace the annihilation process, when a positron interacts in liquid scintillator media. The delay {{induced by the}} positronium decay represents either a potential signature for antineutrino detection, via inverse Î² decay, or to identify and suppress positron background, as recently demonstrated by the Borexino experiment. The formation probability and decay time of o-Ps depend strongly on the surrounding material. In this paper, we characterize the o-Ps properties in liquid scintillators as function of concentrations of gadolinium, lithium, neodymium, and tellurium <b>dopers</b> used by present and future neutrino experiments. In particular, gadolinium and lithium are high neutron cross section isotopes, widely used in reactor antineutrino experiments, while neodymium and tellurium are double Î² decay emitters, employed to investigates the Majorana neutrino nature.
