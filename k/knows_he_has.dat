One of his former {{tactical}} trainees from Quantico, Liz Warner has proclaimed to this and, after Colby confided in her {{that he made a}} mistake, she told him that the very fact that he still remains on Don's team means something. She also said that Don never spoke of his personal life while at the FBI Academy and was at the time fresh from the field in hunting fugitives (with friend Agent Cooper).

500|$|... "Big Two-Hearted River", the {{concluding}} and climactic piece, details Nick's return from war. In it Nick <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> left his needs behind; Debra Moddelmog highlights {{how all of}} the Nick storylines, {{and most of the}} others in the collection, are about a [...] "flight from pain". She believes that Gertrude Stein's definition of the Lost Generation applies to In Our Time as much, if not more so, as to The Sun Also Rises; that [...] "Nick seems to believe that the things most worth having and caring about– life, love, ideals, companions, peace, freedom– will be lost sooner or later, and he is not sure how to cope with this assurance, except through irony, bitterness, and, sometimes, wishful thinking." [...] In the last story he learns {{to come to terms with}} the loss of his friends, and acknowledges [...] "all the loss he has experienced in the last few years and, equally important, the loss he has come to expect." ...|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{began to}} play out {{on-screen}} in February 2011, describing how it starts to develop and the effects it has on Gilly, {{a spokesperson for the}} serial told Inside Soap: [...] "She runs into Gilly who's also got relationship problems,. The drink starts to flow, and one thing leads to another... Gilly consumed with guilt over sleeping with his best friend's girlfriend, it doesn't help that Jacqui leaves Gilly's place while he's asleep - and runs into Rhys. But after Gilly wakes up, he <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to tell his mate what he's done. When Gilly confesses, Rhys is both furious and hurt, and lashes out violently. [...] Once he's confronted Gilly, he demands an explanation from Jacqui - and is stunned when she tells him she was actually raped, it's absolutely devastating." [...] The storyline later takes another turn when Gilly confronts Jacqui in the village with everyone watching, leading everyone to doubt if he did commit the act or not.|$|E

500|$|Tyrion is intelligent, witty, well-read, {{and shares}} his father's skill for {{business}} and political maneuvering. Grossman describes the character as [...] "a bitter, cynical, high-born dwarf", calling him [...] "Martin's Falstaff". David Orr of The New York Times notes Tyrion to be [...] "a cynic, a drinker, an outcast and conspicuously the novels' most intelligent presence". As an outcast, he displays sympathy for other outcasts and the otherwise mistreated; the TV series version of the character commiserates with the illegitimate son of Ned Stark by saying [...] "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes." [...] Still, he is usually seen for his deformities and vices, rather than his virtues and good deeds. Tom Shippey of the Wall Street Journal points out that other characters underestimate Tyrion: [...] "His dwarf-status acts {{as a kind of}} protection, because—though he is probably the most intelligent character in the whole cast list—no one takes him seriously." [...] Acknowledging that Tyrion's wit, humor and cunning are his survival mechanism, actor Dinklage told The New York Times that [...] "He <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no skills with the sword and this is a world that is really deeply violent. Military rules. He {{would not be able to}} survive in that world, given his own strength. So he beats people to the punchline—he's entertaining." ...|$|E
500|$|In late June, {{the three}} Republican Representatives from Wisconsin commented on Thompson's campaign. Though Representative Tom Petri {{identified}} himself as a supporter and hailed Thompson for doing [...] "a lot {{for the country and}} the state and the Republican Party of Wisconsin" [...] he called Thompson [...] "a long shot" [...] and stopped short of endorsing him. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner described Thompson's campaign as [...] "anemic" [...] and Representative Paul Ryan commented that [...] "I think {{a lot of us are}} hoping the best for Tommy and are wishing him well but are just sort of watching the field to see how it materializes." [...] Other Republicans wondered if Thompson was running just to [...] "get it out of his system." [...] Strategist Mark Graul argued that the former governor [...] "had a profound impact" [...] on party members in Wisconsin, which had created a familiarity complex that caused people to say [...] "'Oh, come on'" [...] after hearing of his run. Despite the qualms, spokesman Steve Grubbs remarked that Thompson wants [...] "for people to give him a chance... he <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a lot to prove, and he is working 90 hours a week to prove it." [...] A Strategic vision poll of Iowa voters placed Thompson in fifth place among the candidates, with only 6 percent support. To improve his standing ahead of the Ames Straw Poll, Thompson planned to escalate his Iowa campaign after July 4 in a swing labeled the [...] "Common Sense Solutions Tour". Communications director Rennick Remley remarked that despite low amounts of capital, Thompson would spend [...] "scads of time in Iowa in July." [...] He compared Thompson's strategy to Jimmy Carter's 1976 [...] "retail politics" [...] strategy that led to victory in the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
2500|$|To {{comply with}} the {{provisions}} of MLB's drug policy, Hamilton provides urine samples for drug testing {{at least three times}} per week. [...] Rangers' coach Johnny Narron says of the frequent testing: [...] "I think he looks forward to the tests. He knows he's an addict. He <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to be accountable. He looks at those tests as a way to reassure people around him who had faith." ...|$|E

2500|$|Achiria is {{referred}} to as simple allochiria and is the term proposed to show the failure to regard feelings of sidedness or handedness. [...] Achiria has sensory, motor, and introspective components. [...] For the sensory achiria, a stimulus applied to the affected part arouses no feeling of sidedness. [...] The stimulus is presented {{to the side of the}} body that the person with the disorder has no notion. [...] For the motor component, if a patient is asked to carry out any movement with the limb in question he is unable to do so unless is indicated in some other way than by the use of the words right and left. [...] Reason for this is that he has lost the knowledge of the meaning of these words either altogether or at all events when they are applied to limbs concerned. [...] For the introspective component a patient loses memory for feeling of part of the body that the stimulus is presented and declares that though he <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a part he cannot feel it.|$|E
2500|$|The Trial by bitter {{water is}} {{otherwise}} extremely rare in Western iconography, {{and this is}} one of the latest of the few Byzantine depictions. The legend comes from the apocryphal Protoevangelium of James and occurs, in the fully developed story, after the Dream of Joseph, in which an angel reassures Joseph who is disturbed to discover Mary's pregnancy, since he <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not slept with her. In the legend, others also notice the pregnancy and to dispel gossip and accusations, the priests of the Temple (where Mary had formerly been a temple maid) make the couple undergo the trial of drinking [...] "bitter water" [...] — their reaction to which will prove or disprove their innocence. [...] Naturally they pass. The idea of the trial is clearly based on Numbers 5, 11 ff. The legend was part of some Western medieval religious dramas, in which the [...] "detractors" [...] then drank the water, with horrible results. An example is the N-town Pageant series manuscript in the British Library, London (BL MS Cotton Vespasian D.8), which is mid-15th century from the East Midlands of England.|$|E
