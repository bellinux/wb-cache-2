5000|$|Unlike basic readers, IP readers do {{not require}} control panels and operate independently. A basic reader simply sends card numbers to a panel and does not control an <b>electric</b> <b>lock,</b> door contact or exit button. If the control panel fails, the basic reader stops working. An IP reader has inputs for {{monitoring}} a door contact, exit button and a relay for controlling an <b>electric</b> <b>lock.</b> It also has internal memory for storing the database of users, configuration parameters and recording events. Such readers are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "intelligent readers" [...] or [...] "readers with built-in controllers".|$|E

50|$|An {{electronic}} / digital cylinder is a {{locking device}} which operates {{by means of}} electric current. Electric locks are sometimes stand-alone with an electronic control assembly mounted directly to the lock. More often electric locks are connected to an access control system.

50|$|A snap gun, {{also known}} as lock pick gun, pick gun, or <b>electric</b> <b>lock</b> pick, is a tool {{that can be used}} to force open a {{mechanical}} pin tumbler lock (a common type of cylinder lock) without using the key. A steel rod is inserted into the lock and the snap gun briefly fires the rod against all of the lock pins simultaneously, momentarily freeing the cylinder and enabling it to be turned using a tension wrench. The snap gun is an alternative to a conventional lockpick, which requires other techniques such as raking to free the pins.|$|E

A few of these features are closed circuits with security cameras, additional gates in conjunction with the main gate, electronic keycards and keypads, security guards.|$|R
50|$|An {{access control}} point {{can be a}} door, turnstile, parking gate, elevator, or other {{physical}} barrier, where granting access can be electronically controlled. Typically, the access point is a door. An electronic access control door can contain several elements. At its most basic, there is a stand-alone <b>electric</b> <b>lock.</b> The lock is unlocked by an operator with a switch. To automate this, operator intervention {{is replaced by a}} reader. The reader could be a keypad where a code is entered, it could be a card reader, or it could be a biometric reader. Readers do not usually make an access decision, but send a card number to an access control panel that verifies the number against an access list. To monitor the door position a magnetic door switch can be used. In concept, the door switch is not unlike those on refrigerators or car doors. Generally only entry is controlled, and exit is uncontrolled. In cases where exit is also controlled, a second reader is used {{on the opposite side of}} the door. In cases where exit is not controlled, free exit, a device called a request-to-exit (REX) is used. Request-to-exit devices can be a push-button or a motion detector. When the button is pushed, or the motion detector detects motion at the door, the door alarm is temporarily ignored while the door is opened. Exiting a door without having to electrically unlock the door is called mechanical free egress. This is an important safety feature. In cases where the lock must be electrically unlocked on exit, the request-to-exit device also unlocks the door.|$|E
40|$|Have you {{encountered}} {{problems when}} you are unlocking a door? Perhaps you have had your hands full when you needed to unlock the door? Or, you might be suffering from a disease and have difficulties to put force on to small objects. To solve these problems there are different options. The most common alternative is a key button. With the key button, {{you do not need}} turn the pinion to unlock. However, many people experience {{that there are a lot}} of steps to follow, before you are through the door. The idea to decrease the amount of steps before exiting the door grew and the project team developed a new solution, Senceif. Senceif is a modern and innovative product that simplifies the unlocking and opening a door with an <b>electric</b> <b>lock...</b>|$|E
40|$|Finite state {{machines}} (FSMs) {{are widely used}} {{as a mean to}} model the behavior of systems and/or processes, but they are not supported by general purpose programming languages. To avoid implementations that are difficult to develop, and mostly maintain, frameworks have been developed for the FSM domain. Ideally, frameworks should be easy to learn and use, and provide as much support as possible. They should also enforce design rules, while keeping flexibility. However, there are tradeoffs between these aspects, and thus a balance must be found. Object-oriented frameworks that we have found in the literature do not meet this set of characteristics, but one stands out. We discuss its use to develop an example application (<b>electric</b> <b>lock</b> control), demonstrating important limitations. Based on that analysis, we propose a new framework that is small, efficient, and provides a powerful set of features for implementing FSMs. The framework is easy to learn and use, fully supports both Mealy and Moore machines, enables semantically correct state minimization, and offers conditional transitions.

5000|$|Unlike IP readers, most IP {{controllers}} do {{not support}} PoE. This, however, may change if the PoE technology is improved to deliver more power, or low-power controllers and locks are introduced. Based on the current PoE standards power that can be carried by a single network cable is enough for one IP reader and an electric strike or a magnetic lock, but connecting an IP controller and 2 or more <b>electric</b> <b>locks</b> would require more power than available via PoE.|$|R
5000|$|Spoofing locking {{hardware}} {{is fairly}} simple and more elegant than levering. A strong magnet can operate the solenoid controlling bolts in <b>electric</b> <b>locking</b> hardware. Motor locks, {{more prevalent in}} Europe than in the US, are also susceptible to this attack using a doughnut shaped magnet. It is also possible to manipulate the power to the lock either by removing or adding current, although most Access Control systems incorporate battery back-up systems and the locks are almost always located on the secure side of the door.|$|R
40|$|Physical keys {{made from}} metal or woods {{have been used}} for centuries to operate locks. The {{routines}} for operating a lock did not change significantly by the time. Keys have been carried, stored, lost, searched, lent, and copied. The main intent of locking is making sure that the belongings are kept safe. Hence, security has always been main consideration. Although mechanical Lock Access Control Systems are easy and cost effective to implement, they are insecure and expensive to maintain. Traditional Digital Lock Access Control systems may decrease the problems of mechanical lock access control systems. However, they are still vulnerable to attacks and the costs are usually high. Smart Lock Access Control Systems decrease the security risks and costs caused by fetching, storing, and carrying the physical keys. They also enable distribution of access rights and monitoring activities online. Smart lock solutions are cost effective to implement since they use existing wireless Internet structure (such as home WiFi) and electric locks. A typical Smart Lock Access Control System includes three components: a lock controller which is a microcontroller for operating the <b>electric</b> <b>lock,</b> cloud servers for granting access to the users and monitor activities, and finally a mobile phone which is used as a gateway between the cloud servers and lock controller. This thesis work designs and implements an Android Library for smart phones which will be included in mobile applications to communicate with the lock controller and cloud servers of the system...|$|E

The power levers should have prevented to move from flight idle to ground idle during flight by the function of <b>Electric</b> Magnetic <b>Lock</b> Systems and Mechanical Power Lever Stop Slot. At the accident aircraft {{was found that the}} <b>electric</b> magnetic <b>lock</b> system (Power Lever lock) was on open position. With power lever lock on open position, the solenoid of the <b>electric</b> magnetic <b>lock</b> system disengage and allow the power lever moves to ground idle in flight whenever the mechanical power lever stop slots lifted. Based on simulator test conducted by the NTSC, if the engine entered this condition, the aircraft would lose lift and eventually descended rapidly. The movement of power lever to ground idle will result to the propeller pitch angle changes to low pitch angle which produces significant drag. The NTSC stated that because it happened on 112 ft, it was impossible to not crash.|$|R

5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock, magnetic lock, or maglock is a {{locking device}} {{that consists of}} an electromagnet and an armature plate. There are two main types of <b>electric</b> <b>locking</b> devices. Locking devices can be either [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "fail secure". A fail-secure locking device remains locked when power is lost. Fail-safe locking devices are unlocked when de-energized. Direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail-safe. Typically the electromagnet portion of the lock {{is attached to the}} door frame and a mating armature plate is attached to the door. The two components are in contact when the door is closed. When the electromagnet is energized, a current passing through the electromagnet creates a magnetic flux that causes the armature plate to attract to the electromagnet, creating a locking action. Because the mating area of the electromagnet and armature is relatively large, the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress.|$|R
