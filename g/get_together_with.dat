[...] Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The scope of the 'toon espionage-adventure goings-on is surprisingly limited.

[...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "It's a credit that the writing can be so funny in the moment, that it takes time to realize there's no cohesive story, zero dramatic tension and nary a practical lesson for either the characters in the film or the people watching in the theater." ...|$|E
