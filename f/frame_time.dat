40|$|The {{success of}} many knowledge-intensive {{industries}} depends on creative projects that {{lie at the}} heart of their logic of production. The temporality of such projects, however, is an issue that is insufficiently understood. To address this, we study the perceived <b>time</b> <b>frame</b> of teams that work on creative projects and its effects on project dynamics. An experiment with 267 managers assigned to creative project teams with varying <b>time</b> <b>frames</b> demonstrates that compared to creative project teams with a relatively longer <b>time</b> <b>frame,</b> project teams with a shorter <b>time</b> <b>frame</b> focus more on the immediate present, are less immersed in their task, and utilize a more heuristic mode of information processing. Furthermore, we find that <b>time</b> <b>frame</b> moderates the negative effect of team conflict on team cohesion. These results are consistent with our theory that the temporary nature of creative projects shapes different <b>time</b> <b>frames</b> among project participants, and that it is this <b>time</b> <b>frame</b> that is an important predictor of task and team processes...|$|R
