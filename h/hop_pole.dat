25|$|The ward {{boundaries}} {{were reviewed}} in 2000 {{and resulted in}} two notable changes to Beeston's western boundary. In the northwest, Beeston Cemetery and the residential streets immediately surrounding it (to the south of Derby Road) such as Coniston Road and Windermere Road, {{as well as the}} Nuseryman pub and the eastern part of Beeston Fields Golf Course, were transferred to the Bramcote ward. Beeston did however gain some territory from Chilwell, including residential streets such as Park Road, Grove Avenue and Cumberland Avenue, as well as Central College and the small industrial area between Holly Lane and Wilmot Lane. The original boundary between the old Beeston and Chilwell parishes can still be identified by the change in road name {{at the site of the}} <b>Hop</b> <b>Pole</b> pub, from Chilwell Road (on the Beeston side) to High Road (on the Chilwell side).|$|E

50|$|The FE.2 escort's {{observer}} also downed an Albatros, while Jourdan {{accounted for}} another; one German fell aflame, the other {{fell in a}} slow spinning dive. The escort then broke up under fire from a single Albatros; the British observer was killed in action, and the pilot wounded. Hartney attempted to battle the attacker, {{only to discover that}} his own FE.2 suffered from a snapped-off propeller blade and broken flying wires and was incapable of fighting. The Canadian ace had to shut down the engine and dead-stick to a crashlanding in a Belgian field picketed with <b>hop</b> <b>poles.</b> After impact, he found himself lying under the 775 pounds of the FE.2's engine. Australian troops trying to lift it free dropped it back on him.|$|R

5000|$|In 1872 Knight {{developed}} a steam powered Hops digging machine. A rival designer, Frank Proctor, stated in an 1890 {{edition of the}} weekly magazine [...] "Engineering" [...] that [...] "Mr Knight has undoubtedly earned {{the distinction of being}} one of the early pioneers in the system of steam digging". He had begun developing his first digging machine in 1872, specifically for working in hopfields, which are difficult to cultivate due to the incidence of the <b>hop</b> <b>poles</b> which support the strings up which the plants climb. [...] "Digging by Steam" [...] by Colin Tyler (published in 1977 by Argus Books Ltd) devotes a chapter to hop digging machines, many of which were designed and built by Knight, and which are illustrated with drawings or photos.|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Indigenous people in the Pacific Slope—California, Oregon, and Washington—worked in the hops industry. After the Civil War, the {{cultivation}} of hops, one of the principal ingredients used to make beer, moved from the Midwest to California, Oregon, and Washington to take advantage of developing urban transportation networks, a long growing season, and good soils. Native workers erected <b>hop</b> <b>poles,</b> trained vines, picked hops, and transported the crop to urban distribution centers. In return for their labor, Native peoples earned cash wages, which they used to compensate for poorly provisioned reservations. In addition to earning cash wages, Indigenous people used hop picking to establish credentials for leaders, participate in social activities banned on reservations, and create kinship bonds. Hops and the food product it made—beer—were not used to undermine American Indian power on the Pacific Slope; American Indians used hops and beer to reclaim what had been lost during the colonization of the Pacific Slope and to articulate their sovereignty...|$|R

50|$|The late 1970s mod revival {{combined}} {{musical and}} cultural {{elements of the}} 1970s pub rock, punk rock and new wave music genres with influences from 1960s mod and beat music bands such as The Who, Small Faces and The Kinks. The revival was largely spurred on by the band The Jam, who had adopted a stark mod look and mixed the energy of punk {{with the sound of}} 1960s mod bands. Their debut album In the City (1977), mixed R&B standards with originals modelled on The Who's early singles. They confirmed their status as the leading mod revival band with their third album All Mod Cons (1978), on which Paul Weller's song-writing drew heavily on the British-focused narratives of the Kinks. The revival was also spurred on by small concerts at venues such as the Cambridge and <b>Hop</b> <b>Poles</b> Hotels, and Howard Hall Enfield, the Wellington, Waterloo Road, London, and the Bridge House in Canning Town. In 1979, the film Quadrophenia, which romanticised the original 1960s mod subculture, widened the impact and popularity of the mod revival across the UK. The original mod revival fanzine, Maximum Speed started in 1979 and spawned other home-produced fanzines from then until the mid-to-late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Sometime between 7 pm and 8 pm Fanny {{had still}} not {{returned}} home, prompting Harriet Adams {{and a group}} of neighbours to search for her missing child. As the evening was setting the group began the search in The Hollow, to no success. In the nearby hop garden, however, labourer Thomas Gates (a Crimean War veteran who partook in the famous Charge of the Light Brigade) found the head of Fanny Adams stuck on two <b>hop</b> <b>poles</b> while he was tending to the crops. An ear had been severed from the head which had two large cuts, from mouth to ear across the temple. Further investigation discovered the remains of the child; the head, arms and legs were separated from the trunk. There were three incisions {{on the left side of}} the chest, and a deep cut on the left arm, dividing her muscles. Fanny's forearm was cut off at the elbow joint, and her left leg nearly severed off at the hip joint with her left foot cut off at the ankle point. Her right leg was torn from the trunk, and the whole contents of her pelvis and chest completely removed. Five further incisions had been made on the liver, the heart cut out, and vagina missing. Both of her eyes were cut out and found in the nearby River Wey.|$|R
50|$|The {{adjoining}} {{villages and}} a town {{are in the}} Lincolnshire fens near the River Welland, some 8 {{miles to the north}} of Peterborough and 10 miles or so east of Stamford. The area is just north of the Peterborough border. The Deepings include: Deeping St James, Deeping St Nicholas, Market Deeping and West Deeping. Frognall, Stowgate, <b>Hop</b> <b>Pole</b> and Tongue End are all within the various civil parishes.|$|E
50|$|The 2nd Battalion’s eagle {{was lost}} in action at Mohrungen on 25 January 1807. The regiment’s colonel lied to Napoleon {{and was able to}} conceal the loss because actual eagle had been broken from its {{pedestal}} in an accident. This was hastily mounted on a <b>hop</b> <b>pole.</b> Napoleon later learned the truth from the Russian gazettes. According to the Russian sources this captured flag may have carried the 1802 pattern silk.|$|E
50|$|The A1175 then, {{whatever}} {{it might be}} called, leaves the Deeping bypass, still as single carriageway, and passes through the villages of <b>Hop</b> <b>Pole,</b> and Deeping St Nicholas, before crossing the Peterborough-Spalding railway line on an oblique level crossing at the former Littleworth railway station at TF208152. The route the continues roughly North East past isolated farmhouses until the end of Deeping fen at the North Drove Drain, TF233189.|$|E
50|$|Tewkesbury claims Gloucestershire's oldest public house, the Black Bear, {{dating from}} 1308, {{although}} this is currently closed and for sale with its future as a pub in doubt. Other notable buildings are the Royal <b>Hop</b> <b>Pole</b> Hotel in Church Street (which has recently {{been converted into a}} part of the Wetherspoons pub chain with the discovery of a former medieval banqueting hall in the structure), mentioned in Charles Dickens' The Pickwick Papers, the Bell Hotel, a large half-timbered structure opposite the Abbey gateway, and the House of the Nodding Gables in the High Street.|$|E
50|$|In 1885 Messrs E G Browne and J C Margetson {{acquired}} a cloth mill, known as Avon Mill, {{on the banks}} of the River Avon at Limpley Stoke. The previous owners of the mill had originally been timber merchants, but had later diversified into the production of rubber goods. By 1890 the business had transferred to premises in Melksham and later became Avon Rubber. The village has two public houses, one of which, The <b>Hop</b> <b>Pole,</b> which dates from the 17th century, was used in the filming of The Remains of the Day with Anthony Hopkins.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{development}} of large commercial breweries in the UK, beer would have been brewed on the premises from which it was sold. Alewives would put out a sign—a <b>hop</b> <b>pole</b> or ale-wand—to show when their beer was ready. The medieval authorities {{were more interested in}} ensuring adequate quality and strength of the beer than discouraging drinking. Gradually men became involved in brewing and organised themselves into guilds such as the Brewers Guild in London of 1342 and the Edinburgh Society of Brewers in 1598; as brewing became more organised and reliable many inns and taverns ceased brewing for themselves and bought beer from these early commercial breweries.|$|E
50|$|Ollerton, {{originally}} {{known as}} Alreton or Allerton, meaning 'farm among the alders', is {{situated at the}} crossroads of the York to London, Worksop to Newark, and Lincoln to Mansfield roads. Due to its location, in mediaeval times the village became a meeting place for forest officials, commissioners and Justices of the Peace, leading to the development of its two coaching inns, The White Hart and The <b>Hop</b> <b>Pole.</b> For many years, the main occupation in Ollerton was hop growing - there were hop fields along the River Maun from as early as 1691 and a weekly hop market was held in the village on Fridays.|$|E
5000|$|From Stamford to Uffington {{the route}} lies across the gently {{rolling hills of}} Upper Lincolnshire limestone, save where the Gwash has cut a valley down the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone. After Uffington, through Tallington {{to the end of}} the Deeping bypass at Littleworth, the terrain is flatter, {{described}} as river terrace sands and gravels overlying the mudstones of the Kellaway and Oxford clay formations. From <b>Hop</b> <b>Pole</b> onwards, Deeping Fen is formed of tidal zone deposits less than 2 million years old, over the same Oxford clays. This is the true fen, once brackish marsh until drained between the 16th and 19th centuries. [...] At Stamford the road is close to the 50m contour, falling to 22m at Uffington, 11m at West Deeping, and with spotheights of 2m or 3m across Deeping fen to the A16, rising only to cross the Welland Bridge.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} English country estates {{were used as}} {{locations}} for the film, partly owing to the persuasive power of Ismail Merchant, {{who was able to}} cajole permission for the production to borrow various houses not normally open to the public. Among them was Dyrham Park for the exterior {{of the house and the}} driveway, Powderham Castle (staircase, hall, music room, bedroom), the interior of which was used for the aqua-turquoise stairway scenes, Corsham Court (library and dining room) and Badminton House (servants' quarters, conservatory, entrance hall). Luciana Arrighi, the production designer, scouted most of these locations. Scenes were also shot in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, which stood in for Clevedon. The pub, where Mr Stevens stays, is the <b>Hop</b> <b>Pole</b> in Limpley Stoke; the shop featured is also in Limpley Stoke. The pub where Miss Kenton and Mr Benn meet is the George Inn, Norton St Philip.|$|E
5000|$|To {{the west}} of Beeston Rylands lies the Attenborough ward; while the Chilwell East ward lies to {{the west of}} Beeston West.

Catherine’s sketches were compiled by her sister Sarah. E. E. Mitchell. Derived from her own collection, from those of friends and relations, and from John Ball, Kate's husband, they were compiled sometime between 1928 and 1933. The sketches are mounted in an album, together with: locks of Kate's hair on red silk; a pressed fern arrangement; a coloured photograph of John and Catherine Ball; and coloured views of Buckland Churchyard in 1850, showing the grave of Paul Thomas Mitchell, aged 3 days, and in 1879 showing the grave of Catherine Penwarne Ball.
