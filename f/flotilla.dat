5|$|Upon {{commissioning}} in 1932–33, the D class {{formed the}} 1st Destroyer <b>Flotilla</b> {{assigned to the}} Mediterranean Fleet. The <b>flotilla</b> toured the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea in September–November 1933. After refitting in the UK during 1934, the <b>flotilla</b> {{was transferred to the}} China Station, arriving at Hong Kong in January 1935 and renumbered as the 8th Destroyer <b>Flotilla.</b> Most of the <b>flotilla</b> was sent to the Red Sea during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935–36. They returned to the Hong Kong in mid-1936 and remained there until World War II began. Diamond {{was in the midst of}} a refit that lasted until November, but the rest of the <b>flotilla</b> was immediately transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. Daring was kept in the Red Sea for escort duties until November, but the rest of the <b>flotilla</b> was used on contraband patrol duties upon arrival. They all needed repairs which were made before the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of {{training}} with the 8th U-boat <b>Flotilla,</b> based at Königsberg in the Baltic Sea, U-255 {{was transferred to the}} 11th U-boat <b>Flotilla,</b> based at Bergen, Western Norway, for front-line service on 1 July 1942.|$|E
5|$|Both Boadicea and Bellona {{began their}} careers with {{destroyer}} flotillas of the First Fleet, Boadicea as senior officers' ship for the 1st Destroyer <b>Flotilla</b> and Bellona with the 2nd Destroyer <b>Flotilla.</b> The former {{was transferred to}} the 3rd Destroyer <b>Flotilla</b> in mid-1912 and the sisters were transferred to the 2nd and the 1st Battle Squadrons, respectively, of the First Fleet in 1913. Both ships were assigned to positions at the rear of their squadrons and did not fire their guns during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916.|$|E
50|$|Minesweeper <b>flotillas</b> were {{considered}} administrative units, operating from shore offices, {{and did not}} maintain a standard flagship {{as was the case}} with the destroyer <b>flotillas.</b> The standard rank for a minesweeper <b>flotillas</b> commander was that of Korvettenkapitän.|$|R
50|$|Two eight ship <b>flotillas</b> (9th and 10th Emergency <b>Flotillas)</b> {{launched}} during 1943 and 1944. None were lost.|$|R

5|$|Fearless was {{converted}} into a submarine depot ship shortly afterwards and briefly deployed to Russia later in the year. She later became the <b>flotilla</b> leader of the 12th Submarine <b>Flotilla</b> (SF), initially based in Scapa Flow, but later in Rosyth. In early 1918, she accidentally rammed and sank one submarine from a different <b>flotilla</b> {{as part of an}} incident that sardonically {{came to be known as}} the Battle of May Island. The ship survived the war and was sold for scrap in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Hichens {{was next}} {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 8th MGB <b>Flotilla.</b> These new boats were armed with a twin Oerlikon mount aft, a QF 2-pounder Mark XIV forward, twin Lewis or later twin Vickers machine guns {{either side of the}} bridge and depth charges. The <b>flotilla</b> was moved to Dartmouth, Devon in July 1942. The first action they were involved in was during the night of 14/15 July. Ordered to engage E Boats using Cherbourg as a base they found a convoy of naval trawlers escorting a small tanker. The <b>flotilla</b> engaged the two rear escort trawlers and carried out a depth charge attack. The tanker was last seen to be on fire as the <b>flotilla</b> reformed off Alderney. After this action Hichens was awarded a Bar to his DSO. Both the DSO and the Bar were presented during the same investiture at Buckingham Palace on 22 September 1942, while other members of the <b>flotilla</b> were awarded a Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and four MIDs for the action.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1941 U-37 was {{reassigned to}} the 26th U-boat <b>Flotilla,</b> based at Pillau (now Baltiysk, Russia) as a {{training}} U-boat. She {{was transferred to}} the 22nd U-boat <b>Flotilla,</b> based at Gotenhafen (now Gdynia, Poland) on 1 April 1942, and finally to the 4th U-boat <b>Flotilla</b> on 1 July 1944, where she remained {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
50|$|The Port minesweepers were {{organised}} {{into their own}} <b>flotillas.</b> Eleven new Castle-class minesweepers joined the Port <b>flotillas</b> on completion, 1943-1944.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the standard minesweeper <b>flotillas,</b> twenty [...] "auxiliary minesweeper" [...] (R boat) <b>flotillas</b> (Räumboots-Flottille) were formed during the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|The Self-Defense Fleet, {{headquartered}} at Yokosuka, {{consists of}} the JMSDF's military shipping. It is composed of four Escort <b>Flotillas</b> (based in Yokosuka, Sasebo, Maizuru and Kure), the Fleet Air Force headquartered at Atsugi, two Submarine <b>Flotillas</b> based at Kure and Yokosuka, two Mine-sweeping <b>Flotillas</b> based at Kure and Yokosuka and the Fleet Training Command at Yokosuka.|$|R
5|$|Pelorus {{was named}} after Pelorus Jack, a Risso's dolphin that often escorted ships through French Pass in New Zealand. The ship was ordered on 1 January 1942 from Lobnitz of Renfrew, Scotland and laid down on 8 October. She was {{launched}} on 18 June 1943 and completed two months later on 7 October. The ship {{was assigned to the}} newly formed 7th Minesweeping <b>Flotilla</b> upon completion and served as the <b>flotilla</b> leader. The <b>flotilla</b> was tasked with clearing mines off the east coast of England until June 1944 when they were assigned to sweep the minefields protecting Juno Beach during the Normandy landings. Pelorus led the <b>flotilla</b> on 6 June and was thus the leading ship of the entire invasion fleet. While sweeping the approaches to Cherbourg, she struck a mine that damaged the port engine and propeller. The ship was under repair for three months and was transferred to the 6th Minesweeping <b>Flotilla</b> at Plymouth when they were completed.|$|E
5|$|The Riverine and Lake Forces of the KJRM were {{headquartered}} on the Danube {{river in}} Novi Sad, and were organised into the River <b>Flotilla</b> and three Lake Detachments. Each {{division of the}} River <b>Flotilla</b> except the Monitor Division included one or more mobilised customs motorboats.|$|E
5|$|U-44 had a {{very short}} {{operational}} life. During her service with the Kriegsmarine, she took part in only two combat patrols. After training exercises with the 6th U-boat <b>Flotilla</b> from 4 November to 31 December 1939, U-44 was assigned as the front boat for the 2nd U-boat <b>Flotilla</b> on 1 January 1940. She was to remain {{a part of this}} <b>flotilla</b> until her loss.|$|E
50|$|The Kriegsmarine {{authorized}} twenty five Schnellboot <b>flotillas</b> for formation {{during the}} Second World War, of which fourteen were eventually established. The German Navy also maintained an attack boat training division (Schnellboots-Lehr-Division) consisting of four training <b>flotillas.</b> In November 1943, the 3rd, 7th, 21st, 22nd, and 24th S-boat <b>flotillas</b> were consolidated into the 1st S-Boat Division (1. Schnellbootsdivision).|$|R
5000|$|During the Second World War, the Kriegsmarine {{authorized}} {{the formation of}} ten <b>flotillas</b> for the [...] "auxiliary destroyers", or German torpedo boats. The torpedo boat <b>flotillas</b> were formed from preexisting commands of the Reichsmarine, known as Torpedobootsflottille, several {{of which had been}} founded during or before World War I. Of the ten authorized World War II torpedo boat <b>flotillas,</b> nine were commissioned (8.Torpedobootsflottille was authorized but never formed).|$|R
5000|$|In March of 1943, the Kriegsmarine {{overhauled}} {{the escort}} <b>flotillas</b> {{and ordered the}} formation of five new <b>flotillas</b> (1 through 5 Geleitflottille) utilizing foreign boats of the Torpedoboot Ausland program, [...] "G class" [...] auxiliary patrol ships, as well as auxiliary cutter ships designated by hull number [...] "SG". The original F class escort ships were interspersed into the new <b>flotillas,</b> with the bulk of these ships assigned to the 5. Geleitflottille.|$|R
5|$|When Robert Hichens was {{appointed}} senior officer {{in command of}} the 6th MGB <b>Flotilla</b> from September 1941, he became the first RNVR officer to command a <b>flotilla</b> in the Second World War. Along with the new command came a promotion to lieutenant commander.|$|E
5|$|After the 6th U-boat <b>Flotilla</b> was disbanded in December 1939, U-43 was {{assigned}} to the 2nd U-boat <b>Flotilla</b> based in Wilhelmshaven. U-43 departed from there on 13 March 1940 and sailed along the coast of Norway, north of Scotland, and into the waters west of Ireland, but had no success. The First Watch Officer (second-in-command of the U-boat) Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Wilhelm Behrens fell overboard and was lost on 31 March. U-43 returned to Wilhelmshaven, after 25 days at sea, on 6 April.|$|E

50|$|Surface <b>flotillas</b> of the Kriegsmarine were {{organizational}} {{groupings of}} German naval vessels during World War II based on {{class of vessel}} and geographical location. Surface <b>flotillas</b> were not operationally deployed units, but functioned through the administrative command chain of the Kriegsmarine.|$|R
5|$|Akishio {{was laid}} down in Kobe by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries on 15 April 1983, {{launched}} on 22 January 1985, and commissioned on 5 March 1986. Upon being commissioned, on 5 March 1986, Akishio was immediately assigned to the 1st Submarine Squadron of the 1st Submarine <b>Flotilla</b> of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. On 8 June 1990, she was reassigned to the 5th Submarine Squadron, which was {{also part of the}} 1st Submarine <b>Flotilla.</b> Her crew was trained by American submariners, from September to October, in 1991.|$|E
5|$|All of the E {{class were}} {{assigned}} to the 5th Destroyer <b>Flotilla</b> (DF) of the Home Fleet upon commissioning during 1934. Following the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, the entire <b>flotilla</b> was sent to the Red Sea in August 1935 to monitor Italian warship movements until April 1936. Refitted upon their return, many were deployed to Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–39 to intercept shipping carrying contraband goods to Spain and to protect British-flagged ships. While the F-class ships {{were assigned to}} the 6th Destroyer <b>Flotilla</b> of the Home Fleet, they followed much the same pattern as their E-class sisters. In April 1939 the 5th and 6th DFs were renumbered the 7th and 8th Destroyer Flotillas, respectively. In mid-1939, newly-commissioned J-class destroyers began to replace the E-class ships and they were reduced to reserve for lack of manpower. Increasing tensions with Nazi Germany in August, caused the British to mobilize the Navy's reserves, which allowed the ships to be manned again and assigned to the 12th Destroyer <b>Flotilla</b> of the Home Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Although briefly {{a part of}} the Pola <b>Flotilla</b> at commissioning, UB-8 {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her German career patrolling the Black Sea as part of the Constantinople <b>Flotilla.</b> The U-boat sank two ships. One of them, , was disguised by the British Admiralty as a Royal Navy battlecruiser as part of a decoy operation. In October, she helped repel a Russian bombardment of Bulgaria.|$|E
50|$|Late in World War II, the German Navy began {{consolidating}} {{several types}} of harbor defense units, along with their associated <b>flotillas,</b> {{into a series of}} naval security divisions.

5|$|Duncan {{was ordered}} under the 1930 Naval Estimates on 2 February 1931 from Portsmouth Dockyard. She was laid down on 25 September 1931, {{launched}} on 7 July 1932 and finally commissioned into the Navy on 31 March 1933. Built as a <b>flotilla</b> leader, she displaced 25 long tons {{more than the}} rest of her class and carried an extra 30 personnel.
