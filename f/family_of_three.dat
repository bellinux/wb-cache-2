5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human.

In 2017, 14 people in California were poisoned, including an 18 month old who required a liver transplant. Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|E

5|$|As well as passengers, Nairana {{regularly}} carried cargo, including gold bullion, {{and live}} {{animals such as}} horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A Tasmanian devil being transported to Melbourne Zoo in a wooden crate placed {{in one of the}} ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a hole through its box, and was never seen again. In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY. Nairana was withdrawn from service in December 1935 {{as a result of a}} ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared Port Phillip Bay on 12 April 1936, on a clear day with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> who disappeared after being swept overboard.

5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of the poverty line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 for a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>three)</b> were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.|$|E
