40|$|Feedlot {{regulating}} {{authorities have}} proposed a pond seepage infiltration rate guideline of 1. 0 x 10 ^- 9 m/s (31. 54 mm/year) {{in an effort to}} control environmental degradation. This project aims to investigate the effect of the organic particulates in feedlot effluent upon physical pore blockage and a reduction in soil hydraulic conductivity (HC). Two soils, a heavy clay and clay loam were treated with four solutions, calcium chloride, synthetic effluent, filtered effluent and raw effluent, and the hydraulic conductivity was calculated over an extended time period. The soils were compacted to 98 % maximum dry density (MDD) to ensure the best chance at achieving the guideline infiltration rate. Hydraulic conductivity was calculated using a falling pressure head method. Calcium chloride application caused a slight increase in HC, likely due to an osmotic effect reducing the diffuse double layer. Synthetic effluent was compared against actual effluent, results showed actual effluent caused a much slower flow rate, from this observation it was concluded that accumulation of suspended solids was the major reason for a reduction in HC, not dispersion or swelling. The raw and filtered effluent samples were also compared and as expected the raw effluent produced a slower HC, due to the higher amount of total suspended solids (TSS) in the solution, although it was determined that particulate < 3 μm was primarily responsible for pore blockage. A reduction in TSS from the percolating solution to leachate meant that solid organic matter has accumulating within the soil profile. It was concluded that the organic particulate in feedlot effluent does contribute to pore blockage and a reduction in HC. Regarding the <b>guideline</b> <b>rate,</b> the heavy clay achieved this target after approximately 500 hours of leaching with a final HC of 9. 39 x 10 ^- 10 m/s. The clay loam was unable to reach this rate during the time period finishing with a HC of 1. 52 x 10 ^- 9. However, HC trends indicate that given time the clay loam HC could be expected to achieve the <b>guideline</b> <b>rate.</b> This potential for a large cost saving, due to negation of the requirement for expensive plastic liners to limit HC, was identified. This project provides the groundwork for a more comprehensive study, involving a wider range of soils and effluent sources, which have the potential to ensure the sustainable operation of beef feedlot ponds by restricting pond seepage through organic particulate pore blockage. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To assess {{adherence}} of the prescribing {{physicians in}} a private cancer care center to the American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline for antiemetic prophylaxis, in the first cycle of antineoplastic chemotherapy. Methods: A total of 139 chemotherapy regimens, of 105 patients, were evaluated retrospectively from 2011 to 2013. Results: We observed 78 % of non-adherence to the <b>guideline</b> <b>rate.</b> The main disagreements with the directive were the prescription of higher doses of dexamethasone and excessive use of 5 -HT 3 antagonist for low risk emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. On univariate analysis, hematological malignancies (p= 0. 005), the use {{of two or more}} chemotherapy (p= 0. 05) and high emetogenic risk regimes (p= 0. 012) were factors statistically associated with greater adherence to guidelines. Treatment based on paclitaxel was the only significant risk factor for non-adherence (p= 0. 02). By multivariate analysis, the chemotherapy of high emetogenic risk most correlated with adherence to guideline (p= 0. 05). Conclusion: We concluded that the adherence to guidelines is greater if the chemotherapy regime has high emetogenic risk. Educational efforts should focus more intensely on the management of chemotherapy regimens with low and moderate emetogenic potential. Perhaps the development of a computer generated reminder may improve the adherence to guidelines...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the rate of}} non-compliance to Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for screening of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and related factors in Siriraj Hospital. Study design: Descriptive cross-sectional study. Setting: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University. Material and Method: One-hundred-and-fifty-nine pregnant women at risk for GDM and who delivered at Siriraj Hospital were enrolled. Data were collected from history and medical records including base line characteristics, clinical risk factors of GDM, and compliance to <b>guideline.</b> <b>Rate</b> of non-compliance and related factors were evaluated. Results: The rate of non-compliance to GPG for screening of GDM at Siriraj Hospital was 22 % (95 %CI 16. 3 %- 29. 1 %). The rate was highest among women who had AnteNatal Care (ANC) at a private clinic (82. 1 %), followed by the private cases in the hospital (40 %). Those who received ANC at the hospital had the lowest non-compliance rate of 6. 6 %. The most common neglected risk factor was maternal age> 30 years. Significant higher compliance was found among women with 2 or more clinical risk factors compared to those with only 1 risk factor (p = 0. 028). Conclusion: The rate of non-compliance to CPG for screening of GDM at Siriraj Hospital was 22 %. Highest non-compliance rate was found among the private cases.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} {{on the type of}} early care provided to children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in low middle income countries. We benchmarked early prehospital [PH] and emergency department [ED] pediatric TBI care in Argentina. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from patients previously enrolled in a prospective seven center study of children with TBI. Eligible participants were patients 0 - 18 years, and had diagnosis of TBI (admission Glasgow Coma scale score [GCS] 0). Outcomes were transport type, transport time, PH and ED adherence to best practice, and discharge Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale (PCPC) and Pediatric Overall Performance category Scale (POPC). Of the 366 children, mean age was 8. 7 (5. 0) years, 58 % were male, 90 % had isolated TBI and 45. 4 % were transported by private vehicle. 50 (34. 7 %) of the 144 children with severe TBI (39. 3 % of all TBI patients) were transported by private vehicle. Most (267; 73 %) patients received initial TBI care at an index hospital prior to study center admission, including children with severe (81. 9 %) TBI. Transport times were shorter for those patients who were directly transported by ambulance to study center than for the whole cohort (1. 4 vs. 5. 5 hours). Ambulance blood pressure data were recorded in 30. 9 %. ED <b>guideline</b> adherence <b>rate</b> was higher than PH <b>guideline</b> adherence <b>rate</b> (84. 8 % vs. 26. 4 %).
