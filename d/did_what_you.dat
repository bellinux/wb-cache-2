Upon being introduced to Basehart by Cortese, Fellini invited the actor to lunch, at which he was offered the role of Il Matto. When asked why by the surprised Basehart, who had never before played {{the part of a}} clown, Fellini responded: [...] "Because, if you <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did in Fourteen Hours you can do anything." [...] A great success in Italy, the 1951 Hollywood drama starred Basehart as a would-be suicide on a hotel balcony. Basehart, too, had been greatly impressed by I Vitelloni, and agreed to take the role for much less than his usual salary, in part because he was very attracted by Fellini's personality, saying: [...] "It was his zest for living, and his humor." ...|$|E
