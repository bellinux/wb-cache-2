5000|$|After the {{outbreak}} of hostilities at the Battle of Jumonville Glen in Pennsylvania (May 28, 1754), Bemino was among those Indian leaders siding with the French against the English. Bemino {{is said to have}} led the attack in an ambush (the [...] "Battle of the Trough") of white settlers near Fort Pleasant, in what is now Hardy County, West Virginia, in March or April 1756. A one- or two-hour firefight left seven whites (out of about 18) dead as against three Indians (out of 60 or 70). At around the same time, Bemino and a small band apprehended Mr. Vincent Williams, a settler on Patterson's Creek, some 9 miles across Patterson Creek Mountain from Fort Pleasant. After besieging him in his home (and losing 5 of their party of 7), the Indians managed to kill him and quarter his body, hanging the four parts at the four corners of the log cabin, and impaling his head upon a <b>fence</b> <b>stake</b> at the front door.|$|E
50|$|Kersey and his {{daughter}} Carol, who is still catatonic, now live in Los Angeles because Paul accepted a deal from the NYPD to leave town so they wouldn't tell anyone {{that he was the}} vigilante. Paul now has a new woman in his life, KABC news reporter Geri Nichols. One day while he's out with Carol and Geri, he is mugged by a gang of five punks. Paul fights back, but they get away. The muggers go to his house, gag, rape, and murder Kersey's housekeeper, and kidnap and rape Carol. The assault brings her out of her coma and she tries to get away by jumping through the second story window, but she dies when she is impaled on an iron <b>fence</b> <b>stake.</b> Beside himself with grief and rage, Paul dedicates his life to avenging Carol. He rents a ratty hotel room under another name, and starts looking for the rapists. When the LAPD deduces that they have a vigilante on their hands, they decide to consult with the NYPD, who fear that Kersey is killing criminals again. They send Ochoa to deal with Kersey quietly; they fear that if he is caught he will reveal that the deal they made with him. The events mentioned above involving {{his daughter}}'s death take place in 1981 (as stated by Officer Reiner in Death Wish 4, Kersey's daughter died in 1981).|$|E

50|$|The {{sprawling}} prison complex {{was divided}} into compounds. The perimeter of the each compound was secured by a double barbed-wire fence, fifteen feet in height, on top of which ran a high-voltage wire. The space between the two fences was a tangled mass of barbed-wire. On the prisoners' side of the fence, a wire ran parallel with the <b>fence,</b> <b>staked</b> to the ground approximately ten feet from the fence, six to eight inches above the ground. Any man who stepped between the wire and the fence was shot on sight. Every so many yards along the fence was a guard tower, fully armed and manned.|$|R

50|$|Maritime hunting {{technology}} {{consisted of}} fishing spears, fishing boomerangs, fish-stunning poisons (bunjuda), nets made of massed grass sheaves (marukutju:n) shoved through waters to corner fish., and by building rock ponds <b>fenced</b> with <b>stakes</b> fashioned from mangrove wood, whose base was woven with spinifex to trap {{fish in the}} tidal outflows. The timing for hunting stingrays was signaled by the onset of nyalnyala blossoms from a guardo tree, which corresponded seasonally with the period of stingray fattening.|$|R

In front of the walls, a 9-foot (2.7 m) tall <b>stake</b> <b>fence</b> was used.|$|R
5000|$|In the Principality of Lüneburg, in {{addition}} to the chancery court and the courts at Amt level there existed numerous aristocratic patrimonial courts (Patrimonialgerichte), whose responsibilities were confined to the jurisdiction of specific groups of people and areas.

5000|$|A typical fence {{consists}} {{of a piece of}} synthetic filter fabric (also called a geotextile) stretched between a series of wooden or metal <b>fence</b> <b>stakes</b> along a horizontal contour level. The stakes are installed on the downhill side of the fence, and the bottom edge of the fabric can be trenched into the soil and backfilled on the uphill side, although it is quite difficult to move the trenched [...] "spoil" [...] from the downside to the upside of the trench. The design/placement of the silt fence should create a pooling of runoff, which then allows sedimentation to occur. Water can seep through the silt fence fabric, but the fabric often becomes [...] "blocked off" [...] with fine soil particles (all sediment-retention devices have this challenge, and none of them [...] "filter" [...] storm water for very long). A few hours after a storm event, the fabric can be [...] "disturbed" [...] in order to dislodge the fines, and allow clean water to flow through. Depending on the protected watershed and erosion, larger soil particles will settle out, ultimately filling the silt fence {{to the top of the}} structure; requiring another silt fence above or below it (creating a new ponding area), or for the silt fence to be removed, the sediment removed or spread out, and a new fence installed. The fence is not designed to concentrate or channel stormwater. The fence is installed on a site before soil disturbance begins, and is placed down-slope from the disturbance area.|$|R
50|$|Flowering is not common, {{and there}} are no seeds. Fruits are rare due to low pollen {{viability}} caused by irregular meiosis. At the interval of several decades, the whole population of an area blooms at once, and individual stems bear a large number of flowers. Vegetation propagates through clump division, by rhizome, stem and branch cutting, layering, and marcotting. The easiest and most practised cultivation method is culm or branch cutting. In the Philippines, the best results were obtained from one-node cuttings from the lower parts of six-month-old culms. When a stem dies, the clump usually survives. A clump can grow out of stem used for poles, <b>fences,</b> props, <b>stakes,</b> or posts. Its rhizomes extend up to 80 cm before turning upward to create open, fast-spreading clumps. The easy propagation of B. vulgaris explains its seemingly wild occurrence.|$|R
50|$|This tree {{responds}} {{very well}} to coppicing, which is still practised in Britain, and produces a good crop of tannin-rich wood every 12 to 30 years, depending on intended use and local growth rate. The tannin renders the young growing wood durable and resistant to outdoor use, thus suitable for posts, <b>fencing</b> or <b>stakes.</b> The wood is of light colour, hard and strong. It is used to make furniture, barrels (sometimes used to age balsamic vinegar), and roof beams notably in southern Europe (for example in houses of the Alpujarra, Spain, in southern France and elsewhere). The timber has a density of 560 kg per cubic meter, and due to its durability in ground contact is often used for external purposes such as fencing. It {{is also a good}} fuel, though not favoured for open fires as it tends to spit.|$|R

60|$|Late in {{the evening}} Archie's scouts brought in the news to Wallace that the English army was within three miles, and a {{consultation}} was at once held between the leaders. Most {{of them were in}} favour of a retreat; but Comyn of Badenoch, who had lately joined Wallace, and had been from his rank appointed to the command of the cavalry, with some of his associates, urged strongly the necessity for fighting, saying that the men would be utterly dispirited at such continual retreats, and that with such immensely superior cavalry the English would follow them up and destroy them. To these arguments Wallace, Sir John Grahame, and Sir John Stewart, yielded their own opinions, and prepared to fight. They took up their position so that their front was protected by a morass, and a <b>fence</b> of <b>stakes</b> and ropes was also fixed across so as to impede the advance or retreat of the English cavalry. The Scotch army consisted almost entirely of infantry. These were about a third the number of those of the English, while Comyn's cavalry were a thousand strong.|$|R
40|$|Timber {{preserved}} with Copper Chrome Arsenate (CCA) is {{ubiquitous in}} Australia. Wood, such as radiata pine, is treated with CCA {{to protect it}} from insects, rot and fungus. CCA-treated timber is commonly used on telegraph poles, decking, <b>fencing,</b> landscaping, vineyard <b>stakes,</b> picnic tables and in playgrounds. However the arsenic in CCA leaches out of CCA-treated timber and arsenic is toxic and can cause cancer in the long-term. There is a growing body of scientific evidence that timber treated with CCA poses a danger to both humans and the environment. As a result, authorities around the world are imposing tighter restrictions on its manufacture, use and disposal. This report investigates a range of concerns and issues surrounding its manufacture, use and disposal...|$|R

2500|$|In 1972, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began {{preparations}} for Running Fence: a fabric fence, supported by steel posts and steel cables, {{running through the}} landscape and leading into the sea. The fence was to be 5.5 meters high and 40 kilometers long and constructed in Sonoma and Marin Counties, California. For the project, 59 families of ranchers needed to be convinced and {{the permission of the}} authorities had to be obtained, so Christo and Jeanne-Claude hired nine lawyers. At the end of 1973, Christo and Jeanne-Claude marked the path of the <b>fence</b> with wooden <b>stakes.</b> On 29 April 1976, the work finally began after a long struggle against bureaucracy. Approximately 200,000 m2 of nylon fabric, 2050 steel posts and 145km of steel cable were needed. On 10 September 1976 the work was completed. However, Christo and Jeanne-Claude had to pay a $60,000 fine, because they lacked permission for the coastal region.|$|R

40|$|Cattle {{just love}} calliandra Calliandra calothyrsus is an {{extraordinarily}} versatile species. In April 2002, Spore wrote about its useful ability to release allelopathic or growth inhibiting compounds into the environment, which can reduce infestations of striga weed. In Uganda where dairy farmers were supplied with imported cows, calliandra {{is helping to}} solve another problem how to satisfy the bovine newcomers appetite for greenery without causing deforestation and erosion. Farmers found that a winning combination is zero-grazing with calliandra as high-octane fodder. Dina Twesase is one small-scale farmer who relies on this formula. She feeds her single Friesian cow with calliandra, which she began growing {{with the help of}} the Africare 2000 and the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). Farmers in the region have learned the benefits of planting C. calothyrsus in contour hedgerows to conserve soil and water, improve soil fertility, and obtain <b>fencing</b> materials, firewood, <b>stakes</b> and bee forage. But, as Dina has discovered, calliandra really scores as a source of protein for dairy cattle. A supplement of 3 kg of calliandra is equivalent to 1 kg of expensive commercial dairy meal. She grows the calliandra amongst her crops, avoiding the need to convert any of her small property to pasture. In return for the fancy diet, her cow produces 20 l of milk per day. Marvellous marula In parts of Africa, the marula tree is valued so highly that giving someone the seed kernel is considered a true sign of friendship. Its small golden fruit featured most memorably in Spore 90, which reported how elephants got tipsy when the berries fermented in their stomach. In its native southern Africa, the fruits of the marula tree (Schlerocarya birrea) are used to make a liqueur. More recently, producers have tuned into the potential of this valuable fruit which has four times more vitamin C than oranges as a basis for a whole range of other products. A community-based company in the Limpopo Province of South Africa makes fruit pulp, seed oil and skin conditioner from organic marula. Marula Natural Products Pty Ltd operates on fair trade principles and, as well as processing the fruit, acts as intermediary between African producers and export buyers. Cowpea Plants battle cowpea pests Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp., needs no introduction. Spore has written about this useful grain legume on many occasions, and ACP farmers prize the crop for its high protein levels, resistance to drought and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. But while the cowpea s virtues are well known, the plant does have a major drawback it is highly susceptible to pests and diseases, with losses of up to 90 %. Indeed, Spore has often examined this seemingly intractable problem. There are some encouraging signs, however. Scientists at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) have developed high-yielding varieties with resistance to major diseases, insect pests, nematodes and parasitic weeds. Varieties with resistance to parasitic weeds such as Striga are currently being tested in farmers' fields and early maturing varieties with increased drought and shade tolerance are also being developed. Meanwhile, cowpea producers in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal are learning how to make and use plant-based insecticides. Projet Niébé pour l Afrique (PRONAF) uses high-yielding varieties that are resistant to key pests, diseases and weeds including flower thrips (Megalurothrips sjostedti), pod borer (Maruca vitrata), storage weevils (Callosobruchus maculatus) and Striga combined with botanical insecticides, solar drying, and triple bagging storage techniques. Effective plant-based pesticides include pawpaw, neem and extracts from pepper and tobacco. The many uses of moringa Moringa oleifera, the oleaginous tree found in most tropical countries of Africa, Asia and America, is no stranger to the pages of Spore. It made its first appearance in Spore 19 when we wrote about its seeds, which offer an ecological solution to filtering and purifying water. Moringa is also a very generous tree of life. Its leaves, which are rich in vitamins, minerals and proteins, can be made into a sauce and eaten with cereals. Dried and powdered, they help combat malnutrition, especially in children. This tree may be used in many ways, whether traditional or innovative. In 2002, Spore 100 counted no fewer than 19 different applications. A number of other avenues of research are still being explored, including potential uses as animal fodder, as a vegetable growth hormone, as paper pulp, green fertiliser and as a phytopharmaceutical product. It seems as if moringa has yet to reveal the full range of its virtues. The magic grass vetiver For centuries, the oil extracted from the roots of vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides) has been used in the perfume trade. In October 2004, Spore wrote about how rural dwellers in Mali and Nigeria were selling vetiver to the cosmetics industry. This remarkably useful plant is also used for soil and water conservation, and increasingly, as an environmental tool. When planted as a contour hedge, vetiver acts as a filtering system that slows down rainfall runoff, reduces rilling and collects soil sediments at the hedge face. In ACP regions, vetiver is used to halt erosion, for example, in the Caribbean, Madagascar, Nigeria, Senegal and parts of the Pacific. In Ethiopia and Malawi, the grass is planted on sloping ground to reduce run off and sediment flows in upper watersheds, thus improving water quality further downstream. Spore 80 reported that trials in Thailand had shown that planting rows of vetiver grass could help absorb agrochemicals, particularly pesticides. Similar trials have since been successfully carried out in China and there is now interest in spreading this technology further afield. In South Africa, vetiver has been used to reclaim toxic mine dumps. Vetiver has the advantage of thriving in both wet and dry conditions, and on both highly acidic and alkaline soils. It also has a high tolerance to pests and diseases. Perhaps its most remarkable feature is its extraordinarily long roots, which will grow to depths of 3 to 4 m. Many cultivars are non flowering, which means the plant cannot become a weed. Once established, vetiver needs little maintenance, and its leaves and roots can be used for thatching and weaving. No wonder the Americans call it magic grass! Grain amaranth makes a comeback Grain amaranth is one of the world's forgotten foods. Grown extensively by the Incas and Aztecs of Central and South America, this versatile, hardy grain is packed with vitamins and minerals and may hold out hope for improving food security in dryland ACP regions. Spore 119 wrote about Kenyan farmers who are planting Amaranthus hybridus one of several varieties suitable for grain production {{with the help of the}} local NGO Strategic Poverty Alleviation Systems (SPAS). In Nigeria, a USAID project is also helping farmers to discover the benefits of this long neglected crop. Grain amaranth is especially suitable for hot, dry conditions, and has good resistance to pests and diseases. It grows rapidly and with little water, and is exceptionally high in lysine, a critical amino acid often deficient in plant protein. SPAS has supplied certified seeds for planting, and the hope is to tap growing export markets, as well as domestic ones more than 40 products containing grain amaranth are currently on the health food market in the United States alone.
