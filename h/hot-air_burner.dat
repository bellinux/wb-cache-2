40|$|The {{target of}} the project was to characterise a hot-air/oxygen fuel burner. Therefore, the proposers ran tests at a pilot furnace where the new type of burners was {{directly}} compared with conventional oxygen fuel burners. ln a second stage of the project, a <b>hot-air</b> <b>burner</b> system was designed according to the requirements of a production EAF (electric arc furnace), tests of which demonstrated the performance under production conditions. Oxygen fuel burners and hot-blast fuel burners show marked differences in their melting behaviour. Oxygen fuel burners create large spherical holes in front of the burner nozzle; hot-blast fuel burners create long and slender holes of conical shape. With hot-blast burners, a good preheating of the scrap bulk downstream of the molten cavity is observed which is not the case for oxygen fuel burners. After a firing time of six to eight minutes for oxygen fuel burners, a pronounced chimney formation was observed. This allowed burner fumes to pass directly into the upper furnace and in order to avoid overheating of the furnace roof, oxygen fuel burners were then stopped. With hot-air fuel burners, operation times of up to 20 minutes were reached. This confirmed the potential of the new technique to at least double the input of fossil energy into the EAF. For the tests at the EAF of Badische Stahlwerke GmbH, a compact <b>hot-air</b> <b>burner</b> system was developed where hot-blast generation occurs without a regenerator. Hence, continuous burner operation is possible. This burner was successfully tested at the pilot furnace, was transferred to the EAF and was built in at the location of a conventional oxygen fuel burner. The tests at the EAF (a) showed the feasibility of a supplemental installation of this type, (b) proved the good thermal penetration behaviour of the hot-blast burner system, and (c) demonstrated its potential for prolonged operation times. From the latter point, the increase of the input of fossil energy into the EAF can be estimated to about a factor of two.
