40|$|A novel type of an axial, piston-driven high {{pressure}} hydraulic pump with variable capacity marks {{a significant improvement}} {{in the area of}} the hydraulic machinery design. Total discharge from hydrostatic forces eliminates a need for a servomechanism, thus simplifying operation, reducing weight and introducing the possibility of the pump displacement control by computer. PWK-type pumps, invented in the Gdansk University of Technology, offer high efficiency for pressure levels up to 55 MPa, ability to work self sucking even at high speed. However, the heart of the new invention, the commutation unit, creates harmful pressure peaks. Those peaks can be mitigated by the introduction of a compensation chamber with elastic walls. Owing to the dynamic character of events taking place in the pump, a need for computer simulation arouse in order to understand phenomena leading to the occurrence of pressure peaks and choose compensation chamber parameters accordingly. A CFD package alone would not be sufficient to reliably represent the interaction between the compensation chamber wall and the working fluid.

40|$|High-quality micro-lasers are key {{ingredients}} in non-linear optics, communication, sensing and low-threshold solar-pumped lasers. However, such micro-lasers exhibit negligible absorption of free-space broadband pump light. Recently, this limitation was lifted by cascade energy transfer, {{in which the}} absorption and quality factor are modulated with wavelength, enabling non-resonant pumping of high-quality micro-lasers and solar-pumped laser to operate at record low solar concentration. Here, we present a generic theoretical framework for modeling the absorption, emission and energy transfer of incoherent radiation between cascade sensitizer and laser gain media. Our model is based on linear equations of the modified net radiation method and is therefore robust, fast converging and has low complexity. We apply this formalism to compute the optimal parameters of low-threshold solar-pumped lasers. It is revealed that the interplay between the absorption and self-absorption of such lasers defines the optimal pump absorption below the maximal value, which {{is in contrast to}} conventional lasers for which <b>full</b> <b>pump</b> absorption is desired. Numerical results are compared to experimental data on a sensitized Nd:YAG cavity, and quantitative agreement with theoretical models is found.

40|$|AbstractThe {{temporal}} intensity {{contrast of}} high-power lasers based on optical parametric amplification (OPA) can {{be limited by}} parametric fluorescence from the non-linear gain stages. Here we present a spectroscopic method for direct measurement of unwanted parametric fluorescence widely applicable from unseeded to fully seeded and saturated OPA operation. Our technique employs simultaneous spectroscopy of fluorescence photons slightly outside the seed bandwidth and strongly attenuated light at the seed central wavelength. To demonstrate its applicability we have characterised {{the performance of a}} two-stage picosecond OPA pre-amplifier with 2. 8 × 105 gain, delivering 335 μJ pulses at 1054 nm. We show that fluorescence from a strongly seeded OPA is reduced by ~ 500 × from the undepleted to <b>full</b> <b>pump</b> depletion regimes. We also determine the vacuum fluctuation driven noise term seeding this OPA fluorescence to be 0. 7 ± 0. 4 photonsps− 1 nm− 1 bandwidth. The resulting shot-to-shot statistics highlights a 1. 5 % probability of a five-fold and 0. 3 % probability of a ten-fold increase of fluorescence above the average value. Finally, we show that OPA fluorescence can be limited to a few-ps pedestal with 3 × 10 − 9 temporal intensity contrast 1. 3 ps ahead of an intense laser pulse, a level highly attractive for large scale chirped-pulse OPA laser systems...|$|E

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a coupled {{three-dimensional}} computational model of cardiac electromechanics to investigate fibre length transients and the role of electrical heterogeneity in determining left ventricular function. METHODS: A mathematical model of cellular electromechanics was embedded in a simple geometric model of the cardiac left ventricle. Electrical and mechanical boundary conditions were applied based on Purkinje fibre activation times and ventricular volumes through the heart cycle. The mono-domain reaction diffusion equations and finite deformation elasticity equations were solved simultaneously through the <b>full</b> <b>pump</b> cycle. Simulations were run to assess the importance of cellular electrical heterogeneity on myocardial mechanics. RESULTS: Following electrical activation, mechanical contraction moves out through the wall to the circumferentially oriented mid-wall fibres, producing a progressively longitudinal and twisting deformation. This is followed by a more spherical deformation as the inclined epicardial fibres are activated. Mid-way between base and apex peak tensions and fibre shortening of 40 kPa and 5 %, respectively, are generated at the endocardial surface with values of 18 kPa and 12 % at the epicardial surface. Embedding an electrically homogeneous cell model for the same simulations produced equivalent values of 36. 5 kPa, 4 % at the endocardium and 14 kPa, 13. 5 % at the epicardium. CONCLUSION: The substantial redistribution of fibre lengths during the early pre-ejection phase of systole may play a significant role in preparing the mid-wall fibres to contract.

The Scheme is divided in two systems, The first system (Lot A) transmits water from Shuweihat to Mirfa (100 km). The second (Lot C) is from Mirfa to Mussafah (150 km). The focus {{of this paper is}} on the model predictions and field data recorded by the SCADA system during <b>full</b> <b>pump</b> trip and valve closure events. The validation was performed during the commissioning test and showed a perfect match between the prediction and measurement of pressure and flow of the first wave. This paper also intends to highlight lessons learnt during the commissioning test and in particular the major risk that is caused by inaccurate manufacturer data. On {{the first day of the}} commissioning test, a near incident took place where the pressure during valve closure unexpectedly exceeded the pressure rating by 16 %. Damage to the pipeline was avoided by pressing the emergency trip push-button of the pumps thereby preventing the pipeline from being exposed to the full pressure rise. The post-incident investigation revealed that the control valve characteristics provided and certified by the manufacturer were inaccurate. A difference in Kv of up to 20 % was measured for valve positions below 40 % open and the valves were fully closed at 5 % opening. The control valve characteristics were recalibrated on site and the valve closure pattern was adapted. The commissioning test was resumed and completed flawlessly.

40|$|After September 1683, {{the news}} of the victory against the Ottoman Turks by the armies of the Austrian Habsburg emperor Leopold I and his allies at the siege of Vienna was {{announced}} in Western Europe through prints and public celebrations. In the Southern Netherlands, ruled by the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs, the victories of the Austrian emperor became a welcome news item. Since many years the Spanish king Charles II was losing his control on events in the war-stricken and impoverished Southern Netherlands. Despite the declining economic and political background, processions celebrating the victories of the Habsburg armies on the Ottoman Turks were widely supported by different governmental and urban elites. Triumphal arches and cars with <b>full</b> <b>pump</b> and circumstance displayed the victorious Habsburg emperor and the Spanish monarch together, as if the Spanish Habsburgs weren’t in decline. The catholic church and the Habsburgs were portrayed as the causes of the miraculous victories on the Turkish armies. The portrayal of the Ottoman Turks and their adversaries was done in a symbolic language supporting the governmental, urban and religious elites. The Ottomans were shown as “barbarians from hell” and as “savage, cruel and cunning fighters”. The portrayal of the Habsburgs emphasized the Habsburg tradition as defender of the catholic faith. In the prints and celebrations the common past and other connections of the different Habsburg branches and their courts were recurrently used. Comparable to other catholic countries, the catholic orders in the Southern Netherlands, like the Jesuits had a crucial part in the created image and were together with the governmental elites responsible for an easy transfer of images from region to region, from city to city. The thus created image of the Ottoman Turks was as such highly propagandistic and was used frequently in the era of the Baroque. Celebrating a victory on a generally detested enemy hided the failures and problems of the Southern Netherlands and strengthened the image of the ruling governmental, religious and urban elites.

40|$|There is {{currently}} considerable international effort aimed at utilising single electron tunnelling effects {{to develop a}} highly accurate electrical current standard that is dependent only on the electron charge (e) and a highly accurate frequency (f) standard, by transferring one electron at a time at a frequency in the GHz range. However, the accuracy requirements remain challenging due to measurement limitations. In this thesis, we focus on a silicon (Si) based single-electron pump with an in-situ Al-SET (aluminium single-electron transistor) charge sensor for error detection, which avoids many limitations present in direct current measurements. We aim {{to design and fabricate}} these integrated devices for high-fidelity charge sensing. Firstly, we designed and compared device structures using modelling and simulation. The simulation methods were verified by comparing simulations with experimental results on earlier generation pumps. This enabled identification of a new design, incorporating an Al-SET sensor with up to forty times greater sensitivity than that of previous pumps with Si-SET sensors. Next, we fabricated stand-alone Al-SETs of the selected design. We found that when using a fabrication process previously used in our laboratory, only 30 % of the batches had complete and clear metal structures. By adding an O 2 plasma ash and modifying the evaporation process, 90 % of the batches were then free from this problem. These Al-SETs showed good superconducting operation when tested at millikelvin temperatures. The measured conductance of 9. 2 nA/e is excellent for charge sensing purposes, and almost an order of magnitude better than the Si-SET sensor in the old design. Finally, we fabricated three batches of integrated devices, incorporating both a Si-MOS pump and Al-SET sensors. In these initial trials, we used 15 nm-thick gates, and demonstrated successful functioning of such thin metal gates. The low yield of the Al-SETs meant that we could not demonstrate a device with <b>full</b> <b>pump</b> and sensor functionality. However, the work done in this thesis provides a good foundation for the project. Further investigations will be required to increase the yield of Al-SETs to achieve full device functionality and demonstrations of high-accuracy error counting...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a strategy for}} power-scaling diode-end-pumped solid-state lasers to multiwatt output power whilst retaining the high-efficiency and diffraction-limited beam quality, that have been characteristic of operation at low powers. This strategy reduces the detrimental effect of energy transfer upconversion (ETU), which can decrease the lifetime of the upper-laser-level and also increase the heat generated inside the laser material. An analytical description of the lifetime quenching and increased thermal lensing due to ETU is presented. Using this analytical model it is shown that ETU can be reduced by decreasing the absorption coefficient, by increasing the spot size or by decreasing the upconversion parameter, W. This strategy is applied to a Nd:YLF laser. Before designing the laser the published value of the upconversion parameter for Nd:YLF is confirmed as W = (1. 7 ± 1) x 10 - 16 cm 3 s- 1, by observing the fluorescence saturation with increasing pump power. Also, without applying the power-scaling strategy, the thermal lensing in Nd:YLF in a typical pump set-up is determined, under lasing and non-lasing conditions. A {{significant difference between the}} thermal lensing under non-lasing and lasing conditions is observed which is attributed to the increase in heat input caused by ETU. In a standing-wave cavity, under cw lasing conditions and at the maximum pump power (29. 5 W incident, 27. 4 W absorbed) an output power of 11. 1 W is obtained. This laser has excellent beam quality (M 2 x,y, 10 W of single-frequency output with a 10 % output coupler (~ 9. 7 W at 1. 053 μm and ~ 0. 6 W at 526. 5 nm) at the maximum pump power. With a high reflector, for 1. 053 μm, 6. 2 W of polarised output (8. 3 W generated inside the LBO), at 526. 5 nm is obtained. The output has excellent beam quality (M 2 x,y < 1. 2) and amplitude stability (<± 0. 5 %). The mode-hopping suppression obtained in this laser is also investigated. A large tuning range (~ 42 GHz, ~ 80 axial mode-spacings) with the laser optimised for 1053 nm output (i. e. with the 10 % output coupler) is achieved with both diode-bars at <b>full</b> <b>pump</b> power. Also a large tuning range is achieved with the laser optimised for green output with one diode-bar (~ 72 GHz, ~ 150 axial mode-spacings). The upconversion problems are also sufficiently reduced to successfully demonstrate a highly efficient Q-switched ring laser. This laser overcomes the slow switching speed of the A-O modulator by taking the output through the diffracted beam. ~ 3. 5 mJ of single-frequency TEM 00 energy for ~ 25 W of incident pump power is demonstrated. This laser is then used to pump an OPO and preliminary results are presented...|$|E
40|$|Some modern laser {{applications}} require {{continuous wave}} (CW) high power (> 100 W), and diffraction limited performance near 1. 064 um. One such laser application with these, and additional, requirements is gravitational wave interferometry. This thesis will report {{the development of}} a scalable high power laser for this application. A high-power, single-transverse-mode laser might be produced by intensely pumping the small mode volume within a stable resonator or by using a resonator that has a large transverse mode. Intensely pumping a small volume can lead to crystal fracture and large thermally-induced wavefront aberrations. Using a large transverse mode would also be difficult if using a stable resonator as these are, in general, not suited to fundamental modes that have large cross-sectional areas. Unstable resonators, by comparison, routinely produce fundamental modes that have large cross-sectional areas. They have been used for decades with high-power, high-gain chemical or gas lasers and provide efficient energy extraction, good mode discrimination and beam quality. However, the low gain of Nd:YAG in combination with the high output coupling associated with unstable resonators would limit the efficiency of such a CW laser. One way to utilize the properties of unstable resonators while reducing the output coupling, and thus increase the efficiency, is to use a stable-unstable resonator. These resonators are stable in one plane and unstable in the orthogonal plane, rather than unstable in both planes. The required output coupling can be further reduced without degrading the beam quality by using a Graded Reflectivity Mirror (GRM) as the output coupler. The soft aperturing of the GRM also eliminates diffraction loss associated with scraper mirrors in hard-edged unstable resonators, and enhances mode discrimination. The stable-unstable resonator reported in this thesis is side-pumped by fibre-coupled diode- lasers and side-cooled. It uses a total internal reflection (TIR) zigzag slab geometry, in which the zigzag is co-planar with the pumping and cooling. The resonator is stable in the plane of the zigzag (horizontal) and unstable in the plane orthogonal to the zigzag. In this configuration the strong thermal lensing in the horizontal direction is averaged out by the zigzag. The vertical thermal lens is controlled by Thermo-Electric Coolers (TECs) which are used to adjust the temperature of the bottom and top surfaces of the slab. To test the performance of the side-pumped, side-cooled laser head it was operated initially with a stable resonator. Efficient operation was achieved and will be reported. Control of the refractive index profile (thermal lens) using the TECs on the bottom and top surfaces results in a vertical thermal lens that could be set to any value between 47 mm and 450 mm. The thermal lens encountered by the zigzag mode in the plane of pumping and cooling is weak (horizontal direction) and independent of TEC current. Thus, the thermal lensing in the horizontal and vertical directions is de-coupled, as is necessary for scalability of the mode volume in the vertical direction. A travelling-wave (for ease of injection locking) stable-unstable resonator was investigated using a Fox-Li model, which assumed a greater pump power and mode volume than used for the laser head presented in this thesis. A strip, n= 2 super-Gaussian GRM is shown to be the optimum output coupler for the stable-unstable laser. Furthermore, it is shown that the output coupling loss associated with a resonator magnification of - 1. 3 could be sustained using pump densities below the crystal fracture limit. Useful operation over a realistic range of thermal lens focal lengths is predicted. The validity of the Fox-Li modelling is confirmed using with a standing-wave stable-unstable resonator. The standing-wave resonator was chosen as it suited the available crystal and pump power used for the work in this thesis. The GRM reflectivity profile used the minimum commercially available profile radius. The vertical thermal lens is varied by adjusting the pump power, and then by adjusting the temperature of the bottom and top surfaces at <b>full</b> <b>pump</b> power. This demonstrated CW operation of the standing-wave laser with M= 1. 3 and good beam quality. Good qualitative agreement with the Fox-Li model of the standing-wave resonator is thus confirmed. Finally, suppression of the multiple longitudinal modes by injection locking is reported. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Physics and Mathematical Physics, 2001...|$|E

40|$|Context. The {{turbulent}} pumping effect {{corresponds to}} the transport of magnetic flux due {{to the presence of}} density and turbulence gradients in convectively unstable layers. In the induction equation it appears as an advective term and for this reason it is expected to be important in the solar and stellar dynamo processes. Aims. We explore the effects of turbulent pumping in a flux-dominated Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo model with a solar-like rotation law. Methods. As a first step, only vertical pumping has been considered through the inclusion of a radial diamagnetic term in the induction equation. In the second step, a latitudinal pumping term was included and then, a near-surface shear was included. Results. The results reveal the importance of the pumping mechanism in solving current limitations in mean field dynamo modeling, such as the storage of the magnetic flux and the latitudinal distribution of the sunspots. If a meridional flow is assumed to be present only in {{the upper part of the}} convective zone, it is the <b>full</b> turbulent <b>pumping</b> that regulates both the period of the solar cycle and the latitudinal distribution of the sunspot activity. In models that consider shear near the surface, a second shell of toroidal field is generated above r = 0. 95 R(circle dot) at all latitudes. If the <b>full</b> <b>pumping</b> is also included, the polar toroidal fields are efficiently advected inwards, and the toroidal magnetic activity survives only at the observed latitudes near the equator. With regard to the parity of the magnetic field, only models that combine turbulent pumping with near-surface shear always converge to the dipolar parity. Conclusions. This result suggests that, under the Babcock-Leighton approach, the equartorward motion of the observed magnetic activity is governed by the latitudinal pumping of the toroidal magnetic field rather than by a large scale coherent meridional flow. Our results support the idea that the parity problem is related to the quadrupolar imprint of the meridional flow on the poloidal component of the magnetic field and the turbulent pumping positively contributes to wash out this imprint...|$|R
