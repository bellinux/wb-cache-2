50|$|Appliance {{recycling}} {{consists of}} <b>dismantling</b> <b>waste</b> home appliances and scrapping their parts for reuse. Recycling appliances for their original or other purposes, involves disassembly, removal of hazardous components {{and destruction of}} the end-of-life equipment to recover materials, generally by shredding, sorting and grading. The rate at which appliances are discarded has increased with technological advancement. This correlation directly leads {{to the question of}} appropriate disposal. The main types of appliances that are recycled are televisions, refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, and computers. When appliances are recycled, they can be looked upon as valuable resources. If disposed of improperly, appliances can become environmentally harmful and poison ecosystems.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In recent years, a {{large number}} of toxic and {{hazardous}} substances were discharged into environment because of the simple landfill and accumulation of vehivle <b>dismantling</b> <b>waste.</b> Therefore, {{it is very important to}} develop the recycling technology of vehivle <b>dismantling</b> <b>waste</b> for the harmless, stability, reduction and resource utilization of vehivle <b>dismantling</b> <b>waste.</b> In this paper, the compositions of vehicle <b>dismantling</b> <b>waste</b> from two different dismantling processes were investigated by manual sorting, infrared spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, experimental results showed that the vehicle waste from manual dismantling contained more polyurethane, foamed plastic and rubber with low value and the size of waste is lager, the vehicle waste from mechanical dismantling contained more metal and brittle polymer and their size was smaller. The concentration of metal in two kinds of wastes are less than 1 %, the total concentration of carbon and hydrogen reach about 70 %, so vehicle <b>dismantling</b> <b>waste</b> was suital for recovering ernergy, but the pollution of chlrone from polyvinyl chloride need to be prevented...|$|E
50|$|Early screw-propelled steamships used a {{thrust block}} or thrust box {{composed}} of perhaps a dozen lower-rated plain thrust journal bearings stacked {{on the same}} shaft. These were problematic in service: they were bulky, difficult to <b>dismantle,</b> <b>wasted</b> power through friction {{and they had a}} tendency to overheat. The thrust box was built of a box-like cast iron housing with a radial bearing at each end and a number of collars formed on the shaft between them. This shaft was often a short section of removable shaft called the thrust shaft, linking the engine ahead to the propeller shaft astern. A series of iron horseshoe-shaped collars fitted over the small diameter of the shaft and bore against the forward face of the shaft's collars. Each horseshoe was faced with a low-friction pad of babbitt metal. Lubrication was by an oil bath in the box and a plentiful volume was important for cooling purposes too.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the current {{radioactive waste management}} practices at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The PSI contributes to waste related problems in two aspects, namely to the scientific basis of waste management and disposal, and to the practical treatment and storage of radioactive waste. In addition to the tasks of treating on-site generated waste, PSI manages the wastes from medicine, industry, and research throughout Switzerland {{on behalf of the}} government. Therefore the <b>Dismantling</b> and <b>Waste</b> Management Section {{is a part of the}} Logistics Department at PSI. Proved and accepted methods have to be developed for the safe conditioning and storage of radioactive waste. Various waste treatment facilities exist at PSI. The conditioning facility is dedicated to sorting, compaction by a 120 t press, solidification with special cement, and embedding in concrete. Specialized facilities were constructed for waste from the decommissioning of research reactors. Activated aluminum and its alloys were melted in crucibles and embedded in concrete in a concrete container. After dismantling the structural material of the reactors, it was embedded in concrete in the same manner. For the conditioning of activated reactor graphite, a dedicated method was developed. Graphite was crushed to replace sand in the grout, for embedding radioactive waste in concrete containers. For accelerator waste, a walk-in hot cell equipped with an electrically driven manipulator is available where the highly activated large components (targets, beam dump) can be cut into pieces and embedded in concrete in containers. To guarantee the fulfillment of the demands of the regulators, the <b>Dismantling</b> and <b>Waste</b> Management Section applies an accredited quality management system for the safe collection, conditioning, and storage of radioactive waste...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The UK {{nuclear power}} {{industry}} is predominantly based on gas-cooled, graphite moderated reactors with their being 20 operating and 6 shutdown Magnox reactors. The radioactive graphite {{issues associated with}} the Magnox reactors relate mainly to the reactor core graphite but, at two of the stations, there is also another graphite waste stream which results from the handling of their particular design of fuel elements which incorporate graphite fittings. The decommissioning plan for the Magnox reactors is to apply the Safestore strategy in which the defuelled reactors will be maintained in a quiescent state, e. g. to gain benefit from radioactive decay, with their dismantling being deferred {{for a period of}} time. In preparing for and developing the decommissioning strategy detailed studies have been undertaken on all relevant aspects. These have resulted in, for example, extensive information on the graphite radioactive inventories, the condition of the graphite throughout the quiescent deferral period, safety assessment, and, <b>dismantling,</b> <b>waste</b> management and disposal plans. Significant work has also been undertaken on the management of the graphite fuel element debris that has accumulated at the two stations. For example, work is well advanced at one of the stations to install equipment to retrieve this waste and package it in a form suitable for eventual deep geological disposal. 1...|$|E
40|$|Management review In 2016, all Finnish {{nuclear power}} plants {{operated}} safely and caused no danger to their surrounding environment or employees. The collective radiation doses of employees were yet again historically low in {{almost all of the}} plant units and radioactive releases into the environment very small. The low employee radiation doses were the result of short annual outages and improvements implemented at the {{nuclear power plants}}. In spring 2016, three leaking fuel assemblies were replaced at Olkiluoto 1 during an extra refuelling outage, and then three more assemblies were replaced in connection with the annual outage due to subsequent leaks. The fuel leaks were one reason why the employee radiation doses at the plant unit were somewhat higher than in the previous years. Over the course of 2016, Fortum Power and Heat Oy (Fortum) submitted to STUK a total of 20 operational event reports. The operational events did not compromise nuclear or radiation safety. STUK performed an annual outage inspection in compliance with the periodic inspection programme during the annual outage. During the annual outages, Fortum inspected – according to a programme agreed with STUK – that there was no hydrogen flaking in the reactor pressure vessel of the power plant unit 1. Hydrogen flaking could have occurred during manufacture of the pressure vessel. A similar inspection on the pressure vessel of Loviisa 2 was performed in 2014. No hydrogen flaking was detected in either of the pressure vessels. In 2016, STUK focused its regulatory oversight on the Fortum’s organisation, inspecting Fortum’s management, competence, resource and procurement processes. Also in 2016, Fortum completed a major organisational renewal, and STUK oversaw its implementation and initial impact as part of its regulatory oversight. In 2016, Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) submitted to STUK 11 operational event reports. Some radioactive materials were released into the environment in the case of two of the events. One of the events involved fuel leaks and the other an error during maintenance. The set limits were not exceeded and neither of the events compromised radiation safety of the population. Both events increased the radiation level inside the plant, which was taken into account when planning the work to be done by the employees. STUK performed an annual outage inspection in compliance with the periodic inspection programme during the annual outage. TVO implemented a new organisation and operations model in 2015. Based on inspections by STUK, the new operations model has been largely established, but there are still some challenges pertaining to the atmosphere at the company and the adequacy of resources. STUK will continue to monitor as part of its regulatory oversight the situation and the actions taken by TVO to maintain the organisation’s safety culture during the challenging change. At both Olkiluoto and Loviisa, modifications required for improving safety continued. New main steam line safety valves were installed at Loviisa 1 during the 2016 annual outage. They will also operate in a case where water flows through them in addition to steam. A similar installation was carried out at Loviisa 2 in 2014. New main steam line radiation measuring instruments were also installed and commissioned at Loviisa 1. Of the improvement measures started after the Fukushima accident, further improvements of the flood protection and securing the cooling of the fuel pools are still remaining. Their planning proceeded in 2016. An improvement project of the diesel fuel storage and transfer system was completed in 2016. STUK continued its review of the Loviisa I&C renewal documents and supervised installation work of the renewal’s first phase during the 2016 annual outage. The first phase included a preventive safety function control and indication system as well as modernisation of the I&C status monitoring system. The rest of the I&C renewal installations will be completed during the 2017 and 2018 annual outages. As a result of the Fukushima accident, Olkiluoto will improve, for example, systems used to cool the reactor and add whole new systems for pumping water into the reactor in case of a complete loss of AC power. Another ongoing project at Olkiluoto is an upgrade of the reactor coolant pumps and the emergency diesel generators. In 2016, first of the six reactor coolant pumps in Olkiluoto 1 was replaced. TVO plans to commission the new reactor coolant pumps between 2016 and 2018. STUK continued its review of documents pertaining to the modifications and the supervision of manufacture. The installation and construction work of Olkiluoto 3 are nearing the end, and full-scale testing of the systems and components was started in 2016. Testing of the I&C systems started {{at the beginning of the}} year and the first process system tests were performed in April 2016. TVO submitted an operating licence application for the plant unit to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE) in April 2016. At the same time, TVO submitted the documents on the plant and its operation required by virtue of the Nuclear Energy Decree to STUK for approval. In 2016, STUK focused its regulatory oversight on review of the operating licence application and on oversight of the remaining installations and the commissioning activities. While reviewing the operating licence application, STUK also prepared implementation decisions for Olkiluoto 3 of the updated YVL Guides that were published in 2013. The new YVL Guides will enter into force for Olkiluoto 3 as soon as the operating licence is granted. Due to suspected product forgeries involving manufacturers in France, STUK required reports from the power companies on whether the suspicions involve manufacture of the components used at Olkiluoto 3 or whether any components from the said manufacturers have been used at the operating nuclear power plants. The report on Olkiluoto 3 must be submitted to STUK by the end of April 2017. No forgeries have been detected at the operating plant units, but the reports on Loviisa will be supplemented in early 2017. In June 2015, Fennovoima submitted to the MEAE a construction licence application for a new nuclear power plant. At the same time, Fennovoima submitted to STUK for review documents required by the Nuclear Energy Decree. Fennovoima has supplemented and will supplement the construction licence application in stages between 2015 and 2018. Delivery of documents has been delayed from the schedule of the first licensing plan due to slower organisation than expected of the project and its supply chain and due to a lack of resources in the design organisation. STUK monitored the development of Fennovoima’s management system and quality management, and assessed the company’s organisational resources to begin construction of a nuclear power plant. In September 2015, STUK launched the inspections included in the regulatory inspection programme, and a total of 15 inspections of Fennovoima and key organisations of the plant supplier were carried out in 2016. Furthermore, STUK’s experts participated as observers in audits of the plant supplier and its subcontractors, arranged by Fennovoima. The handling and storage of spent nuclear fuel and operational waste and the disposal of operational waste were implemented safely, and no events compromising safety were detected at the Loviisa or Olkiluoto nuclear power plants. Due to the successful planning of operations, the plants accumulated clearly less operational waste than nuclear power plants on average. An important positive development in the waste management of the plants was the fact that operation of a solidification facility for liquid radioactive waste at the Loviisa nuclear power plant started on 15 February 2016 after STUK had approved the related application. Fortum continued the planning of repairs of the damage observed in the outer surface of the concrete vault in the solidified waste disposal facility, which is why the disposal of solidified waste could not be started yet. The operating licence for the research reactor FiR 1 of VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland is valid until the end of 2023. VTT shut down the research reactor for financial reasons in June 2015 and has been preparing decommissioning of the research reactor ever since. STUK has conducted all the measures necessary for the oversight of the reactor that was shut down and prepared for the review of the application on the decommissioning of the reactor. VTT submitted a nuclear waste management plan for the research reactor to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment in September 2016. The report described all measures since the 2015 report and all planned measures up until 2022. STUK stated in its statement to the MEAE that VTT had clearly progressed with the planning of the research reactor’s decommissioning over the course of the past year. The most important open issues regarding the decommissioning of the research reactor involve the return of spent fuel to the United States and the storage and disposal of <b>dismantling</b> <b>waste.</b> After Posiva Oy received a construction licence from the Government on 12 November 2015, STUK’s oversight has focused on the construction of the encapsulation and disposal facility. The regulatory oversight during the construction stage covers design, manufacture, construction and installation of the nuclear waste facility and its safety-classified systems, structures and components. This stage also includes the nuclear waste facility’s commissioning stage, at which time STUK will oversee Posiva’s operations, review testing programmes and results, and perform commissioning inspections. In 2016, STUK’s oversight focused particularly on the assessment of Posiva’s readiness for construction after the submission of the construction licence. STUK continued to oversee construction of the underground research facility by Posiva, Posiva’s system design, activities of the Posiva organisation and development of Posiva’s safety analyses. An important stage in 2016 was the start of the construction of the disposal facility according to the construction licence. STUK comprehensively assessed Posiva’s readiness for construction before the construction work was started. In June 2016, Fennovoima submitted to the MEAE its environmental impact assessment programme on the disposal of spent nuclear fuel as required in the 2010 decision-inprinciple. The submission of the EIA programme started Fennovoima’s spent fuel disposal project and the selection process of the disposal facility site. Fennovoima has proposed Sydänneva in Pyhäjoki and Eurajoki as the potential sites. The more exact research area in Eurajoki has not been determined as of yet. In its statement on the EIA programme, STUK emphasised the fact that the proposed process would last a long time, the need to regularly assess the programme to ensure that it is up to date and the fact that the exact research area in Eurajoki must be determined as soon as possible. In addition to the operation and construction of a nuclear facility, the use of nuclear energy as laid down in section 2 of the Nuclear Energy Act includes the possession, manufacture, production, transfer, handling, use, storage, transport, export and import of nuclear material. Furthermore, components, systems and information required by nuclear facilities are subject to licensing and oversight by virtue of the Nuclear Energy Act. In 2016, STUK became aware of two cases of import without the proper licence. Nuclear safeguards in Finland were implemented in compliance with the international treaties. Nuclear safeguards ensure that nuclear materials and other nuclear items remain in peaceful use in compliance with the relevant licences and declarations and that nuclear facilities and related technologies are only utilised for peaceful purposes. STUK maintains a national control system which aim is to take care of the necessary oversight of use of nuclear energy for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. STUK processed reports and declarations on nuclear materials and performed safeguards inspections together with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission. STUK actively promoted with the IAEA and the European Commission the development of nuclear safeguards for the disposal of spent fuel. Key issues in this development work were the development of a new oversight model and a new fuel measuring technology...|$|E

40|$|The first {{generation}} of UK research and production reactors were graphite moderated and operated at low temperatures, below 150 °C. The graphite in these reactors now contains {{a significant amount of}} stored (Wigner) energy that may be relatively easily released by heating the graphite above the irradiation temperature. This exothermic behaviour has lead to a number of decommissioning issues which are related to characterization of graphite samples, long term "safe-storage", reactor core <b>dismantling,</b> graphite <b>waste</b> packaging and the final disposal of this irradiated graphite waste. The release of stored energy can be modelled using kinetic models linked to classical kinetic analysis theory. These models rely on Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) data obtained either from graphite samples irradiated in material test reactors or data obtained from small samples trepanned from the reactors themselves. Data from these experiments can be used to derive activation energies and characteristic functions used in kinetic models for application to practical situations using suitable modelling techniques. In this paper the classical theory of kinetic analysis is used as the basis for models applied to the study of stored energy release in irradiated graphite components. The use of an independent parallel reactions model is proposed and several possible kinetic model scenarios are tested. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In order to contribute to answer this question, a life cycle assessment (LCA), including the fabrication of components, construction, operation, maintenance, <b>dismantling</b> and <b>waste</b> treatment, has been used to evaluate the environmental impacts of two high energy performance buildings: a renovated multi-family social housing building and two passive attached houses. Both buildings are located in North of France. For the purpose of this study, renewable energy production has been assumed to achieve nearly positive energy balances. For these buildings, four different heating solutions have been studied: an electric heat pump, a wood pellet condensing boiler, a wood pellet micro-cogeneration unit, and district heating. Modeling and simulation have been performed using the building thermal simulation tool COMFIE, to evaluate the heating load and thermal comfort level, and the LCA tool EQUER to evaluate twelve impact indicators.

40|$|The {{recycling}} of e-waste in general allows {{the recovery of}} valuable materials, which can be reused as secondary raw materials. However this implies, to adopt reliable treatment processes to achieve specific standard characteristics. Actually, the market standards are very strict and strongly affect the economic value of recovered materials. In particular, waste refrigerators recycling allows the recovery of different plastic materials and metallic fractions (ferrous and non ferrous), whose economic value has considerably increased in the last years. Only in Italy, in 2010, approximately 66, 000 tons of waste refrigerators were collected for recycling. An efficient recycling treatment could assure about 85 % of recovery rate. In this paper, a model to control and characterize the materials recovered from mechanical {{recycling of}} carcasses <b>dismantled</b> from <b>waste</b> refrigerators is proposed. The treatment flow sheet consists of various separation and comminution operations. A mathematical model was implemented to determine a partition function, utilizing data obtained from the treatment of 100 waste refrigerator carcasses, carrying out mass balance of recovered materials. The partition function {{was used to determine}} control parameters and assess the quality of the recovered products, and, therefore, of the applied technologies. The results have shown that for waste refrigerator carcasses it has been possible to reach for ferrous metals a recovery rate of 97. 5 % with purity of more than 98 %.

In this context, waste management is even more challenging with small spaces for waste handling, uncertainties in waste control, and impact of waste management activities on project delivery and building occupants. Current literatures on waste management in office building retrofit projects focus on increasing waste recovery rate based on project planning, monitoring and stakeholders’ collaboration. However, previous research has not produced knowledge of understanding the particular retrofit processes and their impact on waste generation and management. This paper discusses the interim results of a continuing research on new strategies for waste management in office building retrofit projects. Firstly based on the literature review, it summarizes the unique characteristics of office building retrofit projects and their influence on waste management. An assumption on waste management strategies is formed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted towards industry practitioners and findings are then presented in the paper. The assumption of the research was validated in the interviews from the opinions and experiences of the respondents. Finally the research develops a process model for waste management in office building retrofit projects. It introduces two different waste management strategies. For the <b>dismantling</b> phase, <b>waste</b> is generated fast along with the work progress, so integrated planning for project delivery and waste generation is needed in order to organize prompt handling and treatment. For the fit-out phase, the work is similar as new construction. Factors which are particularly linked to generating waste on site need to be controlled and monitored. Continuing research in this space will help improve the practice of waste management in office building retrofit projects. The new strategies will help promote the practicality of project waste planning and management and stakeholders’ capability of coordinating waste management and project delivery...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the outline}} of the initial commission, firstly major fields of {{application}} for chlorine-containing products (PVC) within the field of building were selected for further investigation. Halogenes within organic solvents or propellants were excluded. Roof sealants, windows and solid floor materials were closely examined. When it became obvious that the apparatus of Product Lifecycle Assessment, which is geared to short-life consumer products, is not capable of ecologically evaluating durable building elements, one of the focus points of the study readjusted to additional strategies in order to capture the phases of use during the life of structures. As a timeframe for assessment, an eighty-year-long use has been assumed. The delimitation of considered building elements and types and the determination of the assessment timeframe takes place within the methodological description and the goal-and-scope definition of Volume I. Within the groupings of building elements, ten different products have been chosen for which an inventory Analysis was generated that takes into account the necessary preliminary-stage substances where possible. The database consists of records that were available in 1994. Where no current and substance-relevant records were at the authors' disposal, analogies and comparative figures were established. The post-use processes (p. ex. recycling) were disregarded, but qualitatively described and identified as material-specific amounts of waste within the attachments to the study which deal with the possibilities of <b>dismantling</b> and <b>waste</b> management. Based on the input-and-output records determined beforehand, a concept for an 'ecological comparison' related to the building elements was elaborated in Volume III. After an analysis of typical decision-making processes and variants, the resulting impacts on duration and quality of use of the selected building elements were compiled. Within the framework of this concept, a most important goal of research remains, which is the more detailed description of cause-and-effect relations. Connected to the outcomes, the individual 'modules of influence' were assembled to a worst-case and a best-case scenario. The graphic representation of conclusions in Volume III covers the product-related results of the Inventory Analysis and the aggregated scenarios. An interpretative account for the roof sealants was cancelled after objections had been voiced from the involved manufacturers, regarding the results of the Inventory Analysis. The whole study was executed with the inclusion of manufacturers and manufacturers' association, and compromised two comprehensive presentation events as well as constant, project-related discussion circles.

40|$|The US Department of Energy (DO) is in {{the process}} of decontaminating and {{decommissioning}} (D and D) many of its nuclear facilities throughout the country. Facilities have to be <b>dismantled</b> and demolition <b>waste</b> must be sized into manageable pieces for handling and disposal. Typically, the facilities undergoing D and D are contaminated, either chemically, radiologically, or both. In its D and D work, the DOE was in need of a tool capable of cutting steel and stainless steel pipe up to 6. 4 cm in diameter. The self-contained pipe cutting shear was developed by Lukas Hydraulic GmbH and Co. KG to cut pipes up to 6. 4 cm (2. 5 in.) in diameter. This tool is a portable, hand-held hydraulic shear that is powered by a built-in rechargeable battery or a portable auxiliary rechargeable battery. Adding to its portability, it contains no hydraulic fluid lines or electrical cords, making it useful in congested areas or in areas with no power. Both curved and straight blades can be attached, making it adaptable to a variety of conditions. This tool is easy to set up, operates quietly, and cuts through pipes quickly. It is especially useful on contaminated pipes, as it crimps the ends while cutting and produces no residual cuttings. This shear is a valuable alternative to baseline technologies such as portable band saws, electric hacksaws, and other hydraulic shears. Costs using the innovative shear for cutting 2. 5 cm (1 -in.) pipe, for example, are comparable to costs using a conventional shear, approximately 80 % of portable bandsaw costs and half of electric hacksaw costs...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWaste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing waste streams in {{contemporary}} societies. Proper treatment and recovery of WEEE is an important challenge not only because of its content on hazardous substances but also because it contains significant quantities of valuable materials. The pre-processing stage of WEEE recycling plays a major role in the recovery network, in particular when carried out through manual dismantling processes. Dismantling allows components to be separated prior to further treatment. However, recycling organisations usually find this particular stage considerably time-consuming, and hence expensive, since products are not designed to be easily <b>dismantled.</b> One particular <b>waste</b> stream that could reduce dismantling costs through an improved design is the stream of Flat Panel Displays (FPD). However, little detailed data is nowadays available on the dismantling processes, which prevent designing FPD according to the requirements of treatment operators. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method for in-depth analysis of dismantling practices of electronic displays in order to obtain useful data for product design. The method is composed of three stages: (1) study definition, (2) data construction and (3) data analysis. The first stage allows setting out why, how and where the analysis will be performed. The second stage consists in describing dismantling operations in detail to construct a detailed and meaningful dataset. Finally, product indicators are developed and the best and worst design practices from a dismantling point of view are identified. The approach is illustrated through a case study on the manual dismantling of 12 FPD. The sample was dismantled at one of the European recycling facility representatives. Data on the dismantling time spent on each component, operation and tool was obtained. Collected data can be used as empirical evidence to support the development of quantitative ecodesign strategies. Some examples of ecodesign strategies that can significantly reduce the dismantling time of the sample are given. This work opens perspectives on how the quantitative data from the recovery phase obtained within the study can be used in product design...|$|R
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{were once}} widely used as flame retardants in furniture and electronic products, and contamination persists {{in developing countries}} due to the <b>dismantling</b> of electronic <b>waste.</b> Our previous study confirmed that 2, 2 â², 4, 4 â², 5 -pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 99) induced cytochrome P 450 1 A (Cyp 1 a) via aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) âmediated signaling in the zebrafish liver cell line (ZFL) in vitro. In this study, the toxicities of BDE- 47 and BDE- 99 at environmentally relevant concentrations (50 and 500 Â nM) were evaluated in newly hatched zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae in vivo. A time-course study (8, 24, 48, and 96 Â h) was performed. BDE- 99 was observed to cause yolk sac edema and pericardial edema after 72 Â h of exposure. Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and whole-mount in situ hybridization assay confirmed cyp 1 a induction by BDE- 99 in the liver and intestine. Continuous down-regulation of trÎ² {{by as much as}} 2. 1 -fold after 96 Â h and transient down-regulation of ttr by 7. 1 -fold after 24 Â h indicated the interference of BDE- 99 in the thyroid hormone system. cyp 1 a induction was also observed in BDE- 47 âtreated larvae, but cellular localization of cyp 1 a was not confirmed by whole-mount in situ hybridization. The induction of four cyp 1 genes (cyp 1 a, cyp 1 b 1, cyp 1 c 1 and cyp 1 c 2) by both BDE congeners warrants further study to understand the in vivo metabolism of BDE- 47 and BDE- 99 and the dioxin-like toxicity potencies of the OH-/MeO-PBDEs. The data obtained in this study will aid the characterization of molecular disorders caused by PBDEs in fish and help to delineate better models for toxicity assessment of environmental pollutants in ecological systems and in other vertebrates such as humans.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this {{was to assess the}} levels of heavy metals contamination within the vicinity of the Agbogbloshie scrap market. Surface dust samples were collected from various points at the scrap market and its environs. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry preceded by acid digestion was used to evaluate the concentration of the heavy metals in the samples. Heavy metals such as Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd gave concentrations in the range of (10, 575 - 30, 384 mg/kg), (34 - 16, 952 mg/kg), (351 - 5, 105 mg/kg) and (2 - 72 mg/kg), respectively which were over thousand times more than the levels for which intervention is required. The scrap weighing site, the electronic <b>waste</b> <b>dismantling</b> site and the burning site (where electrical cables are burnt to retrieve metals) recorded the highest levels of heavy metals. Index of geoaccumulation which was employed to determine the level of pollution of the various elements gave the values in the range of 6. 7 - 8. 2 for Zinc (Zn), 4. 2 - 8. 1 for lead (Pb) and 3. 0 - 7. 8 for Cadmium (Cd) indicating extreme pollution from all the sites. This was also confirmed by contamination factor calculations. To assess the extent of pollution of each of the site, degree of contamination was calculated which revealed that the most contaminated site is the Weighing Site (WS) which recorded Cdeg value of 1482. 93, followed by Dismantling Site (DS) 1221. 6, Burning Site (BS) 1196. 9, Road Dust (RD) 1061. 9, School Compound (SC) 651. 44, Commercial Area (CA) 618. 6 and Church Premises (CP) 187. 6, respectively. The results also indicate that children living around the scrap market face a very high risk from the ingestion of toxic metals such as Pb and Cd. The weighing site (HI = 205) at the scrap market by far pose the greatest cumulative risk followed by the dismantling site (HI = 130), road dust (HI = 88), burning site (HI = 60), school compound (HI = 52), commercial area (HI = 50) and church premises (HI = 15) ...|$|R
