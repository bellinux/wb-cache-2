5|$|The video {{starts with}} {{a shot of the}} outside view of The Confidante hotel and two flamingos. In the next scene, and {{in the context of the}} track, Lipa is lying on a bed, {{thinking}} of giving her ex a second chance, while her friends are by her side. As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer his call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> but manages to escape to the hallway. There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other. They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they walk over the water.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Auschwitz, the SS {{forcibly}} separated the men <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and children, and Otto Frank was wrenched from his family. Those deemed {{able to work}} were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549—including all children younger than 15—were sent directly to the gas chambers. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, {{was one of the}} youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the Achterhuis had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.|$|E

25|$|Logistical {{organization}} of eighteenth century armies was chaotic at best, and the British Army was no exception. No logistical corps {{existed in the}} modern sense; while on campaign in foreign territories such as America, horses, wagons, and drivers were frequently requisitioned from the locals, often by impressment or by hire. No centrally organized medical corps existed. It was common for surgeons to have no formal medical education, and no diploma or entry examination was required. Nurses sometimes were apprentices to surgeons, but many were drafted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> who followed the army. Army surgeons and doctors were poorly paid and were regarded as social inferiors to other officers.|$|E
25|$|Bangladeshi {{women may}} have been raped during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 by the Pakistan army during night raids on villages. Pakistani sources claim the number is much lower, though having not {{completely}} denied rape incidents. One work that has included direct experiences <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> raped is Ami Birangana Bolchi ("I, the heroine, is speaking") by Nilima Ibrahim. The work includes in {{its name from the}} word Birangona (Heroine), given by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after the war, to the raped and tortured women during the war. This was a conscious effort to alleviate any social stigma the women might face in the society. How successful this effort was is doubtful, though.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the summer}} of 1861 the Soldiers' Relief Association was organized, with McCord as {{president}}. In July 1861, she was made president of the Ladies' Clothing Association. The first-named organization made the uniforms for the company of her son, Captain L. Cheves McCord, his mother furnishing the material. She resigned her presidency of the Soldiers' Relief Association in order to give her whole time to the military hospital established within the South Carolina College; this was in 1862, and here she gave her greatest service. In her home, at the northwest corner of Pendleton and Bull streets, {{across the street from the}} college property, she received supplies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> of the city -— supplies available for nourishment for the sick, and hospital comfort. Early every day, there was made in her kitchen a supply of corn bread and broth, heaped into plates and left on a long dresser on her back piazza, served day after day as the nourishment for wounded soldiers who could drag themselves across the street from the convalescent building on the campus.|$|E

25|$|In general these {{gathering}}s {{would involve}} older women, usually post-menopausal, gathering together {{in order to}} punish individuals of the community for offense such as being accused of witchcraft, falsely accusing others of witchcraft, physically abusing family members or pregnant women, incest, or committing other offenses. In the precolonial situation, these practices were very local, never extended outside of a single ethnic community, and established clear remedies for the individuals targeted (typically begging for forgiveness <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> paying a fine, and being ritually cleansed). The older women gather {{at the house of}} the individual being targeted, sing and chant, and behave in ways which are typically against decorum (including stripping, defecating and urinating on the person’s property, sexual harassment and puns directed at passersby, dressing in male attire, etc.) in order to express the severity of the offense. In Kedjom Keku communities, the women would be led by comedians (called vugweys) who would lead the group in making vulgar jokes and puns at those passing by and the individual being shamed. In Kom communities, the women would be led by the oldest women in the community, called na-anlu (mother of anlu) {{for the duration of the}} shaming, who was in charge of organizing the various efforts.|$|E
25|$|As the air-defences of Helsinki were {{improved}} in spring 1944 after the winter bombings {{it was decided}} to replace some of the personnel in searchlight units with women to ease manpower shortage. Three hundred women were selected from students working already in air surveillance duties, of whom 215 arrived for searchlight training. The trainees were mainly from Helsinki University of Technology, University of Helsinki and Ateneum, but also from schools in Turku and Tampere. The training began on 31 May 1944 in Laajasalo in Helsinki, but was suspended already on 9 June since there was no guarantee that the women would continue to serve after fall (student work responsibility only covered summer months). The training continued after the women expressed interest in the task and pledged to serve {{for as long as the}} war demanded or a minimum of one year. After this the number of trainees was set at 145 and the training was concentrated to Anti-aircraft regiment 1 (Finnish: Ilmatorjuntarykmentti 1 (ItR 1)) in Helsinki, while the training in 1st Independent Anti-aircraft Battalion (Finnish: 1. Erillinen ilmatorjuntapatteristo (1.Er.ItPsto)) in Turku and 2nd Independent Anti-aircraft Battalion (Finnish: 2. Erillinen ilmatorjuntapatteristo (2.Er.ItPsto)) in Tampere was discontinued. Captain K. H. Pentti led the training while Inkeri Simola acted as the Lotta leader. Simola was later succeeded by Aino Airamo. A voluntary written commitment to remain in service as well as passing a medical examination for continuous outdoor duty was required <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> who wished to serve in the searchlight battery.|$|E

500|$|Johann Wilhelm von Archenholz {{claimed in}} 1791 that the lists were {{published}} by [...] "a tavern-keeper, in Drury lane", and that [...] "eight thousand copies are sold annually." [...] There {{is nothing to}} suggest that Hayes had any involvement with any edition other than that of 1769, and the list's authors following Derrick's death have not been identified. [...] From the 1770s Harris's List changes focus, moving away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> of Covent Garden, to their stories. [...] Its prose becomes more genteel, lacking the euphemisms which had helped make it so popular. [...] These changes are echoed by the front cover, whose frontispiece becomes more gentrified. [...] Material from earlier editions is recycled, and little {{attention is paid to}} accuracy. [...] The responsibility for some of these changes can be attributed to John and James Roach, and John Aitkin, who from the late 1780s were the lists' publishers.|$|E
500|$|Although Balzac did {{not draw}} {{specifically}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> {{in his life}} to create Valérie, parallels have been observed in some areas. The tumultuous end of his affair with Louise Breugniot and the advantage she gains from his devotion to Mme. Hanska is {{similar in some ways}} to Valérie's manipulation of Steinbock. Critics also connect the pride and anguish felt by Balzac during Mme. Hanska's pregnancy and miscarriage to the same emotions felt by Baron Hulot when Valérie conceives and loses her child. Although he never ascribed to Mme. Hanska any of the traits in Valérie's treacherous character, he felt a devotion similar to that of Hulot. He once wrote to her: [...] "je fais pour mon Eve toute les folies qu'un Hulot fait pour une Marneffe, je te donnerai mon sang, mon honneur, ma vie" [...] ("I commit for [...] all the follies that a Hulot commits for Madame Marneffe; I give you my blood, my honor, my life").|$|E

500|$|Disillusioned {{at being}} typecast as the [...] "sarcastic {{interest}} of the guy", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor's period drama The Help (2011), a film she found to be challenging. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel {{of the same name}} and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: [...] "Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down and we got a little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, 'God! God! This is Skeeter." [...] She was cast as Eugenia [...] "Skeeter" [...] Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a Southern dialect; she also educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film. With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, The Help became Stone's most commercially successful film to that point. The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for Empire, Anna Smith thought that Stone was [...] "well-meaning and hugely likable" [...] despite finding flaws in the character. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and won Best Ensemble Cast <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Women</b> Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.|$|E
