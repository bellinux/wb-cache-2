An obvious 16 -day wave can be observed from raw wind data. Its maximum meridional wind amplitude can attain 18. 0 m s − 1 at a height of 92 km {{during the time of}} our attention, which is larger than that in previous reports. Sum and difference interactions between the 16 -day wave and the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> are observed to have rather different intensities. Because sum nonlinear interaction is very intense, the secondary sum wave with a period of 22. 59 h is stronger than the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide.</b> However, weak spectrum of the secondary difference wave is hardly identified. The beat of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> with the secondary sum wave leads to substantial modulation of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> at a period of 16 days. Moreover, this strong secondary sum wave further interacts with the 16 -day wave to generate a new secondary wave with a period of 21. 33 h.

The interannual variability in the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> observed by the MLT radars confirms intense QBOs of DW 1 and DE 3 from GAIA between 1997 and 1999.

This period is clearly shorter than the QBO period (18 to 34  months) employed in this study. The wavelet spectra of the GAIA zonal wind, and the U 30 index (Fig.  4) also display an enhancement of signals with a period near 1.5  years between 2014 and 2016.

In the DSP, GW momentum (and energy) are conserved as the waves modulate the background flow and are filtered by the flow. As a consequence, the GW interaction tightly couples the dynamic components of the middle atmosphere with strong non-linear interactions between mean zonal circulation, tides and planetary waves to produce complicated patterns of variability much like those observed. The major conclusions are: (1) Since GW momentum is deposited in the altitude regime of increasing winds, the amplitude of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> is amplified and its vertical wavelength is reduced at altitudes between 80 and 120 km. Wave filtering by the mean zonal circulation (with peak velocities during solstice) causes the GW flux to peak during equinox, and this produces a large semi-annual variation in the tide that has been observed on UARS. (2) Without the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide,</b> the semidiurnal tide would also be modulated in this way. But the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> filters out the GW preferentially during equinox, so that the semidiurnal tide, at higher altitudes, tends to peak during solstice.
