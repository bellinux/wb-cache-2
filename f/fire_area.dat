5|$|On April 17, 2014, Stanislaus National Forest {{issued an}} order closing the {{majority}} of the burn area to the public through November 18, 2014, citing safety issues from potential falls of heavily burned trees, rock falls, and uneven ground. The decision was met with disappointment by morel mushroom hunters who had looked forward to extensive post-fire fruiting of this highly sought-after mushroom. The safety rationale was questioned, as Yosemite National Park, which largely prohibits mushroom collecting, had opened up the burn areas within its boundaries to the public earlier in the month. Some mushroom hunters stated that {{they would be willing to}} sign liability waivers in order to enter the area, but the Forest Service rejected this idea, stating they were ultimately responsible for the safety of those entering the area. Extensive harvesting of morels in the Rim <b>Fire</b> <b>area</b> nevertheless took place in May 2014, in a few cases legally by special permit, but in most cases through illegal harvesting. The closure of the burn area was also criticized by the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors for, among other reasons, causing the cancellation of grazing allotments by local ranchers.|$|E

40|$|In current mining practice, {{the most}} often used methods of cooling {{spatially}} sealed <b>fire</b> <b>areas</b> are: natural cooling, cooling by nitrogen, cooling by water and inert foam and cooling by combustion product recirculation. The technology of cooling with nitrogen represents two variants- the use of liquid nitrogen or nitrogen gas {{in the area of}} closed mine workings. From a technical and safety points of view the application of liquid nitrogen is today considered unsatisfactory, while the use of nitrogen gas seams to be highly safe technology for cooling explosion-proof sealed <b>fire</b> <b>areas.</b> Another possibility for cooling <b>fire</b> <b>areas</b> in deep coal mines is so-called natural cooling, where economical costs are indeed zero, but comparing to cooling processes induced by the application of cooling technologies a longer time period necessary for the natural refrigeration of <b>fire</b> <b>areas</b> causes financial losses.

25|$|The {{teams were}} ferried into {{action by the}} H-34 Kingbees of the RVNAF 219th Helicopter Squadron and {{assorted}} U.S. Army aviation units in the Prairie <b>Fire</b> <b>area,</b> and by the U.S. Air Force helicopters of the 20th Special Operations Squadron in the Salem House area. By the end of 1969, SOG was authorized 394 U.S. personnel, but {{it is useful to}} compare those numbers to the actual strengths of the operational elements. There were 1,041 Army, 476 Air Force, 17 Marine Corps, and seven CIA personnel assigned to those units. They were supported by 3,068 SCUs, and 5,402 South Vietnamese and third-country civilian employees, leading to a total of 10,210 military personnel and civilians either assigned to or working for MACSOG.|$|E
25|$|Command and Control North (CCN) at Danang, {{commanded}} by a lieutenant colonel, used 60 recon teams and two exploitation battalions (four companies of three platoons). Command and Control Central (CCC) at Kontum, also {{commanded by}} a lieutenant colonel, used 30 teams and one exploitation battalion. During 1969 404 recon missions and 48 exploitation force operations {{were conducted in}} Laos. To give {{an example of the}} cost of such operations, during the year 20 Americans were killed, 199 wounded, and nine went missing in the Prairie <b>Fire</b> <b>area.</b> Casualties among the Special Commando Units (SCUs – pronounced Sues), as the indigenous mercenaries were titled, were: 57 killed, 270 wounded, and 31 missing. Command and Control South (CCS) at Ban Me Thuot , also commanded by a lieutenant colonel, consisted of 30 teams and an exploitation battalion. Since the use of exploitation forces was forbidden in Cambodia, these troops were utilized in securing launch sites, providing installation security, and conducting in-country missions. During the year, 454 reconnaissance operations were conducted in Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Urdu novels {{focused on}} urban social life, {{eventually}} widening in scope to include rural social life. They also covered the changing times under the progressive writing movement inspired by Sajjad Zaheer. However, {{the independence of}} Pakistan in 1947 greatly affected the novel, bringing up questions of identity and migration {{as can be seen}} in the major works of Abdullah Hussain and Quratulain Haider. Towards the end of the last century the novel took a serious turn towards the contemporary life and realities of the young generations of India. The most significant novels of the current generation of Indian novelists in Urdu, which demonstrate a new confidence in contemporary life, are Makaan by Paigham Afaqui, Do Gaz Zameen by Abdus Samad, and Pani by Ghazanfer. These works, especially Makaan, brought the Urdu novel out of the prevailing themes of the independence of Pakistan in 1947 and identity issues and took it into the realm of modern-day realities and issues of life in India. Makaan influenced many English writers such as Vikram Seth, who turned to novel writing. These Urdu novels further affected significant works such as Andhere Pag by Sarwat Khan, Numberdar Ka Neela by S M Ashraf and <b>Fire</b> <b>Area</b> by Ilyas Ahmed Gaddi. Paigham Afaqui's second major novel, Paleeta, was published in 2011 and depicts the tension of the political sickening of a common Indian citizen in the six decades after India's independence. Bewildered by the disappointing state of democracy and the transformation of Indian society into a mental desert the central character dies after leaving behind his writings which catch fire.|$|E
40|$|Jharia {{coalfield}} is a {{major source}} of prime coking coal in India. This coalfield has witnessed unparallel fire problems since 1916 affecting seams IV to XVII. At present there are as many as 65 active mine fires spread over 17. 32 sq. km areas affecting the micro and macro environment adversely. The impact of mine fires has been noticed on all segments of environment viz. air, water and land. This paper discusses the variations in trace elements concentration in top soil and soil infiltration rates in some fire affected coal mines vis-a-vis areas not affected by fire. Soil pollution index was also calculated for each of the study areas taking into consideration the critical concentration of different trace elements in the soil. The soil in <b>fire</b> <b>areas</b> showed higher concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cd, Cr and Ni and lower values of B and Mo compared to non-fire and intermediate <b>fire</b> <b>areas.</b> As, Hg and Se were absent in soil of all the stations. Based on the trace element study and soil pollution index, it can be concluded that non-fire areas are slightly polluted, whereas intermediate and active <b>fire</b> <b>areas</b> are moderately polluted. In addition, the soil infiltration rates are higher in <b>fire</b> <b>areas</b> compared to non-fire and intermediate <b>fire</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

[...] Approximately 300 people were evacuated from the Camp Sherman area. [...] By the end of the day, there were 862 firefighters working on the fire. This included 24 handcrews, 21 pumper trucks, 2 bulldozers, and 4 helicopters plus 150 management and support personnel. [...] In addition, both President George W.

[...] The Booth <b>Fire</b> <b>area</b> expanded on the north and northeast flanks, igniting islands of unburned fuel. [...] The fire became active on the south flank drawing firefighters back to Hoodoo and Santiam Pass to protect structures in those areas. [...] The fire also expanded its west perimeter, burning into thick timber near Lost Lake. [...] However, firefighters successfully defended existing lines on the southern and eastern perimeters of the fire. [...] By the end of the day, the interagency incident management team estimated that the fire was 20 percent contained.|$|E
