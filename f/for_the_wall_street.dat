Erskine maintained faith in the Rockne and rashly had the directors declare huge dividends in 1930 and 1931. He also acquired 95% of the White Motor Company's stock at an inflated price and in cash. By 1933, the banks were owed $6 million, though current assets exceeded that figure. On March 18, 1933, Studebaker entered receivership. Erskine was pushed out of the presidency {{in favor of more}} cost-conscious managers. Albert R. Erskine committed suicide on July 1, 1933, leaving it to successors Harold Vance and Paul Hoffman to deal with the problems.|$|E
