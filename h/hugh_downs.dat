In February 1979, ABC sold its recording division to MCA Inc. for $20 million; the label was discontinued by March 5 of that year, {{and all of its}} 300 employees were laid off (the rights to the works of ABC Records and all of MCA's other labels have since been acquired by Universal Music Group).|$|E

5|$|At , Hughes faced future UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, winning via {{unanimous}} decision. Hughes {{started the}} action by taking Sherk down immediately, passing to half guard. Sherk {{was able to}} stand {{for a few seconds}} before <b>Hughes</b> took him <b>down</b> again. In round two, they started to trade punches, but eventually <b>Hughes</b> took Sherk <b>down.</b> Like the first round, they stood up for a moment. At the beginning of the third round, Sherk took <b>Hughes</b> <b>down,</b> while <b>Hughes</b> attempted a kimura from the bottom. A late stand up led to a second takedown by Sherk. Round 4 saw Hughes using his strength to control the challenger on the ground. Sherk took <b>Hughes</b> <b>down</b> again in the fifth round, but the champion controlled {{the rest of the time}} sprawl-and-brawling as he finished on top. With the victory, he became the first man to ever defeat Sherk.|$|R

25|$|For the program's first 25 years, weather {{reports were}} {{delivered}} by the host or newsreader. Dave Garroway illustrated the day's forecast by drawing fronts and areas of precipitation on a big chalkboard map of the United States, based on information gathered earlier in the morning from the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C. Subsequent hosts John Chancellor and <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> dropped the chalkboard weather map concept, and instead read a prepared weather summary over a still image of a weather map. When the show converted to all-color broadcasts in 1965, weather maps were prepared and projected on a screen behind Frank Blair, who delivered the forecast immediately after his news summaries. Following Blair's retirement on March 14, 1975, Lew Wood took over the newsreader and weather reporting duties. When Floyd Kalber was brought in as newsreader in 1976, Wood was relegated to weather, sports, roving reporter assignments, and presenting live on-air commercials until his departure in 1978.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, at 9 {{years of}} age, Balukas competed {{in her first}} Billiard Congress of America U.S. Open {{straight}} pool championship, taking [...] 5th place among a field of adults. In the next two U.S. Opens, in 1970 and 1971, she placed 4th and 3rd, respectively. By that time she was already fairly well known, having had additional television appearances alongside such billiard stars and celebrities as Willie Mosconi, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Falk, <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> and Sonny Fox. [...] She would later appear on television many more times, in addition to broadcasts of pool matches, including an interview on The Mike Douglas Show airing on January 11, 1977 with Bernadette Peters and David Niven.|$|E

2500|$|Today host Dave Garroway {{selected}} Les Brown's [...] "Sentimental Journey" [...] as the program's original theme music, {{which was}} used during Garroway's entire run from 1952 to 1961. In 1962, when <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> became host, Django Reinhardt's [...] "Melodie au Crepuscule" [...] {{was chosen as the}} new theme; it was replaced in 1963 by [...] "Misty", an instrumental ballad composed by Erroll Garner and performed by Bobby Hackett and John B. Seng.|$|E
2500|$|From 1952 to 1964, {{a notable}} {{member of the}} cast was a woman, often an entertainer, the Today Girl. Usually, she {{discussed}} fashion and lifestyle, reported the weather, covered lighter-fare stories or engaged in verbal jousting with Garroway. Estelle Parsons {{was the first to}} hold the job, though her title at the time was [...] "Women's Editor". Upon her departure in 1955, the Today Girl name was adopted. The last to hold the position, Barbara Walters, discussed the job in her autobiography [...] She wrote that the era was before the Women's Movement, and it was believed that nobody would take a woman seriously reporting [...] "hard news"; Walters described the position as a [...] "tea pourer". In 1966, Walters was promoted to co-host alongside <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs,</b> and the Today Girl position was eliminated. Those who held the position were: ...|$|E
2500|$|Along with Arthur Godfrey, Arlene Francis, Steve Allen and Jack Paar, Garroway {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of the {{television}} talk show. Television commentator Steven D. Stark traces the origins of the style to Chicago. Garroway, Studs Terkel, and <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> all hosted relaxed, garrulous, extemporaneous shows in that city in the early 1950s. Earlier radio and television voices spoke with an authoritative [...] "announcer's" [...] intonation, resembling public oration, often dropping about a musical fifth on the last word of a sentence. Garroway {{was one of the}} broadcasters who introduced conversational style and tone to television, beginning some broadcasts as though the viewer were sitting in the studio with him, as in this November 20, 1957, introduction for the Today show: [...] "And how are you about the world today? Let's see what kind of shape it's in; there is a glimmer of hope." ...|$|E

[...] "The fellows back there (the Brewster committee) were giving him a bad time and told him the thing would never fly. So that is when I knew real well that he would take off if possible. I know darn well if it feels right, you are going to fly it. Mr. Hughes didn't want another pilot on board because someday someone would come out and say that Howard Hughes didn't fly it, so-and-so did." ...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the bout, Alves {{surprised}} many by missing {{weight for}} the welterweight bout—coming in at 174 pounds. Despite his opponent missing the 170-pound limit, Hughes accepted the fight at a catchweight. Despite the pre-fight blunder, Alves shocked the crowd by dominating the heavily favored former champion. After picking apart Hughes standing and displaying vastly-improved takedown defense throughout the first round, [...] "The Pitbull" [...] knocked <b>Hughes</b> <b>down</b> with a flying knee {{and followed him}} to the ground with punches early in the second, earning a TKO stoppage. In the post fight interview, Alves attributed not making weight to spraining his ankle two weeks before the fight.|$|R

It's quarter past eight now, and the fun begins at three; I could get there easy enough, and by Jupiter, I will! Got lunch all here, and money enough to pay this car-fare, I guess. If I haven't, I'll go a little further and take a horse-car. What a lark! here goes,"--and with a whoop of boyish delight at breaking bounds, away went <b>Hugh</b> <b>down</b> the long hill, like a colt escaped from its pasture.|$|R
2500|$|Over the years, Li'l Abner {{has been}} adapted to radio, {{animated}} cartoons, stage production, motion pictures and television. Capp has been compared, at various times, to Mark Twain, Dostoevski, Jonathan Swift, Lawrence Sterne and Rabelais. Fans {{of the strip}} ranged from novelist John Steinbeck, who called Capp [...] "possibly the best writer in the world today" [...] in 1953, and even earnestly recommended him for the Nobel Prize in literature—to media critic and theorist Marshall McLuhan, who considered Capp [...] "the only robust satirical force in American life." [...] John Updike, comparing Abner to a “hillbilly Candide,” added that the strip’s “richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the Voltairean.” Charlie Chaplin, William F. Buckley, Al Hirschfeld, Harpo Marx, Russ Meyer, John Kenneth Galbraith, Ralph Bakshi, Shel Silverstein, <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs,</b> Gene Shalit, Frank Cho, Daniel Clowes and (reportedly) even Queen Elizabeth have confessed to being fans of Li'l Abner.|$|E
2500|$|For {{those who}} had {{aspirations}} of becoming broadcasters, WMAQ {{was a good place}} to get started in the medium, even if the job was not on the air. [...] The station encouraged its young employees with dreams of working at a microphone by assisting with tuition for college broadcasting courses and holding workshops at the station where those with stars in their eyes were given the chance to display their skills in a [...] "real world" [...] setting. [...] Herb Kent, a Chicago radio pioneer, [...] first came to work in the mailroom at WMAQ as a young high school graduate in the late 1940s. He credits WMAQ and <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs,</b> who was then a [...] WMAQ staff announcer, with providing him with the tools and encouragement he needed. After getting some announcing experience, Kent returned to WMAQ, this time on the air as a radio actor.|$|E
2500|$|Radio from [...] "the Mart" [...] {{centered}} around the many studios on the 19th floor; only one studio, Studio F, was on the 20th. Like its Radio City Rockefeller Center counterpart, there were NBC pages (Bob Sirott {{was one of them}} in the late 1960s) and a host of staff announcers. [...] In 1947, <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> (Today Show and 20/20), Garry Moore (1915–1993) and Durward Kirby (1912–2000) were on the WMAQ staff, as was Mike Wallace, later of 60 Minutes fame. Dave Garroway (1913–1982) also arrived on the NBC airwaves via WMAQ with his 1160 Club playing big band and jazz in the 1940s. Garroway was also responsible for organizing a series of local jazz concerts and establishing a Chicago lounge [...] "Jazz Circuit" [...] in 1947 which revived interest in the music genre. In 1948 and 1949, Garroway was voted the nation's top Disk Jockey by his peers in Billboard's annual poll.|$|E

2500|$|NBC's {{last major}} radio {{programming}} push, beginning on June 12, 1955, was Monitor, {{a creation of}} NBC President Sylvester [...] "Pat" [...] Weaver, who also created the innovative programs Today, The Tonight Show and Home for the companion television network. Monitor was a continuous all-weekend mixture of music, news, interviews and features, {{with a variety of}} hosts including well-known television personalities Dave Garroway, <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs,</b> Ed McMahon, Joe Garagiola and Gene Rayburn. The potpourri show tried to keep vintage radio alive by featuring segments from Jim and Marian Jordan (in character as Fibber McGee and Molly); Peg Lynch's dialog comedy Ethel and Albert (with Alan Bunce); and iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan. Monitor was a success for a number of years, but after the mid-1960s, local stations, especially those in larger markets, were reluctant to break from their established formats to run non-conforming network programming. One exception was Toscanini: The Man Behind the Legend, a weekly series commemorating the great conductor's NBC broadcasts and recordings which ran for several years beginning in 1963. After Monitor ended its 20-year run on January 26, 1975, little remained of NBC network radio beyond hourly newscasts and news features, and Sunday morning religious program The Eternal Light.|$|E
