50|$|By 1870, {{virtually}} {{every type of}} hand-made lace (pillow lace, bobbin lace) had its machine-made copy. It became increasingly difficult for hand lacemakers {{to make a living}} from their work and most of the English <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> industry had disappeared by 1900.|$|E
50|$|For washing, starching, ironing and {{reassembling}} a poffer, a poffer maker received 9 cents. The {{price of}} an ordinary poffer was 35 guilders. A mourning poffer costed 15 guilders. A chic poffer with <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> and a new under hat costed approximately 100 guilders. The price depended {{on the amount of}} lace and the number of floral motifs. A special poffer could cost as much as 500 guilders. Usually, a farmer's wife had two or three poffers.|$|E

Wigs were made of human, horse, and yak hair and sewn onto a frame with silken thread {{were meant to be}} obvious as wigs and not the wearer's actual hair. Powdered wigs in rows of curls, known as periwigs, were adopted as court dress in many cultures with elaborate curls and style.|$|E

By the 1940s, Stakis was involved in his first restaurant, the Victory in Glasgow, whose affordable prices began {{to change the way}} Scottish people dined out. By the 1960s, he had a chain of thirty restaurants and hotels throughout Scotland. In 1962, he bought the Dunblane Hydro Hotel, which was run-down yet within six months he had returned it to profit. Stakis was to make his home in the grounds of that hotel.|$|E
50|$|The Old Loughborough {{became the}} {{standard}} lacemaking machine, particularly the 1820 form {{known as the}} Circular producing two-twist plain net. The smooth, unpatterned tulle produced on these machines was {{on a par with}} real, <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> net. Heathcoat’s bobbinet machine is so ingeniously designed that the ones used today have suffered little alteration. However during the next 30 years inventors were patenting improvements to their machines. The ones that stand out are the Pusher machine, the Levers machine (now spelled Leavers) and the Nottingham lace curtain machine. Each of these developed into separate machines. Others were the Traverse Warp machine and the Straight Bolt machine.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} period (approx. 1620-1800), sprigs of various designs were worked {{separately}} from the net ground by hand, then put together {{near the end of}} production. Later (approx. 1800-1840), <b>handmade</b> Honiton <b>lace</b> became obsolete in light of the invention of machine-made net, which was much cheaper to produce. Historian Emily Jackson describes the design changes fostered by the convenience of this approach: ...|$|R
50|$|During long {{cold winter}} nights, Swiss farmers and their {{families}} concentrated on handicrafts that could be sold for extra income. This tradition, dating back hundreds of years, {{led to the development}} of distinctive Swiss lace, an intricate, interlaced pattern of threads, looped, twisted or braided to other threads, known throughout the world for its quality and workmanship. <b>Handmade</b> Swiss <b>lace</b> was often used in decorative clothing, curtains, table linens and many other applications.|$|R
50|$|Mundillo is a {{craft of}} <b>handmade</b> bobbin <b>lace</b> that is {{cultivated}} and honored {{on the island}} of Puerto Rico. The term 'mundillo' means 'little world', referring to the cylindrical pillow on which the lace maker ('Mundillista') weaves intricate designs. The decorative lace is created using wooden bobbins about the diameter of a pencil, which are wound with thread that is twisted and crossed to form a pattern. Depending on the pattern, as few as two dozen or as many as several hundred bobbins may be used.|$|R

In particular, the 'Punk Trousseau' collection of 1998 - an edgy reworking of traditional materials such as embroidery, tartan and <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> {{at the height of}} the Cool Britannia era in UK culture and fashion - garnered international attention and remains influential. The label is also credited with making cashmere popular with a younger audience and with creating one of the most imitated designs of the 1990s - the striped twinset. Clements has characterised their style as [...] "clumsy couture"; the V&A noted their tendency to: [...] "use couture within a ready-to-wear context".|$|E
5000|$|Bobbin lace {{was brought}} to Puerto Rico from Spain, where it had thrived in major {{commercial}} markets {{as well as a}} cottage industry in Galicia, Castilla, and Catalonia. In Spain, lace is called encaje, because it was worked on separately and then joined to material (the Spanish word for [...] "join" [...] is encajar). In Puerto Rico, the towns of Moca, Isabela, and Aguadilla, all in the northwestern part of the island, are famous for mundillo lace. In Moca, commonly known as the Capital or cradle of Mundillo, there is an annual festival dedicated to the <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> as well as a museum, El Museo Del Mundillo.|$|E
50|$|Of {{exceptional}} note {{is a rare}} {{collection of}} 16th-, 17th-, and 18th-century weavers' pattern books, including several early editions of Nathanael Lumscher's Weber Kunst- und Bild-Buch. Beautifully illustrated interior decoration books offer glimpses into the trends {{of the late nineteenth}} century and many volumes provide rich reference material on the history of subjects encompassing ink, wallpaper, <b>handmade</b> <b>lace,</b> carpet and rug making, and textile production. Crochet, knitting and needlework pattern books provide instruction and inspiration for hand work projects, while informing on the aesthetics of their time. A particular star of the collection is the Sample Book of Trims with its many samples of elaborately beaded appliques, metallic yarn embroidery and elegantly woven ribbon trimmings.|$|E
5000|$|Bobbinet tulle or genuine tulle is a {{specific}} type of tulle which has been made in the United Kingdom since the invention of the bobbinet machine [...] Heathcoat coined the term [...] "bobbin net", or bobbinet as it is spelled today, to distinguish this machine-made tulle from the handmade [...] "pillow lace".

50|$|Several costly {{embroidered}} vestments {{have been}} donated by benefactors. Among those donated are those from Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria, which are preserved to this day. A notable garment {{in the collection}} is an ermine cloak placed on the statue the first Sunday after Easter, which is the anniversary day of the coronation of the statue by the Archbishop of Prague Ernst Adalbert von Harrach on 4 April 1655. In 1713 the clothing began to be changed according to the liturgical norms. Other valuable garments worn by the image are vestments studded with various gemstones, embroidered with gold, and silk fabrics as well as <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> customised purposely for the statue.|$|E
50|$|The plain, cream-coloured satin gown {{was made}} from fabric woven in Spitalfields, east London, and trimmed with a deep flounce and {{trimmings}} of lace hand-made in Honiton and Beer, in Devon. This demonstrated support for English industry, particularly the cottage industry for lace. The <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> motifs were appliquéd onto cotton machine-made net. Orange flower blossoms, a symbol of fertility, also trimmed the dress and made up Victoria's wreath, which she wore instead of a tiara over her veil. The veil, which matched the flounce of the dress, was four yards in length and 0.75 yards wide. Her jewellery consisted of diamond earrings and necklace, and a sapphire brooch given to her by Albert. The slippers she wore matched the white colour of the dress. The train of the dress, carried by her bridesmaids, measured 18 ft long.|$|E
50|$|Bobbinet {{machines}} were invented in 1808 by John Heathcoat. He studied the hand movements of a Northamptonshire manual lace maker and reproduced {{them in the}} roller-locker machine.

50|$|Tønder lace {{was mainly}} {{made during the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries. Production started in 1647 when a {{merchant}} brought lacemakers from Westphalia to Tønder to teach lacemaking to the general population. Christian IV protected the manufacture of local lace, and didn't wear any foreign lace. In 1712 several lacemakers from Brabant accompanied the troops of King Frederick IV on their return from the Netherlands, bringing new techniques. Tønder lace was a major industry, {{and most of the}} region's girls were employed in making it. Little boys, before they were strong enough to work in the fields, were also taught to make lace. In 1801 20,000 people in Tønder and the immediately surrounding area were employed making lace. When machine-made lace was introduced in the late 1800s, the <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> industry gradually ceased to be economically important to the region. It never died out entirely though, and is still made today, mostly by hobbyists.|$|E
50|$|The Princess lace is also {{a needle}} work. It's an {{application}} on a netting. Machine made nettings are used since 1850 {{in the production of}} lace. These first nettings were produced in the hope it could save time and that lacemakers could be able to finish a work faster. In the early 20th century the machine made netting that could be produced were from a different quality, more regular, bigger quantities. The production of Princess lace started at that time, but it was after world war II that this lace really became famous. It's the last <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> work that's still fine enough to be used for wedding veil and christening gowns.As these 2 types of laces are using a machine made base (the tape or the netting) some purists don't accept these techniques received the 'Handmade Belgian lace' tag. Discussions are not closed about this. Only thing everybody agrees : these 2 modern technics of lace making asks a lot of handwork (80%) to be realized, they're art works and it's unfortunately a dying art.|$|E

Ninety percent of what you see inside, from furniture to paintings, is original. Though the family obviously kept an impressive collection of Limoges porcelain, French gilded mirrors, Italian marble tables, and Baccarat crystal chandeliers here, it wasn't their primary residence; the house was used mostly to host family members in transit, so the furnishings were rather eclectic. The three bedrooms are decorated in grand style, though, with <b>handmade</b> <b>lace,</b> embroidered sheets, and hand-painted glass. There is a gorgeous and very Cuban leather sillón fumador (smoking chair) and, in the music room, the mid-18th-century American piano, one of only two of its type in Cuba.

40|$|The {{extent of}} the <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> {{industry}} {{in the nineteenth century}} is difficult to estimate. Most lacemakers were not given an occupation in the census. For instance, Belleek (in county Fermanagh) was one of the centres of <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> in Ireland. Of the fifty-one women active in the Belleek lace and sprigging class in January 1911, fifty-six per cent were given no occupation in the 1911 census manuscripts and four per cent were given occupations other than lacemaker. In Ireland, {{it is clear that the}} census statistics do not include the tens of thousands of women making lace for the home industries societies examined in this article. The statistics for lacemaking in England, Wales and Scotland (given in table one) are confused by the fact that no distinction is made between hand and machine-made lace...|$|E
40|$|<b>Handmade</b> <b>lace</b> figures {{prominently}} in Émile Zola’s The Ladies’ Paradise {{as one of}} the most intoxicating wares available for sale at the fictional Parisian department store. Zola repeatedly employs the seductive powers of lace as a metaphor to represent the excesses of female preoccupation with fashion and the accompanying excesses of consumption. As a purely decorative object of great value and beauty, lace has seduced consumers of fashionable dress for centuries. This seduction arguably reached it apogee in the mid nineteenth century when the availability of a wide variety of both machine- and hand-made lace enabled its inclusion in almost every element of female dress. A length of 3 1 / 2 -inch wide needle-lace border from the University of Rhode Island Historic Textile and Costume Collection is a superb example of the type that Madame de Boves may have stolen from The Ladies’ Paradise when “ravaged by a furious, irresistible passion for dress. ...|$|E
40|$|Lace {{making is}} a {{traditional}} art on the Island of Gozo and many Gozitans are extremely proud of their unique and valued bobbin lace works. Lace not only once fulfilled an economic role within {{the lives of the}} Gozitans; it also had a significant social aspect to fulfill. On present day Gozo, <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> has not retained its important economic role as it has been replaced in the recent past with factory and tourist related jobs; as well as the fact that the price of lace has not kept up with the cost to weave these intricate pieces. Not only is the reasons for the decline in lace’s economic function a focus, so is whether or not this art form will continue after the current older generation of Gozitans are gone. This is an important question to be asked since Gozitan lace is distinctive from any other form of lace and it is a highly prized item by Gozitan and foreigners alike. The capacity in which lace will continue is significant and what is being done by the people themselves to save this art form is also taken into consideration. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION In her {{publication}} 2 ̆ 2 Peacocks and Penguins: The Political Economy of European Cloth and Colours 2 ̆ 2, Jane Schneider (1978) {{describes the}} flow of gold and slaves from northern Europe to the Middle East in exchange for colourful textiles, during the Middle Ages. Schneider argues that European-made black cloth and clothing constituted both practical and symbolic means to resist luxury textiles from the Orient, {{and in this way}} reverse the balance of trade and power. I believe that, a few centuries later, lace played a similar role in this process; uti 1 izing 1 ocally grown and processed white 1 inen thread and the intensive labour of European women, lace (as a totally European luxury textile) had both symbolic and economic implications for the development of European civilisation from the 15 th century onwards. Between the 15 th and the 18 th century, the Roman Catholic Church {{played an important role in}} this process by utilizing the free labour of nuns to make elaborate ecclesiastical textiles decorated with lace (Gusic, 1969). In the secular domain, the aristocracy developed an insatiable appetite for the ever evolving quality, as well as sheer quantity, of lace. The lower classes were involved in the production of lace in specialized workshops, but sumptuary laws prevented them from wearing much of it. In the early 19 th century the production of <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> declined throughout Europe, being partially replaced by machine made lace. As the 19 th century progressed, however, the reaction against machine made products resulted in a revival of the trade in old antique lace, and renewed production of <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> which continued well into the 20 th century (Kraatz, 1989), Only it was now a different Europe. Aristocracy competed with museums to acquire rare, antique lace. Museums sought prestige, while dealers sought material profits, by negotiating the standards of authenticity of antique lace. At the same time, newly produced lace was displayed as 2 ̆ 7 women 2 ̆ 7 s art 2 ̆ 7 on trade fairs and exhibitions in European capitals. The majority of the new production was no longer centered around monasteries and specialized workshops, but around central schools in European cities, which ran subsidiary lace schools and home industries in rural areas (Pfannschmidt, 1975). The consumption of lace was no longer restricted to the Church and aristocracy, but spread to the emerging bourgeoisie, and even to the lower classes and peasant populations (Bezic-Bozanic 2 ̆ 7, 1984; Polemitou, 1980; Schneider, 1980) ...|$|E
40|$|Common Grounds is a {{collaboration}} between artist Sarah Casey, The Bowes Museum and curator Annabel Talbot to literally bring to light hidden aspects of the Blackborne Lace collection. The Fashion and textiles galleries will be filled with an installation of transparent drawings which when illuminated reveal images of bonnets which have lain unexamined and overlooked in trunks for 70 years. The bonnets depicted belong to a less known section of the internationally significant Blackborne Lace Collection. Arthur Blackborne (1856 - 1952) was a renowned connoisseur of lace and ran Blackborne & Co. a lace dealership in London. Throughout his career he searched through the attics of the British aristocracy and travelled across Europe to amass a collection {{of some of the}} finest surviving examples of <b>handmade</b> <b>lace</b> dating from the 16 th century. The entire Blackborne collection was generously donated to The Bowes Museum in 2007. In addition to the main collection, which is exceptional in its quality and quantity, the Museum received a secondary assemblage of items categorised as the B collection. This has been stored separately from the main collection and is an incidental group of objects, consisting mainly of remaining shop stock from Blackborne & Co. and lace items purchased through auctions. Unlike lace in the main Blackborne Collection, this B category lace is principally the lace of ordinary people. Consisting of reworked fragments of lace from a range of sources, the quality of the lace itself is uneven. Although some fragments of lace on these caps is close to 300 years old the bonnets remained in storage in carriage trunks since entering the museum hidden from view. About the project Over the part 2 years Casey has worked with The Bowes Museum and expert on Blackborne Lace, Annabel Talbot, to explore how drawing can both examine unseen aspects of the collection and present it creatively to the public audience. Casey has catalogued every lace bonnet through 54 ‘hidden’ drawings which appear like x-rays or scans, revealed only when held up to the light These will form an installation hung in space, recalling domestic washing lines. Drawings will appear to light up as viewers walk around them at 360 degrees. The drawings are presented alongside the lace caps themselves and the trunks in which they were until recently stored. Through considered study of individual bonnets from the B collection Casey’s drawing allows us to reflect and consider both notions of categorisation and the interpretation of history through object based research. The exhibition presents this b collection lace alongside a selection of the finest bonnets in the collection which have been recently conserved by the newly established conservation team at The Bowes Museum. This innovative approach to exhibiting aspects of the collection seeks to revalue this overlooked lace, bridging a gap between high art and everyday textiles of the general public...|$|E
