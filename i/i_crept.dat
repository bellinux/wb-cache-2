2500|$|From George Wilkins Kendall's {{account of}} the Texan Santa Fe Expedition: [...] "In their habits, they are clannish, social, and {{extremely}} convivial, never living alone like other animals, but, on the contrary, always found in villages or large settlements. They are a wild, frolicsome, madcap set of fellows when undisturbed, uneasy and ever on the move, and appear to take especial delight in chattering away the time, and visiting from hole to hole to gossip and talk over each other's affairs—at least so their actions would indicate. On several occasions <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> close to their villages, without being observed, to watch their movements. Directly in the centre {{of one of them}} I particularly noticed a very large dog, {{sitting in front of the}} door or entrance to his burrow, and by his own actions and those of his neighbors it really seemed as though he was the president, mayor, or chief—at all events, he was the 'big dog' of the place. For at least an hour I secretly watched the operations in this community. During that time the large dog I have mentioned received at least a dozen visits from his fellow-dogs, which would stop and chat with him a few moments, and then run off to their domiciles. All this while he never left his post for a moment, and I thought I could discover a gravity in his deportment not discernible in those by which he was surrounded. Far is it from me to say that the visits he received were upon business, or had anything to do with the local government of the village; but it certainly appeared so. If any animal has a system of laws regulating the body politic, it is certainly the prairie dog." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>crept</b> slowly out; {{but beyond}} a slight rustle as my head {{appeared}} outside the tent I heard nothing, though I waited several minutes and searched about among the underbrush. But no sooner was I {{back in the}} tent and quiet than there it was again, and repeated three or four times, now here, now there, within the next ten minutes. <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> out again, with no better success than before.|$|E
60|$|I {{found myself}} tottering {{out of the}} room. The thing {{was too much for}} me. <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> into Jeeves's den.|$|E
60|$|THE SERPENT. You and Adam. <b>I</b> have <b>crept</b> {{through the}} grass, and hidden, {{and listened to}} you.|$|R
60|$|And {{yet such}} was the agony of my fear, {{that it seemed to}} me as though <b>I</b> only <b>crept</b> along the ground like a tortoise.|$|R
60|$|<b>I,</b> too, <b>crept</b> {{nearer to}} it.--About a yard away {{there was a}} {{projection}} of the front. I stole into the deep corner and waited. A few feet from me I knew that she too was waiting.|$|R
60|$|Then I left, {{and not too}} soon, for as <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> {{down the}} darksome passage, I heard it open behind me.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{time the}} gal {{was sitting at}} the door of the tent. <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> up behind, cut a slit in the skins, and got inside. As I expected, there was no one in there, the squaws as was {{watching}} her was outside; so <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> up close to the entrance, and I says to her, 'Hush! don't move, your scout Dick is here.' She gave a little tremble when I began, and then sat as still as a mouse.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought it}} was that woman, but I 'ad to make sure. When it came the third time <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> up to the gate.|$|E
6000|$|Boone's {{face grew}} as stern {{as that of}} the speaker, and the shadow <b>I</b> knew <b>crept</b> into his eyes. [...] "I think I do. My wife died for want of comforts that Lane might twice collect his debt, and I am not likely to forget it to-night," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|<b>I,</b> too, <b>crept</b> away, {{and when}} I was safe {{outside in the}} pale evening sunlight, peered back into the dell. There under the dark trees she was no longer, but round and round that cage of passion, {{fluttering}} and wailing through the leaves, over the black water, was the magpie, flighting on its twilight wings.|$|R
60|$|Slowly the penumbra, {{the shadow}} of a shadow, crept on over the bright surface, and as it <b>crept</b> <b>I</b> heard deep gasps of fear rising from the {{multitude}} around.|$|R
60|$|The wind howled dismally without, and {{the rain}} beat furiously against the windows. <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> toward him and seated myself on a low stool beside his chair.|$|E
60|$|Here we lay {{until the}} quick {{transition}} from daylight to darkness had passed. Then <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> out {{to approach the}} fortress walls {{in search of a}} way within.|$|E
6000|$|Once on my mother's breast, a child, <b>I</b> <b>crept,</b> [...] Holding my breath; [...] There, {{safe and}} sad, lay shuddering, and wept [...] At the dark mystery of Death.|$|E
6000|$|I {{shall have}} letters of {{importance}} to-morrow. Which,----,----, or ----? heigho!------is in my heart,----in my head,----in my eye, {{and the single}} one, Heaven knows where. All write, and will be answered. [...] "Since <b>I</b> have <b>crept</b> in favour with myself, I must maintain it;" [...] [5] but I never [...] "mistook my person," [...] [6] though I think others have.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{would attempt}} it. I {{will not go}} back until he {{consents}} to my living apart from him. And, to tell the truth, I am better here for awhile. They say that the sick animals always creep somewhere under cover. I am a sick animal, and now that <b>I</b> have <b>crept</b> here <b>I</b> will remain till I am stronger. How terribly anxious you must be about Tankerville!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a violoncello, if your Majesty {{is pleased}} to remember," [...] said the little jealous man, [...] "not a common fiddle; though, for your Majesty's service, <b>I</b> would have <b>crept</b> even into a kit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep off, you fool!" [...] he cried. [...] "I won't kill him. I'm {{keeping my}} head. I shall {{know when to}} stop." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> away and waited.|$|E
6000|$|I {{blew out}} the candle, when I had looked at him again. As <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> on to the landing, Emily peeped from her room, whispering, [...] "Is he in bed?" ...|$|E
60|$|After {{giving them}} time to get well {{out of sight of}} our cave, Thuvan Dihn and <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> out and {{followed}} them, overtaking them when they were well into the hills.|$|E
6000|$|... "Massa," [...] whispered Peter, [...] "yesterday I jes' caught yer Brer Hornet a-loafin' {{around in}} the wood. 'Come wi' me,' says I, 'and bottled him in this yer {{pasteboard}} box,'" [...] showing one which had held Turkish tobacco. [...] "When I saw that Hebrew Jew wouldn't stir his pencil, <b>I</b> jes' <b>crept</b> up softly and dropped Brer Hornet down his neck. Then he jes' rose and went. Spec's he and Brer Hornet had business of their own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{all that}} trouble,' said he to himself, {{thinking}} {{as usual in}} Hindustani, 'for a horse's pedigree! Mahbub Ali should have come to me to learn a little lying. Every time before that I have borne a message it concerned a woman. Now it is men. Better. The tall man said that they will loose a great army to punish someone--somewhere--the news goes to Pindi and Peshawur. There are also guns. Would <b>I</b> had <b>crept</b> nearer. It is big news!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I {{stayed the}} great war and married the Khania {{and became the}} Khan; but better had it been for me if <b>I</b> had <b>crept</b> into her kitchen as a scullion, than into her chamber as a husband. For from the first she hated me, and the more I loved, the more she hated, till at our wedding feast she doctored me with that poison which made me loathe her, and thus {{divorced}} us; which made me mad also, eating into my brain like fire." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> {{closer to}} the antelope, sure this time of a good shot at a large buck, I {{suddenly}} saw something that caused me to forget all about my prey in wonderment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Man of the Mountains," [...] said Nod presently, [...] "would {{you hold}} me if <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> close {{and put my}} head over the edge? I {{would like to see}} how many Mulgars-deep we walk." ...|$|E
60|$|Madonna, {{wrapped in}} my cloak as she was, I set {{down upon the}} ground, and then <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> forward {{on hands and knees}} and thrust out my head, trusting to the {{darkness}} to envelop me.|$|E
60|$|On the {{occasion}} of {{my first visit to}} Lavedan I had disregarded--or, rather, Fate had contrived that I should disregard--Chatellerault's suggestion that I should go with all the panoply of power--with my followers, my liveries, and my equipages to compose the magnificence all France had come to associate with my name, and thus dazzle by my brilliant lustre the lady I was come to win. As you may remember, <b>I</b> had <b>crept</b> into the chateau like a thief in the night,--wounded, bedraggled, and of miserable aspect, seeking to provoke compassion rather than admiration.|$|R
60|$|January 31.--I {{received}} the young gentlemen to breakfast and expressed my resolution, {{which seemed to}} disappoint them, as perhaps they expected I should have been glad of such an offer. However, I have since thought there are these rejected parts of the Chronicles, which Cadell and Ballantyne criticised so severely, which might well enough make up a trifle of this kind, and settle the few accounts which, will I nill <b>I,</b> have <b>crept</b> in this New Year. So I have kept the treaty open. If I give them 100 pages I should expect £500.|$|R
60|$|Down--steadily down it <b>crept.</b> <b>I</b> took {{a frenzied}} {{pleasure}} in contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity. To the right--to the left--far and wide--with the shriek of a damned spirit; {{to my heart}} with the stealthy pace of the tiger! I alternately laughed and howled as the {{one or the other}} idea grew predominant.|$|R
60|$|They {{went back}} once {{more into the}} house, and <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> away, afraid of being discovered, and {{returned}} to the yacht, sick at heart, not knowing how I should ever venture again to meet Césarine.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>crept</b> {{close to}} {{him and told him}} in a breathless undertone, and I knew that I was shaking the while. He listened gravely, and when I had {{finished}} laid a firm hand on my head.|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{would speak}} {{to me in the}} gardens, though I felt that they ought to have invited me to drink, and <b>I</b> <b>crept</b> back to my hotel to eat six {{different}} fresh chutnies with one curry.|$|E
50|$|Following World War <b>I,</b> {{development}} slowly <b>crept</b> {{onto the}} island. Summer camps were {{started in the}} 1920s, including Camp Quinipet, a United Methodist Church camp and retreat center on Rocky Point Road. On West Neck Harbor, developers Albert and Fred Dickerson built houses for what is today called Montclair Colony. Homes were built on Silver Beach, Ram Island, and Hilo Farms.|$|R
6000|$|Today I saw {{you when}} you did not see me. I was walking on the [...] shore, and as I came around a rock you {{were sitting on the}} [...] other side. I drew back a little and looked at you. Your hands [...] were clasped over your knees; your hat had fallen back, and [...] the sea wind was ruffling your hair. Your face was lifted to [...] the sky, your lips were parted, your eyes were full of light. [...] You seemed to be {{listening}} to something that made you happy. <b>I</b> [...] <b>crept</b> gently away, that I might not mar your dream. Of what [...] were you thinking, Una? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You must know,' {{said the}} fox, 'that {{in this village}} there is a rich man who makes in the summer enough cheeses to last him for the whole year, and keeps them in an old well, now dry, in his courtyard. By the well hang two buckets on a pole that were used, in former days, to draw up water. For many nights <b>I</b> have <b>crept</b> down to the palace, and have lowered myself in the bucket, {{bringing}} home with me enough cheese to feed the children. All I beg of you is to come with me, and, instead of hunting chickens and such things, I will make a good meal off cheese before I die.' ...|$|R
