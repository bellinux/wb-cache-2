50|$|The Global Drifter Program (GDP) (formerly {{known as}} the Surface Velocity Program (SVP)), was {{conceived}} by Prof. Peter Niiler, {{with the objective of}} collecting measurements of surface ocean currents, sea surface temperature and sea-level atmospheric pressure using drifters. It is the principal component of the Global Surface <b>Drifting</b> <b>Buoy</b> Array, a branch of NOAA's Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and a scientific project of the Data Buoy Cooperation Panel (DBCP). The project originated in February 1979 as part of the TOGA/Equatorial Paciﬁc Ocean Circulation Experiment (EPOCS) and the first large-scale deployment of drifters was in 1988 with the goal of mapping the tropical Pacific Ocean's surface circulation. The current goal of the project is to use 1250 satellite-tracked surface drifting buoys to make accurate and globally dense in-situ observations of mixed layer currents, sea surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, winds and salinity, and to create a system to process the data. Horizontal transports in the oceanic mixed layer measured by the GDP are relevant to biological and chemical processes as well as physical ones.|$|E

She then spent the next several weeks undergoing voyage repairs, first at the New York Navy Yard, from 19 to 25 July, and then at Tietjen and Lang’s Dockyard, Hoboken, New Jersey, from 25 July to 27 August. She shifted to New London (28-30 August), then sailed for Charleston, South Carolina. One day out of New London, she went to general quarters early in the mid watch on 31 August and trained her guns on a “suspicious object.” The dark shape, however, quickly disappeared from sight in the thick haze and the ship’s own smoke. Then, after voyage repairs at Charleston (2-6 August), she put to sea as escort for a convoy of three 110 ft submarine chasers assigned to the French Navy: , , and [...] Reaching Bermuda on 10 September, she sailed five days later for the Azores in company with cruiser [...] and tugs Arctic and Goliah and a covey of submarine chasers, and arrived at her destination on 27 September.

The {{objectives of the}} workshop were to: (1) educate potential users (managers and scientists) about the current capabilities and uses of <b>drifting</b> <b>buoy</b> technologies; (2) {{provide an opportunity for}} users (managers and scientists) to experience first hand the deployment and retrieval of various drifting buoys, as well as experience the capabilities of the buoys' technologies; (3) engage manufacturers with scientists and managers in discussions on drifting buoys' capabilities and their requirements to promote further applications of these systems; (4) promote a dialogue about realistic advantages and limitations of current <b>drifting</b> <b>buoy</b> technologies; and (5) develop a set of key recommendations for advancing both the capabilities and uses of <b>drifting</b> <b>buoy</b> technologies for coastal watershed and ecosystem modeling. To achieve these goals, representatives from research, academia, industry, and resource management were invited to participate in this workshop. Attendees obtained "hands on" experience as they participated in the deployment and retrieval of various <b>drifting</b> <b>buoy</b> systems on Big Portage Lake, a 644 acre lake northwest of Ann Arbor. Working groups then convened for discussions on current commercial usages and environmental monitoring approaches including; user requirements for drifting buoys, current status of <b>drifting</b> <b>buoy</b> systems and enabling technologies, and the challenges and strategies for bringing new drifting buoys "on-line". The following general recommendations were made to: 1). organize a testing program of drifting buoys for marketing their capabilities to resource managers and users. 2). develop a fact sheet to highlight the utility of drifting buoys. 3). facilitate technology transfer for advancements in drifter buoys that may be occurring through military funding and development in order to enhance their technical capability for environmental applications.

40|$|Sea-surface geostrophic {{velocities}} for the Kuroshio region {{calculated from}} TOPEX/ POSEIDON altimetry data together with in situ oceanographic data are compared with surface velocities derived from <b>drifting</b> <b>buoy</b> trajectories. The geostrophic velocities agree {{well with the}} observed velocities, suggesting that the Kuroshio surface layer is essentially in geostrophic balance, within measurement error. The comparison is improved a little when the centrifugal acceleration is taken into account. The observed velocities are divided into the temporal mean and fluctuation components, and the partitioning of velocities between these two components is examined. For the Kuroshio region, most of the fluctuation components of the velocities derived from drifting buoys {{are found to be}} positive. This result suggests that Eulerian mean velocities for the Kuroshio region estimated from <b>drifting</b> <b>buoy</b> data tend to be larger than actual means, due to the buoy’s tendency to sample preferentially in the high-velocity Kuroshio.
