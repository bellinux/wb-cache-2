5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier <b>knurled</b> pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{parallel}} mount {{accepts a}} solid bar {{parallel to the}} drum shell. There are many bar sizes and profiles, mostly either round and <b>knurled</b> or hexagonal. There is a some compatibility, {{but it is not}} universal. Some manufacturers such as Tama Drums and Gibraltar Hardware even produce a single fitting that can be used either singly as a hanging tom mount, or in sets of three to attach the floor tom legs.|$|E
25|$|Fixed {{renewable}} bushings {{are used}} in applications where the liner {{is meant to be}} used until it wears out. Slip renewable bushings are designed to be interchangeable with a given sized liner so that two different sized slip renewable bushings can be used in one liner bushing. This facilitates the ability to do multiple machining operations that require different inner diameter (ID) bushings, such as drilling and reaming. They usually have <b>knurled</b> heads so they can be easily removed.|$|E
5000|$|Cut <b>knurling</b> often employs {{automatic}} feed, the tooling for cut <b>knurling</b> {{resembles that}} for form <b>knurling</b> {{with the exception}} that the <b>knurls</b> have sharp edges and are presented to the work at an angle allowing the sharp edges to cut the work, angled, diamond and straight <b>knurling</b> are all supported by cut <b>knurling</b> [...] It is impossible to cut <b>knurling</b> [...] "Like extremely coarse pitch threads" [...] both because lathe gear trains will not support such longitudinal speeds and because reasonable cutting speeds {{would be impossible to}} achieve.|$|R
50|$|A popular myth is that rolled <b>knurls</b> are {{somewhat}} more complicated to design than cut <b>knurls</b> because the outer {{diameter of the}} work piece must be chosen to allow the roller to roll an integral number of patterns around the workpiece, in practice if the <b>knurl</b> is applied positively, it will engage with its own impression and create a proper <b>knurl</b> on any diameter of work. The integer number of <b>knurls</b> for any given diameter typically varies by three repetitions from the bottom {{to the top of}} the pattern. By comparison, for cut <b>knurls,</b> the spacing of the cuts is not preset and can be adjusted to allow an integral number of patterns around the workpiece no matter what the diameter of the workpiece.|$|R

25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using <b>knurled</b> rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the tapered rollers. This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|E
2500|$|The Compact rotary {{row counter}} was {{manufactured}} in England in the 1950s to 1960s under a pending patent application, although the general design was similar {{in principle to}} the early I.X. Products version. It had the same precise engineering for control of friction, and central metal spring suitable for needles up to 3.5mm. [...] The basic Compact, however, had a central <b>knurled</b> grip-band, which made the gadget easier to hold and to turn quickly and precisely. [...] The earlier version of the late 1950s to early 1960s had red numerals, and the later 1960s version had black numerals.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s the {{knitting}} accessories company Aero produced its own rotary on-needle counter {{which had}} a distinctive red inner barrel with thick <b>knurled</b> ends, and a grey outer skin. [...] The red colour of the inner barrel meant that the numbers had to be printed in white, and were more easily visible than the small black printed numbers on earlier versions. Aero later produced a blue and white {{version of the same}} design, with the name Inox printed on it. [...] In the 1990s Wrights Boyle and Prym began to produce a similar design with white inner barrels and coloured outer skin which continued to be sold in different sizes until at least 2010.|$|E

40|$|Electromagnetic pulse {{crimping}} of {{form fit}} joints was investigated using tubes with {{a diameter of}} 50 mm and a wall thickness of 1, 5 mm, in the aluminium alloy EN AW- 6060. The tubes were crimped onto steel internal parts, which were designed to bear torsional loads. Grooved, <b>knurl</b> rolled and <b>knurl</b> cut internal workpieces were used. To assess the torque strength of the connections, a torque test set-up was designed and built. In a first test series, grooved internal parts were used. The influence of the internal workpiece design and the energy level on the torque resistance was investigated. Related to the geometry of the internal workpiece, the following parameters were varied: the groove depth, the groove width, the edge radius {{and the number of}} grooves. In a second test series, <b>knurl</b> rolled and <b>knurl</b> cut internal workpieces were used. For the joints with a <b>knurl</b> rolled internal part, the influence of the <b>knurl</b> pattern, defined by the pitch, was investigated. For the connections with a <b>knurl</b> cut internal part, the influence of the energy level was studied. The different joint failure mechanisms were determined...|$|R

2500|$|Later {{production}} models are distinguished by an enlarged, oblong trigger guard (which was introduced after Japanese soldiers reported difficulty in accessing the trigger while wearing gloves in Manchuria) and sometimes have a <b>knurled</b> steel cocking knob {{instead of the}} standard [...] "slotted" [...] cocking knob. An auxiliary magazine spring was added from mid-1940 to retain the magazine and aid the magazine follower. The safety is a lever {{on the left side}} and locks the barrel and barrel extension as well as stopping the sear from moving. A redesigned cocking knob was implemented in 1944 in order to simplify production. The Type 14 also lacks the grip safety used on the previous models. The Type 14 could be equipped with the Type 90 tear gas grenade with use of a special attachment.|$|E
2500|$|In the 21st {{century and}} at least until 2010, the Japanese company Clover was {{producing}} the bright green pendant Mini Kacha-Kacha which is designed like a hand-held mechanical tally counter, but is oriented upside-down on a neck pendant for easy reading by the user. It has a button to advance the numbers singly, access to the <b>knurled</b> number rings for adjustment of numbers, and a lock to prevent interference by the user dropping the gadget or by children playing with it. On this type of gadget it has been possible for the manufacturer to make the numbers larger and therefore easier to read than on the on-needle counter, which needs to be small. [...] In August 2007 the UK magazine Simply Knitting no.32 gave away a free pendant knitting counter in a form of a white sheep, and in June 2010 the same magazine no.67 gave away another one {{in the shape of}} a yellow flower. Unfortunately the numerals on the yellow flower version were oriented incorrectly, causing inconvenience for the wearer of the pendant.|$|E
2500|$|The gun used metal {{stamping}} and pressing, spot welding and seam welding extensively in its construction, {{reducing the number}} of man-hours required to assemble a unit. Only the barrel, bolt and firing mechanism were precision machined. The receiver consisted of two sheet metal halves welded together to form a cylinder. At the front end was a <b>knurled</b> metal cap which was used to retain the removable barrel. The cold-swaged, rifled barrel had 4 right-hand grooves. [...] M3 and M3A1 submachine guns could be fitted with an optional, detachable flash hider, though none saw any service in World War II. [...] A later production flash hider designated Hider, Flash M9 was produced in time to see service during the Korean War. [...] It proved popular in combat, as frequent night engagements emphasized the need to reduce flash signatures on small arms. [...] In Korea, U.S. soldiers equipped with automatic weapons were taught to look above the flash of their weapon during night firing, a tactic that sometimes prevented the detection of crawling enemy infiltrators and sappers.|$|E
50|$|Hand <b>knurling</b> {{tools are}} available. These {{resemble}} pipecutters but contain <b>knurling</b> wheels rather than cutting wheels. Usually, three wheels are {{carried by the}} tool: two left-handed wheels and one right-handed wheel or vice versa.|$|R

2500|$|A paper card {{version of}} the MP Handy Guide was {{published}} with folded card sliders for the war effort {{under the auspices of}} the UK Ministry of Defence during World War II and was intended for use by people knitting gloves, socks and balaclavas for the troops. In the 1960s, The Aero Needles Group Plc of Redditch, England produced the Knitters Companion, a pocket {{version of the}} complex counter, consisting of a pierced bar of black plastic containing seven <b>knurled,</b> white, rotary, numbered discs whose numbers would appear through the piercings in the bar. [...] As in the MP Handy Guide, the numbers were labelled Increase, Decrease, Rows and Times. It was supplied with a soft plastic case which was intended to maintain memory of the count by preventing accidental movement of the discs. In 1972, UK magazine Woman's Weekly gave away its own card variation of this, with the numbers on dials with rotary paper pointers to record rows, increases or decreases, and times. Like the MP Handy Guide it incorporated a small inch-ruler and needle gauge, but now added a tension gauge measure and centimetre ruler.|$|E

40|$|Relevant {{scientific}} and technical problems in relation to mechanical engineering is development of new technological processes that {{make it possible to}} achieve high accuracy and durability of machine parts that meet the requirements imposed on them. So it is important to develop a new method to make a flat gear teeth by plastic deformation of the ingot. The article deals with the actual problem of improving productivity and quality of plane wheels teeth that are widely used in advanced wave, planetary and other transmissions. A progressive method to produce flat gear teeth gear by plastic deformation of the ingot with two <b>knurl</b> rollers alternately moving reciprocally in the direction not intersecting the axis of the ingot mounting surface has been described in the article. The working surface of the rollers corresponds to the resulting shape of the teeth. The schemes of the teeth installing and <b>knurling</b> have been shown. The necessary material and the heat treatment of the <b>knurling</b> tools have been described.  Its use will significantly increase the wear resistance of the working surfaces of the teeth and their durability as well as to increase productivity and its manufacturing costs. The material of the rollers is BC 15 steel.

50|$|Knurling is {{also used}} on the grips of darts and the footpegs of BMX bicycles. Aside from adding {{functionality}} to an object (valve repairs and hand grips being {{some of the most}} common), knurling also adds a decorative pattern to the material. The <b>knurled</b> nut is one such application, which uses a <b>knurled</b> finish instead of hexagonal or square edges which helps in tightening or loosening the nut without the use of a tool. The <b>knurled</b> surfaces provide enough grip to hold the nut between the thumb and forefinger. Hence it is also called a thumb nut. It is mainly used on small diameter bolts.Knurled nuts are typically used in electrical components, musical instruments and in automobiles.|$|E
