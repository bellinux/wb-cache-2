To investigate and quantify the processes controlling the Danube Delta coast evolution a systematic approach was employed. First, a hindcast of the wave climate was simulated using the numerical model SWAN and wind data recorded locally during 11 consecutive years. Second, the sediment transport was calculated using the simulated wave climate, field data and an one line numerical model (UNIBEST CL+). A sediment budget and predictions for the future evolution of the study zone were derived further on. Third, the process based numerical model Delft- 3 D was used to investigate the episodic water level changes which produce locally large shoreline retreats. Fourth, an ideal spit was design and modelled with Delft- 3 D to {{understand the relationship between}} the two sediment transport components: cross and along shore.

40|$|Ice-rich {{permafrost}} {{that formed}} in glacial periods of the Quaternary is highly vulnerable to thaw under ongoing {{climate change and}} anthropogenic disturbance. Permafrost degradation processes such as thermokarst, thermo-denudation and thermo-erosion are actively shaping modern periglacial landscapes. Retrogressive thaw slumps – {{also referred to as}} thermo-cirques – represent a highly dynamic <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>feature</b> in ice-rich permafrost regions. These rapidly forming landforms consist of a steep headwall surrounding a gently inclined slump floor where sediment erosion and accumulation takes place simulatenously and develop as a result of rapid permafrost thaw over several decades. Thaw slumps are commonly found in permafrost areas with near-surface, thick ground-ice layers that are susceptible to thermo-denudation and subsequent mass displacement through cryogenic landslides (Leibman et al., 2008). Thaw slumps are particularly frequent along riverbanks and coastlines in the Northwest American and West Siberian Arctic, where they are typically initiated by lateral erosion of the bluff toe. In these regions, buried glacier ice (massive ground ice) bodies or ice-rich glacial till have been mapped. Given their exceptional size of up to 40 ha in area and 25 m high headwalls, so-called mega slumps in northwestern Canada represent primary terrain destabilization features with different environmental settings than surrounding areas (Lantuit et al., 2012), but are a significant source for sediment and solute delivery to adjacent lakes and streams (Kokelj et al., 2013).

40|$|SubmittedThe Towada Caldera Volcano {{is located}} in Aomori Prefecture - Northern Honshu Island, Japan. The caldera, today filled by a lake, has {{produced}} 15, 000 years ago a complex eruption emplacing an Ignimbrite deposit topped by the lake outburst flood deposit, through which the present Oirase River cuts. This deposit has shaped the <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>feature</b> named Sambongi fan, on which Towada City extends. Based on outcrops, a few coring and radiocarbon dating, Kataoka (2011) has developed a theory tying the eruption history {{and the formation of}} the Sambongi fan. Because of the lack of extended outcrops - typical of the Japanese environment -, the authors have put the theory to the test using GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) radargram extending along a 640 m length. The GPR used for the survey was a Pulseko-Pro with 50 MHz antennas. The software Reflex was used to process the data. The radargrams have displayed a sole unit, which the GPR could not penetrate and that the authors have interpreted as being the ignimbrite deposit. On top of this deposit a series of subhorizontal layers, with the alternation between a backset and a foreset extend between 5 m and 3 m depth. Above 3 m, the units are regular and subhorizontal. The deposit is also characterized by the extensive presence of blocks, which are located along three bands: (1) on top of the ignimbrite deposit; (2) in the units deposited by the outburst flood, between 3 and 5 m depth; (3) and in the units close to the surface, although part of these punctual elements are most certainly anthropogenic. Compared with the outcrops, the present research confirms that the material located above the ignimbrite material have been deposited by the outburst flood, creating large-sheet patterns, which have transported blocks. These sheets display backsets and foresets patterns, depending on the position of the deposit to the 'high-energy-flow tongues', which may have slightly looked like the ones observed during the 3. 11 tsunami in the Sendai Plain (Miyagi Prefecture) ...|$|R

40|$|In hilly and mountainous {{urbanized}} areas, {{shallow and}} rapid landslides cause significant, often unpredictable, hazard conditions. The mass movements may cross roads, crash or bury vehicle, destroy infrastructures, run into villages and houses and kill people. However, in such critical context the landslide source areas are often found {{along the road}} network. This {{represents one of the}} most recurring situations during not particularly exceptional rainstorms in Northern Tuscany. Owing to its geographical, <b>geomorphologic</b> and climatic <b>features,</b> the Northern Tuscany (Northern Tuscan Apennines, Apuan Alps, Garfagnana, Serchio Valley, Versilia) is frequently hit by rainstorms. In many cases such meteorological events trigger rapid and shallow landslides. They are generally first time movements, mainly referable to complex, translational debris slide-flow or soil slip-debris flows, typically triggered by intense rainfall. In the study area they occurred in peculiar geologic and geomorphologic environments: colluvium/debris thin slope cover (from few decimetres to 1 - 2 metres thick), semi-permeable or impermeable bedrock, hollow shaped slope, high slope gradient. Despite their little size, they caused heavy damage and also deaths, due to their high speed and erosion power. Less intense rainfall often can trigger such mass movements along the road network, which probably are caused by the lack or absence of a correct maintenance of the road drainage systems. In fact, the concentration and of uncontrolled running water on the roads and its subsequent flowing downslope may produce an “unnatural” increase in pore pressure that the only rainfall, hitting the same slope in natural conditions, should not have produced. Actually, this phenomenon generates the reaching and exceeding of the local critical rainfall threshold, making landslide prevision and landslide hazard assessment difficult.

VIMS operates in a spectral range from 0. 35 to 5. 2 µm, generating image cubes in which each pixel represents a spectrum consisting of 352 contiguous wavebands.

This {{makes it possible to}} analyze the spectrum of each pixel separately and to map the spectral characteristics spatially, which is important to study the relationships between spectral information and geological and geomorpholigic surface features. The spatial analysis of the spectral data requires the determination of the exact geographic position of each pixel on the specific surface and that all 352 spectral elements of each pixel show the same region of the target. We developed a method to reproject each pixel geometrically and to convert the spectral data into map projected images cubes. This method can also be applied to mosaic different VIMS observations.

Steep slopes, exposed rocks pronouncing the effect of geological substrate on vegetation, contrast between the sunny and warm southerly oriented slopes and shaded cold northerly oriented slopes, high diversity of various extreme habitats situated next to each other, specific microclimatic conditions causing frequent temperature inversions, the main feature for existence of river phenomenon. The main biotic consequences are: (1) high biodiversity located in deep river valleys, (2) concentration of relict species, resulting from the fact, that deep river valleys served as a refugia for plant and animal species during the era of ice age, (3) function of river valley as a corridor for migration of plants and animals, connecting mountain areas with lowlands, and (4) preservation of the vegetation relatively unaffected by human activities for its inaccessibility.|$|R

On the basis of two GPS campaign measurements, 6 years apart, at 17 sites distributed in Israel and Jordan, complemented by Israeli permanent stations, we compute the present-day deformation across the southern segment of the Dead Sea Transform, the Wadi Araba fault. Elastic locked-fault modeling of fault-parallel velocities provides a slip rate of 4. 9 ± 1. 4 mm/a and a best fit locking depth of $ 12 km.

Within this species, mainland and island subspecies have been described mainly based on external morphological characters, however, their diagnostic characters have not been accurately demarcated. We used both traditional and geometric morphometrics to study the morphological divergence in L. pictus subspecies. Since geographic isolation {{can be related to}} environmental variation (e. g., variation in abundance and richness of insects or fruits), we predict that the L. pictus morphology could vary in head shape between mainland and island localities. Our results show morphological divergence in all variables analyzed among the island and mainland localities. The traditional morphometric approach reveals differences between populations from the mainland and island localities, where the mainland populations show a larger head size. Geometric morphometric data indicate that the eye orbits of the island specimens are more extended than in the mainland specimens in the dorsal view; this is probably related to a different capacity of substrate used. Also, in the lateral view, the eye orbits are extended and the head shape is less dorso-ventrally compressed in the island locality than in mainland populations and the terminal mouth position is more posterior in island specimens. We suggest that the morphological variation between mainland and island localities could be related to the fact that these populations were isolated during the last maximum glacial period in southern Chile, a period in which <b>geomorphologic</b> and bioclimatic <b>features</b> of this area were modified forming the present archipelago...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology {{for using the}} GIS Arc/Info system as an operating tool to study excavation finds and structures on an archaeological site. The choice of the archaeological sample site (Villa Rufolo, Ravello - Italy) and the definition of information and methodologies useful to its study and management {{were the result of}} collaboration between a photogrammetry partnership (S. F. M.) and the “N. Cilento” archaeological laboratory of the University of Salerno. The GIS architecture was developed starting from the analysis of methods common to both the research methodologies (landscape recognition and stratigraphic excavations), which define the phases of archaeological data manipulation. The main aim was to create a tool which, starting from the planimetric documentation of each excavation, could link the various environments to their related stratigraphic units through data derived both from the individual structures and from artefacts. Following Arc/Info data models, all information was arranged into a relational database. The Stratigraphic Unit (US) attribute forms the link which connects the graphical elements, geographical and spatial database, and the descriptive database. Data stored can be analysed using many criteria, and the GIS always makes it possible to display the graphic results of the analysis. Besides the management, integration and manipulation of the archaeological data assigned to the territory under investigation, with Arch/Info various data levels can be combined for the purpose of producing new types of information; this information is usually acquired by employing techniques of data overlapping and through statistic and classification processing of all the stratigraphic units related to the site. The next stage of our project will consist of a careful check {{of the results of the}} statistical and classification processes and the use of this model at other archaeological sites so as to exploit the GIS potential for comparing excavation data as well as the <b>geomorphologic</b> and geographic <b>features</b> of the various sites...|$|R
