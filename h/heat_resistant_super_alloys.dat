To identify any residual elements, analysis were done by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, EDS, on regular as well as modified inserts in combination with forced coolant application on both rake and flank face.

40|$|Aerospace {{gas turbine}} engines are now {{designed}} {{such that the}} <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>super</b> <b>alloys</b> operate at temperature very close to their melting, so current strategies for performance improvement are centered on thermal barrier coatings. Lower thermal conductivities lead to temperature reductions at the substrate/bond coat interface which slows {{the rate of the}} thermally induced failure mechanisms. Alternatively, lower thermal conductivity of thermal barrier coating (TBC) layers might allow designers to reduce the TBC thickness there by decreasing the significant centrifugal load that the mass of the TBC imposes on the rotating turbine engine components.

40|$|Heat {{generated}} in a machining {{process is a}} common and critical obstacle faced in today's machining industries. The heat {{generated in}} the cutting zone has a direct negative influence on the tool life which, in turn contributes to increase the manufacturing costs. Especially, in machining of <b>Heat</b> <b>Resistant</b> <b>Super</b> <b>Alloys,</b> HRSA {{this is a very}} limiting factor. HRSA are capable of retaining their mechanical strength and hardness at elevated temperatures. This property is advantageous in the application in e. g. aero-engines but also a disadvantage, since it also lowers the machinability significantly. This work is an attempt to improve the heat transfer from the cutting zone, which would lead to an increase in the tool life. To achieve this goal, the cutting tool has been modified to create an improved interface between the coolant and tool in the high-temperature areas. Two generations of inserts have been designed and investigated. Firstly, an insert with surface texture features has been created with the purpose of increasing the available surface area for heat dissipation: First generation, Gen I. Secondly, a GenII was designed as a further improvement of Gen I. Here, several channel features on the rake face were added, reaching out from the contact zone to the near proximity of the cutting edge. This with the purpose of improving access of the coolant closer to the cutting edge. The experiments were conducted in facing operations of Alloy 718 with uncoated round carbide inserts. All experiments were carried out with high-pressure coolant assistance, with a pressure of 16 MPa on the rake face and 8 MPa on the flankface, respectively. The two generations of inserts, Gen I and Gen II, were experimentally evaluated by tool wear analysis in comparison with a regular insert. The results shows that the tool life increased significantly for the Gen I insert, compared to a catastrophic failure of the regular insert at the same conditions. Regarding the Gen II insert,an increase in tool life by approximately 30 to 40 percent compared to Gen I insert was observed...|$|E

This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} works, where Inconel 718, a highly corrosive <b>resistant,</b> nickel-based <b>super</b> <b>alloy,</b> was finish-turning under high speed conditions. The machining processes were carried out at three different cutting conditions (DRY, MQL 50 ml/h and MQL 100 ml/h), three levels of cutting speed (Vc= 90, 120 and 150 m/min), two levels of feed rate (f= 0. 10 and 0. 15 mm/rev) and two levels of cutting depth (d= 0. 30 and 0. 50 mm). The tool wear and flank wear progression were monitored, measured and recorded progressively at various time intervals. The experiments indicated that MQL condition performs better than dry condition in term of tool life. Most of the tool failures during machining were due to gradual failure where abrasive and notching wear on the flank face was the dominant followed by, fracture on the flank edge and nose radius. Tool failure due to crater wear was not significant. Wear mechanism such as abrasive and adhesion were observed on the flank face and diffusion wear was observed on the rake face...|$|R
