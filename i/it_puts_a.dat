25|$|Fast bowling puts extreme {{pressure}} on the whole body, especially the feet, back and the shoulder. <b>It</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> lot of body parts under extreme risk of injury. There is a risk of stress fractures in the ankles because of the feet landing hard {{on the ground at}} the time of delivery, back spasms and strains because of the arching movement when the ball is delivered and torn ligaments in the shoulder because of the sudden jerk that invariably occurs just before the ball is bowled.|$|E

25|$|Triazolam {{is usually}} used for {{short-term}} treatment of acute insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including jet lag. It {{is an ideal}} benzodiazepine for this use because its fast onset of action and short half-life. <b>It</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> person to sleep for not more than 1.5 hours (approximately 1–2 hours), allowing its user to avoid morning drowsiness. Triazolam is also sometimes used as an adjuvant in medical procedures requiring anesthesia or to reduce anxiety during brief events like MRI scans and non-surgical dental procedures. Triazolam is ineffective in maintaining sleep however, due to its short half-life with quazepam showing superiority.|$|E
500|$|Such {{cancellations}} {{have been}} criticized by supporters of the arts. After planned performances by an amateur opera company in Middlesbrough, England were [...] "stopped because [...] would be 'distasteful' to ethnic minorities", a local newspaper declared that the actions were [...] "surely taking political correctness too far". A British theatre writer was concerned that [...] "the kind of censorship we've been talking about – for censorship it is – actually militates against a truly integrated society, for it emphasizes differences. <b>It</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> wall around groups within society, dividing people by creating metaphorical ghettos, and prevents mutual understanding". Specifically, the cancellation was based on protests of plans {{to have all the}} black roles to be played in this production by white actors in blackface, as the company had no black members.|$|E
500|$|Reception of the single-player aspect varied. Yin-Poole {{wrote that}} while the cliffhanger ending of Halo 2 was disappointing, the {{campaign}} of Halo 3 was much more satisfying. Gerstmann, GameSpy's Gabe Graziani, and Goldstein maintained that the campaign was too short, especially on easier difficulty levels or with three additional players in co-op. Goldstein was {{highly critical of the}} eighth level, stating [...] "the penultimate chapter is so bad, just thinking about <b>it</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> rotten taste in my mouth." [...] The New York Times Charles Herold said the game had a [...] "throwaway" [...] plot and Total Video Games judged the single-player aspect ultimately disappointing. Goldstein and Steve West of Cinema Blend thought a part of the game's story was lost by not having the Arbiter featuring as prominently as the character was in Halo 2.|$|E

500|$|The stay-at-home dad {{arrangement}} {{allows the}} mother {{to work without}} having to use a daycare or a nanny. This arrangement prevents the mother from {{having to deal with}} the stress of finding acceptable childcare, checking backgrounds, and paying for care. This arrangement also can help ensure that the family's values are being upheld and instilled in the children. Free from the stress of childcare, the working mother is able to actively pursue their career. This allows for a more relaxed working environment for the mother and allows her to focus on her career. [...] If the mother has a higher paying job, this extra income will allow for savings to be made for the children, these savings could help the mother later on pay for university for the child and/or children. Thus, she can advance her career and provide more money for the family. <b>It</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> sound mind for the mother knowing that the child/children are at a safe place with the father having the same safety and values as the mother. These are the same advantages for the father from having a stay-at-home mom arrangement.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepiwall for HitFix {{wrote that}} the finale had [...] "funny throwaway lines and moments" [...] but that overall [...] "it was another largely flat episode, and one that leaned too heavily on the guest stars." [...] Callie Carmichael of CNN was less positive, writing that [...] "I Do Do" [...] fell [...] "a bit flat", and concluded [...] "As a rule of thumb, sitcoms usually fall short {{when you take the}} characters out of their element, and this one definitely did with three weddings in three separate places." [...] Eleanor Barkhorn from The Atlantic had issues with the plot twists, citing that they would not [...] "bode well {{for the future of the}} series." [...] She explained that Jack and Avery having a child was [...] "problematic", observing that <b>it</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> [...] "relatively definite end" [...] to the sexual tension between Liz and Jack that occurred in the show's first season.

2500|$|It was {{the first}} time that Siouxsie worked with {{producers}} who also physically played on the record, which made a [...] "huge difference". Instead of recording the album in one block session, she commuted from France to Bath to the producers' studio. She made several trips from the end of 2006 to May 2007, concentrating on two or three tracks at the time. This working method provided a useful overview, as she stated: [...] "Sometimes when you're so involved in a project day in day out, you can lose sight of the goal or the object. <b>It</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> different discipline to it". She used technology as a tool, listening to the recording process of the music from home. Siouxsie's only instruction to her two composers was [...] "to treat every song as a potential single".|$|E

2500|$|Bevan {{believed}} that the Second World War would give Britain the opportunity to create [...] "a new society". He often quoted an 1855 passage from Karl Marx: [...] "The redeeming feature of war is that <b>it</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> nation to the test. As exposure to the atmosphere reduces all mummies to instant dissolution, so war passes supreme judgment upon social systems that have outlived their vitality." [...] At {{the beginning of the}} 1945 general election campaign Bevan told his audience that his goal was to eliminate any opposition to the Labour programme: [...] "We have been the dreamers, we have been the sufferers, now we are the builders.

We want the complete political extinction of the Tory Party, and twenty-five years of Labour Government." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{important}} as the budget differences are {{to the issue of}} pay for performance, the difference in how federal and private sector employees respond to motivators is even more crucial. Weibel has demonstrated that public servants tend to gravitate more to intrinsic motivation, but two key researchers, Edward L. Deci and Robert Eisenburger, have disagreed as to whether extrinsic motivation is harmful to intrinsically motivated individuals. [...] Deci designed a study that involved college students who were given an [...] "interesting" [...] activity to perform. [...] Some of those students were provided tangible rewards (e.g. money) as an extrinsic motivation and were observed by researchers to see how they reacted. From these studies, Deci argued that some activities provide their own inherent reward, so motivation for such activities is not dependent on external rewards. [...] Deci goes even further to show that when extrinsic rewards are placed on these activities, it is detrimental to performance because <b>it</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> market price on something they already value internally.|$|E
2500|$|Many policy analysts {{consider}} literacy {{rates as}} a crucial measure to enhance a region's human capital. This claim is made {{on the grounds that}} literate people can be trained less expensively than illiterate people, generally have a higher socio-economic status and enjoy better health and employment prospects. If women are these illiterate people, that makes them even more disposable to their economy. Policy makers also argue that literacy for women increases job opportunities and access to higher education. Although it is often viewed that a woman working in the home benefits her family, <b>it</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> strain on the whole community as education is {{one of the keys to}} success and being able to prosper. According to Ojo, women in Nigeria are harder-hit than men by poverty due to the lack of emphasis placed on female education, and the prevalence of early marriage which tend to further impoverish women, and subject them to statutory discrimination. The most important ingredient of employment opportunity is education, especially higher education. If employment opportunities are different, standards of living, life expectancies and other parameters of existence and of well-being, will be different. [...] "For Nigeria to achieve the goal of being among the largest 20 economies in the world, she must rapidly educate the children, most of all, the girls. Educating girls is known to be the basis for sound economic and social development. Educating girls produces mothers who are educated and who will in turn educate their children, care for their families and provide their children with adequate nutrition," [...] says Dr. Robert Limlim, UNICEF’s Deputy Representative. [...] "Therefore educating girls translates to better health for the children, reduction in child morbidity and mortality, thus triggering off a snowball effect of achieving all the other MDGs in a sustainable manner." ...|$|E

60|$|It is no {{adequate}} {{answer to}} our antagonists to say, {{indeed it is}} a mere tu quoque to say, that the existing system does not present such a correlation, that <b>it</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> premium on secretiveness and self-seeking and a discount on many most necessary forms of social service.
