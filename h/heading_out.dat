5|$|Before <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> of Brazil on a mid-1991 European tour, Sepultura {{performed}} {{one more}} concert in São Paulo, the country's largest city. It {{took place at}} Praça Charles Miller (in front of Estádio do Pacaembu), on May 11. Local military police expected 10,000 to attend. 30,000 showed up instead, making crowd management nearly impossible. Six people were hurt, 18 were arrested and one was murdered with an axe. A week before, a young man was stabbed to death at a Ramones concert in São Paulo, during a brawl between headbangers and skinheads. These events were followed by a huge mainstream media backlash throughout the country against rock music.|$|E

5|$|Before <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> to a {{baseball}} game at a nearby ballpark, sports fan Mr. Brown drinks several highball cocktails. He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} end of the bridge, M-26 turns east while US41 turns west into Hancock. M-26 passes through Ripley at the base of the Mt. Ripley Ski Area before turning north to Dollar Bay on the shore of the heavy {{polluted}} Torch Lake. Next are the twin communities of Lake Linden and Hubbell. M-26 forms the main streets of these as it passes north from Hubbell into Lake Linden. The highway then runs back to the west to rejoin US41 in Calumet. US41/M-26 connects with the northern end of M-203 on the north side of town before <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> to Keweenaw County. In the town of Phoenix, M-26 separates from US41 one last time, turning west for a stretch along the northern shoreline of the Keweenaw Peninsula. It passes through the communities of Eagle River (county seat of Keweenaw County) and Eagle Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Steered by {{currents}} {{from an area}} of {{high pressure}} to the north, the storm began to drift northwestward and rapidly deepen over warm waters of the Gulf. It executed a tight counterclockwise loop, and continued to mature; on October 16 it reached peaked winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) with a minimum barometric pressure of 924 mbar (hPa; 27.29 inHg). The hurricane turned northeastward, again approaching western Cuba, and began to accelerate towards the Florida Peninsula on October 17. Its center passed west of Key West and made landfall near Cape Romano. The storm moved due north for a time as it moved inland, and deteriorated into a tropical storm. From northeastern Florida, the cyclone curved northeastward and hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeast United States before <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> to sea. The storm is estimated to have dissipated on October 23.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Ewiniar {{killed at}} least 34people in China, with areas as far {{northwest}} as Gansu and Shanxi affected by landslides. It is not known if the landslides were triggered directly {{as a result of}} Ewiniar, or whether it was caused by a combination of Ewiniar and other weather. Therefore, the deaths that can be attributed to Ewiniar from the landslides are assumed to be indirectly caused, and not directly. Average rainfall reported in Shandong was 3.4mm (0.133inches) per hour from 6a.m. July 9 through midnight July 10 (totalling about 61.2mm or 2.4inches). At least 300 flights out of Beijing's Capital International Airport had to be delayed due to thunderstorms and effects of Ewiniar, while Air China and China Eastern Airlines cancelled flights to South Korea <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> of China. As Ewiniar did not affect the mainland directly, there are little to no reports of major damage.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Manchester City {{once again}} {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup through the Fair Play rankings. As City had to play the qualifying rounds, it meant a very early start to the season, in mid-July. Their first match was {{a trip to the}} remote Faroe Islands to play EB/Streymur. As Streymur's ground had a capacity of only 1,000, the match was moved to Tórsvøllur, the Faroese national stadium. Two early goals gave City a 2–0 win. The home leg was unusual in that it was played outside Manchester. The pitch at the City of Manchester Stadium had been relaid following a Bon Jovi concert, and was not ready in time. Instead, the match was played at Barnsley's Oakwell ground. Another 2–0 win resulted in a 4–0 aggregate scoreline. In the second qualifying round City played FC Midtjylland. The first leg ended in a 1–0 defeat, only City's second ever home defeat in European competition. In the second leg City looked to be <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> of the competition until an 89th minute cross was diverted into his own net by Midtjylland's Danny Califf. The tie then went to extra time, and City progressed on penalties. In the first round proper Cypriots AC Omonia took the lead, but City overcame the deficit and won 2–1, and also won the second leg by the same scoreline.|$|E
5|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} Hispaniola rapidly {{weakened}} {{the system to}} a tropical storm early on September4. Moving westward over the Caribbean Sea, the storm failed to re-strengthen before making landfall in western Cuba with winds of 40mph (65km/h) around midday on September6. Thereafter, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico and curved northeastward. At 09:00UTC on September9, the storm again made landfall near Bradenton, Florida with winds of 45mph (75km/h). Later that day, the storm weakened to a tropical depression while crossing Florida. Upon emerging into the Atlantic Ocean on the next day, the system re-intensified into a tropical storm. While located offshore South Carolina, the storm re-attained hurricane status early on September12. The hurricane then brushed the Outer Banks of North Carolina before <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> to sea. The storm further strengthened to Category2 intensity, heading eastward, but weakened to a tropical storm early on September16. The following day, the storm deteriorated further to a tropical depression, and late on September17, the depression dissipated southwest of the Azores.|$|E

5|$|The revolt in East Anglia was {{independently}} {{suppressed by}} Henry le Despenser, the Bishop of Norwich. Henry was in Stamford in Lincolnshire when the revolt broke out, {{and when he}} found out about it he marched south with eight men-at-arms and a small force of archers, gathering more forces as he went. He marched first to Peterborough, where he routed the local rebels and executed any he could capture, including some who had taken shelter in the local abbey. He then headed south-east via Huntingdon and Ely, reached Cambridge on 19 June, and then headed further into the rebel-controlled areas of Norfolk. Henry reclaimed Norwich on 24 June, before <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> with a company of men to track down the rebel leader, Geoffrey Litster. The two forces met at the Battle of North Walsham on 25 or 26 June; the Bishop's forces triumphed and Litster was captured and executed. Henry's quick action was essential to the suppression of the revolt in East Anglia, but he was very unusual in taking matters into his own hands in this way, and his execution of the rebels without royal sanction was illegal.|$|E
5|$|The {{year after}} he left office as mayor, Armstrong began work with the Edmonton post office. After being {{recommended}} for the position by city notables, he was named postmaster of the city on November 12, 1913. In the same year he oversaw {{the construction of a}} new building on Namayo Avenue, the Fairbairn Block, mainly for use by his business but with additional space for offices and housing in the upper levels. In 1920, Armstrong was involved in a legal case involving his office as postmaster when he was accused in the 1919 disappearance of a sum of $50,000 from the post office. Although exonerated in 1920, he would again be arrested in 1923 and charged with theft. During the trial, it was testified that a witness had seen Armstrong on the day of the robbery, with only a paper in his hand as if he were <b>heading</b> <b>out.</b> Armstrong, who had proclaimed his innocence, and provided evidence for the trial was eventually acquitted and found not guilty of the charges in a decision made on May 29, which was followed by an eruption of applause. Later in 1923, Armstrong was appointed postmaster of the Strathcona (south side) Post Office. He remained with the post office until he retired in January 1937. At the time of his retirement he was serving as postmaster of the south post office. In his years with the post office, he served a total of 14 years as postmaster. The Armstrong Drug Store would later go through multiple owners until its closing on December 10, 1993.|$|E
