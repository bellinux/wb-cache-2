50|$|Dantrolene sodium is a postsynaptic {{muscle relaxant}} that lessens excitation-contraction {{coupling}} in muscle cells. It achieves this by inhibiting Ca2+ ions release from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores by antagonizing ryanodine receptors. It {{is the primary}} drug used for the treatment and prevention of malignant hyperthermia, a rare, life-threatening disorder triggered by general anesthesia. It is also used {{in the management of}} neuroleptic malignant syndrome, muscle spasticity (e.g. after strokes, in paraplegia, cerebral palsy, or patients with multiple sclerosis), and 2,4-dinitrophenol poisoning, and the related compounds dinoseb and <b>dinoterb.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} is addressed, whether in capillary electrophoresis (CE) the laser-based forward degenerate four-wave mixing (F-D 4 WM) detection method {{can become a}} realistic alternative to conventional ultraviolet (UV) absorption detection. In order {{to answer this question}} F-D 4 WM experiments at 351 nm have been performed. As test analytes the herbicides dinitro-ortho-cresol and dinitro-(tert-butyl) -ortho-phenol (trivial names DNOC and <b>dinoterb,</b> respectively) were used without derivatisation. These compounds show moderate absorption (molar absorptivity 4000...|$|E
40|$|A {{phytotoxicity}} assay {{based on}} seed germination/root elongation has been optimized {{and used to}} evaluate the toxic effects of some phenolic herbicides. The method has been improved by investigating the influence of experimental conditions. Lepidium sativum was chosen as the most suitable species, showing high germinability, good repeatability of root length measurements, and low sensitivity to seed pretreatment. DMSO was the most appropriate solvent carrier for less water-soluble compounds. Three dinitrophenols and three hydroxybenzonitriles were tested: <b>dinoterb,</b> DNOC, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, chloroxynil, bromoxynil, and ioxynil. Toxicity was also determined using the Vibrio fischeri Microtox® test, and a highly significant correlation was found between EC 50 values obtained by the two assays. <b>Dinoterb</b> was the most toxic compound. The toxicity of hydroxybenzonitriles followed the order: ioxynil >bromoxynil >chloroxynil; L. sativum exhibited a slightly higher sensitivity than V. fischeri to these compounds. A QSAR analysis highlighted the importance of hydrophobic, electronic, and hydrogen-bonding interactions, in accordance with a mechanism of toxic action based on protonophoric uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The results suggest that the seed germination/root elongation assay with L. sativum is a valid tool for the assessment of xenobiotic toxicity and can be recommended as part of a test battery...|$|E

40|$|The {{ecotoxicological}} risk concept {{is considered to}} be the basis for setting environmental quality objectives for pesticides in groundwater. Ecotoxicological critical concentrations for groundwater can be derived through several exploratory approaches. These approaches will be subsequently compared (focusing mainly on the Netherlands but bringing the European Union standard for pesticides in groundwater into the relevant context) with critically reviewed groundwater monitoring data. Furthermore, aldicarb, atrazine and MITC results of geographic modelling are ecotoxicologically evaluated. The study focuses mainly on the Netherlands but the European context is not forgotten. Many reported groundwater monitoring data are strongly correlated. Therefore the assessment of the extent of groundwater contamination should be {{based on the number of}} localities where pesticides have been detected. Shallow Dutch groundwater monitoring data reveal that aldicarb, 1, 3 -dichloropropene, 1, 2 -dichloropropane, dinoseb, <b>dinoterb,</b> ethoprophos and MITC are ecotoxicologically the most hazardous pesticides. Of the pesticides found in monitoring programs critical levels are lower than 0. 1 4 g/l for aldicarb and aldicarb sulfoxide, dinoseb, <b>dinoterb,</b> ethoprophos, heptachlor, MITC, parathion ethyl and pirimicarb. If {{ecotoxicological risk}} levels for groundwater are desired they should be derived from standard aquatic toxicity data, and the ecological characteristics of the system should be taken into account in the extrapolation. It was not found meaningful to develop ecotoxicity tests based on specific groundwater organisms...|$|E
40|$|Aspects {{of direct}} laser desorption/ionisation {{have been studied}} for three molecules, {{aminotriazole}} (positive ion), <b>dinoterb</b> and ioxynil (negative ion). The samples are deposited on metallic substrates, and a nitrogen laser is used for desorption/ionisation; ion yields are measured with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, Previous work had shown that ion yields can strongly vary from one substrate to another, and that this variation {{does not reflect the}} (calculated) metal surface temperatures. New results obtained in this work indicate that the desorption/ionisation mechanism is linked to the physical state of the substrate surface. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{degradation of}} a herbicide derivative, <b>Dinoterb</b> (1), {{has been investigated}} in aqueous micellar solution {{in the presence of}} titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and air as a function of irradiation time under a variety of conditions using UV and HPLC analysis techniques. The degradation kinetics was studied under different conditions such as different types of TiO 2, catalyst concentration, substrate concentration and reaction pH in the presence of air. The photocatalyst Degussa P 25 was found to be more efficient catalyst as compared to other photocatalysts tested. The model compound was found to degrade more efficiently under neutral pH as compared to acidic and alkaline pH. GC/MS analysis of the irradiated samples indicate the formation of 2 -isopropyl- 4, 6 -dinitro-phenol as by-product which has been characterized on the basis of molecular ion and mass fragmentation pattern. A probable pathway for its formation has been proposed...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a strategy for}} the development of coupled-column liquid chromatographic methods for groups of polar pesticides in environmental water samples. This method is needed in flexible pesticide monitoring programs. The strategy is based on the use of retention data introduced into a computer program; the program calculates conditions for column switching and step-gradient elution. As an example for the validation of this approach, we developed a multiresidue method that is capable of assaying nine polar pesticides: bentazone, DNOC, dinoseb, <b>dinoterb,</b> metamitron, monuron, metribuzin, diuron, and linuron. Using computer simulation, we found proper conditions for the on-line cleanup of extracts by means of column switching and subsequent step-gradient elution for efficient separation of the analytes. The pesticides can be assayed in ground water samples down to a concentration of 0. 1 ppb. Recoveries, made at concentrations between 0. 2 and 2. 8 ppb (n = 10 for each pesticide), ranged from 67 to 114 % with relative standard deviations (RSD) of 4. 5 - 8. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|Nitration {{reactions}} of aromatic compounds are commonly involved in different industrial processes for pharmaceutical, pesticide or military uses. For many years, {{most of the}} manufacturing sites used lagooning systems to treat their process effluents. In view of a photocatalytic degradation assay, the wastewater of a lagoon was investigated by using HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. The wastewater was highly concentrated in RDX (hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine), HMX (octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazocine) and two herbicides <b>Dinoterb</b> (2 -tert-butyl- 4, 6 -dinitrophenol) and Dinoseb (2 -sec-butyl- 4, 6 -dinitrophenol). First of all, an analytical method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) combined with HPLC ESI MS/MS was put in work for identification and titration of RDX, HMX and the two dinitrophenols in a complex natural matrix. Then, the UV/TiO 2 treatment was investigated for pollutants removal. Dinitrophenolic compoundswere significantly degraded after a 8 -h-exposition of the wastewater/TiO 2 suspension, whereas RDX and HMX were poorly affected...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDinoterb (6 -t-butyl- 2, 4 -dinitrophenol), 1, Dinoseb (6 -secbutyl- 2, 4 -dinitrophenol), 2, TBP (2 -t-butylphenol), 3, and DNP (2, 4 -dinitrophenol), 4, {{have been}} {{analyzed}} by electrospray ionization {{in the negative}} mode (ESI-N) - tandem mass spectrometry. Nominal laboratory collision energy was varied from zero to 60 eV during the experiments. Apparent fragmentation energies were estimated from a parametric fitting of the collision efficiency curves. In parallel, fragmentation mechanisms of the deprotonated molecules [M-H](-) were explored using quantum chemistry modeling at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 + G(d,p) level. A major fragmentation of the [M-H](-) ions of <b>Dinoterb</b> and Dinoseb is elimination of an alcohol molecule. This reaction is shown to involve one oxygen atom originating from a nitro group rather than the phenoxide moiety. Eliminations of NO, C(4) and CH(2) = C(CH(3)) (2), i. e. reactions involving significant rearrangements, constitute the {{major part of the}} other fragmentation pathways observed from [3 -H](-) and [4 -H](-) ions.

40|$|Herbogil (<b>dinoterb),</b> a {{reference}} herbicide, the mineral oil Oleo (paraffin oil {{used as an}} additive to herbicides), and Goltix (metamitron) were taken as model compounds {{for the study of}} impacts on microbial soil communities. After the treatment of soil samples, effects on metabolic sum parameters were determined by monitoring substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and dehydrogenase activity, as well as carbon and nitrogen mineralization. These conventional ecotoxicological testing procedures are used in pesticide registration. Inhibition of biomass-related activities and stimulation of nitrogen mineralization were the most significant effects caused by the application of Herbogil. Even though Goltix and Oleo were used at a higher dosage (10 times higher), the application of Goltix resulted in smaller effects and the additive Oleo was the least-active compound, with minor stimulation of test parameters at later observation times. The results served as a background for investigation of the power of “fingerprinting” methods in microbial ecology. Changes in catabolic activities induced by treatments were analyzed by using the 95 carbon sources provided by the BIOLOG system. Variations in the complex metabolic fingerprints demonstrated inhibition of many catabolic pathways after the application of Herbogil. Again, the effects of the other compounds were expressed at much lower levels and comprised stimulations as well as inhibitions. Testing for significance by a multivariate t test indicated that the sensitivity of this method was similar to the sensitivities of the conventional testing procedures. The variation of sensitive carbon sources, as determined by factor weights at different observation times, indicated the dynamics of the community shift induced by the Herbogil treatment in more detail. DNA extractions from soil resulted in a collection of molecules representing the genetic composition of total bacterial communities. Distinct and highly reproducible community patterns, or genetic fingerprints, resulting from application of the different herbicides were obtained by the sequence-specific separation of partial 16 S rDNA amplification products in temperature gradient gel electrophoresis. Significant pattern variations were quantified. For detailed analysis, application-responsive bands from the Herbogil and Oleo treatments were sequenced and their tentative phylogenetic positions were identified. Data interpretation and the potentials and biases of the additional observation windows on microbial communities are discussed...|$|E
