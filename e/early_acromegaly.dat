40|$|Acromegaly is {{uncommon}} in kindreds with {{multiple endocrine neoplasia}} type 1 (MEN 1), whereas primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) has the highest penetrance of any endocrinopathy. We report an unusual MEN 1 kindred with frequent expression of pituitary tumors and a low penetrance of PHP. Four members {{were found to have}} disease: PHP in generation I, acromegaly (2 cases) in generation II, and hyperprolactinemia associated with a pituitary tumor in generation III. There was no evidence for PHP in 1 patient with acromegaly (age 60 yr), the patient with hyperprolactinemia and the pituitary tumor (age 22 yr), and 1 asymptomatic obligate carrier (age 50 yr). Screening of 26 members revealed the possible diagnosis of PHP in 1 family member in generation II and possible <b>early</b> <b>acromegaly</b> in 2 members of generation III with elevated serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein- 3 but normal patterns of pulsatile GH release. Although the predisposing genetic defect in typical MEN 1 families has previously been mapped to chromosome location 11 q 13 without evidence of heterogeneity among the 87 families analyzed, linkage of disease in this family to the MEN 1 region is unlikely based on haplotype analysis. Localization of the gene(s) responsible for disease in such atypical families may aid in the understanding of the pathogenesis of MEN 1. In addition, further study of the earliest changes in patterns of pulsatile GH release in familial acromegaly may allow more insight into the pathogenesis and natural history of this disease...|$|E
40|$|Although aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor-interacting protein (AIP) mutations are rare in sporadic acromegaly, their prevalence among young patients is nonnegligible. The objectives {{of this study}} were to evaluate the frequency of AIP mutations in a cohort of Mexican patients with acromegaly with disease onset before the age of 30 and to search for molecular abnormalities in the AIP gene in teeth obtained from the "Tampico Giant". Peripheral blood DNA from 71 patients with acromegaly (51 females) with disease onset T (p. Arg 304 Ter), well-known truncating mutation was identified; in one of these two cases and her identical twin sister, the mutation proved to be a de novo event, since neither of their parents were found to be carriers. In the remaining three patients, new mutations were identified: a frameshift mutation (c. 976 _ 977 insC, p. Gly 326 AfsTer), an in-frame deletion (c. 872 _ 877 del, p. Val 291 _Leu 292 del) and a nonsense mutation (c. 868 A > T, p. Lys 290 Ter), which are predicted to be pathogenic based on in silico analysis. Patients with AIP mutations tended to have an <b>earlier</b> onset of <b>acromegaly</b> and harboured larger and more invasive tumours. A previously described genetic variant of unknown significance (c. 869 C > T, p. Ala 299 Val) was identified in DNA from the Tampico Giant. The prevalence of AIP mutations in young Mexican patients with acromegaly {{is similar to that of}} European cohorts.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{morbidity}} and mortality are increased in acromegaly. In fact, GH and IGF-I excess induces a specific cardiomyopathy. The <b>early</b> stage of <b>acromegaly</b> {{is characterized by the}} hyperkinetic syndrome (high heart rate and increased systolic output). Frequently, concentric biventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction occur in acromegaly, leading to an impaired systolic function ending in heart failure if the disease is untreated or unsuccessfully untreated. Besides, abnormalities of cardiac rhythm and of valves have been also described in acromegaly. The coexistence of other complications, such as arterial hypertension and diabetes, aggravates the acromegalic cardiomyopathy. The suppression of GH/IGF-I following an efficacious therapy could decrease left ventricular mass and improve cardiac function. In conclusion, a careful evaluation of cardiac function, morphology and activity seems to be mandatory in acromegaly...|$|R
40|$|Acromegaly is the {{clinical}} condition which results from prolonged, excessive circulating levels of growth hormone (GH) in adults, which {{occurs in the}} young before epiphyseal fusion, is called pituitary giantism. Acromegaly was first described in 1886 by Pierre Marie, who noted “a striking non-congenital hypertrophy of the extremities 2 ̆ 2.

Acromegaly is a desease of the whole organism where everything but the central nervous system enlarges. Although the diagnosis is often made accidentally, the patient usually presents complaining of a change in appearance of the face, hands or whole body, headaches, sweating, goiter or secondary symptoms of pituitary enlargement.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} {{claimed to be}} one of the most severe {{complications}} of acromegaly, contributing significantly to mortality in this disease. In fact, an excess of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) causes a specific derangement of cardiomyocytes, leading to abnormalities in cardiac muscle structure and function, inducing a specific cardiomyopathy. In the <b>early</b> phase of <b>acromegaly</b> the excess of GH and IGF-I induces a hyperkinetic syndrome, characterized by increased heart rate and increased systolic output. Concentric hypertrophy is the most common feature of cardiac involvement in acromegaly, found in more than two thirds of patients at diagnosis. This abnormality is commonly associated with diastolic dysfunction and eventually with impaired systolic function ending in heart failure, if the GH/IGF-I excess is left untreated. In addition, abnormalities of cardiac rhythm and of heart valves have also been described in acromegaly. The coexistence of other complications, such as arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, aggravates acromegalic cardiomyopathy. Successful control of acromegaly induces a decrease in left ventricular mass and an improvement in diastolic function, while the effects of GH/IGF-I suppression on systolic function are more variable. However, since cardiovascular alterations in young patients with short disease duration are milder than in those with longer disease duration, it is likely to be easier to reverse and/or arrest acromegalic cardiomyopathy in young patients with early-onset disease. In conclusion, careful assessments of cardiac function, morphology, and activity are required in patients with <b>acromegaly.</b> An <b>early</b> diagnosis and prompt effective treatment are important in order to reverse acromegalic cardiomyopathy...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the features of glucose metabolism in patients with acromegaly depending on treatment. Materials and methods: 63 patients with acromegaly: 29 patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly, 25 patients receiving somatostatin analogs (SSA) therapy and 9 patients underwent surgical treatment. Patients with earlier revealed diabetes mellitus (DM) were not included. The characterization of glucose metabolism was carried out by means of an assessment of fasting insulin plasma levels (FIP) and indexes of an insulinresistance (IR) HOMA-R and an insulinsensivity (IS) MATSUDA. Results: In patients receiving SSA therapy the carbohydrate metabolism disorders (CMD) were revealed in 92 %, among newly diagnosed acromegalic patients – in 62 % and in patients after surgical treatment in 33 % of cases. In newly diagnosed acromegalic patients index MATSUDA was 3, 5 times lower than in patients receiving SSA therapy, and 4 times lower than in patients after surgical treatment ((р= 0, 001). НОМА-R in newly diagnosed acromegalic patients was 3, 7 times higher than in other groups, p= 0, 003 and the level of FIP was 4, 3 times higher than in patients receiving SSA therapy and 2, 9 times higher than in patients after surgical treatment (р= 0, 001). The index MATSUDA in newly diagnosed acromegalic patients with early CMD was 2, 9 times lower, р= 0, 006, НОМА-R – 2, 5 times higher, р= 0, 025 and FIP 2, 4 times higher, р= 0, 039 than in patients with <b>early</b> CMDs without <b>acromegaly.</b> Conclusions: In patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly in the absence of CMDs increase in IR is compensated by hyperinsulinemia. In patients, receiving SSA therapy the IR decreases, however suppression of secretion of insulin leads to increase in percentage of DM in this group. After surgical treatment IR decreases against higher level of fasting plasma insulin that leads to normalization of carbohydrate metabolism.

40|$|Arthropathy is {{the major}} cause of {{morbidity}} in acromegaly. To feature the spinal involvement, 54 patients with active acromegaly (27 men, 27 women; age range, 21 - 69 yr) and 54 sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this observational analytical prospective case-control study. A questionnaire to describe onset, duration, and severity of articular symptoms; rheumatological examination, including vertebral and chest mobility, Schober test, thorax expansion, and axial radiological study; and IGF-I, GH, insulin, and glucose level measurement (baseline and after an oral glucose tolerance test) was used to investigate the prevalence of arthropathy and correlate these findings with hormonal parameters. Axial arthropathy was found in 28 patients (52 %) and 12 controls (22 %; chi(2) = 8. 9; P = 0. 003). In detail, spinal mobility was reduced in 30 patients (56 %) and 10 controls (18 %; chi(2) = 14. 3; P < 0. 0001), thoracic cage was involved in six patients (11 %), alterations of spinal profile were observed in 37 patients (68 %) and 15 controls (28 %; chi(2) = 16. 3; P < 0. 0001), and increased L 2 vertebra diameters were observed in 34 patients (63 %) {{and none of the}} controls (chi(2) = 46. 7; P < 0. 0001). Narrowing and widening of L 2 -L 3 disk space were found in 20 (37 %) and seven (13 %) patients, respectively. Features of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) were found in 11 patients (20 %) and none of the controls (chi(2) = 10. 1; P < 0. 001). Disease duration was correlated with vertebral body height (P = 0. 001) or intervertebral space height (P = 0. 02), and lumbar mobility with thorax expansion (P = 0. 004); DISH severity was correlated with basal (P = 0. 04) and peak (P = 0. 01) glucose levels after glucose load. In conclusion, chronic GH and IGF-I excess typically affects the axial skeleton with development of severe alterations of spine morphology and function until features of DISH occur. An <b>early</b> diagnosis of <b>acromegaly</b> is mandatory to reduce the severity of spine abnormalities as they were significantly higher in patients with longer disease duratio...|$|R

The disease is associated with multiple significant comorbidities and increased mortality. The delay to diagnosis is often long. This may be because of low disease awareness among health care professionals, the insidious onset of differentiating features, and because patients are likely to present with complaints typical of other conditions more frequently seen in primary care. <b>Early</b> identification of <b>acromegaly</b> facilitates prompt treatment initiation and may minimize the permanent effects of excess growth hormone. The primary treatment for many patients will be pituitary surgery, although not all patients {{will be eligible for}} surgery or achieve a surgical cure. If biochemical control is not achieved following surgery, other treatment options include medical therapy and radiation therapy. Improved biochemical control may only alleviate rather than reverse the associated comorbidities. Thus, lifelong monitoring of patient health is needed, with particular attention to the management of cardiovascular risk factors. It is additionally important to consider the impact of both disease and treatment on patients&# 39; quality of life and minimize that impact where possible, but particularly for chronic therapies. For the majority of patients, chronic therapy is likely to include somatostatin analog injections. In some circumstances, {{it may be possible to}} extend the dosing interval of the analog once good biochemical control is achieved. Additional convenience may be gained from the possibility of self-/partner administration of treatment or administration of treatment by a health care professional at home. Overall, it is clear that the care of patients with acromegaly requires a highly coordinated approach involving numerous specialties (eg, endocrinology, surgery, cardiology). Further, patients&# 39; needs must be at the core of management and every effort must be made to improve health care experiences and minimize treatment burdens.

40|$|In {{contemporary}} clinical cardiology practice, echocardiography plays {{a leading}} role in the diagnosis and management guidance of various forms of myocardial remodelling. Furthermore, it is the most commonly used diagnostic technique in the elucidation of the underlying substrates and pathophysiologic mechanisms of heart failure as a consequence of ventricular remodelling. Due to its widespread availability, non-invasiveness, userfriendliness and relatively low cost, echocardiography is still irreplaceable by other cardiac imaging methods which should rather be seen as complementary diagnostic tools. This thesis sought to study several types of ventricular remodelling and their consequences on regional and global myocardial function, employing different echocardiographic tools and dedicated signal and image analysis algorithms in the detection of ventricular dysfunction. Recent echocardiographic techniques based on Myocardial Velocity Imaging have provided the possibility of a more detailed and integrated insight to cardiac (dys-) function. Based on novel understandings, we first gave an original integrated overview on ‘cardiac function’, distinguishing intrinsic myocyte function (often referred to as contractility) and ventricular pump function as well as the main components of function, namely force development and deformation. Additionally, the boundary conditions in which the heart functions, which determine the interactions between these components were defined as: a) wall properties such as tissue composition/elasticity, fibre structure and global geometry, and b) interaction between the heart and peripheral circulation, mostly described as (pressure & volume) loading conditions. Furthermore, Doppler echocardiography data were analyzed in a study addressing flow remodelling as a consequence of cellular and force remodelling in ischaemically remodelled hearts. A dedicated automated quantification of the CW outflow Doppler traces was used to define specific trace parameters indicative of myocardial dysfunction. It was shown that decreased overall contractility results in a more symmetrical outflow velocity profile, which would suggest that the global development of contractile force has been remodelled to cope with the decreased output resulting from decreased contractility. Similar automatic quantification of the aortic instantaneous peak velocities was further employed in patients with hypertrophic remodelling due to aortic stenosis. This study has shown that the values of trace asymmetry before surgery are predictive of the change in EF 112 pre- and postoperatively: all of the patients with markedly symmetric preoperative instantaneous peak velocities showed stagnation or deterioration of EF postoperatively. Furthermore, the study has proven that the symmetry of the shape of the instantaneous peak velocities is a more reliable predictor of functional improvement after the valve replacement procedure as compared to mean aortic gradient and aortic valve area which are widely used in preoperative assessment of patients with aortic stenosis. An intraoperative Doppler myocardial imaging study was performed along with standard echocardiography in an analysis of electrical remodelling in patients with LBBB during the CRT implantation procedure. In addition to confirming the septal flash as a mechanical consequence of the underlying electrical problem and a valid marker of intraventricular dyssynchrony, an acute contractility recruitment, resolution of the septal flash as well as reverse remodelling immediately following CRT device activation was shown in these patients. As opposed to remodelling induced by changes in loading conditions, evidence of hypertrophy and hypercontractility without an additional change in afterload resulting in increased cardiac output and inducing additional signs of vascular remodelling was demonstrated in patients with <b>early</b> stage <b>acromegaly.</b> Finally, a comprehensive view on the changing role of echocardiography in the diagnosis of hypertrophic myopathies is presented. Previous knowledge as well as regional deformation data (including deformation pattern analysis) are combined to provide an indicator toward the disease underlying hypertrophic ventricular remodelling: in hypertensive heart disease LVH is predominantly localized in the basal septal region showing reduced systolic strain values with post-systolic shortening; systemic diseases such as Fabry’s disease often affect a specific region - the basal (infero) lateral segment in which post-systolic deformation is often present. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with regions of local fibre disarray, in which no myocardial deformation is present at all, while in the surrounding segments (often showing similar thickness) deformation is reduced, but almost normal as compared to undiseased hearts. The absence of deformation is mostly associated with the thickest segments. Amyloidosis seems to provide an exception in which the impairment of systolic function affects the myocardium globally – it is presented with global LVH and diffuse, severe reduction of longitudinal strain, while the radial strain is still preserved, but of low values...|$|R
