40|$|The {{business}} value {{of information technology}} (IT) is increasingly being cocreated by multiple parties, opening opportunities for new research initiatives. Previous studies on IT value cocreation mainly focus on analyzing sources of cocreated IT value, yet inadequately accommodating the influence of competition relationships in IT value cocreation activities. To fill the gap, this in-progress paper suggests an agent-based modeling (also simulation) approach to investigating potential influences of the dynamic interplay between cooperation and competition relationships in IT value cocreation settings. In particular, the research proposes a high-level conceptual <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> <b>position</b> general IT value cocreation processes. A relational network view is offered, aiming at decomposing and systemizing several typical cooperation and competition scenarios in practical IT value cocreation settings.

In this paper, we investigate the ability of the support vector machine to predict outcomes in emerging environments in marketing, such as automated modeling, mass-produced models, intelligent software agents, and data mining. The support vector machine (SVM) is a semiparametric technique with origins in the machine-learning literature of computer science. Its approach to prediction differs markedly from that of standard parametric models. We explore these differences and benchmark the SVM's prediction hit-rates against those from the multinomial logit model. Because there are few applications of the SVM in marketing, we develop a <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> <b>position</b> it against current modeling techniques and to assess its weaknesses as well as its strengths. automated modeling, choice models, kernel transformations, multinomial logit model, predictive models, support vector machine...|$|R

We argue that where principal institutions intersect (i. e., family and business); managerial perceptions of stakeholder salience will be different and more complex than where institutions {{are based on a}} single dominant logic. We propose that (1) whereas utilitarian power is more likely in the general business case, normative power is more typical in family business stakeholder salience; (2) whereas in a general business context legitimacy is socially constructed; for family stakeholders, legitimacy is based on heredity; and (3) whereas temporality and criticality are somewhat independent in general-business urgency, they are linked in the family business case because of family ties and family-centered non-economic goals.

40|$|In the era {{of cloud}} computing, {{multi-tenant}} based Software as a Service (SaaS) applications have been widely identified as {{the next generation of}} cloud applications. SaaS allows multiple user organizations to customize an application in a reliable and secure manner. However, this customization is a complex and error prone exercise. In response, researchers and practitioners have come up with SaaS architectures based on frameworks, platforms and modelling approaches to ease the complexity of SaaS application development. However, these methods and tools have not focused on aspect of development methodology being tuned to support long-term maintenance of the SaaS application. This paper presents an architectural framework for SaaS application development that incorporates long-term maintenance requirements arising from multi-tenancy of the application. It consists of a methodology coupled with a tool chain, which brings multi-tenancy aware features to develop SaaS solutions that meet critical architectural requirements. It also includes a UML 2. 0 based Profile named SaaSML for designing of main components, a skeletal <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> <b>position</b> these components and a methodology for benchmark evaluation of key design criteria...|$|R
40|$|The term “cultural entrepreneurship” {{has been}} {{increasingly}} {{used during the}} new millennium, mirroring the rapidly growing importance of the “quaternary sector of the economy,” i. e. knowledge-based industries, including culture. Exploration of the literatur e in which the term “cultural entrepreneurship” is used does not bring a solid, clear-cut, and unambiguous understanding of its definition or meaning. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present various uses of the concept and to bring about some clarity in how the concept can be understood. Two overarching uses of the cultural entrepreneurship concept have been found: 1. the anthropologist’s and institutional economist’s use, which indicates the dynamic development of intangible cultural features such as symbols, myths, languages, beliefs, values, norms, rituals, and attitudes in and between societies, and 2. the arts development use, which indicates the dynamic development of cultural services, tangible goods, and individual or collective career promotion.

40|$|This paper {{builds on}} Birkinshaw's model of {{multinational}} enterprise (MNE) as an internal market system [Birkinshaw, J. (2000). Entrepreneurship {{in the global}} firm. London: Sage]. This model addresses the {{issues related to the}} emergence of market-based mechanisms of coordination within the MNEs and the strategic decisions that affect internal competition. Birkinshaw argues that subsidiaries simultaneously participate in three different internal markets within an MNE: a market for intermediate goods and services, one for charters and another for competencies and practices. The goal of the paper is to expand Birkinshaw's concept of internal market and analyze the logic behind internal competition by considering more fully existing literature and developing an organizing <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> <b>position</b> such a model within that literature. There is specific focus on discussing how the internal market model relates to modern network-based configurations of the MNE. In addition, the study shows that factors affecting the extent to which each of the three internal markets is established can be better understood if we link such a model to the contributions developed by three mainstreams of research: internalization theory, resource-based view and organizational learning literature.

40|$|This thesis {{advances}} several core arguments {{surrounding the}} need for a dynamic and nuanced conceptualisation and multi-dimensional <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> <b>position</b> parties towards European integration; that Europe does play a more important role in European elections than previously thought; that ideology is the strongest predictor of party positions; and finally that the quantitative study of party manifestos produces valid and reliable data for positioning political parties. The study finds that the European issue is the most important in European election manifestos and that parties do exhibit similar behaviour in both national and European elections. Furthermore, it finds that ideology remains an important and strong predictive factor, but its explanatory power diminishes in the analyses towards the newer dimensions of integration (social, cultural, and foreign policy). With the in-depth examination of party positions, it is possible to identify a significantly greater number of Eurosceptic parties using the new definition, that Euroscepticism is now found in all political party families, and that there remains a strong ideological component in the content of their positions towards integration. However, ideology is a stronger predictive factor for the left-wing parties, with those on the right being more fragmented and heterogeneou...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – When {{comparing}} novel centralized {{and distributed}} communications and video streaming services, the authors identified {{a need for}} a theoretic <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> <b>position</b> a multitude of ICT services and technologies according to their value proposition. Literature does not integrate existing value analysis concepts into a holistic theoretical framework. This paper aims to address this shortcoming by proposing a value analysis framework for ICT services capable of describing the value exchanges between different actors and their role constellations based on technological componentizations. Design/methodology/approach – The paper evaluates a representative selection of communications and video streaming services and an extensive literature study on existing value analysis research was conducted <b>to</b> develop the <b>framework</b> and <b>to</b> verify it. Findings – The paper demonstrates the applicability of the value analysis framework in communications and video streaming case studies, which are technically very different from each other but, at the abstraction level the framework provides, display very similar characteristics in value flows and role constellations. Research limitations/implications – The value analysis framework could be extended and verified with other case studies and complemented with quantitative modeling and system dynamics.

40|$|The author {{proposes a}} <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> <b>position</b> ecopreneurship in {{relation}} to other forms of environmental management. The framework provides a reference for man-agers to introduce ecopreneurship. Five basic positions are distinguished according to the degree of environmental orientation of a company’s core business and the market impact of the company: environmental administrators, environmental man-agers, alternative activists, bioneers and ecopreneurs. The author suggests an approach to the qualitative operationalisation of ecopreneurship and to how <b>to</b> assess the <b>position</b> of a company in a classification matrix. The degree of environ-mental orientation in the company is assessed on the basis of environmental goals and policies, the ecological profile of the range of products and services, the organ-isation of environmental management in the company and the communication of environmental issues. The other dimension of ecopreneurship examined, the market impact of the company, is measured on the basis of market share, sales growth and the reactions of competitors. The approach is then applied to seven case studies of companies. The case studies show that the basic concept of ecopreneurship is applicable. The company representatives saw the approach as helpful in clarifying their position in ecopreneurial terms. The main benefit of the approach is that it provides a framework for self-assessment and indications for improvement...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of the paper: The study {{provides}} a theoretical {{analysis of the}} implications of sustainability in business, with a specific focus on the ecological dimension. In particular, we introduce key concepts from natural science and ecological economics into the field of management in order to highlight the limits that characterize the natural capital and our individual and organizational dependence on it. Methodology: The paper draws upon a mix of literature review (management, ecology and ecological economics), action research and field studies. Findings: The study presents the reasons for a profound transformation of the dominant business paradigm in order to address sustainability challenges. Furthermore, it introduces a conceptual <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> <b>position</b> and analyse corporate actions to manage environmental issues and identifies four areas of intervention and research as key drivers of transformational change. Practical implications: By stressing the managerial importance of concepts like carrying capacity, critical natural capital, and ecosystem services and by pointing out the need for collaborative approaches, the paper advances innovative perspectives to analyse and develop sustainable business strategies and operations. Research limitation: The paper shares the limits of conceptual works based on a deductive method. However, to address this limitation, the study is also supported and complemented by the empirical experience gained in more than two decades of fruitful collaboration with companies and institutions.

40|$|Arts-based {{research}} is a generally new research approach within qualitative research tradition. It has increasingly being applied in various disciplines, including health, psychology, education, and anthropology. Arts-based research uses artistic forms and expressions to explore, understand and represent human experiences. Compared to more traditional qualitative research methods, arts-based {{research is}} {{more prone to}} ambiguity and creativity. (Barone & Eisner, 2011) This paper {{is an attempt to}} create order in an otherwise messy field of arts-based approaches by presenting a classification <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> <b>position</b> different types of arts-based approaches and methods. Three major families between art and research have been drawn, namely, art as research, art in research and research about art. Art as research is what artist-researchers usually call artistic research. Art as research is used to gain a deeper understanding of a phenomenon through the systematic study of the artistic process. Art in research refers to research where art is used in one or more phases in the research process, including raising research questions, data collection, data analysis, representation of findings, dissemination of findings and evoke responses from audience. When the focus of research is about art, researchers study topics related with art, without artistically interfering with the subject under study, nor do they use artistic process as a way to inquiry. There are four major forms in arts-based research, which are visual art, audio art, performing art and literal art. Each form can be creatively applied as a way of inquiry, or in a scientific research. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In pathogens, certain genes {{encoding}} {{proteins that}} directly interact with host defences coevolve with their host and {{are subject to}} positive selection. In the lepidopteran host-wasp parasitoid system, {{one of the most}} original strategies developed by the wasps to defeat host defences is the injection of a symbiotic polydnavirus {{at the same time as}} the wasp eggs. The virus is essential for wasp parasitism success since viral gene expression alters the immune system and development of the host. As a wasp mutualist symbiont, the virus is expected to exhibit a reduction in genome complexity and evolve under wasp phyletic constraints. However, as a lepidopteran host pathogenic symbiont, the virus is likely undergoing strong selective pressures for the acquisition of new functions by gene acquisition or duplication. To understand the constraints imposed by this particular system on virus evolution, we studied a polydnavirus gene family encoding cyteine protease inhibitors of the cystatin superfamily. Results We show that cystatins are the first bracovirus genes proven to be subject to strong positive selection within a host-parasitoid system. A generated three-dimensional model of Cotesia congregata bracovirus cystatin 1 provides a powerful <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> <b>position</b> positively selected residues and reveal that they are concentrated in the vicinity of actives sites which interact with cysteine proteases directly. In addition, phylogenetic analyses reveal two different cystatin forms which evolved under different selective constraints and are characterized by independent adaptive duplication events. Conclusion Positive selection acts to maintain cystatin gene duplications and induces directional divergence presumably to ensure the presence of efficient and adapted cystatin forms. Directional selection has acted on key cystatin active sites, suggesting that cystatins coevolve with their host target. We can strongly suggest that cystatins constitute major virulence factors, as was already proposed in previous functional studies. </p...|$|R
