50|$|Humfrey {{was intent}} on {{introducing}} these ‘modern’ techniques. Beginning in November 1566, in Tintern, a village along the River Wye in Monmouthshire, he oversaw the construction of England’s first wireworks operated by water power. What was now needed was {{a steady supply of}} high-quality iron from which the wire could be manufactured. In 1567, Humfrey succeeded in obtaining the services of an expert in the production of Osmond iron from the south-western part of Westphalia, in northern Germany. This expert arrived in Wales in 1567 and began working at a forge located in Rhyd-y-Gwern, a hamlet in the Glamorganshire part of the parish of Machen, about 20 miles southwest of the Tintern wireworks. The expert’s name was later provided in Humfrey’s letter of 24 August 1577:'one Corslett, a German born who at his coming over into this realm first devised more commodius engines than ever before was known or used in England…engines, tools and devices as were first used and invented by the said Corslet, for the making and <b>hoosing</b> of Osmond iron…'According to historian H.R. Schubert, the full name of this expert was Corslett Tinkhaus of Westphalia, Germany.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAs {{the number}} of cores {{continues}} to grow in both digital signal and general purpose processors, tools which perform automatic scheduling from model-based designs are of increasing interest. This scheduling consists of statically distributing the tasks that constitute an application between available cores in a multi-core architecture {{in order to minimize}} the final latency. This problem has been proven to be NP-complete. A static scheduling algorithm is usually described as a monolithic process, and carries out three distinct functions: <b>hoosing</b> the core to execute a specific function, choosing the medium to transfer a specific data block and evaluating the cost of the generated solutions. This paper describes a scheduling framework which splits these functions into reusable sub-modules. This division produces a new level of scalability in terms of schedule quality and computation time, thus enabling the combination of several scheduling heuristics with different architecture models...|$|E

40|$|The {{practice}} of excluding students with social maladjust-ments from special education has stimulated various professional opinions. Maag and Howell have speculated from a cultural-organizational perspective about {{why such a}} practice exists {{and how best to}} address it. It was particularly interesting to note the similarities between their premise and that of William Rhodes, who wrote 20 years ago about social deviance from a sociological and ecological perspective. Maag and Howell have once again reminded us that we cannot prevent and treat emotional and behavioral problems in students by dealing only with the students (i. e., definitions, labels, diagnostic-prescriptive models); prevention and treatment must address system restructuring and a change of values. I agree. However, I also believe that system restructuring needs to include some coercive change techniques such as a revised, more inclusive, federal definition of emotional and behavioral disorders.
