40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to shed light on the main financial elements related to the last enlargement of the European Union (EU), which is the largest in its history.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at the {{practicing}} actuary to introduce the theory of extreme values and a <b>financial</b> <b>framework</b> to price excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties. We introduce the reader to extreme value theory via the classical central limit theorem. Two key results in extreme value theory are presented and illustrated with concrete examples. The discussion then moves on to collective risk models, considerations in modeling tail events, and measures of risk. All these concepts are brought together with the modeling of actual losses. In the last section of the paper all previous elements are brought together with a <b>financial</b> <b>framework</b> for the pricing of a layer of reinsurance.

40|$|The Sapir {{report in}} 2004 famously dubbed the EU Budget a {{historical}} relic. In spite {{of calls from}} many quarters for a comprehensive budget reform, the Council negotiation was hampered by many institutional and political constraints and managed to deliver only limited change. However, the final agreement on the Multiannual <b>Financial</b> <b>Framework</b> 2007 / 13 did introduce a potentially important novelty, namely a review clause in 2008 / 9. Such an occasion should be seized to introduce appropriate incentives and tools for revamping the EU budget {{with the aim of}} making it consistent with the Lisbon-oriented objectives of the EU. This paper argues for the respect of the Multiannual <b>Financial</b> <b>Framework</b> over the period covered rather than in every single year and per every single heading. This should be accomplished via an inter-temporal guarantee of the respect of the Multiannual <b>Financial</b> <b>Framework</b> and coupled with cost-benefit analysis of the additional spending carried out at the EU level. Such â€œconstrained flexibilityâ€, which can be introduced either under the current or the new Lisbon Treaty, should be supported by appropriate governance arrangements to ensure the respect of subsidiarity, allow an efficient running of the budget and enforce budgetary discipline.
