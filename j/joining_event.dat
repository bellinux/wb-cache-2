40|$|Immunoglobulin {{kappa chain}} gene {{formation}} involves site-specific somatic recombination between {{one of several}} hundred germ-line variable region genes and a joining site (or "J segment") encoded close to the constant region gene. We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of major portions of the recombination region of the mouse kappa gene and discovered a series of five such J segments spread out along a segment of DNA 2. 4 kilobases from the kappa constant region gene. These J segments encode the 13 COOH-terminal amino acids of the variable region, probably including amino acids involved in the antigen combining site and in heavy/light chain contacts. The J segments also display striking sequence homology {{to one another in}} both their coding and immediately flanking sequences. Major elements of a short palindrome [...] CAC(TA) GTG [...] are preserved adjacent to the recombination sites of both variable and J region genes and constitute inverted repeats {{at both ends of the}} sequences to be joined. These palindromes can be written as a hypothetical stem structure that draws variable and J regions together, providing a possible molecular basis for the DNA <b>joining</b> <b>event.</b> Four of the J segments that we have discovered encode amino acid sequences already found in myeloma proteins. By altering the frame of recombination, we can account for additional light chain amino acid sequences, suggesting that the V/J <b>joining</b> <b>event</b> might generate antibody diversity somatically both by using different combinations of variable and J region genes and by using alternative joining frames...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} {{amino acid}} sequence diversity of Ig variable (V) j regions {{is known to be}} derived from both evolutionary and somatic processes (I- 3). Comparison of {{amino acid sequence}}s of mouse myeloma and hybridoma K light (L) chains, for example, indicates that these sequences can be arranged into groups such that members of a group are more similar to each other than to members of other groups (4 - 6). In the case of mouse ~ L chains, multiple V region genes have been observed (7, 8) for most groups of V regions tested. Thus, the multiple germ line V ~ genes provide a portion of the V region diversity observed at the protein level. Additional diversity is introduced by permitting each V ~ gene to join with any one of four different active joining (J) segments, by introducing junctional diversity during the <b>joining</b> <b>event,</b> and by somatic mutation (for review, see refs. 3 and 9). Several mouse V ~ genetic markers have been described which involve characteristic V ~ regions that are expressed by some inbred strains of mice, but not by others. These genetic markers have been detected by peptide mapping (10, 11...|$|E

40|$|The t(11; 18) (q 21;q 21) {{between the}} {{inhibitor}} of apoptosis API 2 and the MLT gene {{is a distinct}} feature of marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of MALT-type. Hitherto the chimeric API 2 -MLT transcripts are all "in-frame" and predominantly fuse exon 7 of API 2 to different MLT exons. Recurrent chromosomal translocations are common in lymphoid neoplasms and might represent by-products of the rearrangement processes generating antigen receptor diversity. The genomic structure of the MLT gene was determined to facilitate amplification of the genomic breakpoint junctions from 5 MALT-type lymphomas with t(11; 18). Their sequence analysis showed scattering of the chromosome 11 breakpoints in intron 7 of API 2 whereas rearrangements in MLT occurred in intron 2, 4, 7, or 8, respectively. Sequences around the junctions did not display recognition signal sequences mediating lymphocytic V(D) J recombination or other sequence motifs associated with recombination. The breakpoints occurred in a copy of an AluSx repeat in three cases, but interchromosomal Alu-mediated homologous recombination could be ruled out as the repeat resided only {{on one of the}} participating chromosomes. The t(11; 18) was associated with a deletion in 4 out of 5 cases, ranging in size from 53 bp up to more than 200 kb. These deletions were observed on one or sometimes both derivative chromosomes that might indicate the susceptibility of these regions for breakage. Our data suggest that the API 2 -MLT fusion might result from a non-homologous end <b>joining</b> <b>event</b> after multiple double-strand breaks. The clustering of breaks in intron 7 of API 2 and the consistent "in frame" API 2 -MLT fusions could therefore reflect certain functional constraints crucial for clonal outgrowth. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} that intergenic V(D) J rearrangement, a process referred to as trans-rearrangement, occurs at an unexpectedly high frequency. These rearrangements generate novel V(D) J combinations which could conceivably have some role in the normal immune system, and since they probably arise through chromosomal rearrangements akin to those associated with lymphoid neoplasia, they may {{also serve as a}} model for investigating recombinational events which underlie oncogenesis. In view of the existence of a mechanism that permits relatively frequent intergenic trans-rearrangements, it seems reasonable that interallelic trans-rearrangements involving segments belonging to each of the two alleles of a single antigen receptor gene might also occur. To determine the frequency of such rearrangements, we examined thymocytes of F 1 progeny of a cross between SWR mice, which have a deletion spanning 10 of the known V beta segments, and NZW mice, which have a deletion involving all J beta 2 segments. Rearranged TCR- beta genes containing V beta segments from the NZW chromosome and J beta segments from the SWR chromosome were amplified from the DNA of F 1 thymocytes with the polymerase chain reaction. Using this approach, we found that such rearrangements are relatively uncommon, being present in about 1 in 10 (5) thymocytes, a frequency lower than that of V gamma/J beta intergenic trans-rearrangements. The ratio of conventional cis-rearrangement to interallelic trans-rearrangement for any particular V beta segment appears to be about 10 (4) : 1. The structure of the junctions in all trans-rearrangements analyzed closely resembles conventional cis-rearrangements, indicating involvement of V(D) J recombinase in the ultimate <b>joining</b> <b>event.</b> However, in contrast to cis- rearrangements, a strong bias for inclusion of D beta 1 segments over D beta 2 segments was noted, suggesting that interallelic trans- rearrangement may occur preferentially during attempted D-J joining. J beta 2 segment usage in trans-rearrangements also appeared to differ from that expected from previously studied cis-rearrangements. The results have implications with respect to the events and timing of conventional cis-rearrangement during thymocyte differentiation, and the prevalence of various types of trans-rearrangements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Analysis of {{the primary}} {{structure}} of DNA polymerase ε B subunit defined similarities to B subunits of eukaryotic DNA polymerases α, δ and ε {{as well as the}} small subunits of DNA polymerase DI of Euryarchaeota. Multiple sequence alignment of these proteins revealed the presence of 12 conserved motifs and defined a novel protein superfamily. The members of the B subunit family share a common domain architecture, suggesting a similar fold, and arguing for a conserved function among these proteins. The contribution of human DNA polymerase ε to nuclear DNA replication was studied using the antibody K 18 that specifically inhibits the activity of this enzyme in vitro. This antibody significantly inhibited DNA synthesis both when microinjected into nuclei of exponentially growing human fibroblasts and in isolated HeLa cell nuclei, but did not inhibit SV 40 DNA replication in vitro. These results suggest that the human DNA polymerase ε contributes substantially to the replicative synthesis of DNA and emphasises the differences between cellular replication and viral model systems. The human DNA polymerases ε and δ were found capable of gap-filling DNA synthesis during nucleotide excision repair in vitro. Both enzymes required PCNA and the clamp loader RFC, and in addition, polymerase δ required Fen- 1 to prevent excessive displacement synthesis. Nucleotide excision repair of a defined DNA lesion was completely reconstituted utilising largely recombinant proteins, only ligase I and DNA polymerases δ and ε provided as highly purified human enzymes. This system was also utilised to study the role of the transcription factor II H during repair. Human non-homologous end joining of model substrates with different DNA end configurations was studied in HeLa cell extracts. This process depended partially on DNA synthesis as an aphidicolin-dependent DNA polymerase was required for the formation of a subset of end joining products. Experiments with neutralising antibodies reveal that DNA polymerase α but not DNA polymerases β or ε, may represent this DNA polymerase activity. Our results indicate that DNA synthesis contributes to the stability of DNA ends, and influences both the efficiency and outcome of the end <b>joining</b> <b>event.</b> Furthermore, our results suggest a minor role of PCNA in non-homologous end joining...|$|E
