The [...] "butt", after tanning, is passed through a splitting-machine which removes the grain, or hair side, revealing what is termed the [...] "shell". The close fibers of the shell result in a smooth and pliable leather used almost exclusively in the manufacture of shoes [...] and watch straps, although another use is for the manufacture of <b>finger</b> <b>protection</b> tabs for recreational archery, where it is prized for its toughness, longevity, and protective qualities.|$|E
40|$|Young {{children}} have a natural curiosity and have not yet learned to avoid and get away from danger. It is often necessary to take measures {{to protect children from}} hazards. Parents buy protective products to avoid or decrease risks in their own and their children’s lives. Different kinds of protective products, including <b>finger</b> <b>protection,</b> are also common in nurseries, hospitals and other institutions. When a <b>finger</b> <b>protection</b> is bought and installed this gives the consumer a greater sense of security. It is vital that reality agrees with this sense. Otherwise the risk of injury may in fact increase, since a sense of security in the parent/supervisor often implies less supervision. It is therefore important to make sure that protective products on the market are safe and that they give the protection they were designed to give. This report presents a background study including injury statistics and discusses the hazards as well as methods of prevention/protection. <b>Finger</b> <b>protection</b> devices are divided into categories based on their protection method. Reasonable requirements, based on children’s characteristics and abilities, and ways to test these are discussed. Finally, suggestions of requirements and test methods are presented in the form of complete product standards for the different kinds of <b>finger</b> <b>protection.</b> ‘Finger protection’ in this report refers to protective devices designed to prevent crushing injuries between door leaf and door frame. This report deals only with non-integrated <b>finger</b> <b>protection</b> for inner doors, i. e. devices which are mounted onto an existing inner door. Currently there is no European standard regulating this kind of products...|$|E
40|$|Vibration-reducing {{viscous damper}} {{have been used}} to reduce the hand-transmitted {{vibration}} exposures from machines and powered hand tools but their effectiveness remains unclear, especially for <b>finger</b> <b>protection.</b> The objectives of this study are to determine whether viscous damper can attenuate the vibration transmitted to the fingers and to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms of how these viscous damper work. Thesis is presented on the basis of hand-arm vibration with the application of jigsaw tool. Attention is given to the damper design requirement for vibration reduction. The analysis of jigsaw power tool is helpful in determination of vibration exposure evaluation along with damper. The study of evaluation of exposures to the vibration produced within hand or body during operating the power tools is main purpose of this paper. This paper summarizes the vibration reduction in hand held power machinery with application of damping device. The vibration emission can be measured and controlled by effective mounting of damper on power tool. The purpose of this design guide is to aid the design engineer in selecting the proper damping device {{to reduce the amount of}} vibration or shock that is transmitted to human hand from equipment during operating condition...|$|E

50|$|The {{practice}} {{is generally considered}} safe sex {{as long as there}} are no open wounds on the fingers. The nails should be trimmed and filed; long, sharp or jagged nails can cause cuts, injury, or severe infection. If there are cuts, infections, or open wounds on the <b>fingers,</b> extreme <b>protection</b> and care is necessary. If finger cots are used they may slip off and remain inside the receptive partner. The hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and warm water before practicing any other activity to avoid spreading bacteria or germs. In stimulating both the anus and vagina, separate latex gloves are to be used for each to avoid cross-contamination.|$|R
40|$|SAW {{devices are}} {{routinely}} frequency trimmed at the wafer level {{prior to the}} dicing process so to improve yield at the assembly level. The trimming {{can be achieved by}} using wet etching, reactive ion etching, ion beam milling, and other methods. It is also possible to trim the frequency of patterned SAW wafer by depositing dielectric thin films on the wafer but this method is usually done for the purpose of <b>finger</b> shorting <b>protection</b> from metallic particles. Reactive ion etching can be used to trim assembled SAW devices prior to encapsulation. This is seldom employed since it is considered costly, inefficient, and difficult to perform in-situ. In this paper we propose trimming assembled SAW resonator (SAWR) by using the conventional crystal resonator fine-tuning process with gold thin film addition. Nowadays, the fine-tuning process is a necessary step in crystal resonator production. We show that this is a simple and well-controlled method to trim assembled SAW resonator also. This method provides a wide trimming range and the gold film is thin enough not to short out the SAW transducers so that the SAWR’s integrity can be maintained...|$|R
