5|$|With Mansur's rule lacking any strong foundation, {{his opponents}} among Aleppine factions or individuals, unnamed in sources, {{resolved}} {{to move against}} him and install Abu'l-Hayja' to the emirate. They gained {{the support of the}} Banu Kilab tribe, {{one of the most powerful}} elements in the emirate, and then appealed for the assistance of the Marwanid ruler of Diyar Bakr, Mumahhid al-Dawla; the latter was Abu'l-Hayja's father-in-law. Mumahhid al-Dawla secured Byzantine Emperor Basil II's permission for Abu'l-Hayja' to leave Byzantine territory and depose Mansur, provided that Mumahhid bear the financial expense of such an endeavor. Indeed, Mumahhid supplied Abu'l-Hayja' with money and 200 horsemen, and the Hamdanid was further promised the critical support of the Kilabi chieftains, whom he met on his way to Aleppo. However, once Mansur caught wind of the Kilab's backing for Abu'l-Hayja', he wrote to the tribe's chieftains, promising them a share of the Emirate of Aleppo's revenues and control of some of its rural areas in return for withdrawing their support for the Hamdanid. Moreover, Mansur appealed for military aid from Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim; Mansur promised to allow a Fatimid-appointed <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> the Citadel of Aleppo in return for such aid, which came in the form of Fatimid troops from Tripoli.|$|E

The assembly didn't {{want to pay for}} the roads, so Craig recommended a toll road be created. The assembly leadership balked at the idea, as toll roads had been abolished decades earlier. The assembly finally authorized the Indiana Toll Road in northern Indiana, but refused to build anymore, primarily because they didn't want to allow the <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> over a large number of patronage positions which he could potentially use to gain more power in the party. His other construction recommendations, a state office building, new prisons, and the expansion of Purdue University were ignored by the assembly.

50|$|When {{starting}} from cold, the engine's combustion efficiency is reduced because the cold engine block draws heat {{out of the}} cylinder in the compression stroke. The result is that fuel is not burned fully, resulting in blue and white smoke and lower power outputs until the engine has warmed. This is especially the case with indirect injection engines, which are less thermally efficient. With electronic injection, the timing and length of the injection sequence can be altered to compensate for this. Older engines with mechanical injection can have mechanical and hydraulic <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> to alter the timing, and multi-phase electrically controlled glow plugs, that stay on for a period after start-up to ensure clean combustion; the plugs are automatically switched to a lower power to prevent their burning out.|$|E
5000|$|Smaller {{stationary}} {{steam engines}} generally have a fixed cutoff point while, in large ones, {{the speed and}} power output is generally governed by altering the cutoff, frequently under <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> using an expansion valve or trip gear. In steam engines for transport, it is desirable {{to be able to}} alter the cutoff over a wide range. For starting and at low speed and heavy load, the cylinders need steam supply at maximum pressure for almost the full length of the stroke. In a two-cylinder locomotive, for example, the maximum or 'full gear' cutoff is typically about 85%. At high speeds, the cutoff may be 15% percent of the piston stroke or less. Steam engines used in boats and ships operate under a constant, unvarying load through the propeller and so have a fixed cutoff, with speed being controlled through the regulator.|$|E
50|$|A {{supercharger}} compresses the air back to sea-level-equivalent pressures, or even much higher, {{in order}} to make the engine produce just as much power at cruise altitude as it does at sea level. With the reduced aerodynamic drag at high altitude and the engine still producing rated power, a supercharged airplane can fly much faster at altitude than a naturally aspirated one. The pilot controls the output of the supercharger with the throttle and indirectly via the propeller <b>governor</b> <b>control.</b> Since the size of the supercharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the supercharger is oversized for low altitude. The pilot must be careful with the throttle and watch the manifold pressure gauge to avoid overboosting at low altitude. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the pilot must continuously open the throttle in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the throttle reaches full open and the engine is still producing full rated power is known as the critical altitude. Above the critical altitude, engine power output will start to drop as the aircraft continues to climb.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{nonlinear}} robust controller for steam <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> in power systems. Based on dissipation theory, an innovative recursive design method {{is presented to}} construct the storage function of single machine infinite bus (SMIB) and multi-machine power systems. Furthermore, the nonlinear L 2 -gain disturbance attenuation control strategy is achieved for speed <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> of turbo-generators without requiring the solution of an HJI inequality. With multi-machine power system control, all the variables in the control law are only relevant to the state variables of the local generator, thus a decentralized control strategy is achieved. Simulation results of a 4 -machine system show that the controller can enhance power transient stability and dynamic performance. ...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{nonlinear}} decentralized robust <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> for hydroturbine-generator sets in multi-machine {{power systems}} is suggested in this paper. The nonelastic water hammer effect and disturbances are {{considered in the}} modeling. The advanced differential geometry theory, nonlinear robust control theory and the dynamic feedback method are combined to solve the problem. The nonlinear decentralized robust control law for the speed governor of hydroturbine-generators has been derived. The input signals to the proposed controller are all local measurements and independent to the system parameters. The derived control law guarantees the integrated system stability with disturbance attenuation, which is significant to the real power system application. Computer tests on an 8 -machine, 36 -bus power system show clearly {{the effectiveness of the}} new control strategy in transient stability enhancement and disturbance attenuation. The computer test results based on the suggested controller are compared favorably with those based on the conventional linear <b>governor</b> <b>control.</b> © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
