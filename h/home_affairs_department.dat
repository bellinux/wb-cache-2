5|$|Since the {{abolition}} of decentralised Urban and District Councils in 1999, Hong Kong is now a unitary territory subdivided into 18 districts. Each district is represented by a district council, who advises the government on various local agendas such as public facilities, community programmes, cultural activities and environmental policies. There are a total of 541 district council seats, 412 of which are directly elected and another 27 are ex-officio chairmen of rural committees (families of landowners in the New Territories before 1898); the remaining seats are appointed by the Chief Executive. The <b>Home</b> <b>Affairs</b> <b>Department</b> communicates government policies and plans to the public through the district offices.|$|E
25|$|After the riot, Trench {{recognised}} {{the necessity}} to implement further reform of the government. So, with the assistance from Holmes, the government began a City District Officer Scheme in May 1968 {{which was based on}} the existing District Officer system in the New Territories. Under the new scheme, Hong Kong Island and Kowloon were divided into 10 different districts. Each district had a District Office where the District Officer concerned could collect public opinions, receive complaints and provide advice and quick responses. This scheme effectively drew the relationship {{between the government and the}} general public closer than it used to be, as the general public could easily express their needs and demands to the District Officer nearby. Alongside the reform, the Secretariat for Chinese Affairs was reorganised into the <b>Home</b> <b>Affairs</b> <b>Department</b> in February 1969 while the post of the Secretary for Chinese Affairs was renamed into the Secretary for Home Affairs. Holmes continued to serve after the reorganisation and was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the same year. Before retiring from the <b>Home</b> <b>Affairs</b> <b>Department,</b> he had been focusing on the legislation on abolishing polygyny. Yet, such legislation was completed in October 1971, five months after his retirement from the civil service.|$|E

40|$|Various {{studies from}} {{different}} universities and government departments indicated that Hong Kong {{is facing a}} serious urban decay problem. Redevelopment is costly and slow in progress. The average acquisition time used for redevelopment is over 6 years, and public doubted on social and environmental impact aroused from redevelopment projects. Relocated households lost their social support and networks after redevelopment {{and not all of}} them can opt for re-housing. In addition, the 7 -years money compensation policy cannot catch up with the rapid increase of property market value and public quires about whether redevelopment can really improve people’s living condition and fulfill the original goal and objective of building redevelopment. By contrast, building rehabilitation was highly promoted by the government and professional bodies in solving the problem of urban decay. Without wasting time and cost on relocation of households, their living environment can still improve through building rehabilitation. However, recent studies found out that owners are unwilling to carry out building rehabilitation. In order to find out obstacles affecting building rehabilitation of old private residential building in Hong Kong and speed up the building rehabilitation to solve long term urban decay problem, personal in-depth interviews were conducted together with 77 questionnaires sent to owners of both single building blocks and large residential building estate to ascertain their views on building rehabilitation in old private residential building in Hong Kong. The findings showed that the positive effect of building rehabilitation is highly recognized by the public. However, it is difficult for owners to coordinate enough ownership to carry out building rehabilitation without the help of property management or Incorporated Owner and supports from government departments. The threat of government’s statutory orders and mandatory building inspection scheme had only little deterrent effect to owners who did not complied with the legal requirement and also the enforcement action from government departments is not strong enough too. Moreover, the findings showed that owners are motivated to carry out building rehabilitation if there is economic assistance to maintain their existing social network. Recommendations were proposed to provide more economic and technical supports from Urban Renewal Authority (URA) and <b>Home</b> <b>Affair</b> <b>Department</b> (HAD) for owners who carrying out building rehabilitation. Government should enhance the statutory enforcement along with enhancement propaganda of building rehabilitation. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
