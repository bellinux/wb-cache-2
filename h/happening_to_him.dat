2500|$|It's a Wonderful Life {{features}} {{prominently in}} the literature versions of the TV series of Red Dwarf by Grant Naylor, most notably the books Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers and Better Than Life. In Infinity, during his five-week love affair with Kristine Kochanski it is revealed that It's a Wonderful Life is the favorite film of Dave Lister. In the third and {{last part of the}} book, named Back to Earth (later used as the title for the Easter special return of Red Dwarf), {{under the influence of the}} Better Than Life game Lister ends up living in an exact replica of 1940s Bedford Falls, eternally stuck on Christmas Eve, and is even known to the townsfolk as [...] "George". He also encounters a selection of the more notable supporting characters from the film, and references to film events and locations. In the beginning of the second book, Better Than Life, Lister's Bedford Falls is destroyed by Arnold Rimmer, whose mental state has become erratic. Unable to cope with good things <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> his mind begins to destroy the life of everyone around him, resulting in Bedford Falls altering to more closely resemble Pottersville.|$|E
2500|$|He {{realizes that}} his {{co-workers}} at the factory, who he thought were his friends, only liked {{him to be}} around {{so that they could}} make fun of him. His new intelligence scares his co-workers, and they start a petition to have him fired, but when Charlie finds out about the petition, he quits. As Charlie's intelligence peaks, Algernon's suddenly declines—he loses his increased intelligence and mental age, and dies shortly afterward, to be buried in the back yard of Charlie's home. Charlie discovers that his intelligence increase is also only temporary. He starts to experiment to find out the cause of the flaw in the experiment, which he calls the [...] "Algernon–Gordon Effect". Just when he finishes his experiments, his intelligence begins to regress to its state prior to the operation. Charlie is aware of, and pained by what is <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as he loses his knowledge and his ability to read and write. He tries to get his old job as a janitor back, and tries to revert to normal, but he cannot stand the pity from his co-workers, landlady, and Ms. Kinnian. Charlie states he plans to [...] "go away" [...] from New York and move to a new place. His last wish is that someone put flowers on Algernon's grave.|$|E

60|$|On one {{occasion}} Tom Brown {{went out with}} the rest of the party on horseback after some elephants, the tracks of which had been seen the day before.
