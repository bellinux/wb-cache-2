5000|$|In certain jurisdictions' patent law, {{industrial}} applicability or <b>industrial</b> <b>application</b> is a patentability requirement {{according to which}} a patent can only be granted for an invention which is susceptible of <b>industrial</b> <b>application,</b> i.e. for an invention which can be made or used {{in some kind of}} industry. In this context, the concept of [...] "industry" [...] is far-reaching: it includes agriculture, for instance. An example of invention which would not be susceptible of <b>industrial</b> <b>application</b> is [...] "a method of contraception ... to be applied in the private and personal sphere of a human being".|$|R

5|$|Most <b>industrial</b> <b>applications</b> of {{synthetic}} diamond {{have long been}} associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common <b>industrial</b> <b>applications</b> of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. These are by far the largest <b>industrial</b> <b>applications</b> {{of synthetic}} diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E

The brilliant cut of gemstones is designed specifically to reduce the likelihood of breakage or splintering.|$|E

5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have <b>industrial</b> <b>applications</b> for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have also been shown to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{several years}} after its {{acquisition}} by Amperex, the manufacturing operations of Advanced Micro Electronics were transferred to Slatersville. The products transferred from Advanced Micro Electronics included small signal silicon planar transistors for military and <b>industrial</b> <b>applications,</b> Leadless Inverted Devices (LIDs) and hybrid circuits using both thin and thick film technology. Manufacturing of these three products and the sales office for Philips Semiconductors were housed in Slatersville until 1992 when this business unit was sold.|$|E

Metagenomic {{approaches to the}} analysis of complex microbial communities allow the targeted screening of enzymes with <b>industrial</b> <b>applications</b> in biofuel production, such as glycoside hydrolases. Furthermore, knowledge of how these microbial communities function is required to control them, and metagenomics is a key tool in their understanding. Metagenomic approaches allow comparative analyses between convergent microbial systems like biogas fermenters or insect herbivores such as the fungus garden of the leafcutter ants.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but <b>industrial</b> <b>applications</b> need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
