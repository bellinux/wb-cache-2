40|$|Long period {{gratings}} {{have been}} inscribed in standard single mode fibre using a fs laser system, a fusion arc and a UV laser and a comparative study carried {{out of their}} thermal behaviour. The fs laser induced gratings can survive temperatures in excess of 800 &deg;C, however the inscription process can induce considerable birefringence within the device. Annealing studies {{have been carried out}} showing that below 600 &deg;C, all three grating types show a blue shift in their room temperature resonance wavelengths following cyclic heating, while above 600 &deg;C, the UV and arc induced LPGs exhibit a red shift, with the <b>fs</b> <b>LPG</b> showing an even stronger blue shift. High temperature annealing is also shown to considerably reduce the birefringence induced by the fs inscription process...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a real semisimple Lie group G with finite center and K a maximal compact subgroup of G. We prove an Lp −Lq version of Hardy’s theorem for the spherical Fourier transform on G. More precisely, let a, b be positive real numbers, 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞, and f a K-bi-invariant measurable function on G such that h− 1 a <b>f</b> ∈ <b>Lp(G)</b> and eb‖λ‖ 2 (f) ∈ Lq(a∗+) (ha is the heat kernel on G). We establish that if ab ≥ 1 / 4 and p or q is finite, then f = 0 almost everywhere. If ab < 1 / 4, we prove {{that for all}} p, q, there are infinitely many nonzero functions f and if ab = 1 / 4 with p = q =∞, we have f = constha. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 22 E 30, 22 E 46, 43 A 30...|$|R
40|$|Results from {{abstract}} {{harmonic analysis}} are extended to locally compact quantum groups {{by considering the}} noncommutative Lp-spaces associated with the locally compact quantum groups. Let G be a locally compact abelian group with dual group Ĝ. The Hausdorff–Young theorem states that if <b>f</b> ∈ <b>Lp(G),</b> where 1 ≤ p ≤ 2, then its Fourier transform Fp(f) belongs to Lq(Ĝ) (where 1 p + 1 q = 1) and ‖Fp(f) ‖q ≤ ‖f‖p. Kunze and Terp extended this to unimodular and lo-cally compact groups, respectively. We further generalize this result to an arbitrary locally compact quantum group G by defining a Fourier transform Fp: Lp(G) → Lq(Ĝ) and showing that this Fourier transform satisfies the Hausdorff–Young inequality. Let G be a locally compact group. Then L 1 (G) acts on Lp(G) by convo-lution. We extend this result to Kac algebras and also discuss an operator space version of this result. Ruan and Junge showed that if G is a discret...|$|R
