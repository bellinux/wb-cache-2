5|$|Under {{fire and}} with the wind too calm for sailing, Barlow ran out oars to try and pull his brig away from the French batteries. The {{diminutive}} size of his vessel made it a difficult target and he was soon {{able to take advantage}} of a <b>fresh</b> <b>breeze</b> to withdraw from the crossfire. A single shot struck the brig, smashing into one of the 4-pounder cannon on deck and breaking it into three pieces, although none of the crew were wounded by the strike.|$|E
5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very dark night, the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a <b>fresh</b> <b>breeze,</b> and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E

25|$|Haudaudine left Koné, New Caledonia, on 3 January 1905. She {{had arrived}} earlier from Yokohama, Japan, in ballast and was loaded for her homeward voyage with 3,042 tons of nickel ore from the Katavite mines bound for Rotterdam, Germany. After having been towed {{clear of the}} reefs by tugboat SS St. Pierre, she set sail in a <b>fresh</b> <b>breeze.</b> However, at sunset the wind died out and the strong {{currents}} began pushing Haudaudine towards the Contrariété Reef between Cape Goulvain and Porondu Island. Powerless to stop the ship or alter the course, the captain ordered soundings to be taken every few minutes to determine the water depth.|$|E
25|$|On 9 February 1801, {{while in}} the Bay of Gibraltar, Peard {{observed}} seven French ships {{of the line and}} two frigates, entering the Mediterranean, which he correctly assumed were bound for Egypt to relieve the French army there. Peard set sail in pursuit, intending to overtake them and find Lord Keith, the naval commander-in-chief, to inform him of their location. He caught up with the French squadron off Cape de Gata, and sailed past them during the night. For the next two days the French remained in sight at a distance. A <b>fresh</b> <b>breeze</b> sprang up during the night of the 12th, and Peard attempted to outdistance them, but discovered the French close by the next morning. They gave chase, and Peard set a course west hoping to encounter pursuing British ships. However at noon the wind fell, and the two French frigates crept closer. At 3 p.m. the French opened fire, and Peard, realising that his situation was hopeless, surrendered. When interrogated, Peard falsely claimed that British forces had landed on the coast of Egypt (which did not occur until 8 March), and that Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, with a powerful squadron, was close by and in pursuit. Ganteaume changed course, and his squadron arrived at Toulon six days later, where Peard and his officers were promptly exchanged, arriving at Port Mahon by cartel on 26 February.|$|E
500|$|According to critic Vladimir Stasov, Glazunov and Tchaikovsky {{first met}} in October 1884 at a {{gathering}} hosted by Balakirev. Glazunov was then 19 years old. Tchaikovsky was in Saint Petersburg because his opera Eugene Onegin was being {{performed at the}} Mariinsky Theater. Glazunov later wrote that while the nationalists' circle [...] "was no longer so ideologically closed and isolated {{as it had been}} earlier", they [...] "did not consider P.I. Tchaikovsky one of our own. We valued only a few of his works, like Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, Francesca [...] and the finale of the Second Symphony. The rest of his output was either unknown or alien to us". Tchaikovsky's presence won over Glazunov and the other young members present, and his conversation with them [...] "was a <b>fresh</b> <b>breeze</b> amid our somewhat dusty atmosphere... Many of the young musicians present, including Lyadov and myself, left Balakirev's apartment charmed by Tchaikovsky's personality.... As Lyadov put it, our acquaintance with the great composer was a real occasion." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{promote his}} {{developing}} ideas for an expedition that would overwinter on the Antarctic continent at Cape Adare, Borchgrevink hurried to London, where the Royal Geographical Society was hosting the Sixth International Geographical Congress. On 1 August 1895 {{he addressed the}} conference, giving {{an account of the}} Cape Adare foreshore as a location where a scientific expedition might establish itself for the Antarctic winter. He described the site as [...] "a safe situation for houses, tents and provisions", and said there were indications that in this place [...] "the unbound forces of the Antarctic Circle do not display the full severity of their powers". He also suggested that the interior of the continent might be accessible from the foreshore by an easy route—a [...] "gentle slope". He ended his speech by declaring his willingness to lead an expedition there himself. Hugh Robert Mill, the Royal Geographical Society's librarian, who was present at the Congress, reported reactions to the speech: [...] "His blunt manner and abrupt speech stirred the academic discussions with a <b>fresh</b> <b>breeze</b> of realism. Nobody liked Borchgrevink very much at that time, but he had a dynamic quality and a set purpose to get out again to the unknown South that struck some of us as boding well for exploration". The Congress did not, however, endorse Borchgrevink's ideas. Instead, it passed a general resolution in support of Antarctic exploration, to the effect that [...] "the various scientific societies throughout the world should urge, in whatever way seems to them most effective, that this work be undertaken before the close of the century".|$|E
500|$|On the 7thJune, 1917, while {{disguised}} as a British merchant vessel with a dummy gun mounted aft, H.M.S. [...] "Pargust" [...] was torpedoed at very close range. Her boiler-room, engine-room, and No. 5 hold were immediately flooded, and the starboard lifeboat was blown to pieces. The weather was misty at the time, <b>fresh</b> <b>breeze</b> and a choppy sea. The [...] "Panic Party", {{under the command of}} Lieutenant F. R. Hereford, D.S.C., R.N.R., abandoned ship, and as the last boat was shoving off, the periscope of the submarine was observed close before the port beam about 400 yards distant. The enemy then submerged, and periscope reappeared directly astern, passing to the starboard quarter, and then round to the port beam, when it turned again towards the ship, breaking surface about 50 yards away. The lifeboat, acting as a lure, commenced to pull round the stern; submarine followed closely and Lieutenant Hereford, with complete disregard of the danger incurred from the fire of either ship or submarine (who had trained a maxim on the lifeboat), continued to decoy her to within 50 yards of the ship. The [...] "Pargust" [...] then opened fire with all guns, and the submarine, with oil squirting from her side and the crew pouring out of the conning tower, steamed slowly across the bows with a heavy list. The enemy crew held up their hands in token of surrender, whereupon fire immediately ceased. The submarine then began to move away at a gradually increasing speed, apparently endeavouring to escape in the mist. Fire was reopened until she sank, one man clinging to the bow as she went down. The boats, after a severe pull to the windward, succeeded in saving one officer and one man. American Destroyers and a British sloop arrived shortly afterwards, and the [...] "Pargust" [...] was towed back to port. As on the previous occasions, officers and men displayed the utmost courage and confidence in their captain, and the action serves as an example of what perfect discipline, when coupled with such confidence, can achieve.|$|E

2500|$|Taking {{his eight}} prizes laden with wine and brandy, Cornwallis retired to the {{sheltered}} anchorage of Palais Road, close to Belle Île, where the squadron remained until 9 June. In the evening, Cornwallis {{took advantage of}} a <b>fresh</b> <b>breeze</b> to sail his ships out into the Bay of Biscay and around the Ushant headland, reaching the Scilly Isles on 11 June and sending Kingfisher back to Spithead with the French prizes and two American merchant ships seized in French waters. Cornwallis then ordered the squadron to {{turn back to the}} blockade of Brest in the hope of encountering Vence in more favourable circumstances. At Brest, messages had arrived warning that Vence and the convoy were [...] "blockaded" [...] at Belle Île and the French commander was instructed to rescue him. In fact, as was pointed out by a number of officers in the French fleet including Vice-amiral Kerguelen, the anchorage at Belle Île could never be effectively blockaded as it was too open to block all potential approaches and too close to the major port of Lorient and therefore a rescue was unnecessary. This advice was ignored, and Vice-amiral Villaret de Joyeuse sailed from Brest on 12 June with the ships that were anchored in Brest Roads ready for sea. Villaret's fleet consisted of nine ships of the line, nine frigates (including two ships of the line razeed into 50-gun frigates) and four corvettes.|$|E
