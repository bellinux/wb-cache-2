25|$|A union may, in {{some limited}} circumstances, require {{employees}} to exhaust any <b>internal</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>procedures</b> provided under the union's constitution before filing suit. Unions and employers may also generally require employees to exhaust their {{rights under the}} grievance arbitration procedures provided for under {{the collective bargaining agreement}} before suing the employer for breach of contract. However employees do not usually have to exhaust such procedures if they are suing only the union, since very few collective bargaining agreements even allow for the filing of a grievance against the union by covered employees. To the extent that an employee might have a breach of contract claim against a union arising out of its performance of its duty to represent that employee, the courts will apply the same deferential standards and procedural requirements that they would employ if the worker sued the union on a breach of the duty of fair representation theory.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the applicants' argument was based on section 7 of PAJA, which limits access {{to the right to}} have administrative action reviewed until <b>internal</b> <b>appeal</b> or review <b>procedures</b> have been exhausted.

The mere fact that alternative procedures exist does not create this limitation.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The Annual Professional Performance Review (APPR) is the {{new teacher}} {{evaluation}} system adopted by New York State in 2012. Through APPR, each New York State teacher’s performance is evaluated annually. If a teacher is rated Ineffective, {{he or she must}} take part in a Teacher Improvement Plan (TIP). If a teacher is rated Ineffective for two consecutive years, the teacher may be dismissed even if that teacher has tenure. Given these potential consequences, the ability to appeal APPR ratings and how those ratings are conducted has been a major issue for teachers and their unions. Under New York Education Law 3012 -c, which establishes APPR, each school district negotiates its own APPR procedure with its local teachers union, including any procedures for appealing the performance review. This report examines the APPR <b>appeals</b> <b>procedures</b> established by school districts in order to investigate the following: Which aspects of the APPR process can teachers appeal? Who has the fi nal say in that appeals process? How much time do appeals processes take? Can teachers appeal APPR issues through the regular contractual grievance-arbitration procedure? This report addresses these questions by analyzing APPR <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> for all New York State school districts. The data analyzed was gathered by coding the provisions of the APPR <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures,</b> which are publicly available on the New York State Department of Education website (1) ...|$|R

While taxpayers are technically provided due process by the existing procedures, practically they are not.

Lack of practical due process can shift the property tax burden to the homeowner and small business person. This article focuses on such taxpayers and the property taxes they pay to their local governments. To show that such taxpayers will find the cost of appealing their local property taxes difficult and costly, this article discusses the issues of valuation and equalization—how and when they must be raised if they are to be successfully argued. The article explains how a taxpayer may be assessed without the right to notice or protest when real property has been undervalued, and it discusses exemptions and the unique rules which apply. Finally, it explains when and how refunds may be obtained...|$|R
