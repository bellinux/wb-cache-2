5|$|Now Sunderland {{found out}} <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> score against this terrific defence of ours. Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can I say {{to do justice}} to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E

Being sensitive to how difficult it must be to manage the house and kids by herself, Jim does not tell her who the investor is during their phone conversations and pretends to be stressed over the meeting; Pam, in turn, affects to be having no problems so that she will not add to Jim's supposed stress. Back at the office, Pam apologizes to Meredith, and the two go out for a beer. While at the bar, Pam tells Meredith—who is a single parent—she now realizes <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> handle children without a husband.|$|E

[...] Greenwalt {{observed that the}} show raises questions {{about what it means}} to be a man and does this not only through the characterization of Angel but also the men around him. He said that like other male characters, taken alone Connor may seem a stereotypical teen boy, but considered with rest of the cast offers a complex image of modern masculinity. Greenwalt also compared Connor's journey with others in terms of identity, which he considers a poignant theme within the series. He found it ironic that Connor who was [...] "initially the most damaged of all the characters", was the only one able to [...] "reconcile his actions and new man existence together" [...] and be at peace with himself in the end.|$|E

[...] He refused to categorise the match as a [...] "friendly" [...] much like it is traditionally viewed as: [...] "There is a trophy and medals at stake. We won it last season and our players want to win it again." [...] Ferguson described the 3–0 defeat in the previous season's Shield as a [...] "humiliation", before discussing how it made the team prepare for the challenges ahead: [...] "I have reminded the players <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> lose when you are playing for United these days – it makes so many other people happy." [...] Indeed, United only lost five matches of the whole of last season, with their last defeat coming at home to Middlesbrough in December 1998.|$|E

In {{addition}} to work in Nepal, she has volunteered in Uganda and India, where she spent a week working with Mother Teresa that included assisting in a leprosy clinic. That trip inspired Cruz to help start a foundation to support homeless girls in India, where she sponsors two young women. She donated her salary from her first Hollywood film, The Hi-Lo Country, to Mother Teresa's mission. In the early 2000s, she spent time in Nepal photographing Tibetan children for an exhibition attended by the Dalai Lama.

500|$|Hearsay and {{conjecture}} have clouded {{assessment of}} the Duchess of Windsor's life, not helped by her own manipulation of the truth. But there is no document which proves directly that she was {{anything other than a}} victim of her own ambition, who lived out a great romance that became a great tragedy. In the opinion of her biographers, [...] "she experienced the ultimate fairy tale, becoming the adored favourite of the most glamorous bachelor of his time. The idyll went wrong when, ignoring her pleas, he threw up his position {{to spend the rest of}} his life with her." [...] Academics agree that she ascended a precipice that [...] "left her with fewer alternatives than she had anticipated. Somehow she thought that the Establishment could be overcome once [...] was king, and she confessed frankly to Aunt Bessie about her 'insatiable ambitions'... Trapped by his flight from responsibility into exactly the role she had sought, suddenly she warned him, in a letter, 'You and I can only create disaster together'... she predicted to society hostess Sibyl Colefax, 'two people will suffer' because of 'the workings of a system'... Denied dignity, and without anything useful to do, the new Duke of Windsor and his Duchess would be international society's most notorious parasites for a generation, while they thoroughly bored each other... She had thought of him as emotionally a Peter Pan, and of herself an Alice in Wonderland. The book they had written together, however, was a Paradise Lost."

It's typical of how you feel in relationships. The second movement is called ... 'Easier Said Than Done,' and it's about <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> change after you've been in a relationship for so long. And then the third movement is called 'But Not This Time,' because even though I've done things a certain way for so long, I won't do that this time".

Montag sings about these ideas: <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> handle the paparazzi, how she turns heads everywhere she goes, and how she ignores those that rain on her parade." [...] Limelife gave the album a mixed review, calling some of the songs [...] "catchy", but also said the album [...] "sounds so manufactured, I have no idea what Heidi would sound like without all this technology behind her." [...] HollywoodLife was also gave the album a mixed review, writing [...] "Superficial is just as over-produced as you'd expect a Heidi album to be.
