5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to <b>demineralization</b> and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
25|$|The high {{mineral content}} of enamel, which makes this tissue the hardest {{in the human}} body, also makes it {{susceptible}} to a <b>demineralization</b> process which often occurs as dental caries, otherwise known as cavities. <b>Demineralization</b> occurs for several reasons, {{but the most important}} cause of tooth decay is the ingestion of fermentable carbohydrates.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} {{feature of}} Fanconi syndrome is bone <b>demineralization</b> (osteomalacia or rickets) due to phosphate wasting.|$|E
25|$|Celiac disease, a {{disorder}} {{characterized by an}} auto-immune response to gluten, also commonly results in <b>demineralization</b> of the enamel.|$|E
25|$|Teeth are {{bathed in}} saliva {{and have a}} coating of {{bacteria}} on them (biofilm) that continually forms. The minerals in the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel, dentin and cementum) are constantly undergoing processes of <b>demineralization</b> and remineralisation. Dental caries results when the <b>demineralization</b> rate is faster than the remineralisation and there is net mineral loss. This happens {{when there is an}} ecologic shift within the dental biofilm, from a balanced population of micro-organisms to a population that produce acids and can survive in an acid environment.|$|E
25|$|The early carious lesion is {{characterized}} by <b>demineralization</b> of the tooth surface, altering the tooth's optical properties. Technology utilizing laser speckle image (LSI) techniques may provide a diagnostic aid to detect early carious lesions.|$|E
25|$|Because enamel is {{vulnerable}} to <b>demineralization,</b> prevention of tooth decay {{is the best way}} to maintain the health of teeth. Most countries have wide use of toothbrushes, which can reduce the number of dental biofilm and food particles on enamel. In isolated societies that do not have access to toothbrushes, it is common for those people to use other objects, such as sticks, to clean their teeth. In between two adjacent teeth, floss is used to wipe the enamel surfaces free of plaque and food particles to discourage bacterial growth. Although neither floss nor toothbrushes can penetrate the deep grooves and pits of enamel, good general oral-health habits can usually prevent enough bacterial growth to keep tooth decay from starting. Genetic variations, in humans, might contribute to the intrinsic structural integrity of the enamel, and to its predisposition to <b>demineralization</b> or attack from bacteria.|$|E
25|$|During its evolution, S. mutans {{acquired}} {{the ability to}} increase the amount of carbohydrates it could metabolize, and consequently more organic acid was produced as a byproduct. This is significant in the formation of dental caries because increased acidity in the oral cavity amplifies the rate of <b>demineralization</b> of the tooth, which leads to carious lesions. It is thought that the trait evolved in S. mutans via lateral gene transfer with another bacterial species present in the oral cavity. There are several genes, SMU.438 and SMU.1561, involved in carbohydrate metabolism that are up-regulated in S. mutans. These genes possibly originated from Lactococcus lactis and S. gallolyticus, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{dental plaque}} biofilm {{can result in}} the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from {{balanced}} populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary carbohydrate. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance between <b>demineralization</b> and remineralisation leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues (enamel and then dentin), the sign and symptom being a carious lesion. By preventing the dental plaque biofilm from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested. This can be achieved though the behavioural step of reducing the supply of fermentable carbohydrates (i.e. sugar intake) and frequent removal of the biofilm (i.e. toothbrushing).|$|E
25|$|Calcium, {{as found}} in food such as milk and green vegetables, is often {{recommended}} to protect against dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent decay of a tooth by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. Streptococcus mutans {{is the leading cause}} of tooth decay. Low concentration fluoride ions act as bacteriostatic therapeutic agent and high concentration fluoride ions are bactericidal. The incorporated fluorine makes enamel more resistant to <b>demineralization</b> and, thus, resistant to decay. Topical fluoride is more highly recommended than systemic intake such as by tablets or drops to protect the surface of the teeth. This may include a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash or varnish. Standard fluoride toothpaste (1,000–1,500 ppm) is more effective than low fluoride toothpaste (< 600ppm) to prevent dental caries. After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, rinsing should be avoided and the excess spat out. Many dental professionals include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine visits and recommend the use of xylitol and amorphous calcium phosphate products. Silver diamine fluoride may work better than fluoride varnish to prevent cavities. Water fluoridation also lowers the risk of tooth decay.|$|E
25|$|Primidone, {{along with}} {{phenytoin}} and phenobarbital, {{is one of}} the anticonvulsants most heavily associated with bone diseases such as osteoporosis, osteopenia (which can precede osteoporosis), osteomalacia and fractures. The populations usually said to be most at risk are institutionalized people, postmenopausal women, older men, people taking more than one anticonvulsant, and children, who are also at risk of rickets. However, {{it has been suggested that}} bone <b>demineralization</b> is most pronounced in young people (25–44 years of age) and one 1987 study of institutionalized people found that the rate of osteomalacia in the ones taking anticonvulsantsone out of nineteen individuals taking an anticonvulsant (vs. none among the thirty-seven people taking none) was similar to that expected in elderly people. The authors speculated that this was due to improvements in diet, sun exposure and exercise in response to earlier findings, and/or that this was because it was sunnier in London than in the Northern European countries which had earlier reported this effect. In any case, the use of more than one anticonvulsant has been associated with an increased prevalence of bone disease in institutionalized epilepsy patients versus institutionalized people who did not have epilepsy. Likewise, postmenopausal women taking anticonvulsants have a greater risk of fracture than their drug-naive counterparts.|$|E
500|$|In {{the long}} term, {{the loss of}} muscle {{function}} can have additional effects from disuse, including atrophy of the muscle. [...] Immobility can lead to pressure sores, [...] particularly in bony areas, requiring precautions such as extra cushioning and turning in bed every two hours (in the acute setting) to relieve pressure. In the long term, people in wheelchairs must shift periodically to relieve pressure. [...] Another complication is pain, including nociceptive pain (indication of potential or actual tissue damage) and neuropathic pain, when [...] nerves affected by damage convey erroneous pain signals {{in the absence of}} noxious stimuli. Spasticity, the uncontrollable tensing of muscles below the level of injury, occurs in 65–78% of chronic SCI. It results from lack of input from the brain that quells muscle responses to stretch reflexes. [...] It can be treated with drugs and physical therapy. Spasticity increases the risk of contractures (shortening of muscles, tendons, or ligaments that result from lack of use of a limb); this problem can be prevented by moving the limb through its full range of motion multiple times a day. [...] Another problem lack of mobility can cause is loss of bone density and changes in bone structure. Loss of bone density (bone <b>demineralization),</b> thought to be due to lack of input from weakened or paralysed muscles, can increase the risk of fractures. Conversely, a poorly understood phenomenon is the overgrowth of bone tissue in soft tissue areas, [...] called heterotopic ossification. [...] It occurs below the level of injury, possibly as a result of inflammation, and happens to a clinically significant extent in 27% of people.|$|E

2500|$|Enamel is {{a highly}} mineralized {{acellular}} tissue, and caries act upon it through a chemical process {{brought on by the}} acidic environment produced by bacteria. [...] As the bacteria consume the sugar and use it for their own energy, they produce lactic acid. [...] The effects of this process include the <b>demineralization</b> of crystals in the enamel, caused by acids, over time until the bacteria physically penetrate the dentin. [...] Enamel rods, which are the basic unit of the enamel structure, run perpendicularly {{from the surface of the}} tooth to the dentin. [...] Since <b>demineralization</b> of enamel by caries, in general, follows the direction of the enamel rods, the different triangular patterns between pit and fissure and smooth-surface caries develop in the enamel because the orientation of enamel rods are different in the two areas of the tooth.|$|E
2500|$|Temporal {{descriptions}} can {{be applied}} to caries to indicate the progression rate and previous history. [...] "Acute" [...] signifies a quickly developing condition, whereas [...] "chronic" [...] describes a condition that has taken an extended time to develop, in which thousands of meals and snacks, many causing some acid <b>demineralization</b> that is not remineralized, eventually result in cavities.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteria in a person's mouth convert glucose, fructose, {{and most}} {{commonly}} sucrose (table sugar) into acids such as lactic acid through a glycolytic process called fermentation. If left {{in contact with}} the tooth, these acids may cause <b>demineralization,</b> which is the dissolution of its mineral content. [...] The process is dynamic, however, as remineralization can also occur if the acid is neutralized by saliva or mouthwash. [...] Fluoride toothpaste or dental varnish may aid remineralization. [...] If <b>demineralization</b> continues over time, enough mineral content may be lost so that the soft organic material left behind disintegrates, forming a cavity or hole. The impact such sugars have on the progress of dental caries is called cariogenicity. Sucrose, although a bound glucose and fructose unit, is in fact more cariogenic than a mixture of equal parts of glucose and fructose. This is due to the bacteria utilising the energy in the saccharide bond between the glucose and fructose subunits. S.mutans adheres to the biofilm on the tooth by converting sucrose into an extremely adhesive substance called dextran polysaccharide by the enzyme dextransucranase.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extent to}} which tooth decay is likely, known as cariogenicity, depends on factors such as how long the sugar remains in the mouth. Contrary to common belief, {{it is not the}} amount of sugar {{ingested}} but the frequency of sugar ingestion that is {{the most important factor in}} the causation of tooth decay. [...] When the pH in the mouth initially decreases from the ingestion of sugars, the enamel is demineralized and left vulnerable for about 30 minutes. Eating a greater quantity of sugar in one sitting does not increase the time of <b>demineralization.</b> Similarly, eating a lesser quantity of sugar in one sitting does not decrease the time of <b>demineralization.</b> Thus, eating a great quantity of sugar at one time in the day is less detrimental than is a very small quantity ingested in many intervals throughout the day. For example, in terms of oral health, it is better to eat a single dessert at dinner time than to snack on a bag of candy throughout the day.|$|E
2500|$|Dogs {{are less}} likely than humans to have tooth decay due to the high pH of dog saliva, which {{prevents}} an acidic environment from forming and the subsequent <b>demineralization</b> of enamel which would occur. [...] In the event that tooth decay does occur (usually from trauma), dogs can receive dental fillings just as humans do. Similar to human teeth, the enamel of dogs is vulnerable to tetracycline staining. Consequently, this risk must be accounted for when tetracycline antibiotic therapy is administered to young dogs. Enamel hypoplasia may also occur in dogs.|$|E
2500|$|A person {{experiencing}} caries may not {{be aware}} of the disease. [...] The earliest sign of a new carious lesion is the appearance of a chalky white spot {{on the surface of the}} tooth, indicating an area of <b>demineralization</b> of enamel. This is referred to as a white spot lesion, an incipient carious lesion or a [...] "microcavity". [...] As the lesion continues to demineralize, it can turn brown but will eventually turn into a cavitation ("cavity"). [...] Before the cavity forms, the process is reversible, but once a cavity forms, the lost tooth structure cannot be regenerated.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} aspects of human growth and development, {{nutrition}} {{has an effect on}} the developing tooth. Essential nutrients for a healthy tooth include calcium, phosphorus, and vitamins A, C, and D. Calcium and phosphorus are needed to properly form the hydroxyapatite crystals, and their levels in the blood are maintained by Vitamin D. Vitamin A is necessary for the formation of keratin, as Vitamin C is for collagen. Fluoride, although not a nutrient, is incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal of a developing tooth and bones. The dental theory is the low levels of fluoride [...] incorporation and very mild fluorosis makes the tooth more resistant to <b>demineralization</b> and subsequent decay.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, tooth {{morphology}} {{dictates that}} the most common site for the initiation of dental caries is in the deep grooves, pits, and fissures of enamel. This is expected because these locations are impossible to reach with a toothbrush and allow for bacteria to reside there. When <b>demineralization</b> of enamel occurs, a dentist can use a sharp instrument, such as a dental explorer, and [...] "feel a stick" [...] {{at the location of}} the decay. As enamel continues to become less mineralized and is unable to prevent the encroachment of bacteria, the underlying dentin becomes affected as well. When dentin, which normally supports enamel, is destroyed by a physiologic condition or by decay, enamel is unable to compensate for its brittleness and breaks away from the tooth easily.|$|E
2500|$|As the enamel loses minerals, [...] {{and dental}} caries progresses, the enamel {{develops}} several distinct zones, visible under a light microscope. [...] From the deepest {{layer of the}} enamel to the enamel surface, the identified areas are the: translucent zone, dark zones, body of the lesion, and surface zone. [...] The translucent zone is the first visible sign of caries and coincides with a one to two percent loss of minerals. A slight remineralization of enamel occurs in the dark zone, which serves {{as an example of}} how the development of dental caries is an active process with alternating changes. The area of greatest <b>demineralization</b> and destruction is in the body of the lesion itself. [...] The surface zone remains relatively mineralized and is present until the loss of tooth structure results in a cavitation.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{show that}} {{patients}} who have whitened their teeth {{take better care of}} them. [...] However, a tooth whitening product with an overall low pH can put enamel at risk for decay or destruction by <b>demineralization.</b> Consequently, care should be taken and risk evaluated when choosing a product which is very acidic. Tooth whiteners in toothpastes work through a mechanical action. They have mild abrasives which aid in the removal of stains on enamel. Although this can be an effective method, it does not alter the intrinsic color of teeth. Microabrasion techniques employ both methods. An acid is used first to weaken the outer 22ndash&27 micrometers of enamel in order to weaken it enough for the subsequent abrasive force. [...] This allows for removal of superficial stains in the enamel. If the discoloration is deeper or in the dentin, this method of tooth whitening will not be successful.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Demineralization</b> {{is often}} a term used interchangeably with deionization. <b>Demineralization</b> is {{essentially}} removing all the minerals {{that can be found}} in natural water. This process is usually done when the water will be used for chemical processes and the minerals present may interfere with the other chemicals. All chemistic and beauty products have to be made with demineralized water for this reason. With the <b>demineralization</b> process, the water is [...] "softened" [...] replacing the undesired minerals with different salts (NaCl). Demineralized water has a higher conductivity than deionized water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Demineralization</b> {{is caused}} by {{bacteria}} excreting acids {{as a product of}} their metabolism of carbohydrates. By reducing the intake frequency of carbohydrates in an individual's diet, remineralization is increased and <b>demineralization</b> is decreased. Diet control is an important aspect in promoting remineralization to occur naturally. A loss of the tooth enamel structure and cavitation may occur if the <b>demineralization</b> phase continues {{for a long period of}} time. This disturbance of demineralisation caused by the presence of fermentable carbohydrates continues until the saliva has returned to a normal pH and had sufficient time to penetrate and neutralize the acids within any cariogenic biofilm present.|$|E
