5000|$|Lex Luthor, the Atom Man, invents {{a number}} of deadly devices to plague the city, {{including}} a <b>disintegrating</b> <b>machine</b> which can reduce people to their basic atoms and reassemble them in another place. But Superman manages to thwart each scheme. Since Kryptonite can rob Superman of his powers, Luthor decides to create a synthetic Kryptonite and putters about obtaining the necessary ingredients: plutonium, radium and the undefined 'etc.' Luthor places the Kryptonite at the launching of a ship, with Superman in attendance. He is exposed to the Kryptonite and passes out. Superman is taken off in an ambulance driven by Luthor's henchmen, {{and he is now}} under the control of Luthor. Superman is placed in a device, a lever is pulled, and the Man of Steel vanishes into [...] "The Empty Doom".|$|E
50|$|During early flights, {{for safety}} reasons, the SoloTrek was 'tethered' to a crane during test flights, to prevent {{uncontrolled}} ascent or travel. The tethers {{were designed to}} retract during lift-off to avoid being sucked into the exposed ducted fans {{at the top of}} the machine, but during a flight shortly after a rain shower in December 2002, the tether failed to retract and became tangled in the propeller blades, which <b>disintegrated.</b> Pilot and <b>machine</b> dropped to the ground. The pilot walked away unharmed. Unable to stick to the tight development schedule that its backers demanded, Trek Aerospace lost funding, forcing reorganization in 2003.|$|R
500|$|Welles had {{originally}} wanted the entire film to use high contrast cinematography, resembling engravings of the Middle Ages; only the opening title sequence uses this technique. The film's most famous sequence is the Battle of Shrewsbury; only about 180 extras were available and Welles used editing techniques {{to give the}} appearance of armies of thousands. Welles filmed all of the battle scenes in long takes, but cut the shots into fragments to create the effect that he wanted. It took ten days to shoot the scenes and six weeks to edit what became a six-minute sequence. In filming the sequence, Welles often used hand-held cameras, wide-angle lenses, slow motion and speed up shots, static shots, swish pans and constant rapid movement of the characters to create a kinetic and chaotic atmosphere. Anderegg has said that [...] "in the end, both armies have become one huge, awkward, <b>disintegrating</b> war <b>machine,</b> a grotesque robot whose power source slowly begins to fail and finally comes to a frozen halt. Verbal rhetoric—language itself—seems, for the moment, both irrelevant and obscene." ...|$|R
5000|$|Generating {{capacity}} at Sherco {{was reduced}} to 1,500 MW following the catastrophic failure of Unit 3 on November 19, 2011. [...] Repairs were completed at the facility on October 21, 2013 at a cost exceeding $200 million. [...] The incident occurred during a test cycle following an upgrade to the steam turbine where it was intentionally spun up beyond 3,600 rpm to check that safety mechanisms functioned properly. However, a severe vibration soon developed and pieces of the turbine began to <b>disintegrate.</b> The <b>machine</b> went from over 3700RPM to 0 in less than 10 seconds. Some turbine buckets sliced through the outer casing of the turbine. One cylindrical piece of the exciter {{the size of a}} five-gallon (19 liter) bucket landed next to the control room door and was still spinning at sufficient speed to drill a divot into the floor. A hydrogen and lubricant oil fire also erupted in the unit, which was extinguished within a few hours. Two men were standing between the steam turbine and generator when the incident began, but luckily escaped unharmed. Some men were treated for smoke inhalation but no serious injuries were reported in the incident.|$|R
