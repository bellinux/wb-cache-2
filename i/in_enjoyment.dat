500|$|Reviews for the PlayStation 2 {{release of}} Code: Veronica X were mostly positive. Critics shared similar {{opinions}} to the Dreamcast reviews, but some complaints {{were drawn from}} it being a mostly unmodified port of an 18-month-old Dreamcast game. GameSpot's Joe Fielder pointed out that Sony's Extermination (2001) and Capcom's own [...] (2001) had been released during this gap with better controls. The GameCube version garnered average reviews, due to its unaltered, ported status,. The high definition remaster was released over {{a decade after the}} original and was welcomed with mediocre reviews. Critics commonly cited the game's archaic design and controls as making it less appealing compared with contemporary offerings. The remaster did find some positive reception from Game Informers Tim Turi who found <b>in</b> <b>enjoyment</b> from playing what he called a [...] "challenging classic survival horror game" [...] and [...] "a harrowing but memorable trek through the series' heyday." ...|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer Parkin {{wrote that}} the [...] "childlike" [...] and [...] "unusually Western" [...] {{graphics}} were similar to EarthBound in [...] "flat pastel textures devoid of shading" [...] as juxtaposed with background art that [...] "fizzes with life and character". He described the cutscenes' animations as [...] "bespoke", rare for 16-bit role-playing games, and of greater dramatic impact. RPGamer Jordan Jackson {{wrote that the}} visuals are typical of the series and fit the game's mood, and the website's Mike Moehnke criticized the inventory limits carried over from the previous game. Green of NGC said the game mechanics were [...] "depressingly basic" [...] against more advanced role-playing games. Eurogamer Parkin felt that the role-playing game elements were less interesting and added that Mother 3 had few standout selling points other than its attention to detail and [...] "only systemic innovation": the rhythm-based battle system. Kotaku Richard Eisenbeis praised the system, and GameSpot Greg Kasavin compared it {{with that of the}} Mario & Luigi series. Jackson wrote that the music was [...] "just as catchy as previous games" [...] despite being [...] "almost completely new". Moehnke agreed, calling it [...] "nothing less than stunning". He noted overtones of Wagner and Chuck Berry. Jackson said that the game was somewhat easier {{than the rest of the}} series and somewhat shorter, at about 30 hours in length. Both RPGamer reviewers noted that Mother 3 has few penalties for death. Jackson reflected that while the game is humorous and grows <b>in</b> <b>enjoyment,</b> it has some somber moments as well. Eisenbeis of Kotaku cited [...] "the importance of mothers" [...] as a key theme about which the game revolves, which he preferred to the mid-game [...] "slapstick insanity" [...] and final plot twist. Parkin wrote that the game was filled with [...] "memorable moments", including a character who criticizes the player [...] "for not giggling at puns", frogs with progressively silly costumes that save the game, a [...] "reconstructed mecha caribou" [...] battle, a bad haiku, and the [...] "campfire scene", and that while the game's simpleness could have lent towards [...] "raw stupidity", instead it was [...] "elegant in its simplicity".|$|E

The singer would be required to give a free performance at the Boar's Nest in exchange for having their citations forgiven; the performer would then perform one of their best-known hits or other popular country music standard, while the Dukes, Boss, Rosco, Enos, Cletus, Cooter, and other patrons whooped and hollered <b>in</b> <b>enjoyment</b> of the performance.

They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society <b>in</b> <b>enjoyment</b> of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited [...] "spicy and comic tales about a gang of paisanos, asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. It has been said that in the United States this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression." ...|$|E
