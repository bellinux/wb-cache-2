25|$|Polarization is best {{understood}} by initially considering only pure polarization states, {{and only a}} coherent sinusoidal wave at some optical frequency. The vector in the adjacent diagram might describe the oscillation of the electric field emitted by a single-mode laser (whose oscillation frequency would be typically 1015 times faster). The field oscillates in the x-y plane, along the page, with the wave propagating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>z</b> <b>direction,</b> perpendicular to the page.|$|E
25|$|The {{far field}} pattern is thus seen {{to consist of}} a {{transverse}} electromagnetic (TEM) wave, with electric and magnetic fields {{at right angles to}} each other and at right angles to the direction of propagation (the direction of r, as we assumed the source to be at the origin). The electric polarization, in the θ direction, is coplanar with the source current (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Z</b> <b>direction),</b> while the magnetic field is at right angles to that, in the φ direction. It can be seen from these equations, and also in the animation, that the fields at these distances are exactly in phase. Both fields fall according to 1/r, with the power thus falling according to 1/r2 as dictated by the inverse square law.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{direction}} dependency of tool-workpiece compliance {{of machine}} tool was investigated <b>in</b> three dimensions. <b>The</b> tool-workpiece compliance {{is defined as}} the frequency response of the relative displacement between the tool and the workpiece to the cutting force.
