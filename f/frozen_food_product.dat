The [...] "nose to tail eating" [...] trend resulted in more demand in the 21st century, and British supermarket chain Waitrose once again sold beef faggots from 2014 onwards. Faggots are often homemade and {{are to be found}} in traditional butchers' shops and market stalls, though larger supermarkets generally stock the Mr Brain's brand of mass-produced faggot; this is a <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>product</b> available in the UK, made of liver and onions rolled into meatballs and served in a sauce.

40|$|Thawing of a <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>product</b> in a {{domestic}} microwave oven is numerically simulated using a coupled solver approach. The approach {{consists of a}} dedicated electromagnetic FDTD solver and a closely coupled UFVM multi-physics package. Two overlapping numerical meshes are defined; the food material and container were meshed for heat transfer and phase change solution, whilst the microwave oven cavity and waveguide were meshed for the microwave irradiation. The two solution domains were linked using a cross-mapping routine. This approach allowed {{the rotation of the}} food load to be captured. Power densities obtained on the structured FDTD mesh were interpolated onto the UFVM mesh for each timestep/turntable position. The UFVM solver utilised the power density data to advance the temperature and phase distribution solution. The temperature-dependant dielectric and thermo-physical properties of the food load were updated prior to revising the electromagnetic solution. Changes in thermal/electric properties associated with the phase transition were fully accounted for as well as heat losses from product to cavity. Two scenarios were investigated: a centric and eccentric placement on the turntable. Developing temperature fields predicted by the numerical solution are validated against experimentally obtained data. Presented results indicate the feasibility of fully coupled simulations of the microwave heating of a frozen product. (© 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe express-method of {{diagnostics}} {{and selection}} of polymeric petroleum products is substantiated. Such products are processed by hot melt extrusion into films with technical purposes and then used in packaging. Bright visual effects in layers of polyolefin film materials {{are used in}} packaging of consumer goods; they {{can be seen in}} polarized light and depend on chemical and phase composition of films. For films application in smart packaging, for example, <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>products,</b> input control and diagnostics is required not only of mechanical and optical properties, but also of sensitivity of their optical properties to heat treatment. The two-stage method is suggested for checking the suitability of polyolefin films for the latent marking in polarized light for their usage in the production of intelligent packaging for <b>frozen</b> <b>foods</b> or other <b>products</b> with a strictly regulated mode of storage...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} a vehicle scheduling problem {{encountered in the}} cold chain logistics of the <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> delivery industry. Unlike the single product delivery scenario, we propose an optimization model that manages the delivery {{of a variety of}} products. In this scenario, a set of customers make requests for a variety of <b>frozen</b> <b>foods</b> which are being loaded together. The objective is to find the routes that represent the minimum delivery cost for a fleet of identical vehicles that, departing from a depot, visiting all customers only once and returning to the depot. The delivery cost includes the transportation cost, the cost of refrigeration, the penalty cost and cargo damage cost based on the characteristics of different <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> Apart from the usual constraints of time windows and loading weight, the study also takes into account the constraints of loading volume related to the unit volume of different <b>frozen</b> <b>foods.</b> We then propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) method for the model. Computational tests with real data from a case validate the feasibility and rationality of the model and show the efficient combinations of parameter values of the GA method...|$|R
