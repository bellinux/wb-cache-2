50|$|In thermodynamics, {{it is not}} {{necessary}} that the radiative transfer of heat be of pure black-body radiation, nor of <b>incoherent</b> <b>radiation.</b> Of course black-body radiation is incoherent. Thus laser radiation counts in thermodynamics as a one-way component of two-way radiation that is heat transfer. Also, by the Helmholtz reciprocity principle, the target system radiates into the laser source system, though of course relatively weakly compared with the laser light. According to Planck, an incoherent monochromatic beam of light transfers entropy and has a temperature. For a transfer to qualify as work, it must be reversible in the surroundings, for example in the concept of a reversible work reservoir. Laser light is not reversible in the surroundings and is therefore a component of transfer of energy as heat, not work.|$|E

40|$|Characteristics of {{broadband}} ELF, VLF, and LF {{emissions in}} the magnetosphere were calculated assuming <b>incoherent</b> Cerenkov <b>radiation</b> from magnetospheric electrons with energies from 50 eV to 50 keV.

A diffusive equilibrium model of the magnetosphere with an ionosphere, plasmapause, and a centered dipole magnetic field was used. Ray path calculations were done in three dimensions. Using simultaneous energetic electron and VLF data, comparisons were made between calculated and observed VLF hiss. Assuming a wave normal angle six degrees from the resonance cone angle, the calculated spectral densities are both two orders of magnitude below the observed spectral densities.

40|$|Consideration of <b>incoherent</b> Cerenkov <b>radiation</b> from intense fluxes of {{electrons}} in the magnetosphere {{as a source}} of VLF hiss and several other emission phenomena. A procedure for calculating the Cerenkov and cyclotron radiation power from a spectrum {{of electrons}} in a test volume is outlined, as well as a ray-tracing routine for determining the path that the emitted power follows through the magnetosphere. Comparisons are made between a VLF hiss event and an energetic particle spectrum observed simultaneously with the Injun 5 spacecraft.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{mechanism}} for the long-lived quantum coherence by considering the discrete phonon modes: these vibrational modes effectively weaken the exciton-environment interaction, due to the new composite (polaron) formed by excitons and vibrons. This subsequently demonstrates the role of vibrational coherence which greatly contributes to long-lived feature of the excitonic coherence that has been observed in femtosecond experiments. The estimation of the timescale of coherence elongated by vibrational modes is given in an analytical manner. To test the validity of our theory, we study the pigment-protein complex in detail by exploring the energy transfer and coherence dynamics. The ground-state vibrational coherence generated by <b>incoherent</b> <b>radiations</b> is shown to be long-survived and is demonstrated to be significant in promoting the excitation energy transfer.

The necessity to measure ultrashort pulses of <b>incoherent</b> <b>radiation</b> is encountered in many fields of pure and applied research. Such pulses can be produced by high-energy short bunches of charged particles [1], or bremsstrahlung from a laser generated hot plasma [2].

40|$|The amplified {{spontaneous}} emission from a superluminescent diode was frequency doubled in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide crystal. The temporally <b>incoherent</b> <b>radiation</b> of such a superluminescent diode {{is characterized by a}} relatively broad spectral bandwidth and thermal-like photon statistics, as the measured degree of second order coherence, g^(2) (0) = 1. 9 ± 0. 1, indicates. Despite the non-optimized scenario in the spectral domain, we achieve six orders of magnitude higher conversion efficiency than previously reported with truly incoherent light. This is possible by using single spatial mode radiation and quasi phase matched material with a waveguide architecture. This work is a principle step towards efficient frequency conversion of temporally <b>incoherent</b> <b>radiation</b> in one spatial mode to access wavelengths where no radiation from superluminescent diodes is available, especially with tailored quasi phase matched crystals.
