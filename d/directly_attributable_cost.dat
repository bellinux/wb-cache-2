50|$|Indirect <b>costs</b> are not <b>directly</b> <b>attributable</b> to a <b>cost</b> object. Indirect {{costs are}} {{typically}} allocated to a cost object on some basis. In construction, all costs which {{are required for}} completion of the installation, but are not <b>directly</b> <b>attributable</b> to the <b>cost</b> object are indirect, such as overhead. In manufacturing, costs not directly assignable to the end product or process are indirect. These may be costs for management, insurance, taxes, or maintenance, for example. Indirect costs are those for activities or services that benefit more than one project. Their precise benefits to a specific project are often difficult or impossible to trace. For example, {{it may be difficult}} to determine precisely how the activities of the director of an organization benefit a specific project. Indirect costs do not vary substantially within certain production volumes or other indicators of activity, and so they may sometimes be considered to be fixed costs.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Breast {{cancer is}} the leading cause of death from cancer among women in Germany. Despite its {{clinical}} and economic relevance, no <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> for breast cancer have been reported for Germany so far. The objective of this study is to estimate age-specific breast cancer attributable health expenditures for Germany. METHODS: Sickness fund data from 1999 representing about 26 million insured (i. e. 32 % of the total German population) have been analysed using generalized additive models and the error propagation law. Costs have been inflated to 2010. RESULTS: Breast cancer <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> decreased with age. Among breast cancer patients aged 30 - 45 years, about 90 % of all health expenditures were due to breast cancer, whereas in breast cancer patients aged 80 - 90 years, about 50 % were due to breast cancer. Breast cancer <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> amounted to about € 9, 000 annually for patients below 55 years of age and declined to about € 3, 000 in 90 -year-old breast cancer patients. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides estimates of <b>attributable</b> breast cancer <b>costs</b> in Germany. Compared with the international literature, the estimates were plausible but had a tendency to underestimate breast cancer <b>attributable</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R

40|$|For nearly 20 years, Australia’s {{approach}} to the management of its primary industries {{has been driven by}} the principles of Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD). Even though the use of quality research is fundamental to the application of ESD (NSESD 1991) there has been remarkably little assessment of the effectiveness of the use of such research. One of Australia’s primary industries, the commercial fishing industry, has an annual production value of over $A 2 billion with an estimated 100, 000 people being dependant directly or indirectly on the industry for their employment (FRDC 2005). Fishing also remains a vital source of nutrition and custom for indigenous communities and an estimated 3. 4 million Australians recreationally fish every year (Henry & Lyle 2003). Despite the economic and social value of fish and fishing and the prominence given to research in fisheries management there is no formal process or widely accepted {{approach to}} assess the overall performance of fisheries research, or to measure the extent to which research results have been incorporated into fisheries management. Neither has there been a comprehensive examination of the performance of the national research portfolio and its contribution to fisheries outcomes. This is primarily because there is no generally accepted method for assessing research performance and its contribution to desired outcomes. Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) has, despite its acknowledged inadequacies, been the only method commonly employed to date. This study was undertaken to address the lack of knowledge of the performance of the national fisheries research portfolio and to develop a composite measure to evaluate this performance. It covered over 100 completed projects with <b>directly</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> alone exceeding $A 38 million. It included two separate national surveys of the country’s leading fisheries research end-users and fishery experts together with a series of interviews of selected personnel in key fisheries. These were followed by statistical analyses of the appropriate data on 60 fisheries. In combination, these processes enabled quantification of the relationships between the performance of the fishery pre and post project, biophysical and socio-economic characteristics of each fishery, and the opinions of end-users about project performance. Results obtained in this study showed that the national fisheries research portfolio undertaken over the decade of the 1990 s had performed well according to the opinions of end-users. It was perceived to have had a positive influence on fisheries management and the positive fisheries outcomes that have flowed from this. Between 70 % and 86 % (depending on the measure) of end-users’ opinions regarding fisheries projects completed throughout the 1990 s were positive. Therefore, from the perspective of those with relatively short-term interests, such as politicians, Australia’s fisheries research portfolio could be concluded to have been most successful. As a result, similar surveys, perhaps together with BCAs, may be all that is required for political or corporate reporting purposes. On the other hand significant correlation was only found between fishery outcomes and one measure of end-user opinion. Therefore, these opinions and the surveys that quantified them are, in spite of the quality and short-term utility of the data they contain, not particularly reliable predictors of longer-term fishery outcomes. In contrast, statistically significant relationships were identified between key fisheries outcomes and several fishery characteristics, such as the longevity of the species and the level of scientific knowledge. This confirms that numerous factors not related to research performance also influence fishery outcomes. It also suggests that several may be indicators of the likely success of future projects. This study has provided answers to many of the questions clouding the evaluation of Australian fisheries research performance. It has related the relatively short-term perceptions of research success to the longer-term reality of fishery outcomes. It has also identified areas of portfolio strength, described areas in need of improvement and identified how the necessary improvements might be achieved. By delivering the first in-depth analysis of the performance of the national fisheries research portfolio it has established a sound basis for ongoing work in this field and provided an historical benchmark of that performance over {{the last decade of the}} 20 th century...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} firstly to estimate the healthcare <b>costs</b> <b>attributable</b> to heart disease in Denmark using recently available data for 2002 – 05. Secondly, to estimate the <b>attributable</b> healthcare <b>costs</b> of lifestyle risk factors among heart patients, in order to inform decision making about prevention programmes specifically targeting patients with heart disease. Methods: For a cohort consisting of participants in a national representative health interview survey, register-based information about hospital diagnosis was used to identify patients with heart disease. Healthcare consumption during 2002 – 05 among individuals developing heart disease during 2002 – 05 was compared with individuals free of heart disease. Healthcare <b>costs</b> <b>attributable</b> to heart disease were estimated by linear regression with adjustment for confounding factors. The <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> of excess drinking, physical inactivity and smoking among future heart patients were estimated with the same method. Results: Individuals with heart disease cost the healthcare system on average J 3195 (pv 0. 0001) per person-year more than individuals without heart disease. The <b>attributable</b> <b>cost</b> of unhealthy lifestyle factors among individuals at risk of heart disease was about 11 %– 16 % of the <b>attributable</b> <b>cost</b> of heart disease. Conclusions: Heart disease incurs significant additional costs to the healthcare sector, and more so if heart patients have a history of leading an unhealthy life. Consequently, strategies to prevent or cease unhealthy lifestyle may not only result in cost savings due to avoided heart disease. Additional cost savings may be obtained because heart patient...|$|R
