40|$|We {{present a}} study of <b>Ks</b> <b>band</b> {{luminosity}} evolution of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) population in simple stellar systems using star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We determine physical parameters of LMC star clusters including center coordinates, radii, and foreground reddenings. Ages of 83 star clusters are derived from isochrone fitting with the Padova models, and those of 19 star clusters are taken from the literature. The AGB stars in 102 star clusters with log(age) = 7. 3 - 9. 5 are selected using near-infrared color magnitude diagrams based on 2 MASS photometry. Then we obtain the <b>Ks</b> <b>band</b> luminosity fraction of AGB stars in these star clusters {{as a function of}} ages. The <b>Ks</b> <b>band</b> luminosity fraction of AGB stars increases, on average, as age increases from log(age) ~ 8. 0, reaching a maximum at log(age) ~ 8. 5, and it decreases thereafter. There is a large scatter in the AGB luminosity fraction for given ages, which is mainly due to stochastic effects. We discuss this result in comparison with five simple stellar population models. The maximum <b>Ks</b> <b>band</b> AGB luminosity fraction for bright clusters is reproduced by the models that expect the value of 0. 7 - 0. 8 at log(age) = 8. 5 - 8. 7. We discuss the implication of our results with regard to the study of size and mass evolution of galaxies. Comment: 35 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables; accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the relative localization of some antigenic epitopes {{in the inner}} ear. The inner ear protein antigens were extracted from {{various parts of the}} guinea pig inner ear. Brain, kidney, lung, heart and liver extracts were also obtained. We found by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that total inner ear extracts separated into three high concentration polypeptide bands with molecular weights of approximately 30, 42, 58 kd and three low density bands of 20, 25 and 35 kd. The 30 <b>kd</b> <b>band</b> was found mainly in the extract of the spiral ganglion and the acoustic nerve in the modiolus. The 42 and 58 <b>kd</b> <b>bands</b> were detected in the extract of the spiral ligament and the stria vascularis.
