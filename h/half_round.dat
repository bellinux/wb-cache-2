5|$|The 19th-century station {{building}} {{is owned by}} NS Stations. It is of the type SS 3rd class, which was designed by Karel Hendrik van Brederode. SS 3rd class was chosen instead of the smaller SS 4th class because {{of the importance of}} Winschoten as a commercial center. Eight buildings of SS 3rd class were completed in the Netherlands between 1862 and 1865, of which four remain today. This building of 1865 has a median risalit and wings on both sides parallel to the railway. The facade on the city side and railway side are identical, except for a <b>half</b> <b>round</b> decoration on the city side. The doors and windows of the building have arched frames. In the 1904 expansion, an enclosed porch was added and the east wing was extended with an extra waiting room.|$|E
25|$|The 1940 {{residence}} is {{a robust}} single storey timber-framed building clad in chamferboards. Standing on a red-coloured concrete slab on fill it {{is covered by}} a low-pitched hipped corrugated sheet roof with <b>half</b> <b>round</b> ridge tiles and quad gutters, all of asbestos cement. Verandahs located on {{the north and east}} sides are supported on pairs of 150mm square posts finished with skirtings and capitals on capped concrete upstands. Along the verandahs, projecting porches with gabled hips distinguish the entrances when viewed from the main garden and driveway. The verandah walls and interior partition walls have exposed frames lined with vertical v-jointed tongue and groove boards and ceilings are lined with asbestos cement sheeting finished with timber cover battens.|$|E
500|$|When not {{travelling}} overseas on cricket tours, Harvey {{played baseball}} in the winter for the Fitzroy Baseball Club. He was twice named in the Australian baseball team but the team was named only for the distinction accorded on the players. That is, they never competed. Harvey's fielding abilities were regarded by Wisden as the [...] "finest outfielder in the world" [...] during his career. As a baseball infielder Harvey developed a <b>half</b> <b>round</b> arm throw; its speed and accuracy caused many batsmen to be run out while attempting a run. Ray Robinson said that Harvey's throw was [...] "arrow-like" [...] in accuracy and that [...] "as a versatile fieldsman, this ball-hawk...takes top place". His baseball training also influenced his habit of catching the ball above head height, with which he rarely dropped catches. This {{was based on the}} theory that the fielder need never take his eyes off the ball and, if it were to bounce out of his hands, he would have time to attempt to grab the rebound. Harvey also covered ground quickly and possessed and efficient method of picking up and returning the ball. From late 1958 when Norm O'Neill made his Test debut until Harvey's retirement in 1963, the duo formed a formidable pairing in the covers, helping to restrict opposition batsmen from scoring in the region.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the three}} orders of ancient Greek architecture, the sculptural decoration, be it a simple <b>half</b> <b>round</b> astragal, a frieze of stylised foliage or the ornate {{sculpture}} of the pediment, is all {{essential to the}} architecture {{of which it is}} a part. In the Doric order, there is no variation in its placement. Reliefs never decorate walls in an arbitrary way. The sculpture is always located in several predetermined areas, the metopes and the pediment. In later Ionic architecture, there is greater diversity in the types and numbers of mouldings and decorations, particularly around doorways, where voluted brackets sometimes occur supporting an ornamental cornice over a door, such as that at the Erechtheion. A much applied narrow moulding is called [...] "bead and reel" [...] and is symmetrical, stemming from turned wooden prototypes. Wider mouldings include one with tongue-like or pointed leaf shapes, which are grooved and sometimes turned upward at the tip, and [...] "egg and dart" [...] moulding which alternates ovoid shapes with narrow pointy ones.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} up on six spruce longerons, with bulkheads (formers) of spruce and three-ply. [...] Rather {{than the usual}} <b>half</b> <b>round</b> deck {{on the top of}} the fuselage, the Wee Bee's decking was concave as it reached the flat fuselage sides, making for a better view from the two tandem cockpits. [...] These were positioned at the leading edge and just behind mid-chord, fitted with dual controls. [...] Both cockpits were semi-enclosed and faired neatly into the upper fuselage/ wing surface. [...] The front one was entered by lifting up a small hinged part of the leading edge, which was locked down for flight; this gave excellent visibility with the help of the [...] "hollow ground" [...] decking. [...] The aft cockpit had a roof hatch with a transparent celluloid window in the upper wings, with good views though openings in the sides below the wing. [...] The 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub flat twin [...] engine was hung from a duralumin sheet bracket fixed to the engine bulkhead and positioned below with a pair of duralumin tubes, themselves braced to the lower longerons with steel tubes. [...] It was enclosed in a smooth, streamlined cowling, with the upper cylinder heads protruding for cooling.|$|E
2500|$|Close to Buckland Rings {{is another}} {{earthwork}} enclosure known as Ampress Camp (or Ampress Hole) (...) [...] It lies 360 metres east of Buckland Rings alongside Lymington River, and about 200 metres north of Lymington New Forest Hospital. Ampress Camp was noted by Thomas Wright in 1744, who {{described it as}} [...] "upon a lower Ground, close by a River (which defends it on one Side), with a Ditch and Vallum <b>half</b> <b>round,</b> {{and a kind of}} Morass on the other." [...] The outer rampart depicted by Wright has long since been flattened, and the ditches have been filled in. Waterworks occupy {{the northern part of the}} site, and commercial buildings have encroached upon the western half. Part of the interior (the southeastern part) is still viewable as a field, and a sunken lane runs a short distance along the line of the southern inner ditch. There have been only limited excavations, but a few scraps of pottery found at the site may date from the Iron Age. If the camp does date from the Iron Age, then it is unusual to have two Iron Age camps so close together. Ampress Camp may perhaps have formed a beachhead for the inhabitants of Buckland Rings, or it may have been occupied during a different period of the Iron Age.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} tie-breaking rule, called <b>round</b> <b>half</b> up (or <b>round</b> <b>half</b> towards positive infinity), {{is widely}} used in many disciplines. That is, half-way values of [...] are always rounded up.|$|R

5000|$|Longhorn is {{the best}} known style of the American Colby cheeses. [...] "Longhorn" [...] refers to the long orange {{cylindrical}} shape of the cheese.

50|$|To tie the hitch {{around a}} pole, begin by passing the working end a <b>half</b> turn <b>round</b> the pole. Next, pass a <b>half</b> turn <b>round</b> the {{standing}} part. Then, pass a <b>half</b> turn <b>round</b> both the working {{end and the}} standing part, above the first turn (i.e. closer to the pole). Finally, push a bight of the working end {{through the middle of}} the hitch - between the two half turns, and between the standing part and the working end. Pull on the standing part to tighten, if necessary sliding the hitch snugly up against the pole.|$|R
