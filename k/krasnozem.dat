This ecotechnology has been extensively incorporated into the urban landscape to treat stormwater runoff, BUT do we really know enough about their long term sustainability and performance efficiency? Over the past decade researchers at Griffith University have focussed on evaluating the effectiveness of using different soil media and plant species to maximise nutrient removal. The performance efficiency of ten different media types including amendments for enhanced phosphorus adsorption, and ten different plant species have been investigated. Total Phosphorus removal was highest (94 - 99 %) in sand media amended with Water Treatment Residuals, followed by 'brickies loam' (92 %), then sand amended with Red Mud or <b>Krasnozems</b> (86 - 89 %) and lowest in sand-gravel 44 %. Total Nitrogen removal was highest in the loam (78 %) but relatively poor in other media types (around 50 %).

40|$|Constructed {{subsurface}} flow wetlands {{have the potential}} for high phosphorus removal through chemical adsorption onto the media. Over the past decade researchers at Griffith University, Australia have been using 240 L mesocosms to investigate the long term sustainability and performance efficiency of using different soil media and plant species to maximise nutrient removal from secondary wastewater effluent. The performance efficiency of 15 different media mixes including amendments for enhanced phosphorus adsorption, and 10 different plant species have been investigated. Total phosphorus removal was highest (94 – 99 %) in sand media amended with water treatment residuals (WTR), followed by ‘brickies loam’ (92 %), then sand amended with red mud or <b>krasnozems</b> (86 – 89 %) and lowest in gravel (44 %). Phosphorus removal using sand with WTR had the greatest efficiency when treating influent with P concentrations ranging from 0. 5 to 8 mg/L (90 – 99 %). The addition of biochar to sand did not enhance P removal during a two year trial. Leaching and export of P occurred from the media either after heavy rain or loading with stormwater having low P concentrations (< 0. 06 mg/L). However, following such ‘flushing events’ P sorption and hence P removal efficiency were enhanced. Mature plant assemblages could uptake up to 16 gP/m 2 /year. Of the herbaceous plants the perennial grasses Pennisetum alopecuroides and Vetiver-Chrysopogon zizanioides, and the sedge Carex appressa had the highest biomass. The woody species Callistemon pachyphyllus and Melaleucaquinquenervia had the highest carbon sequestration (1000 g C/m 2 /year).

Uptake of K„ appeared insignificant after exchangeable K, as measured on the bulk soil, had been depleted by about 607 o, and its contribution to total plant uptake thereafter was independent of species. For setaria and maize, plant K concentrations at this time were above the critical level, so that K represents a potassium resource that can be exploited during normal growth of an appropriate species. Uptake of K from the <b>krasnozem</b> was relatively small. The red podzolic soil yielded much more K than a similar soil in earlier experiments. This was attributed to differences in clay mineralogy, possibly associated with differences in the weathering stages reached by the two soils.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine variations in the physical properties of non-compacted soil-sand aggregates in terms of binary packing theory. Two soils were used, a swelling black earth and a <b>krasnozem</b> with low swelling capacity, and aggregates with varying clay percentage were prepared by dispersing the soil, mixing with 100 - 50 nm sand, and wetting and drying. At lower clay percentages, void ratio with increasing clay was greater than that predicted from theory. This was attributed to clay entering between sand junctions and increasing porosity by expanding the coarse matrix. From water retention and swelling data, the transition from coarse to fine matrix occurs in both soils at about 40 % clay. In the fine particle matrix, variation of void ratio in the <b>krasnozem</b> aggregates was as expected from theory. In the black earth, no significant variation in void ratio occurs at clay percentages > 40 %. This was attributed to porosity created around the sand particles owing to differential swelling and shrinkage. Results obtained by other workers are explained in terms of binary packing theory and the concepts developed in this paper...|$|E

40|$|This thesis reports work on {{the effects}} of added, decomposable organic matter as a {{possible}} lime substitute on exchangeable and soil solution aluminium in relation to phosphorus availability and growth of perennial ryegrass (lolium perenne. L) in acid <b>krasnozems</b> on Tertiary basalt, North-Western Tasmania. Soil was collected to a depth of 15 cm at three sites in a sequence of increasing elevation and rainfall, representative of the Burnie, Lapoinya and Yolla series. The soil materials were first screened for their suitability for later work by determining certain basic soil properties and by measuring effects on these properties of glasshouse incubation for four weeks of soils with organic matter added as barley straw or lucerne chaff at rates equivalent to 0, 3. 5 and 7. 0 t/ha. There were significant effects, relative to initial levels of soil parameters, in terms of reduced exchangeable aluminium, increased available phosphorus and increased soil solution (pF 2) ionic strength, with effects due to the addition of organic matter. Differences in cation exchange capacity sum of basic exchangeable cations, and soil reaction, were not significant. Because it was highest in exchangeable aluminium, lowest in available phosphorus, and was strongly acid, Burnie soil material was used to study effects of different rates of added barley straw or lucerne chaff on soil aluminium, phosphorus, and soil solution ionic strength after different periods of incubation (0, 4, 8, 16 weeks), with and without added urea to bring the C/N ratio of the organic matter to a value of 12. The pH of the soils with added organic matter was higher than the controls, both with and without added urea, but the effect of urea on pH decreased with time. The effect of urea on the increase of pH was obvious in the first 4 weeks and then slightly varied from week 4 to week 8. Thereafter, the pH was on the decline. Exchangeable aluminium was lower in soil incubated with organic matter but differences due to rate of added organic matter were not significant, lucerne chaff had a greater early effect but the difference versus barley straw was reduced after four weeks. There was a sharp rise in available phosphorus measured after four weeks in all soils with added organic matter but this was followed by a rapid fall so that levels {{at the end of the}} experiment (16 weeks) were well below those at its commencement. Available phosphorus of control soils decreased regularly throughout. There was little difference in effects due to kind of organic matter. Ionic strength of soil solution extracts (pF 2) from the soils with added organic matter rose sharply and levels were maintained in soils with added organic matter. Burnie soil was again used to follow effects of added organic matter on active aluminium in relation to native available phosphorus and growth of "Nui" cultivar of perennial ryegrass. Urea was not added in this experiment. Soluble aluminium was added as Al 2 (SO 4) 3. 14 H 20 after four weeks of incubation of soil plus organic matter (Sequence (a)) and together with organic matter (Sequence (b)), both sequences being incubated for a further four weeks before sowing of ryegrass seed. Differences between the two sequences in effects on pH, soil solution phosphorus (pF 2), phosphorus uptake and dry matter production by the test plant were not significant. However, there were marked effects within each sequence of added organic matter in increasing values of each of these parameters in relation to controls. Exchangeable and soil solution aluminium, especially monomeric aluminium, were markedly reduced by added organic matter at all rates of aluminium application and these effects were greater in Sequence (a) than in Sequence (b) soils. Aluminium remaining in solution was almost wholly in organic complexed forms. Conversely, available phosphorus was higher. Lucerne chaff was slightly but consistently more effective than barley straw but these differences were not significant. Finally, Lapoinya soil from the "museum" area of Elliott Research Station was used in a study of effects of both added organic matter and phosphorus (KH 2 PO 4) on soil aluminium in relation to growth of ryegrass because of its low pH, very low level of available phosphorus and high level of active aluminium. Reduction of exchangeable and monomeric aluminium occurred with rate of phosphorus application, the effect being greater in the presence of added organic matter. Again, nearly all of the soil solution aluminium was in organically complexed forms in the presence of added organic matter. Differences between the effects of lucerne chaff and barley straw were small but consistent, although not statistically significant, with lucerne chaff having the greater effects. Soil reaction again increased with added organic matter and an inverse relationship between levels of aluminium (both exchangeable, monomeric form) and available phosphorus depended on pH. Plant growth and phosphorus uptake and content responded by increasing sharply with rate of phosphorus application and were further enhanced greatly by added organic matter. Plant symptoms of aluminium toxicity/phosphorus deficiency were not evident in the presence of added organic matter, even at the highest level of aluminium application (100 ppm, 0. D.). Both forms of organic matter used whether fresh or partly decomposed, gave beneficial effects within the period of experimentation in suppressing aluminium toxicity and enhancing growth of perennial ryegrass in the acid soils used. Application of organic matter at practical rates may allow reduction of the quantity and frequency of lime additions...|$|R

The study also examined the productivity of cassava when grown under conditions appropriate to commercial production. These conditions included the use of mainly infertile soils, with no irrigation after establishment. The yellow podsolic site of low initial P status (Colwell P of 4. 1 µg/g) was the most responsive to P application, with yield (dry weight of storage organs) being increased by 170 % with 120 kg/ha of broadcast P. Above that rate there were no further significant increases in yield. A strong response (96 % yield increase with 10 kg/ha of P) was also obtained on the podsol site (Colwell P of 3. 0 µg/g). For the lateritic podsolic and <b>krasnozem</b> sites, which were higher in Colwell-P, the responses to P were not significant, but deficiencies of other nutrients contributed {{to the lack of}} response at the lateritic podsolic site. Although the alluvial site was highest in P (Colwell P of 49 µg/g), a 15 % increase in yield was obtained with 20 kg/ha of P.

40|$|Comparisons are {{reported}} {{of the small}} mammal fauna of three distinct rainforests of south-east Queensland, with emphasis on the faunal response to indirect effects of low soil fertility and past logging disturbance. Cooloola rainforest sites (on infertile podzol soils) supported significantly fewer small mammals than did those at Mt Glorious (on fertile <b>krasnozem</b> soils). This was particularly evident where past logging disturbance was high. However, small mammal species differed in their response to site according to their degree of specialization. The relative abundance of species within Mt Glorious rainforest was comparatively even. In contrast, the small mammal fauna of Cooloola rainforest showed a high dominance-diversity relation with more opportunistic species predominant. Rodent movements and possibly diurnal activity also increased within disturbed secondary Cooloola rainforest. It is proposed that soil infertility, a strong plant commitment to chemical defence against herbivory, {{and a history of}} early logging, combine to suppress the abundance and diversity of small mammals within Cooloola rainforests...|$|E

The weathering pattern and origin can account for differences in their fertility in the virgin state.

The composition of the soil solution obtained was the same with both methods of extraction when samples had been pre-wet to a matric suction of 0. 1 bar. Immiscible liquid displacement extracted solution from a <b>krasnozem</b> surface soil at suctions as great as 15 bar; in contrast, centrifuge drainage failed to extract solution from this soil at > 3 bar. The concentration of ions in solutions extracted by displacement from soils with increasing matric suction rose to a far greater extent than that anticipated if concentration was the only mechanism operating. In re-wet air-dry samples, major cations and anions were at equilibrium levels in solution after incubation for 1 day; longer incubation times resulted in an artificial elevation of ionic strength through mineralization of organic matter in some surface samples. The levels achieved after 1 day were similar to those present in solutions extracted from field-moist samples...|$|E

Queensland government is encouraging people for hardwood plantation in inland (low rainfall) area of Southeast Queensland (SEQ). However, the economic viability of the plantation is suspicious. Since the carbon sequestration is payable in the Kyoto context, this study has compared the total soil carbon and its long-term in-/decreasing rate in scrubland, pastureland, cropping land and spotted gum land in <b>Krasnozem</b> soil of Kingaroy, an inland SEQ. We have demonstrated how the timeline of land use transformation could be useful to triangulate the soil carbon trends efficiently and effectively. Isoprime isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to a Eurovector elemental analyser was used for soil analysis. The lowest amount of soil carbon was found in cropping land (77. 39 t/ha up to 110 cm), which was even bit lower than the global average of similar land use types (80 t/ha up to 100 cm). The soil carbon under the mature spotted gum (306 tC/ha) was found much higher than the world average soil carbon amount of similar region's forest and was closer to the world richest soil carbon boreal forest. The annual decreasing rate of soil carbon in cropping land was found 2. 6811166 percent which was almost similar to the ROTHC modelled value. The annual increasing rate of soil carbon under the pasture and spotted gum plantation was 0. 575841948 and 0. 926507307 percent respectively. Thus, the current cropping practices of Kingaroy are not favourable for carbon sequestration but the spotted gum plantation has considerable potential of sequestrating soil carbon. ...|$|E

This paper reports experiments conducted under controlled conditions to further investigate the influence of water regime and soil type on the response of pigeonpea seedlings to compaction. Undisturbed cores, 23. 5 cm in diameter and 60 cm deep were recovered from compaction treatments (control, moderate, severe) at field sites on an oxisol (<b>Krasnozem,</b> Uf 6. 31, Rhodic Paleustalf) and a vertisol (Black earth, Ug 5. 16, Entic Pellusturt). Pigeonpea seedlings were grown for 30 days in two experiments under either drying or well-watered conditions. Under drying conditions, the vertisol retained more water in the surface than the oxisol. This reduced soil strength in the vertisol and root and shoot growth were unaffected by compaction. The water applied to the oxisol drained to lower depths and the surface dried rapidly, increasing soil strength and reducing root and shoot growth. Under well-watered conditions, compaction {{had no effect on}} plant growth in the vertisol, but in the oxisol growth in both the control and severe compaction treatments was significantly lower than under the moderate compaction treatment. Reduced volumetric water and nutrient content in the control and low air-filled porosity in the severe compaction treatment are thought to be responsible for these effects. Our results indicate the potential influence of rainfall distribution and soil hydraulic properties on plant response to compaction. Predicting yield losses resulting from compaction will require modelling approaches that incorporate the effects of compaction on root growth and crop water use...|$|E
40|$|Degradation of {{dieldrin}} in soils was {{studied in}} laboratory experiments. Application of powdered zinc in dilute acetic acid, nickel chloride in sodium borohydride and potassium tertiary butoxide in dimethyl sulphoxide to pots containing solonized brown soil, podzol, red brown earth, grey clay, alluvial and <b>krasnozem</b> soils {{had little effect}} on the rate of degradation. Application of potassium tertiary butoxide in dimethyl sulphoxide solution to soil samples containing dieldrin achieved a rapid decrease in pesticide concentration in some cases. However, the undesirable effects of these chemicals on soil fauna and flora and on soil physical properties indicate that their use in the field could not be recommended. Adsorption of dieldrin (as illustrated by the Freundlich constant) was greater in red brown earth and grey clay soils than in the solonized brown soil. The rate of dieldrin desorption from these soils was found to be in the order solonized brown soil > red brown earth > grey clay. Dieldrin uptake by plants was determined, with carrots being found to absorb the greatest quantities of dieldrin. All plant species took up considerably more dieldrin when grown on sand than on clay. Lupin translocated very little dieldrin to the plant tops. The amounts of insecticide translocated to the plant tops were not proportional to the amounts of insecticide present in soil. Brown coal was found {{to be a very good}} dieldrin adsorbent. Addition of brown coal in the proportion 4 : 1 soil:brown coal reduced the uptake of dieldrin by carrots from contaminated soil to acceptable levels.

The effects of metal-contaminated sewage sludge on the symbiotic effectiveness of Rhizobiurn leguminosarum biovar trifolii, legume 12 fixation and N mineralization of legume shoots and soil-sludge organic matter were investigated in soil from a 10 year-old, sludge reuse experiment at Glenfield (NSW); in six agricultural soils (Rutherglen Red podzolic, Goulburn Yellow podzolic, Robertson <b>Krasnozem,</b> Condobolin Red-brown earth, Wagga Wagga Sand, Darlington Point Grey clay) recently-amended with four rates (0, 60, 120, 240 dry sludge tonnes (dst) ha 1) of Malabar sludge; and the Goulburn soil recently-amended with four different sludges (Port Kembla, St Marys, Quakers Hill, Richmond) at rates of nil, 60 and 240 dst ha- 1. However, the recently-amended soils were rapidly-reacted with sludge in seven wet-dry cycles each lasting approximately 7 weeks (6 weeks wet, 1 week dry). The Glenfield treatments, initiated in 1982, involved application of sludge at rates of 0, 40 dst ha - 1 y- 1 or 120 dst ha' y - 1, for five consecutive years, to unlimed (pH 4. 4) or limed (2. 5 t ha - 1, pH 5. 1) soil. Total heavy metal concentrations in the Glenfield soil treatments ranged from 120 - 580 mg kg - 1 soil, with a range of individual heavy metal concentrations (mg kg- 1 soil) : 43 - 255, Zn; 21 - 197, Cu; 15 - 45, Cr; 9 - 16, Ni; 25 - 77, Pb; < 0. 06 - 1. 9, Cd. In the recently-amended soils, total heavy metal concentrations ranged from 40 - 1070 mg kg - 1 when amended with Malabar sludge and 86 - 788 mg kg - 1 in Goulburn soil amended with the different sludges. Individual metal concentration ranges in soils amended with Malabar were (mg kg - 1) : 13 - 481, Zn; 3 - 236, Cu; 12 - 182, Cr; < 3 - 80, Ni; < 7 - 80, Pb; < 0. 06 - 5. 5, Cd, and in Goulburn soil amended with the different sludges: 31 - 411, Zn; 23 - 210, Cu; 11 - 65, Cr; < 3 - 36, Ni; 11 - 65, Pb; < 0. 06 - 5. 2, Cd. Symbiotic effectiveness (ISE) of R. tr?folii isolated from sludge treated and control soils, was quantified by the dry matter or N content of seedlings of white (Glenfield) or subterranean (recently-amended) clover produced with only Rhizobium N 2 fixation as an N source. The contribution of fixed N to legumes grown in unamended and sludged soil was determined by the 15 N isotope dilution method using annual ryegrass as the reference plant. N mineralization was determined in short-duration (10 d) incubation experiments with soil incorporated with or without lucerne shoots (2 g 100 g- 1 soil) at soil moisture contents of field capacity (FC) and full water-holding-capacity (FWH). Net mineral N was measured as the sum of NH 4 + and N 03 -. The difference in net mineral N between + lucerne and - Iucerne treatments was taken as the net mineralization of lucerne N termed ? min N. Historic sludge amendment of the unlimed or limed Glenfield soil (maximum heavy metal concentration 500 - 600 mg kg - 1) had no adverse effect on ISE compared to unamended soil. The effect of sludge on ISE in the recently-amended soils depended on the soil type and sludge rate. The ISE of R. trifolii surviving in most sludged soils was not reduced at total metal concentrations up to 1000 mg kg - 1, however the ISE of these rhizobia was reduced in the <b>Krasnozem</b> and Red-brown earth at sludge rates giving total heavy metal concentrations of 550 - 1070 (60 - 240 dst ha- 1) and 668 mg kg - 1 soil (240 dst ha- 1), respectively. The growth and amount of N 2 fixed by white clover in the Glenfield soil was increased by sludge addition, with N 2 fixation contributing nearly all (84 - 98 %) of the clover total N. In the recently-amended experiment, subterranean clover dry weight and total N were increased significantly by sludge amendment of the acidic, podzolic soils and fixed N was increased significantly in the Yellow podzolic. A decrease in N 2 fixation was observed in some soils amended with higher rates of sludge. Where a reduction in ISE occurred fixed N was also poor. In other soils where ISE was not reduced, decreased N 2 fixation is presumed to be due to either mineral N inhibition, or perhaps to heavy metal effects on nodulation. Mineralization of neither incorporated lucerne nor soil-sludge N were adversely affected by sludge amendment at Glenfield. In the recently-amended soils at FC, mineralization of N proceeded as effectively in sludge-amended soils as in sludge-free soil except that ? min N was slightly reduced in the Red-brown earth and Grey clay at sludge rates of 240 dst ha- 1. However, at FWH less mineral N was recovered from incorporated lucerne shoots in sludge-amended soils in the heavier-textured or limed soils, which reduced ? min N relative to the control soil. Thus, there is potential for metal-contaminated sewage sludge to reduce symbiotic effectiveness,N 2 fixation and the net recovery of mineral N from incorporated lucerne depending on soil type and sludge rate, but also to benefit clover production and N fixed in other soilsRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|Growth {{of lettuce}} {{may be limited}} in acid soils by {{manganese}} toxicity which may be alleviated by applications of lime, phosphate fertilisers, iron and molybdenum. However few investigations have been undertaken to determine the biochemical effect of excess manganese in plants. The aim of this project was to demonstrate that manganese toxicity could reduce lettuce yield by inhibiting nitrate reductase activity. Manganese toxicity inhibited nitrate reductase activity in lettuce plants grown in an acid <b>krasnozem</b> soil. The yield of affected plants, which was {{significantly lower than the}} yield of control plants, was significantly correlated with the decrease in nitrate reductase activity. Associated with the decrease in nitrate reductase activity was an accumulation of nitrate in leaves and a decrease in the total nitrogen content (mgN/plant). Following applications of molybdenum foliar sprays there were significant increases in yield and nitrate reductase activity. The molybdenum content of plants increased in plants which had high tissue levels of manganese. The increase was probably due to the lower yield in these plants. It is not known how molybdenum reverses the manganese inhibition of nitrate reductase. Similar responses were observed in lettuce grown in nutrient solution. The Critical solution concentration of manganese,at which there was a decrease in yield and in nitrate reductase activity, was found to be 36 uM. Nitrate reductase activity of young and mature leaves was significantly correlated with leaf manganese levels. Plants grown in nitrate-nitrogen nutrient solutions were more susceptible to manganese toxicity than plants grown in ammonium nitrogen nutrient solutions. A study of the time-course of manganese inhibition of nitrate reductase in vivo (indicated that after a short lag period, manganese significantly decreased nitrate reductase activity. The half life for this decrease in enzyme activity was found to be 2. 5 hours. These results indicated that manganese was not inducing molybdenum deficiency and that manganese may have inhibited nitrate reductase by binding to the enzyme. Enzyme kinetic analysis of the manganese inhibition of nitrate reductase (in vitro) showed that manganese was a competitive inhibitor of nitrate reductase with respect to NADH and a non-competitive inhibitor of nitrate reductase with respect to nitrate. These results indicated that manganese was bound to the enzyme at or near the binding site for NADH. When manganese was added to the enzyme before NADH the degree of inhibition was greater than when the NADH was added to the enzyme before manganese. These results also indicated that manganese was interfering with the binding of NADH to the enzyme. EPR studies supported the results obtained with the kinetic analysis of the inhibition of nitrate reductase. Results of the EPR study showed that manganese was not bound by NADH but could be bound by the partially purified enzyme extract...|$|E
40|$|The rate of {{salinisation}} of soils from a {{water table}} {{has been shown}} to be related to the concentration of salts in groundwaters and the rate of upward flow of saline groundwater. The maximum rate at which soil can transmit soil solution from a water table to the surface is governed by hydraulic conductivity characteristics and depth to water table. In the present study the effects of chemical composition of groundwaters on the rate of salinisation of three different soils by upward flow were evaluated in soil columns. These effects were related to changes in pore geometry and hydraulic conductivity characteristics of the soils in salt solutions. The pore geometry, saturated and unsaturated conductivity, and the capacity of the soil to transmit soil solution from a water table to the surface varied little in <b>krasnozem</b> soil exposed to different salt solutions, but marked changes of different magnitudes occurred in the case of alluvial and red brown soils. With a reduction in cation concentration of salt solution at a given SAR, the inter-aggregate pores of alluvial and red brown soils decreased in size, apparently due to swelling of soil aggregates. The extent of this decrease in pore sizes was greater for solutions of higher SAR. A pore size index was proposed to evaluate quantitatively these changes in pore geometry. Patterns in the volume changes of different sized pores with changes in salt composition were discerned and used to predict the moisture release curves of these soils for other salt solutions and also for soils at slightly different bulk densities in the same Salt solutions. The saturated and unsaturated conductivity at high pressure heads of alluvial and red brown soils decreased markedly with reduction in cation concentration at a given SAR, while unsaturated conductivity at low pressure heads showed only small decreases. Existing methods for computing hydraulic conductivities from moisture release curves could not accurately predict the conductivities at saturation and high pressure heads in different salt solutions. It was suggested that the discrepancy was partly due to changes in internal pore geometry during desaturation as a result of aggregate shrinkage. These changes were described qualitatively in terms of a theoretical model. A concept of equivalent salt solutions was also developed and used to predict, fairly closely, the hydraulic conductivities of the soils in different salt solutions. It is proposed that this method could be used to correlate directly flow of different salt solutions in soils under specific boundary conditions. The computed maximum depths to water table for specific rates of upward flow in alluvial and red brown soils decreased as the cation concentration was reduced at a given SAR. However, marked decreases in maximum depths to water table for specific rates of flow occurred only with solutions of low cation concentration, in the presence of which the values of unsaturated conductivity within a critical range showed marked decreases. This critical range was defined using the •data from a flux/unsaturated conductivity ratio method of computing upward flow. The changes in measured rates of upward flow, AS the •cation concentration was reduced at a given SAR, were generally similar in nature to the changes in computed rates. The application of these results and concepts to field problems and areas for future research have been discussed...|$|E
