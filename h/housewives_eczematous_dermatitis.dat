40|$|Recently we {{have shown}} that T-cell-mediated {{keratinocyte}} apoptosis plays a key pathogenetic role {{in the formation of}} <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Spongiosis, the histologic hallmark of <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> is characterized by impairment of cohesion between epidermal keratinocytes. It is conceivable that the intercellular junction of keratinocytes is an early target of apoptosis-inducing T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the induction of keratinocyte apoptosis is accompanied by a rapid cleavage of E-cadherin and loss of coimmunoprecipitated β-catenin. In situ examination of E-cadherin expression and cellular distribution in acute <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis</b> revealed a reduction in keratinocyte membrane E-cadherin in areas of spongiosis. In contrast, the in vitro and in vivo expression of desmosomal cadherins during early apoptosis remained unchanged. Therefore, induction of keratinocyte apoptosis by skin-infiltrating T cells, subseqent cleavage of E-cadherin, and resisting desmosomal cadherins suggests a mechanism for spongiosis formation in <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis...</b>|$|R

40|$|SummaryStaphylococcus aureus skin {{colonization}} {{is universal}} in atopic dermatitis and common in cancer patients treated with {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor inhibitors. However, the causal relationship of dysbiosis and eczema {{has yet to be}} clarified. Herein, we demonstrate that Adam 17 fl/flSox 9 -Cre mice, generated to model ADAM 17 -deficiency in human, developed <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis</b> with naturally occurring dysbiosis, similar to that observed in atopic dermatitis. Corynebacterium mastitidis, S.  aureus, and Corynebacterium bovis sequentially emerged during the onset of <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> and antibiotics specific for these bacterial species almost completely reversed dysbiosis and eliminated skin inflammation. Whereas S.  aureus prominently drove eczema formation, C.  bovis induced robust T helper 2 cell responses. Langerhans cells were required for eliciting immune responses against S.  aureus inoculation. These results characterize differential contributions of dysbiotic flora during eczema formation, and highlight the microbiota-host immunity axis as a possible target for future therapeutics in <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis...</b>|$|R

Methods: A total 7412 patients aged > 65 years who were admitted to dermatology clinics between April 2009 and April 2014 were included in this analysis.

40|$|Background. Statins, {{an example}} of the most {{commonly}} prescribed medications to the elderly, are not without side effects. Dermatologic events are often overlooked as arising from medications, particularly those which are taken chronically. Moreover, elderly patients are prone to pharmacologic interactions due to multiple medications. In this report, we describe a case of a statin-induced <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis</b> with a psoriasis-like clinical presentation and review the skin manifestations that may arise from statin therapy. Case Presentation. An 82 -year-old man with gout and hypercholesterolemia presented to dermatology clinic with new onset of pruritic, scaly erythematous plaques bilaterally on the extensor surfaces of his arms. He had never had similar lesions before. Despite various topical and systemic treatments over several months, the rash continued to evolve. The patient was then advised to discontinue his long-term statin, which led to gradual resolution of his symptoms.

40|$|In vitro Fc epsilon RII {{expression}} was examined {{in patients with}} atopic dermatitis, those with non-atopic <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and normal individuals following stimulation of peripheral blood cells with recombinant IL- 4 (rIL- 4), phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), or PHA plus rIL- 2. At various days cells were stained with MoAbs to human lymphocyte Fc epsilon RII and to lymphoid cell-surface antigens and analysed by flow cytometry. rIL- 4, but not rIL- 2, specifically induced Fc epsilon RII on T cells as well as B cells in atopic <b>dermatitis,</b> <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and normal individual groups. Both atopics and non-atopics generated comparable proportions of Fc epsilon RII+ T cells (T epsilon cells), whereas the frequency of B cells bearing Fc epsilon RII(B epsilon cells) was significantly higher in patients with extensive atopic dermatitis than in those with mild atopic dermatitis and other subjects. Comparable levels of T epsilon cells were detected in both atopic and non-atopic donors following stimulation of peripheral blood cells with PHA or pre-activation of the cells with PHA plus subsequent incubation with rIL- 2. Whereas both CD 8 + and CD 4 + subsets were present in T epsilon cell populations induced specifically by rIL- 4, PHA and PHA plus rIL- 2, patients with atopic dermatitis had a greater tendency for Fc epsilon RII expression on CD 8 + T cells compared with patients with <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and normal individuals. Recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma), but not rIFN-alpha or prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), suppressed the generation of T epsilon cells by rIL- 4 in atopics and non-atopics to the same degree.

40|$|A 40 -year-old woman {{presented}} with an itchy erythematosquamous change of a café-au-lait spot in her face. The onset {{of this change}} occurred just after her relocation. The café-au-lait spot had been irradiated by laser approximately 20 years ago. Clinically, there was a coin-sized erythema with a slight scale on the pigmented lesion in the left lateral orbital region. Histopathologically, the lesion demonstrated both spongiotic dermatitis and interface dermatitis together with lymphohistiocytic cell infiltration, in addition to moderate acanthosis and elongation of rete ridges with slight basal hyperpigmentation. From these clinical and histopathological findings, the lesion was diagnosed as <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis</b> occurring on the café-au-lait spot after laser radiation. Another interesting histopathological finding was that some parts of a lobule of the sebaceous gland were occupied exclusively by degenerative atrophic sebocytes. From the viewpoint of pathogenesis, the <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis</b> of this patient {{could have been an}} accompanying feature of a neurogenic inflammation occurring on the café-au-lait spot after laser radiation, and the atrophic change of a part of the sebaceous lobule might have been induced by a morphogenetic alteration of certain germinative cells of the sebaceous lobule due to laser radiation...|$|R
40|$|In acute <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> {{keratinocyte}} (KC) apoptosis {{caused by}} dermis-infiltrating, activated T cells plays a crucial pathogenetic {{role in the}} development of spongiosis, the histopathological hallmark of acute eczema. Remarkably, T-cell-mediated apoptosis of single KC, as well as spongiosis, is located predominantly in suprabasal epidermal layers, suggesting that antiapoptotic mechanisms protect basal KC. The cellular Flice-inhibitory protein (cFLIP) is known to block apoptotic CD 95 -signaling, and may therefore account for such a protection of basal KC. HaCaT KCs retrovirally transduced with the long form of cFLIP were effectively protected against T-cell-mediated apoptosis in KC monolayer/CD 4 + T-cell cocultures. In situ correlation of cFLIP protein expression and KC apoptosis in lesional eczematous skin showed a highly restricted expression of cFLIP in basal KC, whereas cleaved caspase- 3 (as a surrogate marker of apoptosis) was detected predominantly in suprabasal epidermal layers. Thus, the modulation of the CD 95 signaling pathway by the cell-intrinsic caspase- 8 inhibitor cFLIP in basal KC may explain the spatial localization of spongiosis in suprabasal epidermal layers, and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of spongiosis formation in <b>eczematous</b> <b>dermatitis...</b>|$|R
