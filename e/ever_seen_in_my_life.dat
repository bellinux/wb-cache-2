500|$|In a 2013 interview, {{the band}} {{revealed}} that they partied heavily during {{the production of}} Follow the Leader, with massive amounts of alcohol, drugs, {{and women in the}} studio. Davis explained further, saying that while recording the vocals for [...] "It's On", there were [...] "people getting blowjobs right behind me, there was girls banging each other in front of me, people getting boned in the closet right behind me, it was the craziest shit I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and I sang that song." [...] According to Davis, he only agreed to begin tracking vocals when producer Toby Wright met his demands for an eight-ball (a one-eighth ounce of cocaine).|$|E
500|$|To {{represent}} the ex-Borg colony on the planet, sets previously {{used for the}} episodes [...] "The Chute" [...] and [...] "" [...] from {{earlier in the season}} were used. This was further extended by the use of a computer generated matte painting created by freelancer Eric Chauvin. Borg sets from First Contact were not re-used, but instead a new set was built. This new set measured [...] in length curved around in a semi-circle, and McNeill was unsatisfied with this size. He said [...] "It was the smallest set that I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> We had no room on the stage to build a big Borg ship, because the other sets took up so much room." [...] He hoped that they had hidden this on camera, with it instead appearing as a series of separate corridors within the Borg vessel. McNeill explained that he had the actors walk the length of the set past the camera at the end, at which point a cut was made and they would go back {{to the start of the}} corridor to start filming again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Go away,' she cried, 'and {{leave me}} to it. It is {{beautiful}}, beautiful,' she sang in strange, rhapsodic tones. 'It {{is the most}} beautiful thing I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Don't try to come between it and me. Take yourself away, you are out of place--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He's {{the most}} ridiculous {{creature}} I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life,' she whispered. 'I wouldn't let him {{out of my sight}} for worlds.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Coach Yost {{called the}} {{unplanned}} drop-kick field goal by Cliff Sparks (pictured) [...] "the greatest individual play <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> whole career".|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning, Mr. Pratt," [...] {{the former}} said, with a strenuous attempt at cordiality. [...] "If you'll excuse my saying so, that's the finest rose I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had hardly}} spoken before there {{rushed into the}} room {{one of the most}} lovely young women that I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering {{excitement}} and concern.|$|E
6000|$|... "All I can say," [...] Mr. Bundercombe declared, {{as he drew}} {{away from}} the note, {{which he had been}} examining, [...] "is that I do not wonder you were deceived, Mr. Giatron. This note is the most perfect {{imitation}} I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> A wicked piece of work, sir!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} that as I took my {{seat in the}} boat I {{was struck by the}} man's great size. He was not tall, but {{he was one of the}} broadest men that I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> But the gondoliers of Venice are a strong breed, and powerful men are common enough among them. The fellow took his place behind me and began to row.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know I think he's a REAL galantuomo--'and no mistake.' There {{are plenty}} of sham ones about. He seems to me simply the best man I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{the most}} {{beautiful}} woman I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life," [...] he said deliberately. [...] "Titian never conceived anything more exquisite. She is a woman to paint and to worship!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Warren Buffett {{testified to}} the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission: [...] "There was the {{greatest}} bubble I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life...The entire American public eventually {{was caught up in}} a belief that housing prices could not fall dramatically." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought her," [...] he said, [...] "one of {{the most}} {{beautiful}} women I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> That is not saying very much, perhaps, but to me it meant a good deal. She was exceedingly gracious and her interest in you seemed quite real and even affectionate. I do not understand why you should wish to hide from such a woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely nothing," [...] Harcutt {{answered}} decidedly. [...] "I {{may as well}} {{repeat that}} my interest is in the man alone. I am not a sentimental person at all. His niece {{is perhaps the most}} beautiful woman I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> but it is with no thought of her that I have taken up this investigation. Having assured you of that, I {{want to know if you}} will help me?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had never}} been in the woods before, and {{everything}} was very new and exciting to me. There were squirrels and rabbits and birds, more than I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and little things that buzzed and flew and tickled my ears. I wanted to rush about and look at everything, but Peter called to me, and I came to heel. He knew where we were going, and I didn't, so I let him lead.|$|E
5000|$|Quist {{also spoke}} against {{the health care}} bill at the event. [...] "This is the most insidious, evil piece of {{legislation}} I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life… Every one of us has to be totally committed to killing this travesty… I have to kill this bill." ...|$|R
5000|$|Comparisons {{were made}} to The Godfather and that the film {{was just trying to}} cash in on its success. Bronson's opinion of Francis Ford Coppola's gangster epic, {{although}} he admired Marlon Brando's performance, was [...] "The Godfather? That was the shittiest movie I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> entire life." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{did well}} {{at the box office}} and critics were {{generally}} favorable. F. Scott Fitzgerald, however, disliked the film. He later wrote to a friend stating, [...] "Its by far the worst movie I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life-cheap, vulgar, ill-constructed and shoddy. We were utterly ashamed of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{came off}} {{by and by}} hanging on Cap'n Tarbell's arm. The cap'n was dressed up in 'is Sunday clothes, {{with one of the}} cleanest collars on I 'ave <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and smoking a cigar that smelt like an escape of gas. He came back alone at ha'past eleven that night, and 'e told me that if it wasn't for the other one down Shoremouth way he should be the 'appiest man on earth.|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Peg," [...] was {{the quick}} reply, [...] "that cuts no ice with me. It {{was sure the}} rottenest {{exhibition}} I <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> But there's excuses, {{and you can just}} gamble I'm the old boy who knows. You kids were scared to death. What hurts me, Peg, is the throw-down we got from my old team and from the students. We're not to blame for rules made by fat-head directors. I was surprised at Dale. He was mean, and so were Hollis and Hickle--all of 'em. They didn't need to disgrace us like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|But I was not alone. On the one bench of {{the down}} {{platform}} sat the largest navvy I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> softened and made affable (for he smiled generously) with liquor. In his huge hands he nursed an empty tumbler marked [...] "L.S.W.R."--marked also, internally, with streaks of blue-grey sediment. Before him, {{a hand on}} his shoulder, stood the doctor, and as I came within ear-shot, this is what I heard him say: [...] "Just you hold on to your patience {{for a minute or two}} longer, and you'll be as right as ever you were in your life. I'll stay with you till you're better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amstrad {{expanded}} to {{the marketing of}} low cost, low quality amplifiers and tuners, imported from the Far East and badged with the Amstrad name for the UK market. Their first electrical product was the Amstrad 8000 amplifier, which Sugar would describe later as [...] "the biggest load of rubbish I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|R
5000|$|Frederick Hafetz, former Chief of the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office S.D.N.Y. wrote: “I {{consider}} you to {{have the}} best killer trial skills I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> 47 years of practice, and I have worked with the best, courtroom presence, capturing the jury’s attention through devastating cross and summations that have jurors on the edge of their seats.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Sylvester (Collected Works, Vol. 3, Paper 2) {{writes that}} when he showed a model to Kelvin, he “nursed {{it as if it}} had been his own child, and when a motion was made to relieve him of it, replied ‘No! I have not had nearly enough of it—it is the most {{beautiful}} thing I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life.’” ...|$|R
60|$|I did see Mr. Parker later, but {{not quite}} so late as the time appointed. He was in the American bar at the Milan when I looked in there just before luncheon and was talking {{to two of the}} most ferocious and objectionable- looking ruffians I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> He glanced at me blandly, but without any sign of recognition, save that I fancied I caught the {{slightest}} twitch of his left eyebrow. I took the hint and did not join him. My reward came presently; for, after leaving the room with his two acquaintances, Mr. Parker strolled back again, and coming straight over to me clapped me on the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|I'm {{bound to}} say that the more I {{contemplated}} the binge, the less I liked it. It was all very well for Bingo {{to say that}} I was slated for a magnificent lunch; but what good is the best possible lunch to a fellow if he is slung out into the street on his ear during the soup course? However, the word of a Wooster is his bond and all that sort of rot, so at one-thirty next day I tottered up the steps of No. 16, Pounceby Gardens, and punched the bell. And half a minute later I was up in the drawing-room, shaking hands with the fattest man I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
60|$|The blind fell, {{and there}} was no more sunlight. I was {{conscious}} of a sudden chill. The bare room, with its stone-flagged floor, its plain deal furniture, depressed me no less than the cold, forbidding appearance of the woman who stood now motionless before me. She was paler than any woman whom I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> A living person, she seemed the personification of lifelessness. Her black hair was streaked with grey; her dress, which suggested a uniform in its severity, knew no adornment save the plain ivory cross which hung from an almost invisible chain about her neck. Her expression indicated neither curiosity nor courtesy. She simply waited. I, although as a rule I had no great difficulty in finding words, felt myself almost embarrassed.|$|E
5000|$|Viola {{grew up in}} Queens, New York, and Westbury, New York. He {{attended}} P.S. 20, in Flushing, {{where he}} was captain of the TV Squad. On vacation in the mountains with his family, he nearly drowned in a lake, an experience he describes as “… the most beautiful world I’ve <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life” and “without fear,” and “peaceful” ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{file format}} has been {{severely}} criticized by Jamie Zawinski, a former Netscape engineer. He has lambasted the ostensibly [...] "textual" [...] format {{on the grounds}} that it is [...] "not human-readable", bemoaned the impossibility of writing a correct parser for the format, and referred to it as [...] "...the single most braindamaged file format that I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> nineteen year career".|$|R
5000|$|Smith chose Queen's [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] for his semi-final song. After the performance, Levine commented, [...] "I don't {{need to say}} {{anything}} at all because that's {{one of the best things}} I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> entire life." [...] Within 30 minutes, the single was the best selling song in the iTunes Store, knocking [...] "Hello" [...] from the top spot for a second time.|$|R
60|$|I ran {{out from}} behind my curtain at that, and rushed into the other room, shaking all over with the horror of it. The old man had slipped down in the chair, and his dressing-gown had rucked up until {{he looked as if}} he had a monstrous hump to his back. His head, with the gold glasses still fixed on his nose, was lolling over upon one side, and his little mouth was open just like a dead fish. I could not see where the blood was coming from, but I could still hear it {{drumming}} upon the floor. She stood behind him with the candle shining full upon her face. Her lips were pressed together and her eyes shining, and a touch of colour had come into each of her cheeks. It just wanted that to make her the most beautiful woman I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{week later}} I was at Gex. At St. Claude I had parted from Leroux, and then hired a chaise {{to take me}} to my destination. It was a matter of fifteen {{kilometres}} by road over the frontier of the customs zone and through the most superb scenery I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> We drove through narrow gorges, on each side of which the mountain heights rose rugged and precipitous to incalculable altitudes above. From time to time only did I get peeps of almost imperceptible tracks along the declivities, tracks on which it seemed as if goats alone could obtain a footing. Once--hundreds of feet above me--I spied a couple of mules descending what seemed like a sheer perpendicular path down the mountain side. The animals appeared to be heavily laden, and I marvelled what forbidden goods lay hidden within their packs and whether in the days that were to come I too should be called upon to risk my life on those declivities {{following in the footsteps of}} the reckless and desperate criminals whom it was my duty to pursue.|$|E
60|$|He was {{the first}} person I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> who had {{understood}} me. He was not in the house three times before I knew that he accompanied every movement of my mind. In his coldly easy way with all of them, and with me, and with the whole subject, I saw it clearly. In his light protestations of admiration of my future husband, in his enthusiasm regarding our engagement and our prospects, in his hopeful congratulations on our future wealth and his despondent references to his own poverty--all equally hollow, and jesting, and full of mockery--I saw it clearly. He made me feel more and more resentful, and more and more contemptible, by always presenting to me everything that surrounded me with some new hateful light upon it, while he pretended to exhibit it in its best aspect for my admiration and his own. He was like the dressed-up Death in the Dutch series; whatever figure he took upon his arm, whether it was youth or age, beauty or ugliness, whether he danced with it, sang with it, played with it, or prayed with it, he made it ghastly.|$|E
6000|$|Sir ANTHONY [Coming forward.] What's {{going on}} here?--So {{you have been}} quarrelling too, I warrant! Come, Julia, I never {{interfered}} before; but {{let me have a}} hand in the matter at last.--All the faults I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> friend Faulkland seemed to proceed from what he calls the delicacy and warmth of his affection for you--There, marry him directly, Julia; you'll find he'll mend surprisingly! ...|$|R
2500|$|Cowell told Walsh: [...] "You {{are going}} to have to fire at least three of them. They have great voices, but they are the ugliest band I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] Three members of the band (Lacey, Keighron and Garrett) were told they would not be part of the new group, and auditions were held in Dublin where Nicky Byrne and Brian McFadden were recruited.|$|R
5000|$|... "They were a cunning lot the Angry Brigade, well {{wrapped up}} in that anarchist movement. They were belligerent and very [...] "anti" [...] {{and there was no}} sense that they were sorry for what they had done. Right from the start, there were {{allegations}} that we'd policeplanted this and planted that. It was the most disgraceful trial I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> experience." [...] Bond, quoted in The Guardian ...|$|R
