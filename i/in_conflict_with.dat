5|$|Because of {{its large}} {{financial}} power, the Kingdom of Hungary quickly rebuilt its army and found itself <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> the Holy Roman Empire in 1337.

5|$|Offa was {{frequently}} <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> the various Welsh kingdoms. There was {{a battle between}} the Mercians and the Welsh at Hereford in 760, and Offa is recorded as campaigning against the Welsh in 778, 784 and 796 in the 10th century Annales Cambriae.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} installments, which were set {{primarily in the}} town of Silent Hill, this game is set in the fictional town of South Ashfield, and follows Henry Townshend as he attempts to escape from his locked-down apartment. During the course of the game, Henry explores a series of supernatural worlds and finds himself <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> an undead serial killer.|$|E
5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} {{complaints}} between bishop and trustees were resolved, some salary disputes lingered into 1813. The conditions at St. Mary's worsened in 1814 {{with the election}} of new trustees who were more <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> Egan than the previous ones. Elsewhere in the diocese, Egan was more successful. In about 1811, he made his most extensive visitation of his diocese, travelling as far west as Pittsburgh after stopping in Lancaster and Conewago. He continued to raise funds for the Catholic orphanage and opened a new parish, Sacred Heart, in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1813, bringing the total number of churches in the diocese to sixteen.|$|E

5|$|As {{animals at}} {{the summit of the}} food chain, bears do not have many predators. The most {{important}} are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> the bears that raided them. Since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease. The tiger is the only four-legged predator that regularly preys on adult bears, including brown bears, sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, and sun bears.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{geographic}} isolation of their homeland, the Hupa had few interactions with early European explorers, although they later came <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> miners looking for gold. Even after California became a US state in 1850, the Hupa {{continued to live}} on their traditional lands and were eventually granted a reservation here in 1876. They are the only Native American group in California to retain most of their original territory; today, the Hoopa Valley Reservation is {{the largest and most}} populous in the state.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his having}} overtly {{undermined}} the king, Armansperg was dismissed from his duties by King Otto immediately {{upon his return}} from Germany. However, despite high hopes {{on the part of}} the Greeks, the Bavarian Rudhart was appointed chief minister, and the granting of a constitution was again postponed. The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example, by the suggested acquisition of Crete in 1841, failed in their objective, and only succeeded in embroiling him <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> the Great Powers.|$|E

5|$|Eardwulf {{was evidently}} married {{before he became}} king, as Alcuin reproached him for abandoning his wife for a {{concubine}} soon after his coronation. This strained relations with the new Archbishop Eanbald II—Eanbald I {{had died in the}} year of Eardwulf's coronation. Alcuin, while condemning secular oppression of the church, affected surprise that while the Archbishop Eanbald was travelling he was accompanied by a large retinue, including soldiers, and that he received and protected the king's enemies. Eanbald was presumably <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> Eardwulf over property, but it is likely that he also supported rivals for Eardwulf's throne.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 17th century, England was embroiled <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> {{commercial}} rival Holland {{through the}} Anglo-Dutch Wars. Rupert became closely involved in these as a senior Admiral to King Charles II, rising to command the Royal Navy {{by the end of}} his career. Although several famous admirals of the day had previously been army commanders, including Blake and Monk, they had commanded relatively small land forces and Rupert was still relatively unusual for the period in having both practical experience of commanding large land armies and having extensive naval experience from his campaigns in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|In 1002 King Æthelred the Unready married Emma of Normandy, {{the sister}} of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. Their son Edward the Confessor, who spent many years in exile in Normandy, succeeded to the English throne in 1042. This led to the {{establishment}} of a powerful Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Childless and embroiled <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> the formidable Godwin, Earl of Wessex and his sons, Edward may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy's ambitions for the English throne.|$|E

When Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would find himself in the minority, and forced to follow their decisions. However, Podgorny was pleased about his position within the leadership, and even more pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet. As head of state, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 had called {{for the expansion of}} Party activities in the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|Montejo the Elder became {{embroiled in}} colonial infighting {{over the right}} to rule Honduras, a claim that put him <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> Pedro de Alvarado, captain general of Guatemala, who also claimed Honduras {{as part of his}} jurisdiction.

In Montejo the Elder's absence, first in central Mexico, and then in Honduras, Montejo the Younger acted as lieutenant governor and captain general in Tabasco.|$|E
5|$|Neil Brooks (born 27 July 1962) is an Australian former sprint {{freestyle}} swimmer {{best known}} for winning the 4100m medley relay at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow {{as part of the}} Quietly Confident Quartet. Brooks was as much known for his swimming achievements as he was for disciplinary incidents. He often found himself <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> officialdom and threatened with sanctions. His international career ended when he was suspended for drinking 46 cans of beer on the return flight to Australia after the 1986 Commonwealth Games. In retirement, he became a news presenter and sports commentator, but was fired amid alcohol problems.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic Plateau was claimed for Norway by Roald Amundsen as the King Haakon VII Plateau {{when his}} {{expedition}} {{was the first}} to reach South Pole on 14 December 1911. It was mapped as a circular territory comprising the plateau around the South Pole, including all the land above latitude 85°S. However, roughly the same area had been claimed by the British as the King Edward VII Plateau, which was <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> the Norwegian claim. Amundsen's claim has never been officially claimed by the Norwegian government.|$|E
5|$|The {{denomination}} {{with the}} longest history of objection to Freemasonry is the Catholic Church. The objections {{raised by the}} Catholic Church {{are based on the}} allegation that Masonry teaches a naturalistic deistic religion which is <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> Church doctrine. A number of Papal pronouncements have been issued against Freemasonry. The first was Pope Clement XII's In eminenti apostolatus, 28 April 1738; the most recent was Pope Leo XIII's Ab apostolici, 15 October 1890. The 1917 Code of Canon Law explicitly declared that joining Freemasonry entailed automatic excommunication, and banned books favouring Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{is considered}} to be very aggressive and has frequently been reported as charging and attacking boats. Small boats can be capsized by hippos and passengers can be injured or killed by the animals or drown. In one case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed. As hippopotamuses will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may also come <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.|$|E
