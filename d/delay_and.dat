5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E

Two years later, the ship was assigned to the Pacific Station until she was ordered home in 1883. Thetis was paid off after her arrival and was sold in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E
30|$|However, the {{differences}} between <b>delayed</b> cosine <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> sine <b>and</b> cosine and sine are that the <b>delayed</b> cosine <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> sine appear in the interval segment [-τ, 0] and with the increasing of variables t, {{the upper and lower}} bounds of <b>delayed</b> cosine <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> sine are also increasing. When the delay τ= 0, by (3) <b>and</b> (4), the <b>delayed</b> cosine <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> sine coincide with the cosine and sine functions.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the <b>delays</b> <b>and</b> amplitudes {{of a positive}} stream of pulses appears in many applications, such as single-molecule microscopy. This paper suggests estimating the <b>delays</b> <b>and</b> amplitudes using a convex program, which is robust {{in the presence of}} noise (or model mismatch). Particularly, the recovery error is proportional to the noise level. We further show that the error grows exponentially with the density of the <b>delays</b> <b>and</b> also depends on the localization properties of the pulse...|$|R
5|$|Damage to the {{crossing}} {{resulted in the}} closure of the QEW until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what was becoming a major <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. To provide better access to the new structure as well as the proposed Chedoke Expressway, construction began on the Freeman Diversion, bypassing the old trumpet interchange and creating a new three-level stack. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.|$|E
5|$|In early 1965, Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon {{wrote to}} President Lyndon Johnson, {{opposing}} the dollar and {{pointing out that}} the coins would be unlikely to circulate in Montana or anywhere else; they would simply be hoarded. Nevertheless, Dillon concluded that as Senator Mansfield insisted, the coins would have to be struck. Dillon resigned on April 1; his successor, Henry H. Fowler, was immediately questioned by Mansfield about the dollars, and he assured the senator that things would be worked out to his satisfaction. Mint Director Eva Adams hoped to avoid striking the silver dollars, but wanted to keep the $600,000 appropriated for that expense. Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> on May 12, 1965, the Denver Mint began trial strikes of the 1964-D Peace dollar—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.|$|E
5|$|The German advance never {{recovered}} from its initial <b>delay,</b> <b>and</b> Kampfgruppe Peiper only {{got as far}} as Stoumont, where the remaining vehicles ran out of fuel and came under heavy attack from American aircraft, artillery, and tanks. Having advanced less than half-way to the River Meuse, they were forced to abandon more than a hundred vehicles in the town, including six Tiger II tanks. The soldiers were ordered to find their way east on foot. Having started the offensive with about 5,800 men, 60 tanks (including 30 Tiger IIs), 3 flak tanks, 75 half-tracks, 14 20mm Flak Wagons, 27 75mm assault guns, plus 105 and 150mm SP Howitzers, Hitler's prized Kampfgruppe was reduced to 800 S.S. troopers creeping through the brush at night, trying to get back to their own line.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of modeling and output feedback controller design for a class of discrete-time networked control systems (NCSs) with time <b>delays</b> <b>and</b> packet dropouts. A Markovian jumping method is proposed to deal with random time <b>delays</b> <b>and</b> packet dropouts. Different from the previous studies on the issue, the characteristics of networked communication <b>delays</b> <b>and</b> packet dropouts can be truly reflected by the unified model; namely, both sensor-to-controller (S-C) and controller-to-actuator (C-A) time <b>delays,</b> <b>and</b> packet dropouts are modeled and their history behavior is described by multiple Markov chains. The resulting closed-loop system is described by a new Markovian jump linear system (MJLS) with Markov delays model. Based on Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, sufficient conditions of the stochastic stability and output feedback controller design method for NCSs with random time <b>delays</b> <b>and</b> packet dropouts are presented. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

5|$|The {{crossing}} of the Meuse enabled the Germans {{to break into the}} strategic depths, or undefended rear, of the Allied front and to advance to the English Channel without significant opposition. The French attempted to launch counter-attacks against the German-held bridgeheads, from 15–17 May, but the offensives fell victim to <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> confusion. Five days after consolidating their bridgeheads at Sedan, on 20 May, the German Army reached the Channel. The victory at Sedan achieved the operational goal of Fall Gelb and encircled the strongest Allied armies, including the British Expeditionary Force. The resulting battles destroyed the remaining French army as an effective fighting force, and expelled the British Army from the continent, leading to the defeat of France in June 1940. The battle at Sedan was instrumental in the fall of France.|$|E

25|$|The {{plaintiff}} in that suit, Robert Blankenship, charged that <b>DeLay</b> <b>and</b> a third partner in Albo Pest Control had breached the partnership agreement {{by trying to}} force {{him out of the}} business without buying him out. Blankenship filed suit, charging <b>DeLay</b> <b>and</b> the other partner with breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, wrongful termination, and loss of corporate expectancy. While being deposed in that suit, DeLay claimed that he did not think that he was an officer or director of Albo and that he believed that he had resigned two or three years previously. However, his congressional disclosure forms, including one filed subsequent to the deposition, stated that he was either president or chairman of the company between 1985 and 1994. Blankenship also alleged that Albo money had been spent on DeLay's congressional campaigns, in violation of federal and state law. <b>DeLay</b> <b>and</b> Blankenship settled for an undisclosed sum.
