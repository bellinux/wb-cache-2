The author suggests a solution that allows for compensation of plaintiffs and deterrence of officers. Under the proposed solution, judges should always allow compensation for plaintiffs but should consider the officer 2 ̆ 7 s prior history of misconduct, the disciplinary measures taken against such misconduct, and the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s ability to pay in determining the portion the city should indemnify. The author also proposes that the indemnification scheme should apply {{regardless of whether the}} officer acted within his scope of employment...|$|R

Systems of {{adaptive}} suppression of acoustical signal {{it is possible}} to make an effort apply for defence of acoustic information in an apartment. Thus within the limits of guard zone by means of the compensative acoustic systems an area, outside that sound-level either is absent, relaxes either considerably, is created or distorted to the illegible state. Therefore there is of interest research of spatial distribution of the field of sound-wave from information and acoustic systems <b>of</b> <b>indemnification</b> <b>of</b> the field of wave generators.

For all considered frequencies in the center of distribution <b>of</b> power <b>of</b> <b>indemnification</b> <b>of</b> radiations there is an area with the low enough level of radiation, surrounded by higher peak constituents, that gives an opportunity of the use of this zone for a conduct, for example, of the protected negotiations. Such system can appear most effective and simple in technical realization on a priv on condition of creation of spherical wave both from an information(man) generator and compensative acoustic system. As for creation of the system of protecting from a loss on an acoustic channel at distribution of flat discontinuous and flat undamped waves, then drawn conclusion, that for this situation, when 2 sources of informative signal and 2 acoustic repressing systems are, realization of defence is impossible. In this case it is necessary to suppose that for defence it is necessary to use the greater amount of the acoustic systems with certain amplitude, located on certain distance. ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ????????? ??? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ?????????. ??? ???? ? ???????? ???????? ???? ? ??????? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ???????, ?? ????????? ??????? ??????? ????? ???? ???????????, ???? ??????????? ???????????, ???? ?????????? ?? ?????????????? ?????????. ??????? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ????????????????? ????????????? ???? ???????? ????? ?? ?????????? ?????????? ? ???????????? ?????? ??????????? ???? ?????. ??? ?????????? ???????????? ???? ?????????????? ??????????-?????????????? ?????
