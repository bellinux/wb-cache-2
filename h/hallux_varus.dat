40|$|<b>Hallux</b> <b>varus</b> was {{observed}} in 69 feet among patients from a rural Indian population. This included three types of congenital <b>hallux</b> <b>varus.</b> The congenital "primary " type was the commonest and {{was not associated with}} any other foot deformity. Among the acquired forms was idi-opathic <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> of middle age, which developed spon-taneously in unshod persons and progressed gradually. <b>Hallux</b> <b>varus</b> following chronic arthritis was part of a con-sistent pattern of foot deformities in which the first ray collapsed in a zig-zag manner in two planes. Although the development of <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> is often due to intrinsic muscle imbalance, <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> secondary to chronic arthritis seems to occur as a result of both intrinsic and extrinsic muscle imbalance associated with midtarsal and subtalar arthritis.

30|$|<b>Hallux</b> <b>varus</b> {{complication}} following {{surgery is}} most frequently observed after {{use of the}} McBride procedure. Although in previous studies <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> complication ratios of 2 / 39 [5], 6 / 72 [8], 3 / 39 [17], and 13 / 109 [23] were reported, we saw only one in 36 cases. Two different types of postoperative <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> complications have been defined [30]: The static type, which most frequently occurs after methods {{such as those of}} Keller-Brandes, Mayo, and Hohmann, is due to overexcision of bunions or joint laxity. The dynamic type is observed after DSTP and is due to muscle imbalance. McBride concluded that angles up to 24 ° are tolerable, whereas larger values require revision. Coughlin and Mann [1] reported <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> complication rates of 11 %, which led them to cease lateral sesamoidectomy. They stated that <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> is mainly due to muscle imbalance, which causes dislocation of the lateral sesamoid.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. <b>Hallux</b> <b>varus</b> is a {{relatively}} rare foot deformity. Commonly, <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> is a complication after the hallux valgus surgery and typically {{is the result of}} the first metatarsal medial eminence over resection, first and second metatarsal excessive convergence, over release of the lateral soft tissues, overtightening of the medial soft tissues and soft tissue imbalance of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The purpose of this study was to clarify the causes and timing of the iatrogenic <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> formation and to evaluate the possibility and efficiency of percutaneous techniques in its surgical treatment. Material and methods. Thirty-one feet (31 females suffering from iatrogenic <b>hallux</b> <b>varus)</b> were examined clinically and radiologically, including 14 patients who underwent surgery. The average age of the whole group was 57 years (range, 39 to 74), the subgroup of operated patients — 60 years (range from 53 to 68). The time after primary interventions before the examination varied from 2 to 44 years. The mean follow-up after surgery was 6 months (range from 1. 5 to 54). Results. No infection or wound-healing issues were observed. Overall, the patients were completely satisfied with the outcomes of 12 surgeries and satisfied with reservation in 2 cases. Conclusions. The visual manifestations of <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> are determined not only by the <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> angle, but also by the value of the first intermetatarsal angle. In addition to well-known factors, <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> formation is determined by first metatarsal bone elongation and first metatarsophalangeal joint instability. In rare cases, only one of the factors leads to the hallux varus; as a rule, we see a combination of factors with their mutual reinforcement. Despite the demonstration of usage possibility and the efficiency of percutaneous techniques in <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> correcting, a small number of observations in the study does not yet allow giving recommendations on the use of specific percutaneous techniques depending on the various clinical manifestations of <b>hallux</b> <b>varus...</b>|$|E
30|$|However, {{since it}} is only a soft tissue procedure, there are no {{complications}} related to bone in DSTPs. In the literature, <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> is the most common complication of the DSTPs [9, 14, 20]. Mann and Coughlin reported the incidence of <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> as 11 %, though it was severe in four cases [14]. In another report, Mann and Pfeffinger noted that <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> was due to the attempt of correction of severe deformities [20]. In our study, there was one case (3 %) who sustained from <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> postoperatively. In the course of treatment, the radiological measurements of that case were found as follows: HVA from 34 ° to − 5 ° and IMA from 17 ° to 6 °. This mild degree of varus angulation did not bother the patient with minimal pain and discomfort. Therefore, no further surgery was required.|$|E
40|$|Two {{case reports}} are {{presented}} of spontaneous <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> developing late in life. The first patient had long-standing poliomyelitis involving the foot, {{while the second}} patient had bilateral congenital absence of the lateral sesamoids. In the second patient the <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> was bilateral. The probable etiological relationship of these underlying disorders {{to the development of}} the sponta-neous <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> is discussed. The purpose of this paper is to report two very rare cases of spontaneous <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> occurring in late adulthood. The first case, which was unilateral, oc-curred at the age of 72 years. The patient had a history of childhood poliomyelitis involving this ex-tremity. The second patient developed bilateral <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> at the age of 59 years. X-rays revealed bilateral congenital absence of the fibular sesamoids. CASE 1 The patient, a 74 -year-old female, complained of pain and stiffness of her left ankle. She also noted a painless left sided <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> deformity developing 2 years ago. The patient is a diabetic. She gave a history of contracting poliomyelitis in childhood. Two operations were performed, one, a heel cord lenthen-ing, 52 years ago, for an equinus deformity and the second, a triple arthrodesis, performed 50 years ago. Physical examination revealed severe valgus of her left foot with evidence of a triple arthrodesis. There was hammering of the second through the fifth toes and a painfully stiff ankle. There was a severe, but flexible, <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> (Fig. 1 A). The right foot was splayed associated with a bunion, hallux valgus, and metatarsus primus varus deformities.

40|$|Congenital <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> {{is a rare}} {{condition}} in which the great toe is angled medially at the metatarsophalangeal joint. The varus deformity of the toe can vary in severity from only a few degrees {{to as much as}} 90 °. The cleft be-tween the great and second toe is usually larger than nor-mal. 1) Potential causes of the congenital <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> are multifactorial, including: thickened medial cords, medial slopes to the first metatarsocuneiform joints, first metatar-sal longitudinal epiphyseal bracket (LEB; delta phalanx), shortened block first metatarsals, space occupying extra metatarsals with the first web spaces and ineffective ab-ductor halluces and adductor hallucis insertions. 1 - 7) Surgical correction is generally recommended for Background: The {{purpose of this study was}} to report outcomes of congenital <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> deformity after surgical treatment.

40|$|Iatrogenic <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> is a {{possible}} complication of hallux valgus surgery following Mc Bride or Scarf osteotomy, with or without Akin osteotomy of the first phalanx. It may also occur following chevron osteotomy or Keller’s procedure. One possibility for surgical revision of iatrogenic <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> is recon-struction of the lateral stabilising soft-tissue compo-nents of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Until now, only dynamic tendon transfers, possibly com-bined with interphalangeal fusion, have been described. The aim of our study {{was to develop a}} static, anatomic reconstruction procedure. A new surgical technique of ligamentoplasty using the abductor hallucis tendon is described. The new method was applied in 7 feet (5 patients) with a mean follow-up over two years. <b>Hallux</b> <b>varus</b> deformities were operated by transplantation of the abductor hallucis tendon. Subsequent radiographs showed correction of most of the factors considered to be responsible for the iatrogenic deformity. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux metatarsophalangeal-interpha-langeal (MTP-IP) score improved from 61 to 88.

30|$|<b>Hallux</b> <b>varus,</b> syndactaly and {{conjoint}} delta first metatarsals are {{the most}} common toe deformities associated with FH that benefit from surgical treatment of the toes. Syndactaly of the first to second toes is easily treated by release and skin grafting. Syndactaly between the middle toes {{does not need to be}} separated. <b>Hallux</b> <b>varus</b> is always associated with a short bracket (delta) first metatarsal. In most cases this is a conjoint metatarsal (fusion of first and second metatarsal) associated with syndactaly of the first and second toes. The treatment for this requires separation of the syndactaly combined with splitting of the conjoint metatarsal into two parts and reorienting of this osteotomy to realign the first metatarso-phalangeal joint surface.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Hallux</b> <b>varus</b> {{deformity}} is not fre-quent, {{is usually}} acquired, and is poorly tolerated by patients.

40|$|Sixteen {{patients}} with duplication of the hallux were re-viewed. Follow-up averaged 21 years. Duplication may be classified into three groups: simple hallucal duplication, a transitional type {{with a short}} thick first metatarsal, and complete first ray duplication. Routine removal of the most medial hallux or ray is to be avoided. Careful preoperative assessment is necessary to compare hallucal function, cosmesis, and metatarsal weightbearing. Surgery should also correct the associated congenital <b>hallux</b> <b>varus.</b> Sur-gical complications include functionless hallucis from in-appropriate selection and medial soft tissue contractures with either recurrence of the <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> or the gradual development of a <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> interphalangeus. Duplication of the hallux is a relatively rare congenital deformity about which there is limited information.

30|$|Based on the {{criteria}} described by Bonney and Macnab there were 24 excellent (77 %), 3 good (10 %), 3 fair (10 %) and 1 poor (3 %) results. The poor result {{was due to}} <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> development as HVA of (− 5 °) postoperatively. Because of the patient’s no major complaint, {{there was no need}} to perform salvage surgery. Three fair results were due to recurrence of deformity who had HVAs greater than 30 º preoperatively. There were 2 (6 %) superficial infections detected at the early postoperative period treated by meticulous wound care and oral antibiotics. Twentysix cases (84 %) reported no obvious pain and the others (16 %) were occasionally while standing.|$|E
30|$|Beyond the {{hindfoot}} deformities {{there can}} be deformities of the midfoot. When midfoot deformity is present it is most commonly abductus and rockerbottom. Most midfoot deformities are most commonly related to coalition between the cuboid and calcaneus. Talo-navicular joint coalition can also be present. One or more rays may be missing, making the foot narrower. Absence or weakness of the peroneus longus may lead to overpull of the tibialis anterior and elevation of the first metatarsal with compensatory flexion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (dorsal bunion). A bracket first metatarsal or a bracket conjoined first and second metatarsal with <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> is not uncommon. Syndactaly between {{some or all of}} the toes is also common.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Cochrane {{review of}} hallux valgus surgery has disputed the {{scientific}} validity of hallux valgus research. Scoring systems and surrogate {{measures such as}} x-ray angles are commonly reported at just one year post operatively but these are of dubious relevance to the patient. In this study we extended the follow up to a minimum of 8 years and sought to address patient specific concerns with hallux valgus surgery. The long term follow up also allowed {{a comprehensive review of}} the complications associated with the combined rotation scarf and Akin osteotomies. Methods Between 1996 and 1999, 101 patients underwent rotation scarf and Akin osteotomies for the treatment of hallux valgus. All patients were contacted and asked to participate in this study. 50 female participants were available allowing review of 73 procedures. The average follow up was over 9 years and the average age at the time of surgery was 57. The participants were physically examined and interviewed. Results Post-operatively, in 86 % of the participants there were no footwear restrictions. Stiffness of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was reported in 8 % (6 feet); 10 % were unhappy with the cosmetic appearance of their feet, 3 feet had <b>hallux</b> <b>varus,</b> and 2 feet had recurrent hallux valgus. There were no foot-related activity restrictions in 92 % of the group. Metatarsalgia occurred in 4 % (3 feet). 96 % were better than before surgery and 88 % were completely satisfied with their post-operative result. <b>Hallux</b> <b>varus</b> was the greatest single cause of dissatisfaction. The most common adverse event in the study was internal fixation irritation. Hallux valgus surgery is not without risk and these findings could be useful in the informed consent process.

The most common deformity is represented by congenital clubfoot (14. 7 %), syndactyly (14. 50 %), brachydactyly (11 %); follow the congenital flat foot (8. 75 %), Polydactyly (6. 25 %) and oligoectrodactyly (4. 50 %); unusual finding of congenital metatarsus varus (3. 75 %), congenital hallux valgus (2. 00 %) and hammer toe (2 %); rare congenital talipes (1. 75 %), congenital hollow foot (1. 25 %) and congenital <b>hallux</b> <b>varus</b> (1. 25 %); very rare macrodactily (0. 75 %) and clinodactyly of the fifth finger (0. 75 %). The majority of diseases that are {{the basis of the}} deformities of the foot above are of genetic origin; they recognize an autosomal recessive trans 4 ission in the 41. 12 % and dominant in the 31. 67 %; a dominant X-linked transmission in 4. 72 % and recessive X-linked in 1. 45 %; finally, they are transmitted in different ways with both dominant and recessive in the 7. 88 % of cases; forms of genetic origin are therefore 86. 84 % of all cases. 7 % is represented by chromosome aberrations and the remaining by embryo-fetopathy or disease of unknown etiology...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUNDS: Residual {{deformities}} of operatively treated severe clubfeet evaluated radiographically {{have been}} rarely studied {{in detail in}} adults. METHODS: Twenty-five operatively treated stiff clubfeet were analyzed at {{a mean age of}} 21 years and 6 months. The clinical evaluation used the Laaveg and Ponseti scale for clubfeet. Radiographic assessment was done with weightbearing and dynamic views. RESULTS: Clinical evaluation was globally good except for motion (poor). Radiographic assessment showed residual abnormalities in all feet. The distal tibial epiphysis showed slanting of its posterior part in seven feet (28 %) and notching of its anterior lip in 13 (52 %). Talar length, calcaneal length, and talar trochlear height were significantly smaller in clubfeet compared to normal feet. Undercorrection of hindfoot varus, was found in 19 feet (76 %) but was well tolerated. Navicular wedging was present in seven (28 %), and cavus deformity was found in seven (28 %). Dorsal bunion, <b>hallux</b> <b>varus,</b> and skewfoot were found in four (16 %), two (8 %), and three (12 %), respectively. The dynamic views demonstrated a significant decrease in the foot and ankle mobility with compensation mechanisms such as anterior talar incongruence or midfoot hypermobility. CONCLUSION: Severe clubfeet never become normal at adult age either clinically or radiographically. Multiple radiographic deformities exist. Their etiology and possible prevention are discussed. Despite the numerous abnormalities, clinical results were good at skeletal maturity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionFirst-ray metatarsophalangeal {{arthrodesis}} is {{a classic}} surgical procedure {{in the treatment of}} severe hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, revision surgery, and inflammatory arthritis. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify if metatarsophalangeal plate arthrodesis could correct the M 1 M 2 intermetatarsal angle. Material and methodsThis prospective and continuous series (June 2007 to March 2011) included 208 patients (48 % severe and/or arthritic hallux valgus, 18 % hallux rigidus, 16 % rheumatoid forefoot, 13 % surgical revision of the first ray, 5 % <b>hallux</b> <b>varus),</b> with a mean age of 62. 4 ± 9. 9  years (range, 19 – 87  years). All the patients were operated on by a senior surgeon with the same technique: spherical avivement of the joint surfaces using reamers, osteosynthesis with an anatomic plate (Fyxis-Biotech™) in Ti. 6 Al. 4 V alloy prebent to 5 ° with a phalangeal arm to receive an oblique metatarsophalangeal screw in compression, in addition to four 2. 7 -mm nonlocking dorsal screws. The full-scale preoperative and intraoperative angle measurements were taken on AP and lateral X-rays of the weightbearing foot, as related to the etiology and the severity of the preoperative metatarsus varus (M 1 M 2 10 ° in only two patients (one case of rheumatoid arthritis and one case of severe hallux valgus) : 0. 9 %. DiscussionThese results show that isolated metatarsophalangeal arthrodesis of the first ray can correct metatarsus varus even in substantial deformations in any etiology.

40|$|Background: In a {{continuous}} series of 54 MTP- 1 arthrodeses using ball and cup reamers, fusion and great toe position were analyzed. Materials and methods: The population was mainly female (46 versus 8). Mean age at operation was 61 years. Arthrodesis was for four conditions of symptomatic degenerative disease: 36 severe hallux valgus (> 358), 7 recurrences of hallux valgus, 9 hallux rigidus and 2 <b>hallux</b> <b>varus.</b> Arthrodesis used a medial approach, articular surface preparation by ball and cup reamers (plus perforation by Kirschner wire), and osteosynthesis with three titanium staples. Pre- and postoperative big toe positions were analysed with the FootlogTM semi-automated X-ray assessment software. Results: All patients were followed {{up for a}} mean 38. 6 months (22 - 56). Overall fusion rate was 94. 4 %, and 99 % for primary arthrodesis. Mean time to union was 56 days (74 % in 6 weeks), with 3 non-unions (5. 6 %), including 2 after hallux valgus recurrence. Mean pre-operative toe valgus was 408 and 14. 18 at revision for all groups. 95 % of arthrodeses fused at a mean lateral metatarsophalangeal angle of 22. 6 (18 - 268). Metatarsus varus exceeded 208 in 8 cases, mainly in the severe hallux valgus group; at revision, the mean first intermetatarsal angle was 10. 68 (9 - 128). Conclusion: Arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint with ball and cup reamers is a reliable and reproducible technique, giving total correction of big toe valgus. The first intermetatarsal angle was corrected without supplementary osteotomy. Using three pure titanium staples for fixation, rate and time of fusion were in line with reference techniques...|$|E
