50|$|The notothenioids lack a swimbladder, and the {{majority}} of species are therefore benthic or demersal in nature. However, a <b>depth-related</b> diversification has given rise to some species attaining increased buoyancy, using lipid deposits in tissues and reduced ossification of bony structures. Reduced ossification of the skeleton in the notothenioids changes their weight and henceforth has created neutral buoyancy in the water, where the notothenioid neither sinks nor floats, and can thus adjust depth with ease.|$|E
50|$|They {{are largely}} {{found in the}} Southern Ocean and {{off the coast of}} Antarctica. As the {{dominant}} Antarctic fish taxa, they occupy both sea-bottom and water-column ecological niches. Although lacking a gas bladder, they have undergone a <b>depth-related</b> diversification, such as increased fatty tissues and reduced mineralization of the bones, resulting in a body density approaching neutral, to fill a variety of niches. The spleen may be used to remove ice crystals from circulating blood. As the chilly subantarctic waters averages -1 to 4°C, most Antarctic species have antifreeze glycoproteins in their blood and other body fluids.|$|E
50|$|When active, juveniles feed {{primarily}} on zooplankton such as mysid shrimp, euphausiids, mesopelagic and benthopelagic fish, amphipods, and other crustaceans; mature adults consume smaller fish, predominantly of the Chaetodontidae and Myctophidae families, and squid {{which make up}} to 20% of their diet. The diet of the orange roughy is <b>depth-related,</b> with adult diets inversely related to that of juveniles. For example, juvenile consumption of crustaceans is lowest at 900 m but increases with depth while crustaceans in the adult diet peaks at 800 - 1000 m and decreases with depth. The consumption of fish is the opposite, juvenile consumption decreases with depth while adult consumption increases. This inverse feeding pattern may {{be an example of}} resource-partitioning to avoid intraspecific competition for the available food at depths where prey is less abundant. The orange roughy's metabolic phases are thought to be related to seasonal variations in prey concentrations. The inactive phase conserves energy during lean periods. Orange roughy can live up to 149 years.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{driven by}} {{advances}} in experimental technique (such as neutron diffraction) and available computational power, {{the latter of}} which has enabled extremely accurate atomic-scale simulations of the behaviour of crystals, the science has branched out to consider more general problems {{in the fields of}} inorganic chemistry and solid-state physics. It, however, retains a focus on the crystal structures commonly encountered in rock-forming minerals (such as the perovskites, clay minerals and framework silicates). In particular, the field has made great advances in the understanding {{of the relationship between the}} atomic-scale structure of minerals and their function; in nature, prominent examples would be accurate measurement and prediction of the elastic properties of minerals, which has led to new insight into seismological behaviour of rocks and <b>depth-related</b> discontinuities in seismograms of the Earth's mantle.

40|$|CSIRO 2007 It is {{remarkable}} {{that although the}} importance of depth is firmly rooted in the discipline of marine ecology, so little is understood about <b>depth-related</b> patterns of invertebrates in kelp forests, particularly in temperate Australia.

There was a greater abundance and richness of common taxa in holdfasts from shallow relative to deep waters. Strikingly, a disproportionately large percentage (60 %) of species was unique to holdfasts from shallow reefs, suggesting that shallow environments create conditions that facilitate a rich biodiversity of invertebrate fauna. We conclude that <b>depth-related</b> variation in kelp forests may not be completely idiosyncratic, and coherent research programs of a broader scale and scope may unify subsets of fragmented knowledge that previously provided little insight into general <b>depth-related</b> patterns of invertebrate assemblages.

As {{part of the}} ANT-XXIX/ 3 cruise of RV Polarstern, trophic plasticity of sea urchins was studied in three neighbouring regions (Drake Passage, Bransfield Strait and Weddell Sea) featuring several <b>depth-related</b> habitats offering different trophic environments to benthic consumers. Three families with contrasting feeding habits (Cidaridae, Echinidae and Schizasteridae) were studied. Gut content examination and stable isotopes ratios of C and N suggest {{that each of the}} studied families showed a different response to variation in environmental and food conditions. Schizasteridae trophic plasticity was low, and these sea urchins were bulk sediment feeders relying on sediment-associated organic matter in all regions and/or <b>depth-related</b> habitats. Cidaridae consumed the most animal-derived material. Their diet varied according to the considered area, as sea urchins from Bransfield Strait relied mostly on living and/or dead animal material, while specimens from Weddell Sea fed on a mixture of dead animal material and other detritus. Echinidae also showed important trophic plasticity. They fed on various detrital items in Bransfield Strait, and selectivity of ingested material varied across <b>depth-related</b> habitats. In Weddell Sea, stable isotopes revealed that they mostly relied on highly 13 C-enriched food items, presumably microbially reworked benthic detritus.

Our study revealed: (1) DNA and RNA datasets showed significant differences in microbial eukaryote community composition, with the variability between the two datasets for the same sample exceeding that between samples within each dataset, indicating that nucleic acid source overrode environmental factors in determining the composition of microeukaryotes; (2) despite the differences in community composition between the two datasets, both DNA and RNA revealed similar <b>depth-related</b> distribution patterns of microbial eukaryotes; (3) using the ratio of RNA: DNA as a proxy of relative metabolic activity, a <b>depth-related</b> pattern was found for the relative metabolic activity of some but not all groups of microbial eukaryotes, with the highest activity for the groups with <b>depth-related</b> pattern usually found in the middle water layers; and (4) the presence of live and active photoautotrophic microbial eukaryotes in the deep ocean was confirmed, indicating that they {{play an important role in}} controlling the deep-sea organic carbon pool.

40|$|Elemental and isotopic {{compositions}} {{of organic}} matter in surficial sediments from five transects across Lagoa do Caco (Brazil) were analyzed to identify the <b>depth-related</b> processes that affect the production and deposition of sedimentary organic matter in this shallow tropical lake. Each of four transverse transects began at a margin dominated by aquatic macrophytes (Eleocharis), crossed the central deep part of the lake, and terminated in the opposite, macrophyte-dominated margin. In each transect, TOC concentrations, C/N ratios, and delta C- 13 values decreased between 0 and 4 m, whereas delta N- 15 values increased. The variables remained stable in sediment from 4 m water depth {{to the center of}} the lake at 10 m. The <b>depth-related</b> patterns reflect differences in both the delivery and the deposition {{of organic matter}} in the lake. Organic matter is produced in abundance in the marginal area by emersed and submerged macrophyte vegetation that diminishes with depth and disappears at 4 meters. After the disappearance of macrophytes, organic matter is produced at low rates principally by open-lake phytoplankton. Drawdown of dissolved oxygen is high in the lake margins, but it is low in the oligotrophic open waters of the lake. Preservation of organic matter is consequently better in sediments of the lake margins than in deep waters. The <b>depth-related</b> pattern of organic matter delivery and deposition in the sediments of Lagoa do Caco, in which water levels are sensitive to groundwater fluctuations, shows that the elemental and isotopic compositions of sediment organic matter can provide a record of changes in the paleohydrology of this and other similar shallow lake systems...|$|E

However, when light is attenuated across a depth gradient, the relative importance of this over other mechanisms for tolerating long-term light reduction (such as morphological adjustments and shoot loss) has been questioned. This study aimed to describe a number of the physiological characteristics of Posidonia sinuosa Cambridge et Kuo along a <b>depth-related</b> gradient of light availability (1. 6 to 9. 0 m depth) and infer how these characteristics are important for the long-term maintenance of the meadow. Rapid light curve-derived parameters, light harvesting pigments, photoprotective pigments and nutrient and carbohydrate concentrations exhibited few differences among depth strata, but showed some (albeit limited) adjustment between the seasons. It was inferred that some physiological plasticity is possible in P. sinuosa but that differences in the depthrelated gradient of long-term light availability were not sufficient to induce physiological differences, even at the depth limit. Shoot density reductions, which reduce the effects of self-shading, possibly offset <b>depth-related</b> light reductions. Because the physiological characteristics we examined did not explain the adaptations by P. sinuosa to the long-term gradient of light availability, they may not be useful indicators of long-term light reduction...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{ecological}} importance of decapod crustaceans in energy transfer in marine ecosystems, {{little is known}} on their distribution below oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). To understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of benthic and benthopelagic decapod crustaceans living below the OMZ cores, four seasonal oceanographic and sledge surveys were performed in the south-east Gulf of California at depths between 730 and 2250 m. Multivariate analyses indicate the existence of three major <b>depth-related</b> assemblages at: 800 – 1000, 1000 – 1200 and > 1200 m (mean trawl depth). Benthic detritivores dominated between 800 and 1000 m and benthopelagic (i. e. swimming) predators dominated deeper, where dissolved oxygen (DO) values were higher. Assemblages comprised the same species throughout the year, but aggregations of smaller organisms were observed in June. DO significantly controlled the distribution of decapod crustaceans, likely through physiological exclusion of swimming species from hypoxic waters. Besides, the combined effects of DO and temperature contributed to defining the depth ranges occupied by each species. Food derived from surface-water production modulated changes in community parameters with different time lags in the different <b>depth-related</b> assemblages.

40|$|Studies from {{temperate}} {{and tropical}} regions {{have shown that}} variability {{in the distribution of}} benthos exists at different spatial scales. There are very few similar studies from polar systems, the shallows of which represent some of the most intensely disturbed habitats on the planet. Variability in the abundances of the five most common macrofauna was examined at three spatial scales, metres, tens of metres and hundreds of metres, in the shallows (5 - 25 m depth) of Adelaide Island, West Antarctic Peninsula. Whilst significant community change occurs along a depth gradient at the study sites, not all of the common species studied showed clear <b>depth-related</b> patterns of distribution. Furthermore, although abundance patterns varied between the organisms, consistent <b>depth-related</b> trends in the spatial scale contributing most to the variability were observed for four of the five species. For four species the relative importance of large-scale variability (between sites) decreased from 5 to 25 in depth, whilst small-scale variability (between replicates) increased along the depth gradient. Variation between sites is probably largely driven by ice disturbance, which becomes less frequent with depth. Conversely, small-scale patchiness is promoted by biological interactions, which become relatively more influential as community complexity and species richness increase along the depth gradient...|$|E

In stereo-based systems, the depth effect can be {{produced}} by delivering frames of disparate image pairs, while in monocular environments, the viewer has to extract this depth information from a single image by examining details such as perspective and shadows. This paper investigates via a number of psychophysical experiments, whether we can reduce computational effort and still achieve perceptually high-quality rendering for stereo imagery. We examined selectively rendering the image pairs by exploiting the fusing capability and depth perception underlying human stereo vision. In ray-tracing-based global illumination systems, a higher image resolution introduces more computation to the rendering process since many more rays need to be traced. We first investigated whether we could utilise the human binocular fusing ability and significantly reduce the resolution {{of one of the}} image pairs and yet retain a high perceptual quality under stereo viewing condition. Secondly, we evaluated subjects' performance on a specific visual task that required accurate depth perception. We found that subjects required far fewer rendered depth cues in the stereo viewing environment to perform the task well. Avoiding rendering these detailed cues saved significant computational time. In fact it was possible to achieve a better task performance in the stereo viewing condition at a combined rendering time for the image pairs less than that required for the single monocular image.

Yet, {{few studies have}} assessed the evolutionary context of these ecological distributions by exploring the genetic diversity of closely related coral species and their associated Symbiodinium over large depth ranges. Here we assess the distribution and genetic diversity of five agariciid coral species (Agaricia humilis, A. agaricites, A. lamarcki, A. grahamae, and Helioseris cucullata) and their algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium) across a large depth gradient (2 - 60 m) covering shallow to mesophotic depths on a Caribbean reef. Results The five agariciid species exhibited distinct depth distributions, and dominant Symbiodinium associations {{were found to be}} species-specific, with each of the agariciid species harbouring a distinct ITS 2 -DGGE profile (except for a shared profile between A. lamarcki and A. grahamae). Only A. lamarcki harboured different Symbiodinium types across its depth distribution (i. e. exhibited symbiont zonation). Phylogenetic analysis (atp 6) of the coral hosts demonstrated a division of the Agaricia genus into two major lineages that correspond to their bathymetric distribution ("shallow": A. humilis / A. agaricites and "deep": A. lamarcki / A. grahamae), highlighting the role of <b>depth-related</b> factors in the diversification of these congeneric agariciid species. The divergence between "shallow" and "deep" host species was reflected in the relatedness of the associated Symbiodinium (with A. lamarcki and A. grahamae sharing an identical Symbiodinium profile, and A. humilis and A. agaricites harbouring a related ITS 2 sequence in their Symbiodinium profiles), corroborating the notion that brooding corals and their Symbiodinium are engaged in coevolutionary processes.

We discuss how the majority of studies of multisensory interactions in the depth plane that have been conducted to date have focused on visuotactile and audiotactile interactions in frontal peripersonal space and underline the importance of such multisensory interactions in defining peripersonal space. Based on our review of studies of multisensory interactions in depth, we question the extent to which peri- and extra-personal space (both frontal and rear) are characterized by differences in multisensory interactions (as evidenced by multisensory stimuli producing a different behavioral outcome as compared to unisensory stimulation). In addition to providing an overview of studies of multisensory interactions in different regions of space, our goal in writing this review has been to demonstrate that the various kinds of multisensory interactions that have been documented may follow very similar organizing principles. Multisensory interactions in depth that involve tactile stimuli are constrained by the fact that such stimuli typically need to contact the skin surface. Therefore, <b>depth-related</b> preferences of multisensory interactions involving touch can largely be explained in terms of their spatial alignment in depth and their alignment with the body. As yet, no such <b>depth-related</b> asymmetry has been observed in the case of audiovisual interactions. We therefore suggest that the spatial boundary of peripersonal space and the enhanced audiotactile and visuotactile interactions that occur in peripersonal space can be explained in terms of the particular spatial alignment of stimuli from different modalities with the body and that they likely reflect the result of prior multisensory experience...|$|E
40|$|Reef-accretion {{rate was}} {{measured}} in 151 core intervals from 12 Caribbean and western Atlantic locations. Paleo-water depth for each core interval was determined by comparing its position to the curve of Lighty et al. (1982), based on calendar years before 1950. While {{the majority of the}} data points fell within the upper 15 meters of the water column, no clear <b>depth-related</b> pattern of reef accretion emerged. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} widely held assumption that reef accretion will decrease exponentially with water depth at rates approximately an order of magnitude below the corresponding rates of coral growth at the same depths. Similarly, reef-accretion rates from facies dominated by branching Acropora palmata (3. 83 m/ky) versus those associated with branching corals (3. 07 m/ky) were not significantly different (!= 0. 05), owing to high variance across all water depths. Reef accretion showed a tendency to increase at higher rates of sea-level rise, but that relationship was likewise non-significant. It is proposed that the known <b>depth-related</b> decrease in carbonate production may be offset by a parallel drop in bioerosion. While available data generally support this hypothesis, quantitative verification must await careful measurements of both biological degradation and transport along a depth gradient. Nevertheless, bioerosion appears to not only play an important role in creating reef fabric, but to perhaps affect patterns of reef accretion as much as initial calcification. Regardless of the cause, the patterns revealed by this study fly in the face of the assumptions that underlie our most widely accepted Holocene reef models. Clearly new ones are needed that emphasize the varying contribution of biological material to what is largely a process of physical aggradation – in short reef corals grow, corals reefs accrete...|$|E
