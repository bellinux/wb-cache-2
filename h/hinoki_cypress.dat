5|$|The {{practice}} of marking sacred areas began in Japan {{as early as}} the Yayoi period (from about 500BC to 300AD) originating from primal religious beliefs. Features in the landscape such as rocks, waterfalls, islands, and especially mountains, were places believed to be capable of attracting kami, and subsequently were worshiped as yorishiro. Originally, sacred places may have been simply marked with a surrounding fence and an entrance gate or torii. Later, temporary structures similar to present day portable shrines were constructed to welcome the gods to the sacred place, which eventually evolved into permanent buildings that were dedicated to the gods. Ancient shrines were constructed according to the style of dwellings (Izumo Taisha) or storehouses (Ise Grand Shrine). The buildings had gabled roofs, raised floors, plank walls, and were thatched with reed or covered with <b>hinoki</b> <b>cypress</b> bark. Such early shrines did not include a space for worship. Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: taisha-zukuri, shinmei-zukuri and sumiyoshi-zukuri. They are exemplified by Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha, respectively, and date from before 552AD. According to the tradition of , the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.|$|E

40|$|Forecasts {{of prices}} can help {{industries}} in their risk management. This {{is especially true}} for Japanese logs, which experience sharp fluctuations in price. In this research, the authors used an exponential smoothing method (ETS) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to forecast the monthly prices of domestic logs of three of the most important species in Japan: sugi (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica D. Don), <b>hinoki</b> (Japanese <b>cypress,</b> Chamaecyparis obtusa (Sieb. et Zucc.) Endl.), and karamatsu (Japanese larch, Larix kaempferi (Lamb.) Carr.). For the 12 -month forecasting periods, forecasting intervals of 80 % and 95 % were given. By measuring the accuracy of forecasts of 12 - and 6 -month forecasting periods, it was found that ARIMA gave better results than did the ETS in the majority of cases.

30|$|<b>Hinoki</b> (Japanese <b>cypress)</b> strand with 0.6 mm {{thickness}} was hammer-milled {{to prepare}} {{three types of}} particles that had the same thickness but different lengths and widths. Screen analysis and image analysis were conducted to evaluate the shape and distribution of the particle dimensions. Laboratory-scale particleboards were fabricated at three density levels using these particles. To determine the true effect of particle shape on the linear expansion (LE) of the board, these boards exhibited almost the same temperature behavior during pressing, the same density profile, and the same bending properties at each board density level. LE at 40 °C and 90 % relative humidity of the board {{was found to be}} affected by the particle shape. The board composed of small particles showed a larger LE at the same density level. It was considered that the out-of-plane orientation angle of the particles affected the LE of the boards. Thickness swelling and internal bond strength were also affected by the particle shape.|$|R
30|$|Low density wood is {{more rapidly}} eroded than denser wood {{when exposed to}} the weather, {{possibly}} {{because it is more}} susceptible to photodegradation. Fourier transform infrared microscopy was used to examine: (1) the depth of photodegradation in earlywood and latewood of sugi (Japanese cedar) and earlywood of <b>hinoki</b> (Japanese <b>cypress)</b> exposed for up to 1500 [*]h to artificial sunlight emitted by a xenon lamp (375 [*]W/m 2 within the 300 to 700 [*]nm spectral range); and (2) the relationship between the density of wood tissues and depth of photodegradation. The depth of photodegradation varied between species (sugi and hinoki) as well as within a growth ring (sugi earlywood and latewood), and there was an inversely proportional relationship between depth of photodegradation and wood density. These findings may explain why low density earlywood is more rapidly eroded than latewood during weathering, and more generally, why there is an inverse relationship between the density of wood species and their rate of erosion during artificial and natural weathering.|$|R

30|$|Mat {{consolidation}} {{behavior was}} investigated at various press closing times (PCTs) using <b>hinoki</b> (Japanese <b>cypress)</b> particle mats. The {{temperature in the}} core layer of the mat, press pressure, and platen distance were measured. At the plateau stage during hot pressing, the core temperature decreased with increasing PCT. The core temperature did not increase before the platen distance equaled the target board thickness in the PCT range of 4 – 50 s and rose slightly when the PCT exceeded 100 s. There was a linear relation between the logarithm of PCT and the maximum press pressure. The density profile across board thickness was strongly affected by the PCT. As the PCT increased, {{the position of the}} peak density (PD) moved toward the core layer as the PD itself decreased. The effect of PCT on the linear expansion (LE) of the board is discussed in relation to the density profile. There was no difference in LE after high relative humidity treatment in the PCT range 4 – 50 s. LE appeared {{to be related to the}} low density and the precured region of the board surface. The LE after drying treatment was around − 0.1 %, and the thickness swelling after high relative humidity and drying treatments increased with increasing PCT.|$|R

Three Japanese <b>cypress</b> (<b>hinoki,</b> Chamaecyparis obtusa) treatments (including three different understory conditions) and one deciduous forest treatment were studied. For all plots, including deciduous hillslopes, we observed overland flow even for small storm events (180 mm, runoff from Japanese cypress plots with dense fern understory exhibited a delayed and higher peak associated with return flow. The dominance of hillslope-scale flow contribution to catchment runoff was also affected {{by changes in}} the dominance of overland flow and return flow. Understory vegetation cover {{and the availability of}} a litter layer altered the amount of overland flow, which was mediated by soil water repellency and soil moisture.

30|$|Three-layered {{composite}} oriented strand boards were manufactured using {{very thin}} <b>hinoki</b> (Japanese <b>cypress,</b> Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl.) strands oriented {{in the faces}} and mixtures of sugi (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica D. Don.) and hinoki particles in the core. The boards were composed of two density levels, with 1 : 8 : 1, 0.5 : 9 : 0.5, and 0 : 10 : 0 face: core: face ratios. Polymeric and emulsion type isocyanate resins were used. The resin contents for the strands {{in the face and}} particles in the core were 10 % and 5 %, respectively. The steam-injection press was applied at 0.62 MPa (160 °C), and the steam-injection time was 2 min. The mechanical and physical properties of the boards were evaluated based on the Japanese Industrial Standard. The parallel moduli of rupture and elasticity along the strand orientation direction and the wood screw retaining force increased with increasing face/core ratios. Incorporation of 10 %– 20 % of thin strands {{in the face of the}} boards improved the parallel moduli of rupture and elasticity by 47 %– 124 % and 30 %– 65 %, respectively. In addition, the thickness swelling after water-soaking at 20 °C for 24 h, and the parallel linear expansion after boiling for 2 h and water-soaking at 20 °C for 1 h, of the three-layered composite boards were below 8 % and 0.15 %, respectively, despite a short steam-injection press time. The thickness swelling of the boards decreased with increasing face/core ratios. In contrast, the presence of face strands seems to have a minimal effect on the moduli of rupture and elasticity along the perpendicular direction of the three-layered composite boards. A similar trend was observed for the internal bond strength, hardness, and linear expansion along the perpendicular direction.|$|R
