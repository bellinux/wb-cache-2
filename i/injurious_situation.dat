40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{researcher}} explores and examines the ‘bullying ’ behaviour patterns {{of not only}} the child but {{the teacher and the}} principal and various other staff members as well as parents, in the school setting. A study of various reasons for bullying, techniques and types of bullying will be analysed. It is a well-known fact that bullying is increasing in the school milieu. We need to analyse and respond positively to the situation and discover methods which can be used effectively to discourage this behaviour, when doing so. In the past, ‘isolation ’ was generally the cause and comfort zone for the bully but as things change bullying has now crept into many other areas and today’s generation finds new ways to torment and intimidate others on a continuous basis. Being bullied can change your life in the long-term in distressing, demoralizing and detrimental ways. We need to find a solution to this <b>injurious</b> <b>situation</b> before it becomes so overwhelming that it cannot in the long term be restrained...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Textiloma is a mass {{composed}} of retained surgical textile foreign body. It {{is a rare}} iatrogenic complication that can engage the doctor’s responsibility. The aim of this manuscript is to report an unusual case of breast Textiloma mimicking a recurrent tumor and to highlight its medico-legal implications. Presentation of case: A 47 -year-old lady, without past medical history, {{was diagnosed with a}} breast infiltring intraductal carcinoma. She was treated with mastectomy. Four years later, the patient consulted her surgeon for a subcutaneous mass in the operative site. Both medical and radiological investigations concluded to recurrent tumor. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of Textiloma. Discussion: Retained foreign bodies in the operative site are infrequent but serious iatrogenic complications. Clinical manifestations of Textiloma are variable and non-specific. It should be suspected in any postoperative case with unresolved or unusual problems. It can mimic other conditions such as tumor. Textiloma is a frequently <b>injurious</b> <b>situation</b> that can lead to medico-legal implications. It {{is considered to be a}} sample of medical negligence that involves the surgeon responsibility. Conclusion: Textiloma is a preventable condition and it can be avoidable by maintaining standard recommendations...|$|E

Previous research has suggested different phases of rate of torque development (RTD) are differentiately controlled. However, the extent to which supraspinal and spinal mechanisms predict RTD at different time intervals is unknown. RTD of the plantarflexors across various phases of contraction (i. e., 0 - 25 ms, 0 - 50 ms, 0 - 100 ms, 0 - 150 ms, 0 - 200 ms, and 0 - 250 ms) was measured in 37 participants. The following predictor variables were also measured: (a) gain of the resting soleus H-reflex recruitment curve, (b) gain of the resting homonymous post-activation depression recruitment curve, (c) gain of the GABAergic pre-synaptic inhibition recruitment curve, (d) the level of post-synaptic recurrent inhibition at rest, (e) level of supraspinal drive assessed by measuring V waves, and (f) the gain of the resting soleus M Wave. Stepwise regression analyses were used to determine which variables significantly predicted allometrically scaled RTD. The analyses indicated that supraspinal drive was the dominant predictor of RTD across all phases. Additionally, recurrent inhibition predicted RTD in all of the time intervals except 0 - 150 ms. These results demonstrate the importance of supraspinal drive and recurrent inhibition to RTD...|$|R
