40|$|Abstract One of {{the central}} aspects {{of this study was}} the {{investigation}} of the histomorphometric characteristics of normal human myocardium. Furthermore the changes in the cell dimensions in case of pressure hypertrophy and reactive hypertrophy were detected and evaluated. Using the EasyMeasure software <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> diameters at defined points of the cell were evaluated by light microscopy. The measurements were performed on 7 male and 16 female healthy heart donors (7. 752 measurements on cells of the left ventricular wall and 8. 055 measurements on cells of the right ventricular wall), 41 patients with advanced coronary artery disease (13. 868 measurements) and 13 male patients with aortic stenosis (4. 404 measurements). The mean <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> diameter was 10, 74 ± 2, 40 µm in the left ventricle and 9, 14 ± 1, 78 µm in the right ventricle of the healthy donor cohort. Based on the established normal range from 6 µm to 15 µm it was found, that besides of the normal sized myocytes the normal myocardium contains small amounts of atrophied (2, 5 % left vs. 3, 8 % right) and hypertrophied (8, 1 % left vs. 0, 4 % right) heart muscle cells as well. The right ventricular wall was composed of more homogeneous and of significantly smaller myocytes than the left one. There was no difference between the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> diameters of male and female donor hearts. The mean diameters in the CHD-group (17, 67 ± 4, 09 µm) and in the AVD-group (19, 79 ± 4, 56 µm) were greater than in the donor cohort, but there were no statistically significant differences between this two groups. According to the analysis of the groups this result is due to the coexistence of hypertension. In patients without hypertension (8 CHD-patients and 4 AVD-patients) was demonstrated, that the myocyte diameter in pure pressure hypertrophy (20, 36 ± 5, 11 µm) was significantly different than in pure reactive hypertrophy (16, 10 ± 3, 60 µm).

MethodsTwenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into three groups, namely: control, non-treated diabetic, and ginger extract-treated diabetic groups. The ginger extract-treated diabetic group received a 50 mg daily dose of ginger extract intragastrically for 6 weeks. ResultsThe results revealed concurrent significant increases in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), homocysteine (Hcy), cathepsin G and apoB levels and decreases in apoA and leptin levels in the non-treated diabetic group compared to the control group. Moreover, heart structural changes, including fibrosis and <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, were observed in non-treated diabetic rats compared to the control rats. Significant amelioration of changes in the heart structure together with restoration of the elevated levels of Hcy and CRP, leptin, cathepsin G, and apoA and B were found in the ginger extract-treated diabetic group compared to the non-treated diabetic group.

40|$|AbstractDynamic {{models of}} {{biological}} systems often possess complex and multivariate mappings between input parameters and output state variables, posing challenges for comprehensive sensitivity analysis across the biologically relevant parameter space. In particular, {{more efficient and}} robust ways to obtain a solid {{understanding of how the}} sensitivity to each parameter depends on the values of the other parameters are sorely needed. We report a new methodology for global sensitivity analysis based on Hierarchical Cluster-based Partial Least Squares Regression (HC-PLSR) -based approximations (metamodelling) of the input–output mappings of dynamic models, which we expect to be generic, efficient and robust, even for systems with highly nonlinear input–output relationships. The two-step HC-PLSR metamodelling automatically separates the observations (here corresponding to different combinations of input parameter values) into groups based on the dynamic model behaviour, then analyses each group separately with Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). This produces one global regression model comprising all observations, as well as regional regression models within each group, where the regression coefficients can be used as sensitivity measures. Thereby a more accurate description of complex interactions between inputs to the dynamic model can be revealed through analysis of how a certain level of one input parameter affects the model sensitivity to other inputs. We illustrate the usefulness of the HC-PLSR approach on a dynamic model of a mouse <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>cell,</b> and demonstrate how it reveals interaction patterns of probable biological significance not easily identifiable by a global regression-based sensitivity analysis alone. Applied for sensitivity analysis of a complex, high-dimensional dynamic model of the mouse <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>cell,</b> several interactions between input parameters were identified by the two-step HC-PLSR analysis that could not be detected in the single-step global analysis. Hence, our approach has the potential to reveal new biological insight through the identification of complex parameter interaction patterns. The HC-PLSR metamodel complexity can be adjusted according to the nonlinear complexity of the input–output mapping of the analysed dynamic model through adjustment of the number of regional regression models included. This facilitates sensitivity analysis of dynamic models of varying complexities...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA rhythmic {{heart beat}} is coordinated by {{conduction}} of pacemaking impulses through the cardiac conduction system. Cells of the conduction system, including Purkinje fibers, terminally differentiate from {{a subset of}} cardiac <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> that respond to signals from endocardial and coronary arterial cells. A vessel-associated paracrine factor, endothelin, can induce embryonic <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> to differentiate into Purkinje fibers both in vivo and in vitro. During this phenotypic conversion, the conduction cells down-regulate genes characteristic of cardiac muscle and up-regulate subsets of genes typical of both skeletal <b>muscle</b> and neuronal <b>cells.</b> In the present study, we examined the expression of myogenic transcription factors associated with the switch of the gene expression program during terminal differentiation of <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> into Purkinje fibers. In situ hybridization analyses and immunohistochemistry of embryonic and adult hearts revealed that Purkinje fibers up-regulate skeletal and atrial muscle myosin heavy chains, connexin- 42, and neurofilament protein. Concurrently, a cardiac muscle-specific myofibrillar protein, myosin-binding protein-C (cMyBP-C), is down-regulated. During this change in transcription, however, Purkinje fibers continue to express cardiac muscle transcription factors, such as Nkx 2. 5, GATA 4, and MEF 2 C. Importantly, {{significantly higher levels of}} Nkx 2. 5 and GATA 4 mRNAs were detected in Purkinje fibers as compared to ordinary <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> No detectable difference was observed in MEF 2 C expression. In culture, endothelin-induced Purkinje fibers from embryonic cardiac <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> dramatically down-regulated cMyBP-C transcription, whereas expression of Nkx 2. 5 and GATA 4 persisted. In addition, myoD, a skeletal muscle transcription factor, was up-regulated in endothelin-induced Purkinje cells, while Myf 5 and MRF 4 transcripts were undetectable in these cells. These results show that during and after conversion from <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>cells,</b> Purkinje fibers express a unique myogenic transcription factor program. The mechanism underlying down-regulation of cardiac muscle genes and up-regulation of skeletal muscle genes during conduction cell differentiation may be independent from the transcriptional control seen in ordinary cardiac and skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
