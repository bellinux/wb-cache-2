The cabins for non-commissioned officers were also located here. The superstructure included several cabins for senior officers. The ships were initially painted black but in the 1920s they were repainted gray. Alfonso XIII wore a white identification band on her funnel and Jaime I wore two, though both ships had them removed {{after the start of}} the Civil War. Jaime <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> repainted dark gray at this time.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a zone of buffer states, Sigismund I of Hungary tried to draw the neighboring Orthodox rulers under his own suzerainty by granting them estates in his kingdom. For example, Stefan Lazarević of Serbia received Satu Mare, Baia Mare and Baia Sprie in modern Romania, and Mircea I of Wallachia was granted Făgăraş. Sigismund <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the first monarch who recognized, in 1419, the legislative competence of the Estates in Transylvania. On his initiative, their assembly declared that {{in case of an}} Ottoman attack, every third nobleman and every tenth serf would take up arms. Indeed, from 1420 Ottoman attacks occurred on an annual basis. In this period many Saxon churches, and later the Székely churches of the Ciuc region, were fortified, which gave local architecture a distinctive appearance.|$|E

25|$|There also survive {{documents}} from Castile which {{make reference to}} the imperator terrae ("emperor of the land"), but the relevance of these was disputed by Mayer and Menéndez Pidal, who disagreed whether they referred to the Count of Castile or the King of León.

The return followed the failure by RTÉ 2fm in its attempts to target teenagers. Fanning claimed: In fact I so never moved that instead I brought the four people who were working with me for Radio One and their desks into 2FM!

25|$|At {{the time}} of the conquest much ecclesiastical {{property}} had been secularized and, despite the demands of the clergy, this had not been returned to the churches. The Chronicle of the Morea reports that when the churches refused to provide their fair share of military aid, Geoffrey I seized their property and devoted the income from it to the construction of the powerful castle of Clermont. Furthermore, Geoffrey <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> accused of treating the Greek priests as serfs because their numbers had considerably increased, since the Greek prelates showed no hesitation in conferring orders on peasants to permit them to escape the burdens of serfdom. These events resulted in a prolonged conflict with the church.|$|E

500|$|In late November, Benzema began {{appearing}} mainly {{as a substitute}} as manager Manuel Pellegrini preferred Gonzalo Higuaín in the lead striker role. To coincide with his benching, the striker was also being criticized by the Spanish media for his under-performance and difficulties settling in the country as {{he had not yet}} begun learning the Spanish language. He was even declared the [...] "new Anelka" [...] by a Spanish newspaper Marca blogger, referring to former Real Madrid striker Nicolas Anelka who had a tumultuous year at the club before being sold. Benzema was defended by his compatriot Zinedine Zidane, who admitted [...] "after two months, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> criticized" [...] and that Benzema was [...] "a talented player and talented players in Madrid must win".|$|E
500|$|Since late 2008, MOBA {{has been}} experimenting with {{allowing}} the public to title and caption some works.

The [...] "Guest Interpretator's Collection" [...] is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and one is added every two months. A professor at Boston University offered his thoughts: [...] "The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests {{a commitment to the}} abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> reminded that I need to pick up some toilet bowl cleaner on my way home!" ...|$|E

500|$|Adam {{later told}} UK daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian: [...] "No one was allowed in Fort Knox but because [...] Cubby Broccoli {{had some good}} connections and the Kennedys loved Ian Fleming's books I was allowed to fly over it once. It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} the novel is drugs, which Faulks said came partly from the {{timeframe}} of the novel and partly from Fleming not using it as a major theme: [...] "1967, the summer of love... Drugs were first coming to public notice. The Stones were busted, and there was that famous leader in The Times. And, you know, {{what are we talking about}} now all the time? Drugs. It's still very resonant. And there's little about drug-dealing in Fleming. It's not something he did in any depth." [...] Faulks also wanted to broaden the aspect of the story compared to Fleming: [...] "The book is set during the Cold War and I wanted it to not just be a crime story but to also have a political background. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> determined that although the book is set in 1967, I wanted the issues that it touches on to still be alive to us today".|$|E
500|$|Others use machinima in drama; {{these works}} {{may or may}} not retain signs of their video game provenance. Unreal Tournament is often used for science fiction and Battlefield 1942 for war, but some artists subvert their chosen game's setting or {{completely}} detach their work from it. In 1999, Strange Company used Quake II in Eschaton: Nightfall, a horror film {{based on the work of}} H. P. Lovecraft (although Quake <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> based on the Lovecraft lore). [...] A later example is Damien Valentine's series Consanguinity, made using BioWare's 2002 computer game Neverwinter Nights and based on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Another genre consists of experimental works that attempt to push the boundaries of game engines. One example, Fountainhead's Anna, is a short film that focuses on the cycle of life and is reminiscent of Fantasia. Other productions go farther and completely eschew a 3-D appearance. Friedrich Kirschner's The Tournament and The Journey deliberately appear hand-drawn, and Dead on Que's Fake Science resembles two-dimensional Eastern European modernist animation from the 1970s.|$|E
