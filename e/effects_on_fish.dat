25|$|Due {{to their}} very high {{solubility}} and because soils are highly unable to retain anions, nitrates can enter groundwater. Elevated nitrate in groundwater {{is a concern}} for drinking water use because nitrate can interfere with blood-oxygen levels in infants and cause methemoglobinemia or blue-baby syndrome. Where groundwater recharges stream flow, nitrate-enriched groundwater can contribute to eutrophication, a process that leads to high algal population and growth, especially blue-green algal populations. While not directly toxic to fish life, like ammonia, nitrate can have indirect <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> if it contributes to this eutrophication. Nitrogen has contributed to severe eutrophication problems in some water bodies. Since 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer has been increasingly controlled in Britain and the United States. This is occurring {{along the same lines}} as control of phosphorus fertilizer, restriction of which is normally considered essential to the recovery of eutrophied waterbodies.|$|E
500|$|These {{findings}} do {{not mean}} that river regulation and water extraction have not had adverse <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> stocks. Rather, river regulation {{has been a major}} factor in the decline of Murray cod and other native fish. Thermal pollution is also a major problem, evidence indicates strong Murray cod recruitment events (which may be important for sustaining Murray cod populations over the long term) can result from spring flooding, and the health of Australian lowland river ecosystems generally rely on periodic spring flooding. Also, due to the regulation of most of the rivers in the Murray-Darling River system, mainly for irrigation purposes, only exceptional spring floods manage to [...] "break free". The long-term viability of wild Murray cod, other native fish species and river ecosystems, in the face of this fact, are of great concern.|$|E

40|$|Turbulence is {{a complex}} subject that is often defined by various {{definitions}} dependent on topic of interest or application. In its basic form, turbulence describes velocity fluctuations within the velocity field. In fish passage and habitat applications, these fluctuating velocities can have a significant <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>fish.</b> Turbulence can inhibit or prevent fish from swimming in certain areas and high intensity turbulence can cause disorientation. The size scale of turbulence is of critical importance. Small scale turbulence has little <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> but high shear flows can potentially damage fish. To quantify turbulence, three different categories of turbulence are defined {{as well as their}} respective <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>fish.</b> Current methods of evaluating turbulence in fish passage include the energy dissipation factor (EDF), root mean square (RMS), and the turbulence intensity factor. Each method is described and their strengths and weaknesses outlined. A new turbulence parameter is developed termed the average-vector method. The average vector method incorporates velocity magnitude, acceleration and the change in flow direction into a single value at a given point in the flow. For field application, it is believed that the average-vector method coupled with standard statistical methods provides a better measure of turbulence in fish passage/habitat than the existing methods. The resulting dimensions of the average-vector method is L/T 2; an acceleration. Potentially, there could be a correlation between Newton 2 ̆ 7 s second law (F = ma) and the average-vector method indicating that fish turbulence is related to a fluctuating force acting <b>on</b> the <b>fish...</b>|$|R

40|$|A bioenergetic growth {{model was}} {{developed}} to examine the integrated effects of fertilization, stocking density, and spawning on the growth of tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L.), in pond aquaculture. The analyses showed that growth rates increase {{with higher levels of}} organic fertilization up to 500 kg/ha/week. Growth rates increased with added food rations in ponds, reaching a maximum growth of 2 - 07 g/day at about 44 – 48 days after stocking. Fish growth rates decreased with increased levels of stocking density. The stocking density for optimal growth is 1 fish/m 2; the optimal density for total harvesting weight and fish size is 2 fish/m 2. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that tilapia growth is most sensitive to catabolism (metabolism) and anabolism (synthesis) coefficients, both of which are geometrically related to the fish body weight.

40|$|Processes {{affecting}} {{fish populations}} range in scale from local to global. Fish response is also scale-dependent, with some activities varying locally while others depend on large-scale connectivity within or between watersheds. These issues are still only partly recognized, with large-scale research often affected by non-independent sampling, weak inference, poor model testing or model over-extrapolation. Available multi-scale studies can reach different conclusions about factors affecting fishes from local studies, but results vary between examples. Potential explanations are (i) <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>fishes</b> are context-dependent; (ii) different species or life-stages {{are limited in}} different ways; (iii) multi-scale studies are too few for generalization.

Moreover, fish habitat model, which based on fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm, integrated with two-dimensional water quality model. Finally, the relations between flow and habitat quantity factors, and between flow and habitat quality factors, like habitat suitability and habitat fragment, were discovered. By these relations, the tendency for years on the S. hollandi Oshima habitat, which caused by flow regime variation upstream, was discussed from both quantity and quality aspects and the cumulative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> habitat would be revealed.
