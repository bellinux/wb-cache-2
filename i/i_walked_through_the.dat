2500|$|The actress Lucy Speed – {{seventeen}} at {{the time}} – was chosen to play the part. Speed claims that she was cast due to her “cranky” attitude during her audition. She comments “I showed up there with an attitude, not giving ‘a stuff’ whether I got the damn part and they responded to that. They liked it, liked my feistiness, {{they thought it was}} the quality they were looking for…Natalie was a pretty gloomy kid, not a sunny show-biz kid which is all they'd been seeing until <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> door. So I got the part.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, Derby {{rejected}} {{an offer}} from Burnley for Bryson. Bryson was however given permission to speak to Burnley, later saying that [...] "it doesn't matter what team it is, when someone puts an offer in for you I think you owe them the respect {{to sit down and}} speak to them... but just because I did that didn't mean I was going to sign for them." [...] Soon afterwards, he agreed a new five-year contract with Derby, saying that his bond with the fans was {{part of the reason that}} he chose to stay: [...] "I've got a good bond with the fans as well and that was a big part in my decision to stay here. The fans have been excellent ever since <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> door. When you come to a new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life. I took a while to think about it and I knew it would be a massive decision. I went through stages where one minute I thought I was leaving and then the next minute I think I'm staying. But in the end it turned out to be an easy decision for me because Derby are such a great club to be part of." ...|$|E

6000|$|I laid it {{down again}} and stood up, dizzy, breathless, unseeing. Like {{a woman in a}} dream <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> outer office and into the street.

60|$|I {{very much}} {{questioned}} within myself, as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Insane Asylum, whether I {{should have known}} the attendants from the patients, but for the few words which passed between the former, and the Doctor, {{in reference to the}} persons under their charge. Of course I limit this remark merely to their looks; for the conversation of the mad people was mad enough.|$|E
60|$|I can {{remember}} that as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fields {{the grass was}} damp with the rain of the morning, {{and the air was}} heavy with the smell of the fresh-turned earth. Gabriel was waiting for me under the hawthorn tree outside the gap, and we stood hand-in-hand looking down at the long sweep of moorland and at the broad blue channel which encircled it with its fringe of foam.|$|E
60|$|My {{return home}} to Lady Grove was a very {{different}} thing from what I had anticipated when I had got out to sea with my load of quap and fancied the Perfect-Filament was safe within my grasp. As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> evening light along the downs, the summer stillness seemed like the stillness of something newly dead. There were no lurking workmen any more, no cyclists on the high road.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{begins with}} a line from Psalm 23:4: [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> valley of the shadow of death", but then diverges with: [...] "I {{take a look at}} my life and realize there's nothin' left."

60|$|My {{agony of}} {{suspense}} {{was replaced by}} an icy calm. At length I knew the worst. It was finished--I had striven in vain. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> outlying trees and {{between two of the}} wagons. One of these I noticed, as we do notice things at such times, was the same in which Marais had trekked with his daughter, his favourite wagon that once I had helped to fit with a new dissel-boom.|$|E
60|$|The sun {{beat down}} mercilessly on thatch and terrace, the yellow walls flung back the quivering heat, as Madame la Vicomtesse and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> empty streets towards the Governor's house. We were {{followed}} by Andre and Madame's maid. The sleepy orderly started up from under the archway at our approach, bowed profoundly to Madame, looked askance at me, and declared, with a thousand regrets, that Monsieur le Baron was having his siesta.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets; and, {{once more}} seeing my old adversary the butcher--now a constable, {{with his staff}} hanging up in the shop--went down {{to look at the}} place where I had fought him; and there meditated on Miss Shepherd and the eldest Miss Larkins, and all the idle loves and likings, and dislikings, of that time. Nothing seemed to have survived that time but Agnes; and she, ever a star above me, was {{brighter}} and higher.|$|E
60|$|The fame {{which came}} to me through that gallant rescue was a little embarrassing. I was a marked man. Did <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> village, heads emerged from windows, and eyes {{followed}} me out of sight. Did I sit on the beach, groups formed behind me and watched in silent admiration. I was {{the man of the}} moment.|$|R

60|$|But {{the people}} in the villages, so far as I could detect, saw no {{difference}} in their world. Two little girls bobbed and an old labourer touched his hat convulsively as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> village. He still thought he knew his place--and mine. I did not know him, but I would have liked dearly to have asked him if he remembered my mother, if either my uncle or old Lichtenstein had been man enough to stand being given away like that.|$|E
60|$|I {{walked home}} with but one thought {{in my mind}}. The Archduchess had put into words--very plain, blunt words--what as yet I had {{scarcely}} dared harbour in my mind as a fugitive idea. She had done me in that respect good service. She had brought to a sudden crisis an issue which it was folly any longer to evade. I meant to speak now, and have done with it. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> busy streets a dreaming man. It was for the last time. Henceforth, even the dream must pass.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{streets of}} Forli with {{swinging}} steps; I {{breathed in the}} morning air, and felt so strong, and well, and young. Everything was beautiful--all life! The grey walls enchanted me; the sombre carvings of the churches; the market women, gaily dressed, entering the town laden with baskets of many-coloured fruit. They gave me greeting, and I answered with a laughing heart. How kind they were! Indeed, my heart {{was so full of}} love that it welled over and covered everything and everybody, so that I felt a strange, hearty kindness to all around me. I loved mankind! ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1 The Lord is my shepherd; I {{shall not}} want.2 He maketh me {{to lie down}} in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.4 Yea, though <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.|$|R
