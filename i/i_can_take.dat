I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of all from the poor man's standpoint. As the sovereignty and self-rule movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with this evil.|$|E

500|$|Kolb {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} be the starting quarterback for the Eagles during the 2010 offseason: [...] "Obviously {{my goal is to}} be the starter and to start for 16 games and to lead this team {{as far as we can}} go. Personally, I don't have a lot of personal goals right now, they're more team-oriented, besides me getting on the field and proving <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> over this thing." [...] Kolb gained many comparisons to the situation Aaron Rodgers endured backing up Brett Favre during his first three seasons. Kolb and Rodgers reached out to one another to share their similar plights.|$|E

Chris Ryan of MTV News said [...] "Usher pairs off with current queen MC Nicki Minaj, {{and the two}} glide over Polow Da Don's minimal bass beat." [...] Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio Blog said that the [...] "heavy back-beat tune confirms Usher's old ways: [...] "Yeah you the business / So What's the business / Don't be shy, I'm just talkin' to you girl." [...] Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media called the heavily manipulated [...] "Living for the City" [...] sample, [...] "a monstrous swirl of orchestral exoticism". Minaj makes several puns in her lines, one of them referring to Santa Claus's reindeer in a runthrough which Prefix Magazine reviewed negatively. She also refers to P. Diddy and Cassie in her lines, that she's [...] "plotting on how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> Cassie away from Diddy".|$|E

500|$|Of Human Feelings was a {{continuation}} of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change. Although Coleman's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music, Tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a soloist and melodist: [...] "When we read Ornette's music we have his notes, but we listen for his phrases and phrase the way he wants to. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the same melody, then, and phrase it like I want to, and those notes will determine the phrasing, the rhythm, the harmony– all of that." ...|$|E
