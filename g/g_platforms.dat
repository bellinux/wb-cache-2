40|$|Human {{behavior}} increasingly involves digital online software, {{where the}} activities and resources that support (1) learning, (2) work, and (3) collaboration overlap and are placed in far greater proximity than the physical world – often just a browser-tab or window away. What scientific and practical gains in 21 st century learning, work, and collaboration {{can be achieved by}} integrating and contrasting these three areas ’ relevant technologies, scientific com-munities, and industry practitioners? For example: How can software for collaborative work incorporate learning? Which methods are ef-fective for coordinating diverse experts to iteratively improve online educational resources? How can online learning improve the skill set and labor force for crowd work? What kinds of computational frameworks exist to jointly optimize the learning of skills and the use of these skills to achieve practical goals? This workshop tackles such questions by bringing together participants from industry (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>platforms</b> similar to oDesk, Amazon Mechanical Turk); educa-tion, psychology, and MOOCs (e. g., attendees of AERA, EDM, AIED, Learning at Scale); crowdsourc-ing and collaborative work (e. g., attendees of CHI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{convergence}} of mobile technologies will characterize the future telecommunication systems based on TCP/IP protocols. These Protocols {{can be used}} to build both wired and wireless parts on same platform. But TCP/IP headers overheads are large, so it utilizes more bandwidth even small services, whose payload is small. So it definitely need header compression to save bandwidth, as we know bandwidth is the most expensive and scared resource in wireless systems. There are many approaches used to compress the headers overloads. Most commonly used approaches are, an adaptive robust TCP/IP header compression algorithm for 3 G wireless networks and an adaptive robust header compression algorithm based on UDP-RTS/CTS handshake for real-time streams in wireless networks such a 3 <b>G</b> <b>platforms.</b> But these approaches are not efficient in adaptive nature. So In this paper we are proposing one approach to solve the problem efficiently even in adaptive nature. The aim of this algorithm is to adjust the dimension of Variable Sliding Window (VSW) in W-LSB encoding with the accurate estimation of wireless channel state to achieve the good balance of compression ratio and error-resistant robustness for the adaptive use in wireless link. We present simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive algorithm over wireless link and comparative study of existing approache...|$|E
40|$|Education {{is one of}} {{the eight}} Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of the United Nations. Considerable {{interest}} has been displayed in online education at scale, a new arising concept to realize the MDG. Yet connecting online education to real jobs is still a challenge. This CHI workshop bridges this gap by bringing together groups and insights from related work at HCOMP, CSCW, and Learning at Scale. The workshop aims at providing opportunities for groups not yet in the focus of online education, exemplified by low SES and less educated students who have not have equal access to higher education, compared to typical students in MOOCs. The focus is on theoretical and empirical connections between online education and job opportunities which can reduce the financial gap, by providing students with an income during their studies. The workshop explores the technological analogue of the concept of "apprenticeship", long established in the European Union, and education research (Collins, Seely Brown, Newman, 1989). This allows students to do useful work as an apprentice during their studies. This workshop tackles such questions by bringing together participants from industry (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>platforms</b> similar to Upwork, Amazon Mechanical Turk); education, psychology, and MOOCs (e. g., attendees of AERA, EDM, AIED, Learning at Scale); crowdsourcing and collaborative work (e. g., attendees of CHI, CSCW, NIPS, AAAI's HCOMP) ...|$|E

40|$|Accurate, {{precise and}} rapid {{acquisition}} of topographic data {{is fundamental to}} many sub-disciplines of physical geography. Technological developments {{over the past few}} decades have made fully distributed data sets of centimetric resolution and accuracy commonplace; yet the emergence of Structure from Motion (SfM) with Multi-View Stereo (MVS) in recent years has revolutionised three-dimensional topographic surveys in physical geography by democratising data collection and processing. SfM-MVS originates from the fields of computer vision and photogrammetry, requires minimal expensive equipment or specialist expertise, and under certain conditions can produce point clouds of comparable quality to existing survey methods (e. g. Terrestrial Laser Scanning). Consequently, applications of SfM-MVS in physical geography have multiplied rapidly. There are many practical options available to physical geographers when planning a SfM-MVS survey (e. <b>g.</b> <b>platforms,</b> cameras, software); yet, many focused SfM-MVS end-users are uncertain as to the errors associated with each choice and, perhaps most fundamentally, the processes actually taking place as part of the SfM-MVS workflow. This paper details the typical workflow applied by SfM-MVS software packages, reviews practical details of implementing SfM-MVS, combines existing validation studies to assess practically achievable data quality and reviews the range of applications of SfM-MVS in physical geography. The flexibility of the SfM-MVS approach complicates attempts to validate SfM-MVS robustly as each individual validation study will use a different approach (e. g. platform, camera, georeferencing method, etc.). We highlight the need for greater transparency in SfM-MVS processing and enhanced ability to adjust parameters that determine survey quality. Looking forwards, future prospects of SfM-MVS in physical geography are identified through discussion of more recent developments in the fields of image analysis and computer vision...|$|E
40|$|Basic {{research}} {{is critical to}} toxicology in that it contributes {{to the understanding of}} how biological systems respond to perturbation (mechanistic studies) and to advances in toxicity testing methodologies (e. g., toxicogenomics and in silico models). Basic research also advances the understanding of inter- and intraspecies variability, and improving the assessment human population responses (biomarker studies). The identification and validation of biomarkers (relevant to both exposure and outcome assessment) also draws upon basic research. Similarly, basic {{research is}} critical to the process of phenotypic anchoring for new computational and toxicogenomic methods. Evidence-based considerations can enhance the translational relationship between basic research and toxicology. These considerations include criteria for evaluating research data, the standardization of methodologies (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>platforms,</b> procedures, genotypic characterization of cells, and quality control), the selection of relevant doses or concentrations to toxicological problems, and the provision of parameter information (e. g., free chemical concentrations in cell cultures). A number of tools and approaches relevant to basic research in an evidence-based toxicology were identified. With regard to data quality, criteria are required to evaluate evidence with regard to relevance and quality, and standardized data analysis and presentation. Data quality should also be evaluated by the level of experimental design detail available (in journals or otherwise), and relevance to the toxicological question. With regard to publication, editorial advice and good referee practice should also be encouraged. An evidence-based toxicology movement should also aim to improve data availability. Original data should be available whenever possible, public-access databases should be encouraged, and publication bias should be addressed (including the publication of negative results). To apply basic research to new toxicological methods {{it is important to understand}} variability and uncertainty, to apply criteria to data with respect to relevance to humans, and to design or select the most relevant experimental models. Available evidence-based tools includes established validation criteria (e. g., those developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), and guidelines such as those for Good Cell Culture Practice.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the origins, improvements, and variations of a broadband microwave antenna {{that can be}} beam-steered by a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS). The steerable MEMS antenna of this work was comprised of a planar antenna {{on top of a}} Silicon membrane. The membrane is etched to create a gimbal hinge structure and a platform which supported the antenna and gave it one or two degrees of freedom of rotation. The antennas presented were broadband and fed by a coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission line which traversed the hinge structure. The antenna 2 ̆ 7 s orientation in space was designed to be changed through electrostatic actuation of the antenna platform 2 ̆ 7 s hinges. The goal of this thesis was to improve on the initial design and performance of the prototypic antenna. The best variation of the prototype antenna could rotate ± 4. 0 ° in two degrees of freedom under 800 VDC of actuation voltage and had a bandwidth of 1. 55. The mechanical and electrical aspects of the device were studied and analyzed concurrently. Three variations of the MEMS antenna platform were design and modeled; Generations 1 - 3 (G 1 - G 3). The <b>G</b> 1 <b>platform</b> was an optimized version of the prototypic MEMS <b>platform.</b> The <b>G</b> 2 <b>platform</b> could rotate in two dimensions but had much thinner hinges and a more robust antenna <b>platform.</b> The <b>G</b> 3 <b>platform</b> was a one degree of freedom version of the <b>G</b> 2 <b>platform.</b> A new antenna shape was selected and optimized for integration with the three generations of antenna platforms; the planar inverted cone antenna (PICA). The <b>G</b> 3 <b>platform</b> had the best overall electrical and mechanical performance. Two additional antennas were simulated on the G 3 platform; a cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (C-DRA) and a teardrop dielectric resonator antenna (Td-DRA). The three best antenna variations on the <b>G</b> 3 <b>platform</b> were simulated to have maximum actuation angles ranging from 10 - 13 ° and have bandwidths of 3. 62 (PICA), 1. 70 (C-DRA), and 1. 78 (Td-DRA) ...|$|R
