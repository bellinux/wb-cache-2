From earlier studies, we had prelimi-nary evidence that {{one to three}} freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) increased soil aggregate stability when measured by wet sieving field-moist aggregates. In this study, we measured the stability of aggregates vapor-wetted to field capacity from the Ap horizons of four soils after undergoing either zero, one, two, or four FTCs, and we determined the number of FTCs at which aggregate stability would be greatest for each soil. Moist soil was packed to a dry bulk density of 1. 15 Mg M- 3 by tapping it into 28 -mm-diameter, 50 -mm-tall brass cylinders. Each cylinder was then sealed in a polyethylene bag and inserted into a polystyrene <b>foam</b> <b>tray.</b> The soil in each cylinder was frozen convectively at — 5 °C for 48 h and then thawed at + 6 °C for 48 h for each FTC. Aggregate stability increased with {{the first one to}} two FTCs but changed little thereafter. Trend analysis revealed that aggregate stability would be greatest after two or three FTCs. When averaged across the four soils, FTCs stabilized aggregates more at 0 to 15 mm than at 15 to 30 mm. Near the surface of wet soils, two or three FTCs may be beneficial rather than detrimental to soil structure. (Soil Science 1998; 163 : 63 - 70...|$|E

The experiment was conducted by dipping longan fruit in 1. 2 % (w/v) chitosan coating solution containing 1. 0 % CA (pH 3. 3) for 2 min, in 1. 0 % CA solution (pH 2. 6) for 2 min, and in distilled water for 2 min as a control. The treated fruits in each treatment were then packaged in a <b>foam</b> <b>tray,</b> wrapped with 11 μm PVC film and stored at 5 °C, 95 % RH for 27 days. Pericarp browning, pericarp color, pericarp pH, titratable acidity (TA), weight loss, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and total phenol were monitored during storage. The results revealed that interaction betweenchitosan and CA demonstrated the best treatment in postponement of pericarp browning, which was indicated by the lowest browning index and high L* value, chroma, and hue angle. Based on browning index, the fruits treated with citric acid alone and the control fruits were not acceptable after 20 days, which those treated with both CA and chitosan were still acceptable after 27 days of storage. TA had a correlation with the pericarp pH and browning index. Chitosan mixed with citric acid exhibited a higher efficacy in preventing TA degradation in pericarp and maintaining low pericarp pH, compared to 1. 0 % CA treatment. In addition, low PPO activity and high total phenol content were found when CA was applied in combination withchitosan during storage...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a heat {{management}} PS <b>foam</b> <b>tray</b> containing an ultrathin fiber-structured PS/PCM coating was prepared by using high throughput electrohydrodynamic processing. To this end, polystyrene (PS) {{was used as}} the encapsulating matrix of a commercial phase change material (PCM) called RT 5 (a blend of paraffins with a transition temperature at 5 °C), by using the electrospinning technique. With the aim of imparting heat management capacity to the trays, the PS tray was coated by the PS/PCM ultrathin fiber mats and a soft heat treatment was applied to improve the adhesion between the layers. Results showed that RT 5 could be properly encapsulated inside the PS matrix, with a good encapsulation efficiency (ca. 78 %) and the developed PS fibers had a heat storage capacity equivalent to ∼ 34 wt. % of the neat PCM. The effect of storage time and temperature was evaluated on the heat storage capacity of the developed PS-trays with the ultrathin fiber-structured PS/PCM layer. The heat storage capacity was affected not only by the storage time, but also by the temperature. This work adds a new insight on the development of heat management polymeric materials of interest in food packaging applications, in order to preserve the quality of refrigerated packaged food products. Although the electrohydrodynamic processing seems to be a promising alternative to develop heat management materials, further works will be focused on the improvement of heat storage capacity and efficiency of the developed packaging materials along storage time.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2001. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{polystyrene}} <b>foam</b> <b>tray</b> {{manufacturing industry}} {{started with a}} monopoly in 1954, and lasted for more than 29 years. During {{the last ten years}} the industry has grown extremely competitive, seeing many new players enter (and exit) and a reduction in industry profitability. This mini thesis attempts to analyze the polystyrene <b>foam</b> <b>tray</b> manufacturing industry in its current form and to quantify the external, new challenges it currently faces. It attempts to identify potential pitfalls for new entrants to the industry and to construct an ideal strategy suited best for the industry, based on an industry analysis. The polystyrene foam container industry background is discussed to determine its origins in South Africa. An industry and competitive analysis is done to assess the strategically relevant aspects of the industry's macro environment. A technique developed by Thompson and Strickland (1998 : 68) is utilized. The scope of the macro environment in the mini-thesis was limited to the South African scenario. Ultimately, an ideal strategy, which would deal with all the relevant challenges of the industry, is proposed. The industry and competitive analysis revealed important dominant economic traits. Competition is concentrated in the country's economic hub, namely Gauteng, but regional manufacturing bases leads to extended market share in those areas. The product range spans over several hundred coloured, printed and laminated trays, but the fiercest competition across the board takes place in a few sizes white, commodity flat trays to the meat industry, which also forms the bulk of sales to the industry. The growth rate has been organic for the last few years, mainly due to the mature status of polystyrene <b>foam</b> <b>tray</b> products and the introduction of alternative (though more expensive) media. The external macro economic environment has also not been conducive to abnormally high growth (GDP in South Africa has drifted between 1 % and 3 % for the last few years). Five competitors exist, and two of these competitors have 80 % of the market share, but are also the furthest away from the largest part of the market, namely Gauteng. Customers are divided into two groups, distributors and end users. Small competitors make extensive use of distributors (since they do not own their own distribution channels), while large competitors limit the use of distributors to limit the potential buying power of distributors. The barrier to entry for a new entrant wanting to acquire up to 5 % of market share is around R 10 m, which includes working capital. The industry profitability varies from losses to extreme profits in some years. This becomes a vicious circle, since the latter attracts new entrants, which in turn causes price wars. Rivalry amongst competitive sellers is excessive, specifically when new entrants appear on the scene. Price cutting, although a very blunt tool, is used almost exclusively to obtain a volume advantage. Substitute products do not really pose a threat in the South African economic situation where cost is all-important. No other packaging medium can compete with the wide range of applicability, low cost and strength of polystyrene foam. Where end-user markets are more affluent, substitute products may have a minor impact. The power of suppliers in the industry is limited, since there is a manufacturing over capacity in the country, and there are no switching costs when changing from one supplier to another. The power of buyers, specifically ones that buy in bulk (distributors and the like), is thus quite strong. The main drivers of change include excessive movement in market pricing, product innovation, technological changes, increasing globalisation of the industry and changing societal concerns. Movement in market pricing {{is by far the most}} important and has the greatest affect on industry profitability, since the complete product range is affected. The latter four drivers affect mostly branded and speciality product. Strategic group mapping, combined with an in-depth analysis of each competitor, revealed that the largest two players, Kohler Versapak and Atlantic Forming, are definitely in the strongest position from a financial point of view. Although drawbacks such a corporate red tape, shareholder pressure and geographic location exist for these competitors, sheer financial strength to survive price wars will give them an edge. With the current amount of competitors and over capacity in the market there is bound to be some consolidation in the manufacturing industry. It seems that one of the larger two players (Kohler Versapak or Atlantic Forming) may acquire one of the smaller manufacturers in a bid to stabilize market prices. The most important key success factor is the ability to produce polystyrene foam trays at the lowest possible cost. The absence of switching costs, price wars and a manufacturing over capacity are all causes of the preceding success factor. Other less important success factors are distribution related (being close to the market is an advantage) and technology related (being able to develop advanced branded and functional trays). In its current status, where there is a supply-demand imbalance, the industry does not seem attractive. Although negative external forces such as environmental pressure, are limited, growth potential is limited and competition is fierce. In summary none of the competitors have attempted to utilize other tools than pricecutting to protect market share. From a geographic location point of view, Airshield and Mainpack are positioned best, but do not possess the financial momentum to optimally utilise their location in terms of finished product distribution and raw material acquisition. Atlantic Forming and Kohler Versapak seem to have expanded their product ranges to low profit and unprofitable products, while the other competitors have stayed focused on a few high volume items. It seems that it may have been a better idea for the larger players to utilize existing resources on other profitable media rather than expanding its interests in polystyrene foam trays. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Polistireen skuim houer vervaardiging het in 1954 met 'n monopolie begin wat vir 29 jaar staande gebly het. Gedurende die laaste tien jaar het die polistireen skuim industrie baie kompeterend geraak, met heelwat kompeterende maatskappye wat die mark betree het (en uitgetree het), en 'n gevolglike afname in industrie profyt gehad het. Hierdie minitesis poog om die polistireen skuim bakkie industrie te analiseer in sy huidige vorm en om die eksterne uitdagings wat tans bestaan, te identifiseer. Die tesis poog verder om potensiele probleme te identifiseer wat nuwe kompeterende maatskappye in die industrie mag teëkom, en dan om 'n ideale strategie saam te stel, gebasseer op 'n industrie analise. Die polistireen skuim houer industrie is bespreek, sodat die oorsprong van die industrie in Suid-Afrika bepaal kon word. 'n Industrie en kompeterende analise is gedoen om die strategies belangrike aspekte van die industrie se makro omgewing te bepaal. Vir die bogenoemde analise is 'n tegniek soos ontwikkel deur Thompson en Strickland (1998 : 68) gebruik. Die omvang van die makro omgewing in hierdie minitesis is beperk tot die Suid- Afrikaanse omgewing. Die uiteindelike ideale strategie sal al die relevante uitdagings van die industrie aanspreek. Die industrie en kompeterende analise het belangrike dominante ekonomiese eienskappe blootgelê. Markgerigte kompetisie is gekonsentreerd in die land se ekonomiese enjin, naamlik Gauteng, maar streeks gebaseerde vervaardigings aanlegte lei gewoonlik tot 'n verbeterde mark aandeel in 'n spesifieke streek. Die produk reeks bestaan uit honderde gekleurde, gedrukte en gelamineerde houers, maar die grootste kompetisie vind plaas oor slegs 'n paar plat, wit vleis bakkies - wat ook die grootste volume verkope in die industrie beslaan. Die groei tempo was organies vir die laaste paar jaar, hoofsaaklik as gevolg van die volwasse stand van polistireen skuim produkte en die bekendstelling van alternatiewe produkte. Die eksterne makro ekonomiese omgewing het ook nie bygedra tot bogemiddelde groei nie (BBP in Suid-Afrika het tussen I% en 3 % gewissel vir die laaste paar jaar). Vyf produseerders van polistireen skuim houers ding mee in die mark, en twee van hulle besit 80 % van die totale mark aandeel, alhoewel hulle ook die verste vanaf grootste mark, naamlik Gauteng, is. Kliënte word in twee groepe verdeel, naamlik verspreiders en eind-gebruikers. Klein produseerders maak meestal gebruik van verspreiders omdat hulle nie oor hulle eie verspreidings kanale beskik nie. Groter produseerders beperk die gebruik van verspreiders om uiteindelik potensiële koopkrag van verspreiders te beperk. Vaste kapitaal, asook lopende kapitaal om ongeveer 5 % van die mark te bekom, is ongeveer R 10 m. Die industrie profyt variëer tussen verliese tot oorgrote profyt in sommige jare. Hierdie variasie vorm 'n afbrekende sirkel, aangesien oorgrote profyt potensiële nuwe produseerders aantrek wat dan weer tot prys oorloë lei. Mededinging tussen kompeterende produseerders is oormatig sterk, spesifiek wanneer nuwe produseerders die mark betree. Alhoewel prys verlaging 'n redelike kru metode is om markaandeel te bekom, word dit amper uitsluitlik gebruik. Alternatiewe, duurder vervangings produkte is nie werklik 'n gevaar vir polistireen skuim produkte in Suid-Afrika nie, aangesien prys die belangrikste element is. Geen ander verpakkingsmedia kan meeding met die toepasbaarheid, lae koste en sterkte van polistireen skuim nie. Slegs in sekere wel-gestelde segmente van die mark kan alternatiewe produkte 'n minimale impak op die polistireen skuim mark toon. Die mag van verskaffers in die industrie is beperk, aangesien daar 'n geweldige oorkapasiteit in die land is en omdat daar geen oorskakelingskoste bestaan wanneer daar van een verskaffer tot 'n ander geskuif word nie. Die mag van kopers, en spesifiek die wat in grootmaat koop, is dus redelik sterk. Die hoofdrywers van verandering sluit in sterk beweging in mark pryse, produk innovasie, tegnologiese veranderinge, toenemende globalisering van die industrie en veranderende sosiale standaarde. Variëerende beweging van markpryse is by verre die belangrikste en het ook die grootste effek op industrie profyt, aangesien die hele produk reeks geraak word. Die laaste vier drywers affekteer meestal handelsmerk produkte en spesialiteits produkte. Strategiese groep kaarte, gekombineerd met 'n indiepte analise van elke produseerder, het aangedui dat die twee grootste kompeteerders, Kohler Versapak en Atlantic Forming, definitief in die sterkste posisie is vanaf 'n finansiële oogpunt gesien. Alhoewel negatiewe punte soos korporatiewe sloering, aandeelhouer druk en geografiese posisie teen die twee mededingers tel, sal blote finansiele mag om prys oorloë te deurstaan hulle die oorhand gee. Met die huidige hoeveelheid oorkapasiteit in die mark moet daar uiteraard konsolidasie in die vervaardigings industrie plaasvind. Dit is waarskynlik dat een van die groter spelers (Kohler Versapak of Atlantic Forming) van die kleiner mededingers mag bekom in 'n poging om die mark te stabiliseer. Die mees belangrike sleutel sukses faktor is die vermoë om polistireen skuim bakkies teen die laagste koste te vervaardig. Die afwesigheid van oorskakelingskoste, die aanwesigheid van prys oorloë en vervaardigings oorkapasiteit is almal oorsake van die genoemde sukses faktor. Ander minder belangrike sukses faktore is verspreidings verwante (om nabyaan die mark te wees is 'n voordeel) en tegnologie verwante (om handelmerk produkte en moderne funksionele produkte te kan ontwikkel) faktore. In die mark se huidige vorm is daar nie 'n vraag-aanbod balans nie, en lyk die industrie nie aantreklik nie. Alhoewel negatiewe eksterne kragte soos omgewings druk beperk is, is groei potensiaal ook beperk en kompetisie agressief. Opsommendergewys het geen van die mededingers ander metodes as prys verlaging probeer gebruik om mark aandeel te beskerm nie. Vanaf 'n geografiese oogpunt gesien, is Airshield en Mainpack die beste geposisioneer, maar hulle het nie die finansiële momentum om hulle posisie optimaal te benut in terme van klaar produk verspreiding en rou material aankope nie. Atlantic Forming en Kohler Versapak het hulle produk reeks uitgebrei na lae profit en verlies-lyende produkte, terwyl ander mededingers gefokus gebly het op 'n paar hoë volume items. Dit lyk asof dit beter sou gewees het vir die groter spelers om bestaande bronne te gebruik het op ander winsgewinde media as om verder uit te brei in polistireen skuim...|$|E

Harvested fruits were stored in polystyrene <b>foam</b> <b>trays</b> covered with two film types: {{linear low density polyethylene}} of 10 mu m thickness (PPL) or polyethylene film perforated with holes of 10 mm diameter spaced 50 mm (PP). Through 15 days storage at 0, 3 and 6 degrees C, fruits were analyzed for quality parameters. The strawberry tree fruits presented relevant qualitative properties and were appreciated by panelists. Color parameters (L*, h degrees, C*) had higher decrease at 3 and 6 degrees C than at 0 degrees C. The degrees Brix almost did not change and firmness decreased mainly in the first 4 days storage. Ethanol and weight loss increased with temperature mostly from 3 to 6 degrees C. Strawberry tree fruits are a good source of ascorbic acid, glucose, fructose, anthocyanins and antioxidant activity. Those properties are maintained through 15 days storage at 0 degrees C followed by 3 degrees C. Film covers showed no significant differences between them. The temperature of 0 degrees C was the best for preservation of fruit quality through 15 days shelf-life. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The application usually lasts for approximately four minutes, and patients should not rinse, eat, smoke, or drink for 30 minutes after application. The reason for this is to allow the teeth to absorb the fluoride into the tooth structure when it is at its highest concentration, without being interrupted. This aids in the repair of microscopic dental decay. There is no clinical evidence on the effectiveness of one-minute fluoride gel/foam applications. A specific benefit when using foam is that less product is required during application, which results in a lower fluoride dose and lessens the risk of accidental ingestion. Additionally, more research regarding the efficacy of fluoride foam is needed as the evidence for its effectiveness is not as strong compared to those of fluoride gels and varnish.|$|R

40|$|Even {{though the}} Lavandula species may be {{propagated}} by seeds, {{it should not}} be the preferred propagation method because it causes a great lack of uniformity. On the other hand, asexually propagated lavender crops would provide more homogeneous crops, and clones from high quality plant material would increase the odds for obtaining a higher quality essential oil. However, problems such as poor rooting and restrict market availability for superior clones have been a problem in vegetative propagation of the Lavandula species. The objective of this work was to define which type and size of cutting is more adequate for cutting propagation of L. dentata, a very productive Lavandula species. Cuttings with 5, 8, 10 or 13 cm and from the apical or basal parts of stems cut from L. dentata stock plants were placed in Plantmax HT® filled polystyrene <b>foam</b> <b>trays</b> and kept under intermittent mist system for two months. Averages of root number, length of the longest root, fresh and dry root weight, and percentage of rooting were evaluated. Apical cuttings combined 97. 9 % rooting with an average of 13. 2 roots per cutting and basal cuttings 93. 7 % rooting with 2. 98 roots per cutting. Apical cuttings with at least 10 cm in length were considered the most adequate for cutting propagation of L. dentata. Apesar de serem propagadas por sementes, as espécies de Lavandula deveriam ser preferencialmente propagadas por estaquia devido a grande falta de uniformidade causada pela primeira, enquanto que a propagação assexual da alfazema permite maior homogeneidade da lavoura e o uso de clones de alta qualidade aumentaria as chances de se obter óleo essencial de alta qualidade.

Polystyrene <b>foam</b> food <b>trays</b> for instance can be produced by first heating the thermoplastic foam sheet, causing the gas contained to build up pressure and expand, after which a vacuum pressure {{can be applied to}} draw the sheet in the required form on the mould. This production method appears to be a very sensitive process with respect to e. g. the sheet temperature, the pressures applied and the cooling time. More problems can be foreseen when for environmental reasons the blowing agent will be adapted (for instance replaced by a gas with a lower molecular weight). To gain more insight in the occuring phenomena the large deformations of a foam structure have been analysed using finite element modelling. To this end a constitutive model has to be defined. Starting from the basic theory given by Gibson & Ashby [1], the behaviour of a closed cubic cell has been elaborated for large strains. The total stiffness is then the sum of the contributions of the edges and faces of the cell and the gas contained in it. The large deformations cause anisotropy of the cells [2], which influences their tangential stiffness. The constitutive model developed here includes the effects of internal gas pressure and the evolving anisotropy...|$|R

40|$|Thermoplastic {{cellulose}} acetate (CA) is a bio-based polymer with optical, mechanical and thermal properties {{comparable to those}} of polystyrene (PS). The substitution of the predominant petrol-based PS in applications like <b>foamed</b> food <b>trays</b> can lead to a more sustainable economic practice. However, CA is also suitable for more durable applications as the biodegradability rate can be controlled by adjusting the degree of substitutions. The extrusion foaming of CA still has to overcome certain challenges. CA is highly hydrophilic and can suffer from hydrolytic degradation if not dried properly. Therefore, the influence of residual moisture on the melt viscosity is rather high. Beyond, the surface quality of foam CA sheets is below those of PS due to the particular foaming behaviour. This paper presents results of a recent study on extrusion foamed CA, using a two-component physical blowing agent system compromising HFO 1234 ze as blowing agent and organic solvents as co-propellant. Samples with different co-propellants are processed on a laboratory single screw extruder at IKV. Morphology and surface topography are investigated with respect to the blowing agent composition and the die pressure. In addition, relationships between foam density, foam morphology and the propellants are analysed. The choice of the co-propellant has a significant influence on melt-strength, foaming behaviour and the possible blow-up ratio of the sheet. Furthermore, a positive influence of the co-propellant on the surface quality can be observed. In addition, the focus is laid on the effect of external contact cooling of the foamed sheets after the die exit...|$|R

40|$|Taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott) is an {{important}} food crop cultivated for its edible tubers in Ghana. In May 2009, outbreaks of a destructive leaf disease were observed on several taro farms in the Atiwa, East- Akim, Fanteakwa, West-Akim, and New Juaben districts of the Eastern Region of Ghana. Symptoms began on leaves as small, brown, water-soaked lesions that enlarged and coalesced into large lesions with yellow exudate, ultimately leading to the defoliation and death of plants. Symptoms were suggestive of taro leaf blight (TLB) caused by Phytophthora colocasiae Raciborski (3). By August 2010, the disease had spread to other taro-growing regions in Ghana. To identify the pathogen, leaf tissue from lesion margins were excised and plated on carrot agar and V 8 selective media for Phytophthora and incubated at 27 °C for 5 days (2). Growth from diseased tissue was used for morphological characterization. Sporangia were ovoid, hyaline, papillate, caducous, 30 to 60 × 17 to 28 μm, and pedicels were 3. 5 to 10 μm long. Genomic DNA was isolated from pure cultures of two isolates, PCg 11 - 2 from Oseim (6 ° 15 ′N, 0 ° 27 ′E) and PCg 11 - 5 from Oyoko (6 ° 8 ′N, 0 ° 17 ′W). Ribosomal DNA ITS 1, 5. 8 S and ITS 2 were amplified by PCR using the ITS 1 and ITS 4 primers (4). The resultant 784 -bp amplicons were sequenced (GenBank Accession Nos. JN 662439 and JN 662440). Sequences of both isolates were identical. A BLASTn search of these sequences revealed maximum homology of 99 % with the sequence of P. colocasiae strains from blighted taro leaves in Nigeria (GenBank Accession No. HQ 602756), Hawaii (GenBank Accession No. GU 258997), and several strains in Asia and the South Pacific. On the basis of morphological characteristics and nucleotide homology, the isolates were identified as P. colocasiae. To fulfill Koch's postulates, 30 leaf discs from 3 -month-old plants were inoculated with 10 μl of a suspension of 3 × 105 zoospores per ml (2). Leaf discs were incubated in the dark at 27 °C on wet <b>foam</b> in plastic <b>trays</b> for 5 days. All inoculated discs developed blight symptoms similar in appearance to those observed on diseased taro in the fields. Control discs remained asymptomatic.

40|$|Development of {{biomaterials}} {{is crucial}} for progress {{in the field of}} tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The intention of biomaterials is to interface with biological systems to evaluate, treat, augment or replace any tissue, organ or function of the body. The utility of alginate as a biomaterial in tissue engineering has recently gained increasing interest. A wide variety of uses have been identified including regeneration of various tissues, delivery vehicles for bioactive molecules such as drugs, growth factors and genes, implantable space filling agents and as artificial extracellular matrices (ECM) providing support for cells in both in vivo and in vitro systems. The present work describes the development and characterization of a novel type of macroporous alginate based foams. The alginate foam is prepared by the steps of: (i) high shear mixing for incorporation of air into a viscous solution containing alginate, water, plasticizer, foaming agent and a source of gelling ions that is insoluble at neutral conditions (calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) /strontium carbonate (SrCO 3)), (ii) addition of a hydrolyzing glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) that induce slow dissolution of the carbonate salt, (iii) transfer of the wet <b>foam</b> into <b>trays</b> for gelation, and (iv) air drying to receive pliable and soft sheets of foams. The gelation method is well known for preparation of homogeneous alginate hydrogels, however, it has not before been utilized for preparation of macroporous dried alginate foams. Pore structure, hydration properties, mechanical properties, degradability and biocompatibility are all highly relevant for the functionality of a biomaterial scaffold. The flexibility of the method allows tuning of these properties by process and formulation parameters. The mechanisms that were influenced in the preparation process to modify the foam properties were (a) the foam density controlled by the amount of air incorporated, (b) coalescence and gelling rate of the wet foam before drying controlled by the amount of air incorporated, amount and type of gelling ion and alginate, and gelling time, (c) gel network controlled by the amount and type of gelling ion and alginate, and gelling time, (d) weight average molecular weight (MW) controlled by technique for terminal sterilization. A rabbit study was conducted to evaluate biocompatibility and degradability of the foam in vivo. Intramuscular implantation of alginate foam discs showed degradation rates related to concentration of gelling calcium ions (Ca 2 +) and MW. No adverse systemic signs or mortality were noted and body weights and organ weights of the rabbits were unaffected. Implantation-related inflammation changed over time as typically seen in a healing process and a transient foreign body reaction occurred that mirrored the foam degradation. The overall results showed that the foams were well tolerated. To investigate the possibility of using alginate foams as scaffolds for 3 -dimentional (3 D) cell cultivation, a new technique for cell immobilization was utilized to ensure gentle and fast entrapment of cells that were evenly distributed throughout the thickness of the foam. First the cells were suspended in an alginate solution and applied to a Ca alginate foam. As the solution was absorbed by the foam, the pore walls became rehydrated and Ca 2 + diffused from the foam and induced gelation of the added alginate solution in situ filling the foam pores. Thereby cells were entrapped in a transparent foam-gel composite structure. The cells were cultured in such gels for extended periods and different types of multicellular structures were formed inside. Isolation of cells and intact multicellular structures were possible due to the de-gelling properties of citrate which chelates divalent cations, hence the gel dissolves. High viability of cells was retained inside the gels and controlled modification of the cell-matrix interactions were demonstrated by inclusion of alginates with covalently attached peptide sequences. The peptide sequence used was glycine-arginine-aspartic acid-glycine-proline (GRDGSP), which is present on several ECM proteins and function as a cell adhesion motif. This facilitated cell-matrix interactions which stimulated proliferation in a dose dependent manner, although variations in sensitivity between the different types of cells were seen. Tunable elastic properties of the gels were shown over the range of 1 - 16 kPa, hence the elasticity can be optimized for different cell types and matches the elasticity of different soft tissues. The applicability of macroporous alginate foams as biomaterials was demonstrated here. The demonstrated mechanistic and functional relationships between operational and formulation parameters {{can be used as a}} tool to tailor physical and biological properties. Good biocompatibility was confirmed by in vivo animal studies in addition to in vitro cell cultivation studies. PhD i bioteknologiPhD in Biotechnolog...|$|R
