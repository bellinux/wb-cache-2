40|$|A {{series of}} Monte Carlo neutron {{calculations}} for a combined gamma/passive neutron coincidence counter has been performed. This type of detector, {{part of a}} suite of non-destructive assay instruments utilised for {{the enforcement of the}} <b>Euratom</b> nuclear <b>safeguards</b> within the European Union, is to be used for high accuracy measurements of the plutonium content of nuclear materials. The multi-purpose Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code version 4 B has been used to model in detail the neutron coincidence detector and to investigate the leakage self-multiplication of PuO 2 and Mixed U-Pu Oxide (MOX) reference samples used to calibrate the instrument. The MCNP calculations have been used together with a neutron coincidence counting interpretative model to determine characteristic parameters of the detector. A comparative study to both experimental and previous numerical results has been performed. Sensitivity curves of the variation of the detector's efficiency, epsilon, to the (alpha,n), to spontaneous fission neutron emission rate ratio, alpha, and to the reals coincidence gate utilisation factor, fr, are presented. Once bias-corrected, the trends of the real coincidence counts rate as a function of sample mass for three types of sample could be matched within 0. 33 % of experimental results. This result confirms the possible use of MCNP to calculate response trends accurately {{for a wide variety of}} source materials, given a limited experimental calibration set. Sources of the inaccuracy in the calculations have not yet been fully investigated, because of the vast parameter space to be investigated, but values of the coincidence gate utilisation factor derived directly from the MCNP data have been found to be overestimated by about 8. 2 %.

Since essential internal electronic chips of the MCA- 166 are not provided any more IAEA and the German support program to the IAEA decided to endorse {{the development of a}} follower instrument, the MCA- 527, with the same company. The performance of this new instrument was tested with respect to parameters, which are essential for safeguards applications: Dead time correction for U enrichment measurements, peak shape for high resolution applications MGA and MGAU, high count rate performance with CdZnTe detectors for spent nuclear fuel, temperature stability of the MCA itself. The tests cover all important detector types applied by IAEA and EURATOM: NaI, NaI with internal Am source, planar Ge, coaxial Ge, LaBr 3, and CdZnTe detectors. The tests were made with nuclear materials U and Pu, and with 137 Cs and 60 Co to simulate spent nuclear fuel. They cover count rate ranges up to about 70 000 … 100 000 cps for U and Pu and with CdZnTe detectors up to 300 000 cps. The report provides a series of setup files for different detector types. The result of the test is: The performance of the MCA- 527 meets the functional requirements for gamma spectrometric measurements for nuclear safeguards applications. Its parameters are as good as or the ones of the MCA- 166 or superior to them. The MCA- 527 can also be used for neutron measurements in List mode.

40|$|Reliable {{measurements}} {{are needed for}} the verification measures of States’ declarations of their nuclear activities in line with international agreements and the EURATOM Treaty. Laboratories carrying out measurements of nuclear material need to follow stringent quality control concepts and are required to demonstrate their measurement capabilities on a regular and timely basis to legal and Safeguards authorities. This includes participation in interlaboratory comparisons (ILCs). In {{the frame of the}} Regular European Interlaboratory Measurement Evaluation Programme (REIMEP) a new ILC (REIMEP- 17) was jointly organized by the EC-Joint Research Centre-Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (JRC-IRMM) and EC-Joint Research Centre-Institute for Transuranium Elements (JRC-ITU) for <b>EURATOM</b> and IAEA <b>safeguards</b> laboratories, nuclear plant operators and nuclear material laboratories. The focus in REIMEP- 17 was on measurements of the uranium and plutonium amount contents, and isotope amount ratios in synthetic input solutions. Participants received two test samples, REIMEP- 17 A and REIMEP 17 B, with different uranium and plutonium amount contents. Laboratories were requested to report the results with associated uncertainties applying their standard measurement procedures, and had the possibility to benchmark those results against the independent assigned (reference) values and the International Target Values for Measurement Uncertainties in Safeguarding Nuclear Materials (ITV 2010). It can be concluded that the participants in REIMEP- 17 performed well for the measurements of uranium and plutonium amount content in compliance with the respective ITV 2010. In particular, the measurement performance for the isotope amount ratios was very satisfactory for both REIMEP- 17 test samples. This confirms the measurement capabilities of laboratories in the field of nuclear material analysis and demonstrates that the stringent ITV 2010 are achievable target values under state-of-practice conditions. On the other hand, the spread of results for the minor uranium isotope amount ratios was larger. Moreover, for some of the measurands, differences in the measurement uncertainty estimations provided by laboratories were observed even when using the same instrumental technique. A summary of the participant results is presented and discussed in this paper. JRC. D. 4 -Standards for Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguard...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} verify {{declared}} nuclear activities for safeguards purposes, high-performance analyses {{are a key}} element. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission runs for this purpose the Analytical Service at JRC-ITU, and {{on behalf of the}} Directorate Gerneral (DG) ENERGY (<b>Euratom</b> <b>Safeguards)</b> the two on site laboratories, at Sellafield, UK, and at La Hague, F. Destructive analyses provide highest accuracy and precision and therefore are part of the analytical techniques used. The isotopic composition and concentration of uranium and plutonium and analysis of impurities are performed using isotope dilution thermal ionisation mass spectrometry, titration, inductively coupled mass spectrometry, and carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen element content assay by fusion extraction. Reference materials play a crucial role to guarantee traceability, accuracy, and comparability of safeguard analyses. All three laboratories have different approaches in choosing the reference materials due to the local requirements. JRC-ITU produces internal reference materials complementary to certified reference material.

40|$|Micro-particles {{containing}} actinides are {{of interest}} for risk assessments of contaminated areas, nuclear forensic analyses, and IAEA as well as <b>Euratom</b> <b>safeguards</b> programs. For their analysis, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) has been established as the state-of-the-art standard technique. In the case of actinide mixtures within the particles, however, SIMS suffers from isobaric interferences (e. g., 238 U/ 238 Pu, 241 Am/ 241 Pu). This can be eliminated by applying resonance ionization mass spectrometry {{which is based on}} stepwise resonant excitation and ionization of atoms with laser light, followed by mass spectrometric detection of the produced ions, combining high elemental selectivity with the analysis of isotopic compositions. This paper describes the instrumental modifications for coupling a commercial time-of-flight (TOF) -SIMS apparatus with three-step resonant post-ionization of the sputtered neutrals using a high-repetition-rate (kHz) Nd:YAG laser pumped tunable titanium:sapphire laser system. Spatially resolved ion images obtained from actinide-containing particles in TOF-SIMS mode demonstrate the capability for isotopic and spatial resolution. Results from three-step resonant post-ionization of bulk Gd and Pu samples successfully demonstrate the high elemental selectivity of this process. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear safeguards and Securit...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new seal for dry storage containers with nuclear material. Currently, sealing of dry storage casks containing spent fuel presents various challenges to safeguards inspectors. Continuity of knowledge {{needs to be}} reliably maintained over periods of time that can be decades. Seal replacements and verification, require significant Inspector efforts, radiological dose, and is continuing to grow. A decrease in Inspector effort is required and fail-safe redundancy is sought. These needs called {{for the development of}} a new compact sealing bolt covering these requirements. The Ultrasonic Optical Sealing Bolt (UOSB) is based on the JRC Candu Sealing System (JCSS), which is approved for safeguards use by IAEA and <b>EURATOM</b> <b>safeguards.</b> The new seal includes the same integrity element with the same identity element In addition, the UOSB integrates the additional element of a Fibre Optical Cable (FOC). This construction is in principal two seals-in-one allowing versatility. After several design iterations, field trials and a positive Vulnerability Assessment, the UOSB design was finalized. The first UOSBs, combined with EOSS and Cobra seals, were installed on dry storage containers at the Ignalina nuclear power plant (Lithuania) in June 2014.

40|$|Sweden is {{planning}} to store nuclear spent fuel in long-term geological repositories. Copper canisters with a ductile iron insert will preserve the fuel {{for thousands of years}} at a depth of about 500 m in Swedish bedrock. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and <b>Euratom</b> <b>safeguards</b> inspectorates have to maintain the continuity of knowledge (CoK) during transport and deposition of canisters from the encapsulation plant to the final repository. The aim of this paper is then oriented to provide such CoK for canisters by an identification and authentication based on ultrasound. This paper describes an authentication method oriented to prevent falsification of copper canisters. According to the ultrasonic investigation of the friction stir welding process of the copper lid onto the cylindrical tube, the ultrasonic response of the remaining gap partially filled during the welding is used as a unique pattern for authentication. The analysis of various measurements made on angular sections of copper lids friction stir welded onto the tube revealed the feasibility of acquisition of a valuable signal from the reflection of the internal gap. Following the observations on this data set, a possible technical design is detailed, where the identification and authentication methods can be combined with immersion probes. JRC. G.

40|$|The digital MCA- 527 [1] was {{developed}} by GBS Electronik as follower instrument of the MiniMCA- 166, which cannot be produced any more due to missing electronic chips. The instrument was successfully tested for use by IAEA and <b>EURATOM</b> <b>safeguards</b> inspectors [2]. In {{the course of the}} tests it was understood that this same piece of hardware can be used for correlated and multiplicity counting as well. A dedicated firmware version and a user software, WinTimeStamps, were developed by the instrument provider. Test results for this application show that the instrument, operated in its basic mode (“EDGE” mode) fulfils the requirements for correlated neutron counting. Due {{to the fact that the}} MCA- 527 is not a dedicated neutron counter but a multichannel analyzer, it is slower than established neutron counting devices; however this is of no real relevance for most of the safeguards inspection applications. Further study of the signal flow resulted in the development of a new signal evaluation method which integrates rather than counts TTL signals. The method is implemented as “Advanced High Count Rate” mode (“AHCR” mode). In this mode, the MCA- 527 is faster than the other established neutron counters. The paper presents some relevant measurement results both for gamma spectrometry and neutron counting device. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|E

For nuclear safeguards these are the <b>Euratom</b> <b>safeguards</b> and the IAEA Network of Analytical laboratories (IAEA-NWAL). For nuclear forensics, the laboratories are mainly members of the Nuclear Forensics International Technical Working Group (ITWG). Metrological quality control tools are a means to establish accurate, traceable and comparable measurement results. The European Commission-Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) has therefore put effort into the development of certified reference materials and the provision of conformity assessment tools, particularly for "age-dating" of uranium and plutonium samples, which is of importance to both communities. In this context the new IRMM- 1000 a and IRMM- 1000 b, certified for the production date based on the 230 Th/ 234 U radiochronometer, will be presented, and the results from the Regular European Inter-laboratory Measurement Evaluation Programme (REIMEP- 22) on 'U Age Dating' will be discussed. Furthermore the status of the on-going development of a 243 Am spike reference material in the frame of the recently signed collaboration agreement between the EC-JRC and the CEA/DEN will be presented.

In this area JRC is an un-replaceable R&D partner of <b>Euratom</b> <b>safeguards</b> authority and IAEA through its very extensive support programme. The JRC R&D safeguards programme aims in one hand at maintaining traditional safeguards at level so that deterrence to diversion from civil cycle remains high, {{taking into account that}} more installations will need to be safeguarded by EU and international authorities. This relies on development of advanced NDA, DA and CS techniques, full remote and unattended (authenticated) technology and stringent quality systems in measurements and results delivery. In another hand the RD programme put more focus on material flows in sensitive uranium and spent fuel handling facilities and use of fingerprinting techniques to cover diversion scenarios and more performing and accurate environmental sampling techniques and traces analysis. Open-source analysis and development of new tools and methodologies for the control of Import/export are areas where the effort is also increased. In the JRC R&D programme a special attention is also given to the development of accountancy and safeguards concepts for advanced fuel cycles (GenIV) as well as proliferation resistance methodology.

ABACC expressed interest in having access to two new Safeguards capabilities based on two JRC technologies approved for Safeguards use by both EURATOM and IAEA. This four-year cooperation project is funded by the European Commission Directorate General for Development and Cooperation – EuropeAid (DEVCO), under the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation (INSC). The new capabilities to be created at ABACC are: (i) Verification of complex plant design and lay-out ("as-is") and (ii) Containment of Spent Fuel in a complex Storage Environment. This is to be achieved by transferring to ABACC two JRC-owned technologies: (a) 3 D Laser Verification System and (b) Ultrasonic Seals. The development of the two technologies to be transferred were funded by JRC's internal work-programme and targeted to Safeguards under the framework of the European Commission Support Programme to the IAEA (tasks EC-E- 1425 and EC-E- 1559). The transfer of technologies includes a set of comprehensive training actions and field support activities. Close coordination with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) takes place during the whole project’s lifetime.

These discussions have been related to and concentrated on, among other aspects, the improvement of future nuclear safeguards effectiveness and efficiency within the Community. This debate resulted in a 'non-paper' issued by the Council¿s Working Party on Atomic Questions (WPAQ) entitled ¿A New Framework for Euratom Safeguards¿. The WPAQ non-paper describes audits as a tool that can play a role in problem resolution and to check that the relevant standards are in place and being implemented effectively. Since the publication of the WPAQ non-paper, the Commission has undertaken the necessary steps to organise trial audits in a number of nuclear facilities in order to evaluate this new tool for the verification of the performance of the operator's nuclear material accounting and control (NMAC) systems. This paper is a report on the initial planning, preparation, and organisation of the first audit trials to be carried out as part of the proposed new framework related to the nuclear safeguards approach of the Commission for nuclear installations in the European Union.

The four plants in the UK (Magnox, Thorp) and France (UP 2, UP 3) were built in two sites. Thorough analysis concluded that sampling is needed; the transport of the samples to a central Euratom laboratory should be avoided. It was decided to establish laboratories {{on the site of}} Sellafield and La Hague. These laboratories were opened about ten years ago and have been working continuously. They are staffed by experts of the Institute for Transuranium Elements, JRC-ITU, at Karlsruhe. ITU staff is present on-site for more than 40 weeks per year, ensuring a continuous flow of samples and of results. The laboratories receive samples from all the plants on the respective sites, with input solution, plutonium products (including mixed oxides) and inventory samples being the most important type of material. The criteria for selection of the measurement methods for these samples are based on a combination of highest possible accuracy and a minimum of resource consumption. The data can be used for direct comparison with the operator¿s results and they allow an evaluation of the material flows and material balance in a timely manner. The paper will give an overview of 10 years of operation of the laboratories. Emphasis will be on analytical techniques, measurement uncertainties, and on the renovation of measurement equipment, which is becoming a serious issue after ten years of operation.

40|$|The European Union and the United States of America have {{a common}} {{interest}} that nuclear material is managed worldwide in the most secure way. Nuclear material safeguards should apply worldwide and meet the highest possible standards, and necessary steps {{need to be taken}} to prevent dissemination of nuclear weapons of mass destruction. The EU and the US have a long standing tradition to cooperate towards this aim. In 1995 the European Atomic Energy Community and the United States Department of Energy concluded an ‘Agreement in the field of nuclear material safeguards research and development’. During the IAEA Safeguards Symposium, on 2. 11. 2010 a new ‘Agreement in the field of nuclear material safeguards and security research and development’ with enhanced scope was signed by Euratom and the DOE, replacing the first one. The Agreement of 1995 has been decisive in shaping the technical cooperation between the two organisations. It provided a platform for a number of US laboratories to work closely with the relevant services of the European Commission: the laboratories of the Joint Research Centre and the <b>Euratom</b> <b>Safeguards</b> Directorate, which applies many of the results in its own inspections and has helped to make some new techniques also available to the IAEA. The paper will report on some of the significant achievements seen throughout the years. A number of projects selected from the areas of non-destructive assay, destructive assay, modelling and calculations, surveillance and training will be discussed. An outlook on potential future activities under the new Agreement will be given. In addition to nuclear safeguards activities, which remain in the focus of the cooperation, the scope of the new Agreement includes areas such as nuclear forensics, proliferation resistance and technical aspects of export control. Increasing emphasis will also be on training activities in both nuclear safeguards and security. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear security (Ispra...|$|E
40|$|Research and {{development}} (R&D) in nuclear safeguards, nonproliferation, and nuclear {{security is a}} cornerstone of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) Nuclear Safety and Security Work Program. The main stakeholders are the <b>Euratom</b> <b>safeguards</b> authority and the International Atomic Energy Agency and close contact is maintained with the nuclear facility plant operators. More recent customers include, e. g., authorities dealing with trade of sensitive goods and those dealing with nuclear security measures. This paper illustrates {{a number of the}} latest JRC safeguards and nonproliferation related developments, describing the rationale for the R&D, the recent achievements, the continuing challenges, and the outlook for deployment in future nuclear fuel cycle facilities and activities. With respect to the nuclear materials verification, examples of recent developments focus on {{the front end of the}} nuclear fuel cycle, high-level quality systems, and quality control tools for the measurements in enrichment and reprocessing facilities and the fuel cycle back end. At the facility level, continued emphasis is put on enhanced process monitoring and modeling of material flows, advanced sealing and surveillance techniques, and unattended and remotely operated systems. Both inside and outside the facility, environmental sampling and other verification methods (e. g., laser-based methods and satellite imagery) continue to pose challenges. With respect to the overall evaluation and/or verification of state activities and capabilities, open-source analysis, mainly focusing on trade of sensitive technologies, proves to provide significant potential. Finally at the conceptual level, the activities of safeguards by design and assessment of proliferation resistance of future nuclear fuel cycles allow to both assess and integrate the developments previously referred to. The paradigm of nuclear safety, security and safeguards is also shortly touched upon in this paper. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|E
40|$|Safeguards equipment, in particular, {{electronic}} systems designated for unattended operation, {{has to be}} designed and approved for failure-free operation under different environmental conditions, e. g. nuclear or ionising radiation. Irradiation testing has to be performed {{in order to ensure}} the safe and reliable use as well as long-term survivability of electronic safeguards equipment in radiation environments typically occurring in nuclear installations. If radiation survivability measures are established already in the design stage of an electronic module when appropriate components such as microprocessors are being selected the time delay and additional costs will be negligible. Hitherto, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the <b>Euratom</b> <b>Safeguards</b> Authority were missing agreed test procedures and criteria for the qualification of safeguards equipment. Therefore, guidelines were developed for the application of universal measurement methods in irradiation tests. The radiation environments were adopted as defined in the draft version 2. 04 of the proposal "Common Qualification Test Criteria for New Safeguards Equipment". These criteria have been worked out jointly by IAEA and Euratom. Depending on the radiation level the tested equipment is categorised into three classes: standard, high class and special application. The paper addresses the physical background of permanent damage and temporary malfunction of electronic or photonic systems, the guidelines for nuclear radiation testing of safeguards equipment, the criteria applied, and the statistical methods to be used. Test techniques have been defined for irradiation testing and parts control which, if applied, provide assurance that each delivered system will meet the radiation requirements. Guidance is given for managing the tests and templates for each sort of irradiation test. A set of templates was designed for the complete test documentation. The present document draws upon existing test and measurement standards. The described test methods are independent of any specific safeguards system. These test procedures and criteria have to reviewed and, if necessary, revised according to the experience gained...|$|E
40|$|Radiation test {{criteria}} {{adopted by}} the IAEA and Euratom for safeguards equipment were evaluated with respect to reliability and safety in nuclear radiation environments. The proposed set of test criteria is not complete. The proposed irradiation values for level 1 ("standard") and level 2 ("high class") have been compared with values measured {{in the field and}} typical radiation protection limits and found to be acceptable. The proposed irradiation level 3 ("special application") seems to be arbitrary, and, therefore, further consideration is suggested. Supplements and recommendations for the test criteria and the irradiation tests are proposed. The test criteria are applicable for the EOSS seal in expected radiation environments in nuclear facilities. The Electronic Optical Sealing System (EOSS) was developed by Dr. Neumann Consultants for safeguards applications by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the <b>Euratom</b> <b>Safeguards</b> Office (Euratom). The tests of the EOSS seal with fast and thermal neutrons and gammas had been carried out at the Prater Reactor in Vienna by the Vienna Technical University under contract of the IAEA without participation of FhG-INT. All the measurement records of the irradiation tests made available to FhG-INT were evaluated. According to the tester, the tested seals passed all levels for all radiation types. Because of a lack of definitions of pass and fail criteria, test parameters, dosimetry etc. FhG-INT cannot conclude that the EOSS seal can be used in the field up to the specified irradiation levels. We propose to repeat all radiation tests with 5 to 10 devices after the test criteria have been revised and detailed test specification for the test of the EOSS seal have been agreed between IAEA, the supplier and the tester. The radiation safety analysis of the seal components leads to the conclusion that in the field no problems should be encountered. The implemented lithium batteries can be used in radiation environments, because the temperature in the batteries will not rise due to radiation, no significant amount of gas will be generated, and activation will be low. The neutron-induced radioactivity of the EOSS seal will be rather low, except under accelerated irradiation tests or certain "special application" conditions in the field...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{safeguards}} {{is based}} on international agreements and in the EU has the rank of European law (Euratom Treaty, Chapter VII, Euratom regulation 302 / 2005) ensuring that materials usable in both peaceful and military applications – such as uranium and plutonium – are used for peaceful purposes only. Physical verification measurements at nuclear facilities, such as reprocessing and fuel fabrication plants, {{are a part of}} safeguards inspections. The reliability of measurement results in nuclear material accountancy and verification is indispensable for an effective safeguards system. A new external quality control campaign, REIMEP- 17 on "Plutonium and uranium amount content, and isotope amount ratios in synthetic input solution" was organised by JRC-IRMM in cooperation with JRC-ITU, particularly for <b>EURATOM</b> <b>safeguards</b> (DG ENER) laboratories and the IAEA Network of Analytical Laboratories for nuclear material analysis (IAEA-NWAL), as well as for laboratories from industry and experts in the field. Participating laboratories in REIMEP- 17 received two samples with undisclosed U, Pu amount content and n(238 Pu) /n(239 Pu), n(240 Pu) /n(239 Pu), n(241 Pu) /n(239 Pu) n(242 Pu) /n(239 Pu) and n(234 U) /n(238 U), n(235 U) /n(238 U), n(236 U) /n(238 U) amount ratio values. One of the samples, REIMEP 17 A had uranium and plutonium amount contents typical for undiluted spent nuclear fuel input solution and the other sample, REIMEP- 17 B was a diluted fraction of it. The participants were requested to apply their standard analytical procedures and report the results with the associated uncertainties. The laboratories were also requested to complete and return a questionnaire so that an overall picture of the laboratories’ capabilities could be made. REIMEP- 17 was announced to participants in April 2012. Sixteen laboratories registered for REIMEP 17. Due to delays in the shipment of the samples and problems with the transport containers, three laboratories were not able to receive the samples. Three laboratories withdrew their participation. Consequently, the deadline for submitting the results had to be extended until July 1, 2013. In the end JRC-IRMM received results from nine laboratories; one laboratory did not submit the results. The reported measurement results have been evaluated against the independent reference values by means of z-scores and zeta-scores in compliance with international guidelines. In general the REIMEP- 17 participants' results were satisfactory and in compliance with the International Target Values for Measurement Uncertainties in Safeguarding Nuclear Materials (ITV 2010). This report presents the REIMEP- 17 participants' results; including the evaluation of the questionnaire. JRC. D. 4 -Standards for Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguard...|$|E
40|$|The Additional Protocol (AP) authorizes {{safeguards}} {{authorities to}} verify the absence of undeclared nuclear activities {{in all parts of}} a state’s nuclear fuel cycle as well as any other location where nuclear material is or may be present. As a part of the Additional Protocol, environmental sampling has become an important tool for the detection of non-declared nuclear activities. In environmental sampling, swipe samples are collected for bulk and particle analysis. Considering the potential consequences of the analyses, these measurements need to be subjected to a rigorous quality management system. The Nuclear Signatures Inter-laboratory Measurement Evaluation Programme (NUSIMEP) was established in 1996 to support the growing need to trace and measure the isotopic abundances of elements characteristic for the nuclear fuel cycle present in trace amounts in the environment. NUSIMEP- 8 focused on measurements of low-level uranium and plutonium in synthetic nitrate solution aiming to support <b>EURATOM</b> <b>safeguards</b> (DG ENER), the IAEA Network of Analytical Laboratories (NWAL) for bulk analysis of environmental samples and laboratories in the field. The NUSIMEP- 8 solution was prepared from mixed oxide fuel dissolved in nitric acid with addition of natural uranium and diluted to an environmental level. Participating laboratories in NUSIMEP- 8 received one sample solution with undisclosed values of n(238 Pu) /n(239 Pu), n(240 Pu) /n(239 Pu), n(241 Pu) /n(239 Pu), n(242 Pu) /n(239 Pu) and n(234 U) /n(238 U), n(235 U) /n(238 U), n(236 U) /n(238 U) amount ratios. Those isotope amount ratios were measured by participating laboratories using their routine analytical procedures. Measurement of the major isotope ratios n(235 U) /n(238 U) and n(240 Pu) /n(239 Pu) were obligatory; measurement of the minor isotope ratios were optional. 25 laboratories registered for NUSIMEP- 8, three withdrew the registration while one laboratory encountered problems with the shipment of the sample. Finally, 19 participants have reported measurement results using different analytical techniques, among those 10 NWAL laboratories. Two participants did not report their results due to technical problems. The participant measurement results have been evaluated against the certified reference values by means of z-scores and zeta-scores in compliance with ISO 13528 : 2005. The NUSIMEP- 8 results were overall satisfactory and in compliance with the IAEA Measurement Quality Goals for the analysis of bulk environmental samples. This report presents the NUSIMEP- 8 participant results; including the evaluation of the questionnaire. In addition feedback from the measurement communities in nuclear safeguards, nuclear security and environmental sciences was collected in view of identifying future needs for NUSIMEP inter-laboratory comparisons.
