50|$|Batches of {{pigmented}} plaster (ground alabaster or gypsum) modified {{with animal}} glue {{are applied to}} molds, armatures and pre-plastered wall planes {{in a manner that}} accurately mimics natural stone, breccia and marble. In one technique, veining is created by <b>drawing</b> <b>strands</b> of raw silk saturated in pigment through the plaster mix. Another technique involves trowelling on several layers of translucent renders and randomly cutting back to a previous layer to achieve colour differential similar to jasper. When dry, the damp surface was pumiced smooth, then buffed with a linen cloth impregnated with Tripoli (a siliceous rottenstone) and charcoal; finally it was buffed with oiled felt; beeswax was sometimes used for this purpose. Because the colours are integral to the plaster, the pattern is more resistant to scratching than with other techniques, such as painting on wood.|$|R

This book helps satiate the demand for legal resources to support the M 2 ̆ 6 A community in Singapore, more particularly the legal professionals. The goal in this book has been {{to address the needs of}} the professional and academic communities alike, which is manifested in its title that encompasses both “law and practice”. The book is intended to operate as an aid to M 2 ̆ 6 A practitioners who are involved in the structuring and implementation of transactions. In addition, it is also aimed at litigation professionals whose services are drawn upon when an M 2 ̆ 6 A deal is one that requires a ex ante sanction of the court of law or one that presents itself before a court due to disputes that require resolution. Apart from discussing the law and its implications on transactions, we make a conscious effort to distill the background and rationale to specific rules and principles and their evolution, which we believe will be of benefit to students and professionals seeking an initiation into the field of M 2 ̆ 6 A. In certain areas, we also make normative observations about reforms that need to be introduced to the current legal regime, in the modest hope that the legislative reformers, the regulators and the courts may <b>draw</b> <b>strands</b> from these, as they may deem appropriate...|$|R

5000|$|Bessie Ellen Davidson {{was born}} on 22 May 1879 in Adelaide, Australia, to a family of Scottish and English origin. She was the second child of David Davidson, {{who was in the}} mining industry, and Ellen Johnson Davidson. [...] Her {{great-grandfather}} William Gowan was a sculptor, and her grandmother Frances Gowan was a painter. She was educated at the Advanced School for Girls (which had a strong <b>drawing</b> <b>strand),</b> and studied art with the painter Rose McPherson (better known as Margaret Preston). She began exhibiting with the South Australian Society of Arts as early as 1901; in this period, her work clearly showed Preston's influence. [...] In 1904, after her mother's death, she went to Europe to study art in company with Preston. They spent the first few months in Munich, where Davidson studied briefly at the Künstlerinner Verein, before moving on to Paris. There she studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, under René-Xavier Prinet, where she met and began a lifelong friendship with Philippe Besnard's future wife, Germaine Desgranges. She also took classes with Raphael Collin, Richard Miller, and Gustave Courtois. A year after her arrival in France, she was exhibiting at the Salon de la Société des Artistes Français, and the year after that at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. In 1922 she would become the first Australian woman elected a member of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and she would later serve as its secretary. She was {{a founding member of the}} Salon des Tuileries, at which she would exhibit almost every year between 1923 and 1951.|$|R

40|$|The paper draws {{together}} {{a number of}} findings from the PhD Examination Project conducted by the authors {{as part of the}} SORTI (Centre for the Study of Research Training and Impact) program conducted at The University of Newcastle. Its particular focus is on an analysis of the roles of examiner and supervisor, and the interface between these, as seen through the lens provided by Habermas’s ‘Ways of Knowing’ thesis. Early scripts appraised of examiner comment directed to the candidate seemed to reveal a preponderance of text that conformed with Habermas’s ‘empirical-analytic’ way of knowing, displaying a fairly technical approach to the task and positioning the examiner in the role of ‘expert’. At the same time, there was little evidence of ‘self-reflective’ knowing that might betray a more sophisticated task being undertaken and a role of some asymmetry between the examiner and candidate. Since the latter way of knowing would seem to fit better with a regime dealing with original thought and new contributions to knowledge, it has been postulated that the dominant text in PhD examination may work to constrain the generation of new knowledge rather than encourage it. A recent paper explored this postulation with special reference to those aspects of examination script that made explicit mention {{of the role of the}} supervisor, finding essentially the same phenomenon, but with a slightly different balance in favour of ‘self-reflective’ text. This paper will <b>draw</b> <b>strands</b> out of SORTI’s more comprehensive work that might inform this particular analysis, expand on the analysis itself and indicate ways in which the analysis could inform the practicalities of research training and especially the role of the supervisor...|$|R
