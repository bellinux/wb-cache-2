Subjects (N= 10) purposely performed a series of bilateral forward-reach tasks (BFR) while standing unilaterally on the dominant leg, on the non-dominant leg (unilateral conditions) or on both legs (bipedal condition). For each leg, the integrated electromyographical (iEMG) activity per 20 -ms periods ranging from 300 ms before BFR onset (t 0) to 1000 ms after t 0 was compared between the unipedal and bipedal stance conditions. This time-window included "anticipatory", "on-line" and "corrective" postural adjustments, i. e. those postural adjustments occurring before (anticipatory postural adjustments, APAs), during (on-line postural adjustments, OPAs) and after (corrective postural adjustments, CPAs) the BFR.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{spectrum}} of normalizable states on a Euclidean SL(2,R) /U(1) black hole exhibits a duality between oscillator states and wound strings. This duality generalizes the FZZ correspondence, which {{can be thought of}} as an identification between a normalizable mode of dilaton gravity and a mode of the tachyon with winding number one around the Euclidean time circle. It implies that normalizable states on a large Euclidean black hole have support at widely separated scales. In particular, localized states that are extended over the cap of the cigar (the Euclidian analog of the black hole atmosphere) have a component that is localized near the tip of the cigar (the analog of the stretched horizon). As a consequence of this duality, the states exhibit a transition as a function of radial <b>excitation</b> <b>level.</b> From the perspective of a low energy probe, low lying states are naturally thought of as oscillator states in the black hole atmosphere, while at large <b>excitation</b> <b>level</b> they are naturally described as wound strings. As the <b>excitation</b> <b>level</b> increases, the size of the states first decreases and then increases.

40|$|Coupled bunch instabilities (CBI) are {{the most}} harmful instabilities in ELETTRA. Longitudinal {{excitations}} generate an increase in effective momentum spread which has a particularly adverse effect on the higher harmonics of the light spectrum. Their intensity is reduced and their width is increased. The <b>excitation</b> <b>level</b> of CBIs can be controlled by tuning {{the temperature of the}} cavities. We can differ between three different regimes. For a medium and high <b>excitation</b> <b>level,</b> a relaxation oscillation is observed. Due to the strong driving term of the longitudinal CBI the oscillation amplitude increases very quickly until it reaches the regime of Landau damping, where the motion decoheres. The blown up bunch is then damped down in dimension by radiation damping, until the process starts again from the beginning. For a small <b>excitation</b> <b>level</b> an extension of the phase space dimensions occurs and a coherent longitudinal oscillation is observed. Only in the regime of complete or nearly complete compensation of longitudinal CBIs, are transverse effects observed. These are again compensated by temperature tuning of the cavities, as well as tune and chromaticity adjustment. In addition a higher order mode shifter is used to shift dangerous parasitic cavity modes away from the operating region of the cavity. ...|$|E

The short-time correlation for TEOAEs is significant for longer than it is for NEOAEs, particularly in some individuals, and the STCC allows this to be quantified. This suggests that derived NEOAEs do not display the highly synchronized dominant frequencies often seen in TEOAEs.

Conventional TEOAEs thus appear to measure a combination of two conceptually different processes, while NEOAEs measure just one...|$|R
40|$|The tire dynamic {{transfer}} stiffness {{describes how}} a displacement enforced at the tire contact patch {{results in a}} force at the spindle-wheel interface. The dynamic transfer stiffness is expressed {{as a function of}} frequency and provides insight in the generation of vehicle interior structure-borne tire/road noise. The road surface texture excites the tire at the contact patch, resulting in structural waves travelling around the circumference of the tire. The tire sidewalls transfer these vibrations to the rim. The vibrational energy is then transmitted through the spindle-wheel interface toward the suspension and vehicle body. The resulting body panel and window vibrations cause noise radiation in the passenger compartment. It is known that the tire dynamic properties are dependent on the vibration amplitude. Therefore, the <b>excitation</b> <b>levels</b> during tire dynamic characterization tests should be similar as the <b>excitation</b> <b>levels</b> during operation of the tire.
