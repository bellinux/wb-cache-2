2500|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{examples}} {{were installed}} in Cornish mines {{by the end of}} the century, but these were usually of the single-rod type, which was perceived as safer in use. When cable operated winding gear became available the man engines continued in use, particularly in cases where the mineshaft was not truly vertical and winding engines drawing suspended cages could not be used; with the provision of a few well-placed rollers, and “fend offs” mounted on trunnions, the rods could reach the bottom of a shaft even at a substantial deviation from the vertical. Economics also played a part: the rods needed for pumping could be used for this extra function at little increased cost. Even when skips or <b>kibbles</b> were used in such shafts, (running on [...] "skipways") the tipping motion would make them impractical for carrying men.|$|E
6000|$|This {{was indeed}} true. Frankey, as his mates called him, {{was at that}} time the [...] "lander" [...] in charge of the <b>kibbles</b> at the surface. It was his duty to receive each kibble as it was drawn up to the mouth of the shaft full of ore, empty it, and send it down again. Several coils of chain passing round the large drum of a great horse-windlass, called by the miners a [...] "whim," [...] was the means by which the <b>kibbles</b> were hoisted and lowered. The chain was so {{arranged}} that one kibble was lowered by it while the other was being drawn up. Frankey had emptied one of the <b>kibbles,</b> and had given the signal to the boy attending the horse to [...] "lower away," [...] when he inadvertently stepped into the shaft. With ready presence of mind the man caught the chain and clung to it, but the boy, being prevented by a pile of rubbish from seeing what had occurred, eased him down, supposing him to be the kibble! ...|$|E

60|$|It {{would seem}} as though the <b>kibbles</b> had known that a {{stranger}} was about to descend and had waited for him, for no sooner did Oliver get on the ladder than they began to move--the one to ascend full, {{and the other to}} descend empty.|$|E
60|$|All {{this time}} they had not met with a miner, or with any sign of human life--unless the pump and <b>kibbles</b> could be {{regarded}} as such--for they had been hitherto traversing the old levels and workings of the mine, but at last, during one of their pauses, they heard the faint sound of chip, chip, chip, in the far distance.|$|E
6000|$|As he advanced, Oliver {{began to}} take note of the places he had passed on the way down, and so much had he seen and thought during his sojourn underground, that, when he reached the level where he first came upon the noisy <b>kibbles,</b> and made {{acquaintance}} with the labouring pump-rod, he almost hailed the spot as an old familiar landmark of other days! ...|$|E

60|$|The {{possibility}} of anything happening to Captain Jan, and my light getting blown out occurred to me, but I said nothing. When we had walked {{a quarter of}} a mile in this level, we came to the point where it entered the pump-shaft. The shaft itself was narrow--about 8 or 10 feet in diameter--but everything in it was ponderous and gigantic. The engine that drove the pump was 70 horse power; the pump-rod was a succession of wooden beams, each like the ridge-pole of a house, jointed together--a rugged affair, with iron bolts, and nuts, and projections at the joints. In this shaft the <b>kibbles</b> were worked. These <b>kibbles</b> are iron buckets by which ore is conveyed to the surface. Two are worked together by a chain--one going up full while the other comes down empty. Both are free to clatter about the shaft and bang against each other in passing, but they are prevented from damaging the pump-rod by a wooden partition. Between this partition and the pump was the ladder we had now to descend, with just space for a man to pass.|$|E
60|$|A {{circumstance}} occurred {{just then}} which surprised him not a little, {{and tended to}} fix this locality still more deeply on his memory. While {{he was standing in}} the level, waiting until the captain should relight and trim his much and oft bruised candle, the <b>kibbles</b> began their noisy motion. This was nothing new now, {{but at the same time}} the shout of distant voices was heard, as if the gnomes held revelry in their dreary vaults. They drew gradually nearer, and Oliver could distinguish laughter mingled with the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps.|$|E
60|$|Before {{the captain}} could explain what <b>kibbles</b> were, these {{reckless}} buckets met, with a bang, close to Oliver's cheek, and rebounded on the beams that protected him from their fury. Naturally {{the young man}} shrank a little from a noise so loud and so near. He was at once scraped down {{on the other side}} by the pump-rod! Drawing himself together as much as possible, and feeling for once the disadvantage of being a large man, he followed his leader down, down, ever down, into the profounder depths below.|$|E

50|$|<b>Kibble</b> size {{is also an}} {{important}} factor when creating a dental diet. Hennet et al. (2007) found that by increasing <b>kibble</b> size, tartar can be significantly decreased. This reduction in tartar correlates to the increased need to chew as <b>kibble</b> size increases.|$|R

6000|$|This [...] "easing down" [...] a {{great number}} of fathoms was by no means an easy process, as those know well who have seen a pair of <b>kibbles</b> go banging up and down a shaft. It was all that poor Frankey could do to keep his head from being smashed against rocks and beams; but, by {{energetic}} use of arms and legs, he did so, and reached the bottom of the shaft without further damage than a little skin rubbed off his knees and elbows, and a few cuts on his hands. The man thought so little of it, indeed, that he at once returned to grass by the ladder-way, to the unutterable surprise and no little consternation of the boy who had [...] "eased him down." ...|$|E

50|$|Polyphosphates {{can be used}} to {{coat the}} <b>kibbles</b> of both dog and cat dental diets. These {{compounds}} are effective at binding to minerals, in particular calcium, which would otherwise bind to plaque and harden to form tartar. In particular, sodium hexametaphosphate has been shown to effectively decrease tartar buildup on teeth. It is able to do this by binding to the calcium component found in tartar. <b>Kibbles</b> coated with this compound have been proven to prevent the formation of tartar on all teeth, and not just those involved in the mechanical breakdown of food (mainly the molars).|$|E

5|$|The {{challenge}} with <b>Kibble</b> balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of <b>Kibble</b> balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's <b>Kibble</b> balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the <b>Kibble</b> balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards {{down the hall to the}} <b>Kibble</b> balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of <b>Kibble</b> balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|R
50|$|John <b>Kibble,</b> {{the son of}} a Glasgow Metal Merchant, was one {{of several}} wealthy Glasgow merchants who had large villas built at Coulport in the nineteenth century either as {{permanent}} residences or summer retreats. Several still survive, some now flatted, others in a dilapidated condition. <b>Kibble's</b> Coulport House was the original location of the giant conservatory known as the <b>Kibble</b> Palace (now in Glasgow's Botanic Garden).|$|R
5|$|In April 2007, the NIST's {{implementation}} of the <b>Kibble</b> balance demonstrated a combined relative standard uncertainty (CRSU) of 36µg and a short-term resolution of µg. The UK's National Physical Laboratory's <b>Kibble</b> balance demonstrated a CRSU of 70.3µg in 2007. That <b>Kibble</b> balance was disassembled and shipped in 2009 to Canada's Institute for National Measurement Standards (part of the National Research Council), where research and development with the device could continue.|$|R

5000|$|Dry {{dog food}} (<b>kibbles)</b> {{is most often}} packed in multi-wall paper bags, {{sometimes}} with a plastic film layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern for the {{long-term}} health effects of selenium (Se) over- or underfeeding. The efficiency of utilization of dietary Se is subject to many factors. Our study in dogs evaluated the effect of diet type (canned versus <b>kibble)</b> and dietary protein concentration on Se digestibility and bioactivity. Canned and <b>kibble</b> diets are commonly used formats of dog food, widely ranging in protein concentration. Twenty-four Labrador retrievers were used and four canned and four <b>kibble</b> diets were selected with crude protein concentrations ranging from 10. 1 to 27. 5 g/MJ. Crude protein concentration had no influence on the digestibility of Se in either canned or <b>kibble</b> diets, but a lower Se digestibility was observed in canned compared to <b>kibble</b> diets. However, the biological activity of Se, as measured by whole blood glutathione peroxidase, was higher in dogs fed the canned diets than in dogs fed the <b>kibble</b> diets and decreased with increasing crude protein intake. These results indicate that selenium recommendations in dog foods need to take diet type into account...|$|R
