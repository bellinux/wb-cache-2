5|$|To {{some extent}} {{this is due}} to {{geography}} and driver training, but more rigorous impaired driving enforcement and severe penalties in Sweden for driving under the influence may also explain the difference. While <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that highways and vehicles in Sweden are different from those in the United States, the U.S. fatality rate is also about double the rate in the Canadian province of Ontario, which experienced 3.6 road fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km according to preliminary 2014 data. Ontario, which is a vast province of more than 1 million square kilometers, has a similar mix of highway types including congested urban and rural highways. Ontario also has a similar mix of large transport trucks essentially identical to U.S. transport trucks, full-sized pickup trucks, SUVs and passenger cars, although there may be more small cars driven in Ontario compared to the United States. This suggests that differences in fatality rates are due to non-physical factors such as driver behavior.|$|E

When using a structured dialogue system (SDS), instead of free chat, via roles and sentence-openers, the social dimension of the relation between participants disap-pears from the surface interaction.

However, Germany at that time suffered from limitations in raw materials such as oil and aluminium, which meant that there were insufficient resources for much beyond a tactical air force: given these circumstances, the Luftwaffes reliance on tactical mid-range, twin engined medium bombers and short range dive-bombers was a pragmatic choice of strategy. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the Luftwaffes Kampfgeschwader medium and heavy bomber wings were perfectly capable of attacking strategic targets, {{but the lack of}} capable long range escort fighters left the bombers unable to carry out their missions effectively against determined and well organised fighter opposition.|$|R

2500|$|Later French legend {{held that}} a vial of oil—the Holy Ampulla—descended from Heaven to anoint ClovisI as King of the Franks {{following}} his conversion to Christianity in 493. The Visigoth Wamba is the earliest Catholic king {{known to have been}} anointed, although the practice apparently preceded him in Spain. The ceremony was performed in 672 by Quiricus, the archbishop of Toledo; despite the king's strongly antisemitic laws, the ceremony hewed closely to the rite described by the Old Testament. It was apparently copied a year later when Flavius Paulus defected and joined the Septimanian rebels he had been tasked with quieting. The rite epitomized the Catholic Church's sanctioning the monarch's rule; it was notably employed by usurpers such as Pepin, whose dynasty replaced the Merovingians in France in 751. While <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the practice subordinated the king to the church, in practice the sacral anointing of kings was seen as elevating the king to priestly or even saintly status. It provided a directly religious aspect to Europe's regimes apart from the church hierarchy and, for political and practical reasons, was seldom performed by the popes. Instead, the anointment was usually administered by a bishop from a major see of the realm, often the national primate. Lupoi argues that this set in motion the conflicting claims that developed into the Investiture Crisis. At the same time, royal unction recontextualized the elections and popular acclamations still legally responsible for the elevation of new rulers. They were no longer understood as autonomous authorities but merely agents in service of God's will. The divine right of kings was thus gradually recreated in a Christian context, continuing even when monarchs might choose to forgo the anointment ceremony altogether. The supposedly indelible nature of anointment was alluded to in Shakespeare's Richard II: ...|$|E

Moreover, the share of the short-term unemployed varies greatly over time and across countries. This paper does not advocate the creation of an EUBS; it merely investigates the stabilisation properties of such a system, and as such constitutes a companion to “A European Unemployment Benefits Scheme: The rationale and the challenges ahead”, 1 which makes ample reference to the vast academic literature on this issue...|$|R
