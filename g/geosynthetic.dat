25|$|Containment {{involves}} geomembranes, <b>geosynthetic</b> clay liners, or some geocomposites which {{function as}} liquid or gas barriers. Landfill liners and covers make critical {{use of these}} geosynthetics. All hydraulic applications (tunnels, dams, canals, surface impoundments, and floating covers) use these geosynthetics as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{juxtaposition}} {{of the various}} types of geosynthetics just described with the primary function that the material is called upon to serve allows for the creation of an organizational matrix for geosynthetics; see table below. In essence, this matrix is the “scorecard” for understanding the entire <b>geosynthetic</b> field and its design related methodology. In the table the primary function that each <b>geosynthetic</b> can be called upon to serve is seen. Note that these are primary functions and in many cases (if not most) cases there are secondary functions, and perhaps tertiary ones as well. For example, a geotextile placed on soft soil will usually be designed {{on the basis of its}} reinforcement capability, but separation and filtration might certainly be secondary and tertiary considerations. As another example, a geomembrane is obviously used for its containment capability, but separation will always be a secondary function.|$|E
25|$|Separation is the {{placement}} of a flexible <b>geosynthetic</b> material, like a porous geotextile, between dissimilar materials so that the integrity and functioning of both materials can remain intact or even be improved. Paved roads, unpaved roads, and railroad bases are common applications. Also, the use of thick nonwoven geotextiles for cushioning and protection of geomembranes is in this category. In addition, for most applications of geofoam and geocells, separation is the major function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Geosynthetic</b> clay liners, or GCLs, are an {{interesting}} juxtaposition of polymeric materials and natural soils. They are rolls of factory fabricated thin layers of bentonite clay sandwiched between two geotextiles or bonded to a geomembrane. Structural integrity of the subsequent composite is obtained by needle-punching, stitching or adhesive bonding. GCLs are used as a composite component beneath a geomembrane or by themselves in geoenvironmental and containment applications {{as well as in}} transportation, geotechnical, hydraulic, and many private development applications.|$|E
25|$|Drainage is the {{equilibrium}} soil-to-geosynthetic {{system that allows}} for adequate liquid flow without soil loss, within {{the plane of the}} <b>geosynthetic</b> over a service lifetime compatible with the application under consideration. Geopipe highlights this function, and also geonets, geocomposites and very thick geotextiles. Drainage applications for these different geosynthetics are retaining walls, sport fields, dams, canals, reservoirs, and capillary breaks. Also to be noted is that sheet, edge and wick drains are geocomposites used for various soil and rock drainage situations.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{harvesting}} rain {{water has been}} is modular, scalable systems which are installable underground. These came as an evolution of a <b>geosynthetic</b> applications called Infiltration Tanks, which when stacked provide a void space volume which allows for the storing of water. Improved and more cost effective industrial design now allow for theoretically limitless storage of water underground. Examples of these modular structures are Atlantis Matrix Tanks used in the Manly Stormwater Treatment and Re-use project of Manly Council in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Early {{papers on}} {{geosynthetics}} (as {{we know them}} today) in the 1960s documented their use as filters in the United States and as reinforcement in Europe. A 1977 conference in Paris brought together many of the early manufacturers and practitioners. The International Geosynthetics Society (IGS) founded in 1982 has subsequently organized a worldwide conference every four years and its numerous chapters have additional conferences. Presently, separate <b>geosynthetic</b> institutes, trade-groups, and standards-setting groups are active. Approximately twenty universities teach stand-alone courses on geosynthetics and almost all include the subject in geotechnical, geoenvironmental, and hydraulic engineering courses. Geosynthetics are available worldwide and the activity is robust and steadily growing.|$|E
25|$|Geo{{synthetic}}s are synthetic products used {{to stabilize}} terrain. They are generally polymeric products used to solve civil engineering problems. This includes eight main product categories: geotextiles, geogrids, geonets, geomembranes, <b>geosynthetic</b> clay liners, geofoam, geocells and geocomposites. The polymeric {{nature of the}} products makes them suitable for use in the ground where high levels of durability are required. They can also be used in exposed applications. Geosynthetics are available {{in a wide range of}} forms and materials. These products have a wide range of applications and are currently used in many civil, geotechnical, transportation, geoenvironmental, hydraulic, and private development applications including roads, airfields, railroads, embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals, dams, erosion control, sediment control, landfill liners, landfill covers, mining, aquaculture and agriculture.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, a reburial program was {{undertaken}} at Chetro Ketl {{that sought to}} preserve the structure's original timbers by backfilling portions of the site with soil. Because only {{a thin layer of}} overburden was applied, specialized <b>geosynthetic</b> materials were added to help keep the area dry. The program also developed techniques that facilitate the sampling of ancient wood for assessment of deterioration. Lekson and McKenna note, [...] "the visible building is far from pristine. Most walls have undergone generations of structural and cosmetic treatment... Chetro Ketl is an artifact deteriorating before our eyes. If the reader is inspired to questions that cannot be answered by the present study, be advised that Chetro Ketl's ability to answer in detail is slowly, but surely, disappearing." ...|$|E
500|$|The cost of {{construction}} aggregate in Afghanistan is high (around $250 to $650 per cubic metre) because {{of security and}} transport costs, therefore Foley attempted to minimise its use. [...] A series of trials using various foundation systems was carried out at Camp Bastion to assess the capacity of a <b>geosynthetic</b> cell system called Neoweb. [...] Neoweb is supplied flat but unfolds to form a hollow honeycomb structure that can be backfilled with aggregate and overlain with a wearing course. [...] The specification of Neoweb allowed a 75percent reduction in aggregate and a two-thirds cost saving compared to traditional road-building methods. [...] The Neoweb layer acts as a semi-rigid slab foundation and is designed to allow the surfacing layer to hold together under heavy vehicles and in harsh weather. [...] The foundation also {{makes it harder for}} insurgents to plant IEDs under or in the road.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a meeting}} between the Commanding Officer of the Light Dragoons (Lt Col Fair) and Commanding Officer of 28 Engineer Regiment (Lt Col MTG Bazeley) {{it was decided that}} a new and easier to protect road would be {{constructed}} by the Royal Engineers. [...] 28 Engineer Regiment had used a new road construction material called NeoWeb <b>geosynthetic</b> cellular confinement system on an exercise in the UK prior to deployment and this was considered to be a practical option to reduce cost aggregate and provide a barrier to the implanting of lethal IEDS. [...] Lt Col Bazeley contacted the Sales Director of PRS (who was at that time on holiday) and talked him into providing a small amount of Neoweb to trial in Afghan conditions which PRS agreed to do free of charge. [...] The trial proved successful and Bazeley undertook to use funds originally designated to buy aggregate to purchase in excess of £2m of NeoWeb material. [...] The NeoWeb was shipped to Cyprus by PRS and Bazeley convinced the RAF to re-route a flight via Cyprus to pick it up. [...] Construction began in December 2009 and was completed in March 2010, during which time the construction teams and security forces came under frequent attack. This was the first road to be built under fire since British operations in the Dhofar Rebellion in the early 1970s, the completed road allowed resupply convoys to travel its length in about 30minutes, compared to 36hours along the old road. [...] The success of the project led to the approval of plans for an extension to connect the provincial capital Lashkar Gah with the economic capital of Gereshk. [...] Construction of the extension began in July 2010 and was completed in April 2011.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{some debate}} on the {{electrical}} conductivity of <b>geosynthetic</b> clay liners {{in the application of}} electrical liner integrity surveys. [...] The moisture content of <b>geosynthetic</b> clay liners is sufficient for the methods as the sheets leave the factory, however the sheets can become desiccated while they are placed in the field. This becomes a problem for encapsulated <b>geosynthetic</b> clay liners, located between the primary and secondary geomembranes, which cannot wick moisture from the underlying subgrade soil. In addition to maintaining the moisture content of encapsulated <b>geosynthetic</b> clay liners, copper wires are installed as part of construction in order to conduct electricity over the panel overlaps.|$|E

5000|$|Many <b>geosynthetic</b> {{aggregates}} {{are also}} {{made from recycled}} materials. Being polymer based, recyclable plastics can be reused {{in the production of}} these new age of aggregates. For example, Ring Industrial Group's EZflow product lines are produced with <b>geosynthetic</b> aggregate pieces that are more than 99.9% recycled polystyrene. This polystyrene, that would have otherwise been destined for a landfill, is instead gathered, melted, mixed, reformulated and expanded to create low density aggregates that maintain high strength properties while under compressive loads. Such <b>geosynthetic</b> aggregates replace conventional gravel while simultaneously increasing porosity, increasing hydraulic conductivity and eliminating the fine dust [...] "fines" [...] inherent to gravel aggregates which otherwise serve to clog and disrupt the operation of many drainage applications.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{philosophy}} behind geocomposite {{materials is}} {{to combine the}} best features of different materials {{in such a way}} that specific applications are addressed in the optimal manner and at minimum cost. Thus, the benefit/cost ratio is maximized. Such geocomposites will generally be <b>geosynthetic</b> materials, but not always. In some cases it may be more advantageous to use a nonsynthetic material with a <b>geosynthetic</b> one for optimum performance and/or least cost. As seen in the following, the number of possibilities is huge — the only limits being one's ingenuity and imagination.|$|E
50|$|<b>Geosynthetic</b> clay liners are {{a type of}} {{combination}} liner. One {{advantage to}} using a <b>geosynthetic</b> clay liner (GCL) {{is the ability to}} order exact amounts of the liner. Ordering precise amounts from the manufacturer prevents surplus and over-spending. Another advantage to GCLs is that the liner can be used in areas without an adequate clay source. On the other hand, GCLs are heavy and cumbersome, and their installation is very labor-intensive. In addition to being arduous and difficult under normal conditions, installation can be cancelled during damp conditions because the bentonite would absorb the moisture, making the job even more burdensome and tedious.|$|E
50|$|Other names {{used for}} GCLs since their {{initiation}} are “clay blankets”, “bentonite blankets”, “bentonite mats”, “prefabricated bentonite clay blankets” and “clay <b>geosynthetic</b> barriers”, the latter currently {{favored by the}} International Organization for Standardization (ISO).|$|E
50|$|In Cold Spring, New York, in the Hudson River, {{sediment}} was {{contaminated with}} cadmium and nickel from a battery manufacturing facility. A <b>Geosynthetic</b> clay liner (GCL) and a 12-inch covering of sandy loam was planted {{on top of}} the contaminated area.|$|E
50|$|Containment {{involves}} geomembranes, <b>geosynthetic</b> clay liners, or some geocomposites which {{function as}} liquid or gas barriers. Landfill liners and covers make critical {{use of these}} geosynthetics. All hydraulic applications (tunnels, dams, canals, surface impoundments, and floating covers) use these geosynthetics as well.|$|E
50|$|Composite liners are {{required}} {{to be used in}} municipal solid waste systems for landfills and use a double liner system which is composed of a leachate system which is a liquid that collects solids from the substance this is passed through it. The leachate system is surrounded in a by a type of solid drainage layer such as gravel which is enclosed by a geomembrane and compressed clay, also known as a <b>geosynthetic</b> clay liner. This <b>geosynthetic</b> clay liner is usually made of sodium bentonite which is compacted in between two thick pieces of geotextile. The next material surrounding the composite liner would be a leak detection system composed of another material like gravel with an additional geomembrane or complex liner. The geomembranes within the composite liner consist of a high-density polyethylene which provide an effective minimization for flow and deliver and helpful barrier which is used on inorganic contaminants. It {{can be used as a}} substitute for sand or gravel and also has a very high transmissivity and low storage. The lower surface helps provide an effective leak test once correctly installed. It is also a low permeable vapor and liquid barrier. The <b>geosynthetic</b> clay liners are manufactured by factories and the purpose for it being made of sodium bentonite is that they regulate the movement of liquids in gases within the waste. The geocomposites which are a combination of the geomembranes and <b>geosynthetic</b> liner material also include a layer of bentonite between the middle of the layers of geotextile; however, airspace is allowed to be implemented. It is then topped off with a final cover.|$|E
50|$|Geogrids are {{synthetic}} {{materials used}} {{to reinforce the}} ground. The insertion of <b>geosynthetic</b> reinforcements (generally in {{the direction in which}} the deformation has developed) has the function of conferring greater stiffness and stability upon the ground, increasing its capacity to be subjected to greater deformations without fracturing.|$|E
5000|$|While quite {{different}} in the manufacture or configuration than geonets are competitive <b>geosynthetic</b> products called [...] "geospacers". Their drainage cores consists of nubs, columns, cuspations, or 3-D networks of stiff polymer strands. They are generally used for drainage behind retaining walls, plaza decks or green roofs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{geological}} stabilization {{process was}} based on a geotechnical design involving the use of <b>geosynthetic</b> materials designed to enhance the cohesion and strength of the landslide fill. Asked about the safety of the work, Trump said: [...] "If I'm ever in California for an earthquake, this is where I want to be standing".|$|E
5000|$|Geomembranes {{dominate}} {{the sales of}} <b>geosynthetic</b> products, at 1.8 billion USD per year worldwide, which is 35% of the market. The US market is currently divided between HDPE, LLDPE, fPP, PVC, CSPE-R, EPDM-R and others (such as EIA-R), and can be summarized as follows: (Note that M m2 refers to millions of square meters.) ...|$|E
50|$|A geonet is a <b>geosynthetic</b> {{material}} {{consisting of}} integrally connected parallel sets of ribs overlying similar sets at various angles for in-plane drainage of liquids or gases. Geonets are often laminated with geotextiles {{on one or}} both surfaces and are then referred to as drainage geocomposites. They are competitive with other drainage geocomposites having different core configurations.|$|E
