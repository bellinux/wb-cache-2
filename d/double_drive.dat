40|$|Abstract：With two {{upper and}} nether {{piezoelectric}} vibrators to provide excitation {{in the same}} time, vertical <b>double</b> <b>driven</b> piezoelectric feeder (vertical <b>double</b> <b>driven</b> feeder for short in the paper) has smaller piezoelectric ceramics (PZT), and lower driving voltage to prolong the lifetime of the PZT, meanwhile, its carrying capacity gets stronger, compared with vertical single driven piezoelectric feeder (vertical single driven feeder for short in the paper). Vibration analysis was carried out on the feeder system, and the affection factors on the system natural frequency and feeder tray amplitude were received. Based on the modal analysis, the system theoretical resonant frequency was got as 135. 95 Hz. In the end, the prototype was tested to analyze the relationships among the feeding speed, feeder tray amplitude, driving voltage and driving frequency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:Operating {{mechanism}} {{is the main}} part of breaker，and the quality of breaker will directly influence the safe operation of power system. Because of the continuous improvement requirements of switch，in order to mak this actuator faster and more powerful closing，this paper proposes a <b>double</b> coil parallel <b>driven</b> permanent magnet actuator at a high speed. This paper expounds the working principle of single and <b>double</b> coil parallel <b>driven</b> permanent magnet actuator. It uses Ansoft building model and contrasts test results. In prance we designed and produced the single and <b>double</b> coil parallel <b>driven</b> permanent magnet actuator for experimental study. The simulation and experiment results show that <b>double</b> coil parallel <b>driven</b> permanent magnet actuator，compared with single coil parallel driven permanent magnet actuator，has a better and faster action performance. Thus，the <b>double</b> coil parallel <b>driven</b> permanent magnet actuator achieves a kind of optimization...|$|R

Wellesley sent a large force under Colonel Sartorius to recapture rebel held Kottayam. But the plan {{could not be}} carried out as there were not enough troops in Malabar. Wellesley advised Commissioners to stop all communications with Wayanad so as to starve Raja of supplies. But shortage of troops also meant this plan too remained on paper. By the time, Wellesley decided to smash Raja by a <b>double</b> <b>drive</b> from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad, Manjeri Athan Gurikkal an Ernad Mappila leader along with his followers agreed to support of Raja.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>double</b> <b>drive</b> {{wheel is}} named after its drive band, which goes around the {{spinning}} wheel twice. The drive band turns the flyer, which is the horse-shoe shaped piece of wood surrounding the bobbin, {{as well as the}} bobbin. Due to a difference {{in the size of the}} whorls (the round pieces or pulleys around which the drive band runs) the bobbin whorl, which has a smaller radius than the flyer whorl, turns slightly faster. Thus both the flyer and bobbin rotate to twist the yarn, and the difference in speed continually winds the yarn onto the bobbin. Generally the speed difference or [...] "ratio" [...] is adjusted by the size of the whorls and the tension of the drive band.|$|E

The cheerful inner court is a resting place, where various outdoor programmes are held. The 26-hectare English park, which {{is open to the}} public every year, was declared a nature reserve in 1998. Its botanical curiosities are much appreciated by the visitors. Riding competitions are held in the park annually.|$|E
50|$|Scammell {{launched}} the three-axle 6x4 Crusader at London's 1968 Earls Court Commercial Vehicle Show. The truck {{was designed for}} high-speed long distance transport, typically to cover 250,000 miles a year. The truck included a 'repair by replacement' philosophy to cut downtime {{and the consequences of}} unscheduled maintenance. The drive line included a 9.3-litre GM Detroit Diesel 8V71N two-stroke diesel engine, rated at 273 bhp. This drove through a Fuller RoadRanger 16-speed constant-mesh gear box, to an Albion double-drive and two-spring bogie, using double reduction and cross lockable drive axles. The final reduction took place in the hubs to give better ground clearance under the differential housings. Scammell used the same rear bogie on its highly successful 24-ton <b>Double</b> <b>Drive</b> Routeman 8x4 tipper chassis, launched at the same exhibition. As most contemporary 32-ton and maximum capacity trucks in the UK had engine power ratings of between 150 and 220 bhp, the Crusader's 273 bhp attracted immediate attention, much of it unfavourable from deeply conservative operators.|$|E

5000|$|Chaffey's {{master plan}} called for distributing the water over the whole tract to each farm lot in cement pipes, with each holder {{to share in the}} water proportionately to his holding {{irrespective}} of distance from the source. Chaffey also laid out the main thoroughfare which ran {{from one end of the}} settlement to the other. He also named the [...] "main thoroughfare" [...] Euclid in honor of his favorite mathematician. Euclid Avenue was seven miles long, stretching from the colony's [...] "southernmost boundaries to the mountains." [...] Euclid was planned as a [...] "200-foot-wide <b>double</b> <b>drive</b> ... a center parkway to be flanked by a 65-foot-wide drive on each side. Chaffey also planned for electricity in Ontario with street lamps being placed a mile apart on Euclid and an electric streetcar that would travel up and down Euclid daily. Ontario was available for settlement on November 1, 1882. During the first week, Chaffey sold 190 acres for a total value of $28,500.|$|E
50|$|Owensmouth, California was a town {{founded in}} 1912 in the Western {{part of the}} San Fernando Valley. Owensmouth joined the city of Los Angeles in 1917, and was renamed Canoga Park on March 1, 1931. Owensmouth was named for the 1913 Owens River aqueduct's {{terminus}} in current Canoga Park. The town was started by the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company {{as part of an}} extraordinary real estate development in Southern California. Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company was owned by a syndicate of rich Los Angeles investors, developers, and speculators: including Harrison Gray Otis, Harry Chandler, Moses Sherman, Hobart Johnstone Whitley, and others. It anticipated possible connections to but was planned independent of the soon to be completed (1913) Los Angeles Aqueduct from the Owens River watershed to the City of Los Angeles through the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County.The newly built Sherman Way <b>double</b> <b>drive</b> and the Pacific Electric street cars, opened on December 7, 1912, gave new access to the town and to the other new towns in the valley Van Nuys (1911) and Marion (now Reseda);At the time the new road and streetcar seemed like route to an open agricultural fields {{at the end of the}} line — but was a necessity to promote development. Sherman Way was a paved boulevard with lush landscaping and no speed limit where one might get up to 35 mph, there was a separate dirt road for farm wagons/equipment, and telegraph lines.|$|E

5000|$|The circuit {{works by}} {{alternately}} switching {{the output of}} each stage between a voltage <b>doubler</b> <b>driven</b> by [...] and one driven by [...] This behaviour leads to another advantage over the Dickson multiplier: reduced ripple voltage at double the frequency. The increase in ripple frequency is advantageous because {{it is easier to}} remove by filtering. Each stage (in an ideal circuit) raises the output voltage by the peak clock voltage. Assuming that this is the same level as the DC input voltage then an n stage multiplier will (ideally) output nVin. The chief cause of losses in the cross-coupled circuit is parasitic capacitance rather than switching threshold voltage. The losses occur because some of the energy has to go into charging up the parasitic capacitances on each cycle.|$|R
