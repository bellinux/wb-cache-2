25|$|Conventional geared {{aircraft}} {{are much more}} susceptible to <b>ground</b> <b>looping.</b> A ground loop occurs when directional control is lost {{on the ground and}} the tail of the aircraft passes the nose, swapping ends, in some cases completing a full circle. This event can result in damage to the aircraft's undercarriage, tires, wingtips, propeller and engine. Ground-looping occurs because, whereas a nosewheel aircraft is steered from ahead of the center of gravity, a taildragger is steered from behind (much like driving a car backwards at high speed), so that on the ground a taildragger is inherently unstable, whereas a nosewheel aircraft will self-center if it swerves on landing. In addition, some tailwheel aircraft must transition from using the rudder to steer to using the tailwheel while passing through a speed range when neither is wholly effective due to the nose high angle of the aircraft and lack of airflow over the rudder. Avoiding ground loops requires more pilot training and skill.|$|E

The microphone splitter serves several purposes; it will split the signal 5-ways, provide phantom power for condenser microphones and active DI boxes, {{and it will}} provide isolation between the 5 outputs, preventing <b>ground</b> <b>loops.</b> Preventing <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> is an extremely important function, as the severity of <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> typically increases with distance.

The prediction of temperature response has three parts: a simple heat pump model allows for building heating and cooling loads to be translated to heat extraction and heat rejection rates; the long term temperature response of a <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> heat exchanger to heat rejection and extraction {{is based on a}} detailed conduction heat transfer simulation developed by Eskilson(1); and short-term temperature response of the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> heat exchanger is estimated with a simple analytical approximation for the response of the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> heat exchanger to a single peak heat extraction or rejection pulse...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} a cold-climate project that examines {{an alternative approach}} to {{ground source heat pump}} (GSHP) <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> design. The innovative <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> design is an attempt to reduce the installed cost of the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> heat exchange portion of the system by containing the entire <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> within the excavated location beneath the basement slab. Prior to the installation and operation of the sub-slab heat exchanger, energy modeling using TRNSYS software and concurrent design efforts were performed to determine the size and orientation of the system. One key parameter in the design is the installation of the GSHP in a low-load home, which considerably reduces the needed capacity of the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> heat exchanger. This report analyzes data from two cooling seasons and one heating season. Upon completion of the monitoring phase, measurements revealed that the initial TRNSYS simulated horizontal sub-slab <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> heat exchanger fluid temperatures and heat transfer rates differed from the measured values. To determine the cause of this discrepancy, an updated model was developed utilizing a new TRNSYS subroutine for simulating sub-slab heat exchangers. Measurements of fluid temperature, soil temperature, and heat transfer were used to validate the updated model...|$|R

When what we call a light plane,one flown by an individual, lands crosswind, its fairing or streamlining makes it want to turn violently {{in the direction of the}} wind - the direction of least resistance.

50|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> will be {{carrying}} some current {{at the local}} supply frequency, typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz, due to electromagnetic induction from current-carrying conductors nearby. There is an AC magnetic field everywhere in developed areas; however, its magnitude and direction depend strongly on the local environment and arrangement of current-carrying wiring. This influences the current induced in the <b>ground</b> <b>loop,</b> which is also dependent on the area enclosed by the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> and its orientation. The impedance of the loop, basically just its resistance at low frequencies, also influences the induced current that will flow. It is important to realise that for a <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> to cause problems, {{there must be a}} local magnetic field produced by power frequency or other systems. It is the combination of radiated field and receptive <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> that causes problems, and the situation can be improved by attention to either one, or both of these. In effect, the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> is the secondary of a very loosely coupled transformer, the primary being the summation of all current carrying conductors nearby. Transformer action limits the induced voltage in the loop, and the weak coupling limits the maximum current that will flow, even if the loop resistance is very low. The maximum induced energy is normally quite small, and except in situations very close to a radiating loop carrying high current, there is no prospect of inducing sufficient energy to cause a hazard to humans.|$|R

40|$|Measuring a transmitter-current {{waveform}} provides {{critical data}} unavailable for some airborne electromagnetic (AEM) systems yet needed to model AEM data quantitatively. We developed a novel experimental method of measuring an airborne transmitter waveform by monitoring the current induced in a closed, multiturn, insulated <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> of known inductance L and resistance R. The transmitter waveform of five different time-domain systems is deconvolved from the measured ground-loop response when {{excited by the}} primary electromagnetic field of the AEM system. In general, our measurements agree well with contractor-described transmitter current waveforms, although crucial differences exist between our deconvolved waveforms and those described in the literature. Using the pulse-per-second feature of a GPS antenna, the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> can monitor the frequency drift of a frequency-domain system. The <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> behaves like a lossy electric-field antenna when the resistance closing the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> is too large. This leads to negatives in the response of coincident-loop systems without including induced polarization effects. After observing exponentially decaying, oscillating-current responses in high-resistance <b>ground</b> <b>loops,</b> we model the observed current with an LRC circuit whose resistance and capacitance represent generalized effective antenna and free-space values.
