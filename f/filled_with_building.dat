2500|$|There {{have been}} at least five cathedrals on this site, each {{replacing}} an earlier building damaged by war or fire. Nothing survives of the earliest church, which was destroyed during an attack on the city by the Danes in 858. Of the Carolingian church that replaced it, all that remains is a semicircular chamber located directly below the centre of the present apse. This chamber, known as the Lubinus Crypt (named after the mid-6th-century Bishop of Chartres), is lower {{than the rest of the}} crypt and may have been the shrine of a local saint, prior to the church's rededication to the Virgin. Another fire in 962 is mentioned in the annals, though nothing is known about the subsequent rebuilding. A more serious conflagration occurred in 1020, after which Bishop Fulbert (bishop from 1006 to 1028) began the construction of an entirely new building. Most of the present crypt, which is the largest in France, dates from that period. The rebuilding proceeded in phases over the next hundred years or so, culminating in 1145 in a display of public enthusiasm dubbed the [...] "Cult of the Carts" [...] – one of several such incidents recorded during the period. It was claimed that during this religious outburst, a crowd of more than a thousand penitents dragged carts <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>building</b> supplies and provisions including stones, wood, grain, etc. to the site.|$|E

50|$|The {{site was}} created when Thomas Neale {{laid out the}} Seven Dials area in 1692. By the 1970s the block was {{occupied}} by an ageing, densely-packed cluster of terraced houses surrounding a yard that had been completely <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>building</b> extensions. The whole Seven Dials area was then considered run-down and ripe for wholesale redevelopment.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a simple}} cave system {{underneath}} comprising a passageway and bricked up alcoves leading to a chamber close to the cliff edge to the south. The chamber is fitted with brick built bins but mainly <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>building</b> rubble {{which is likely to}} have arisen from the demolition some time ago of a property above, where now there is a car parking area.|$|E

50|$|In 1966 {{a gravel}} mining permit for the {{property}} was granted to a Charles Bird. Mining of the land continued into the late 1970s. Through the late 1960s to early 1980’s the mined areas were <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>building</b> debris and commercial solid waste. The property was also used for tire stockpiling. The site is approximately 53 acres. The land is being considered {{for the construction of}} residential housing.|$|E
50|$|College Street {{was fully}} {{laid out in}} the area by 1900 and the area was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>buildings</b> from the early 1900s.

50|$|The {{area that}} is now Cathedral Square quickly became a {{commercial}} block <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>buildings</b> after the relocation of the cemetery. The buildings were then demolished in 1979 to create a public park facing the Cathedral. The current park layout was implemented in 1996.|$|R
50|$|The area is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>buildings</b> {{predominantly}} two {{or three}} storeys tall. Along the main streets of Front, King and Queen are numerous first floor restaurants and stores with walk-up apartments on the upper floors. The area also has numerous older warehouses that have been converted to lofts or offices.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of elevated entrances were {{between five and}} ten metres above the ground level and facing the courtyard side {{in order to protect}} them from shell fire. Several examples were located in rather unsuitable places, however, for example above the outside of a castle. Heights of above 15 metres are only rarely recorded. The entrance was usually only accessible from another building in the nearby vicinity that is occasionally still is archaeologically discernible. Many elevated entrances today are only two to three metres above the ground because the original ground level, often several metres lower, has been <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>building</b> rubble.|$|E
50|$|Not {{hearing about}} the other group for some time, the rebels {{returned}} to their own plans. Venezuela {{was chosen as the}} new target, as there was an ED base there under construction. A convoy was due <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>building</b> materials. The rebels attacked while the convoy was in the base. However, Earth was starting to be shaken by the massive tidal forces of the Sun, forcing them to hurry up. The ED and the LC already started to break down their American camps and ship their forces to Europe where the last chance to escape was located, so the UCS had to do this as well. However, they couldn't contact their foes because of GOLAN's radio jamming and the Atlantic coast was firmly {{in the hands of the}} alliance. Because of that, Grodin was forced to destroy two extremely heavily defended bases near New York.|$|E
5000|$|The Inca used similar {{construction}} {{techniques in}} building Saksaywaman {{as they used}} on all their stonework, albeit on a far more massive scale. The stones were rough-cut to the approximate shape in the quarries using river cobbles. They were dragged by rope to the construction site, a feat that at times required hundreds of men. [...] The ropes were so impressive that they warranted mention by Diego de Trujillo (1948:63 1571) as he inspected a room <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>building</b> materials. The stones were shaped into their final form at the building site and then laid in place. The work, while supervised by Inca architects, was largely carried out by groups of individuals fulfilling their labor obligations to the state. In this system of mita or [...] "turn" [...] labor, each village or ethnic group provided {{a certain number of}} individuals to participate in such public works projects.|$|E

5000|$|Pedro Álvarez de Toledo y Leiva Viceroy of Peru (1639-1648) {{knew of the}} {{strategic}} importance of Valdivia and decided to repopulate and fortify it once for all. He financed partly the expedition to repopulate Valdivia with his own capital. [...] The contingent {{in charge of the}} mission was organized in Peru and consisted of seventeen ships <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>building</b> materials and supplies that astounded contemporaries by its magnitude. The local government of Chile could not secure Valdivia as it was engaged in continuous war with the Mapuches and was deeply dependent on the Real Situado, an annual payment of silver from Potosí to finance the army of Chile. The Valdivia enclave was placed directly {{under the control of the}} Viceroyalty of Peru that administered Valdivia from its repopulation in 1645 until 1740. Corral, located on the river entrance to Valdivia, became one of the most fortified bay at the time, with 17 forts. During this time it was several times proposed to move the city of Valdivia to Mancera Island. Valdivia's original site, downtown of modern Valdivia was repopulated in 1684.|$|E

Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czechoslovakia) in 1900, Norbert Troller served as a soldier in World War I, spending time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1984. digitizedDigital imag...|$|E
40|$|U listopadu 2014. godine provedena je šesta sezona istraživanja lokaliteta Torčec – Cirkvišče. Tijekom istraživanja otvorena je sonda površine 100 m 2, odnosno četiri kvadranta (I, J i K 8 te K 9). Unutar istražene površine pronađeni su skromni ostaci crkve (dio južnog zida te apside), 76 novih grobova i četiri groba koji su dijelom istraženi 2012. godine te dio dubokog jarka koji je vjerojatno služio i kao rub groblja. Većina ove sezone pronađenih grobova pripada ranijoj fazi župnog groblja i na osnovi 14 C analiza te pojedinih nalaza mogu se datirati od sredine 12. do kraja 14. stoljeća. From October 6 to 25, 2014, the Institute of Archaeology {{carried out}} the sixth season of {{research}} at the Torčec-Cirkvišče site. Four quadrants were opened (I, J, K 8 and K 9), that is, the sondage explored an area of 100 m 2. Modest remains of a church were found (part of the south apside wall), 76 new graves and 4 graves which were partially researched in 2012, as well as part of a deep ditch which could have been the edge of the cemetery. This season, most of the graves found date back to the earlier stage of the parochial cemetery. Based on 14 C analysis and individual finds, they can be attributed to mid- 12 th to late 14 th century. Graves 224 and 240 are particularly interesting. Burial in grave 224 is face down, being the second grave of that kind found on this site. Grave 240 contained a bag made of organic material with 16 to 18 pieces of silver coin (Slavonian banovci). Although there are few remains of the actual church, they still provide some information. The layout of the church was fully investigated during this season, and the size can be estimated to 14. 5 x 8. 3 m. The moat that was found was probably an old natural water stream which outlined the cemetery. When the church was torn down and the cemetery abandoned, the stream was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>building</b> material and soil...|$|E
