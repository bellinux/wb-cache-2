25|$|Philatelic bureaus were {{established}} in head post offices located at circle headquarters and at district-capital head post offices (as necessary). There are 68 philately bureaus and 1111 philatelic counters, including all head post offices (Mukhya Dak Ghars) in the country as of 31 March 2011. A domestic philatelic deposit-account system was introduced on 1 August 1965 at all philatelic bureaus. Customers are given priority in purchasing commemorative or special-issue stamps, first-day covers and <b>information</b> <b>sheets</b> soon after their issue by opening a deposit account at any philatelic bureau. The number of philately deposit-accountholders grew from 23,905 in 1999–2000 to 168,282 in 2006–2007 and 183,202 in 2008–2009. Four philatelic Bureaus—the Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and Parliament Street, New Delhi GPOs are authorized to sell United Nations stamps. A quarterly philatelic magazine, Philapost, was launched in 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{sales and}} {{marketing}} stage is closely intertwined with the editorial process. As front cover images are produced, or chapters are edited, sales people may start talking about the book with their customers to build early interest. Publishing companies often produce advanced <b>information</b> <b>sheets</b> that may be sent to customers or overseas publishers to gauge possible sales. As early interest is measured, this information feeds back through the editorial process and may affect the formatting {{of the book and}} the strategy employed to sell it. For example, if interest from foreign publishers is high, co-publishing deals may be established whereby publishers share printing costs in producing large print runs thereby lowering the per-unit cost of the books. Conversely, if initial feedback is not strong, the print-run of the book may be reduced, the marketing budget cut or, in some cases, the book is dropped from publication altogether.|$|E

This intervention study aims to increase first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors using implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Newly registered donors (N = 937) received an extra <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> during their medical check-up wherein implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques were tested. Donors were randomly assigned to either the control condition, <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> only condition, <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with implementation intentions condition, <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with explicit commitment condition, or <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition. Logistic regression analyses examined actual first-time return behaviour after an appeal to donate blood. RESULTS: Donors in the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition had an 11 · 5 % higher return rate than donors in the control condition. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition significantly increased the odds on return behaviour compared with the control condition (OR = 1 · 65, 95 %CI = 1 · 08 - 2 · 50). CONCLUSION: This study successfully increased actual first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors by using both implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of an <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> designed to aid interpreters in police interviews in recognizing, conveying and inadvertently obstructing rapport-building efforts by police interviewers. The contents of this sheet were informed by past research defining rapport, and rapport uses in police interviews. We used a mixed experimental design to test the <b>information</b> <b>sheet.</b> One group (Intervention, n = 35) was randomly assigned to read an <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> before responding to short vignettes of police interviewing foreign non-English speaking suspects about international crimes, while another (Control) group (n = 37) simply responded to the vignettes. Perceptions of rapport cues by the intervention group exceeded that of the control group. However, the groups performed equally well at identifying appropriate methods to convey/avoid obstructing rapport. Feedback from the intervention group on the helpfulness of the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> was largely positive. The findings were used to improve the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> which can be used to alert interpreters to the importance of rapport in suspect interviews...|$|R

40|$|Background: For blood establishments it is {{important}} that blood donors donate blood {{for a longer period of}} time. Unfortunately, many donors stop donating blood in the beginning of their donor career. It is therefore desirable that donors are well informed about, and agree with the blood donation invitation policy before their first donation. In this study new donors received an <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> about the invitation policy, wherein two different manipulation techniques were used: implementation intentions and explicit commitment. Implementation intentions are said to delegate control of goal-directed behavior to situational cues, thereby eliciting these responses automatically. In addition, explicit commitment is defined as the binding of a person with a specific behavior. Aim: This study aims to increase return behavior of first-time donors using implementation intention and commitment techniques Methods: The study sample consisted of 503 new donors who came to the blood bank for their medical check-up. The medical check-up consisted of a medical questionnaire and three blood samples. The <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> for this study was handed out after the medical questionnaire and consisted of information about the invitation policy. In the implementation intention condition donors had to read the <b>information</b> <b>sheet,</b> and then fill out their donation preferences (e. g. preference for day and time). In the commitment condition donors had to read the information, sign their name and date the <b>information</b> <b>sheet.</b> All new donors were randomly assigned to one of five experimental conditions: standard procedure (control group), standard procedure plus <b>information</b> <b>sheet,</b> standard procedure plus <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with implementation intentions, standard procedure plus <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with explicit commitment, standard procedure plus <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with implementation intentions and explicit commitment. The outcome variable was visiting the blood bank for a first donation after a first appeal to donate blood. Differences between conditions were tested with Chi square tests and statistical significance was considered when P < 0. 05. Results: A total of 320 (63. 6...|$|R
