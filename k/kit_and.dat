40|$|In this paper, {{based on}} a number of site visits we performed, we present certain {{fundamental}} differences between <b>kitting</b> <b>and</b> line stocking (i. e., no <b>kitting),</b> <b>and</b> we develop definitions which are intended to serve as a framework to study most kitting operations. We also develop a descriptive model which can be used to quantify the trade-offs in material handling, space requirements, <b>and</b> work-in-process between <b>kitting</b> <b>and</b> line stocking at an early decision stage. We present a numerical example to demonstrate the model and some of the insight we gained. Lastly, we discuss new research directions to further explore <b>kitting</b> <b>and</b> its impact on the shop floor...|$|R

40|$|The {{materials}} feeding {{principle of}} kitting is often {{discussed in the}} context of in-plant materials supply, as it has been stated to offer a number of advantages compared to the common alternative of continuous supply (also known as line stocking). However, few detailed studies can be found where the relative effects of using <b>kitting</b> <b>and</b> continuous supply are described. Accordingly, the current paper identifies the relative effects of using <b>kitting</b> <b>and</b> continuous supply, and provides insight into how these effects arise. The paper uses empirical data from two case studies from the Swedish automotive assembly industry. In each of the cases, continuous supply has been replaced by <b>kitting</b> <b>and,</b> consequently, it has been possible to study both <b>kitting</b> <b>and</b> continuous supply in the same production environment. The studied performance areas included man hour consumption, product quality, flexibility, inventory levels and space requirements. Interviews with production engineers, assemblers and operators responsible for the kit preparation within each of the two companies contribute to a broad yet detailed view of the effects {{associated with the use of}} <b>kitting</b> <b>and</b> continuous supply...|$|R
5|$|On 8 July 2016, {{the club}} {{launched}} their new third away kit for the 2016–17 Premier League season.

5|$|Swannell {{played as}} a forward, {{and in his}} last Test {{specifically}} at number eight. He was an unconventional and hard rugby player, known for his violent play.

His poor personal hygiene and overly violent playing style, made him an unpopular character {{in the eyes of}} other players.|$|E

5|$|The {{steady flow}} of {{calculator}} sales allowed MITS to run full page advertisements in Radio-Electronics, Popular Electronics and Scientific American. In the June 1972 Radio-Electronics, MITS announced a 14 digit calculator (Model 1440) with memory and square root function for $199.95 <b>kit</b> <b>and</b> $249.95 assembled. The original 816 kit was reduced from $179 to $149.95. Both calculators could be controlled by upcoming programming unit.|$|E
5|$|To {{fund the}} new project, Roberts sold 15% of MITS to fellow Air Force officer, Lieutenant William Yates. He also got an {{investment}} from another Weapons Laboratory officer, Major Ed Laughlin. Several other officers and {{scientist at the}} lab were interested in this {{state of the art}} calculator <b>kit</b> <b>and</b> helped with the design. Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual in return for a calculator kit.|$|E

The SV6 sports the Performance interior look, characterised by an accentuated matte black centre console and red lighting, {{as opposed to the}} silver Functional-style interior of the Omega.|$|E
5|$|Coghill {{received}} his first drum {{at the age}} of 14, which was a Pearl drum kit given to him by his parents. In 1999, Coghill noted that he began using a 1970 Slingerland drum kit, citing that it had a better sound than a new <b>kit,</b> <b>and</b> was cheaper. Coghill uses Avedis Zildjian cymbals. He says that he has been offered sponsorship, but opted for older drums as a matter of preference. Despite this assertion, as of 2007 Coghill's name is mentioned in the Brady Drums artist roster.|$|E
5|$|For much of Arsenal's history, {{their home}} colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though {{this has not}} always been the case. The choice of red is in {{recognition}} of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of <b>kit</b> <b>and</b> a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.|$|E

5|$|The French team {{traditionally}} {{played in}} blue shirts, white shorts, and red socks, {{the colors of}} the national flag, and as such were nicknamed les tricolores. Due to the mostly blue strip the French team currently wears, the team is now often referred to as les Bleus (the Blues), like many other French sporting teams. When this strip clashes with that of their opponents, such as in games against Scotland and Italy, French players wear white. New strips were developed for the 2007 World Cup, one of which is a darker blue. In June 2011 they relaunched another kit which they wear blue shirt, blue shorts and blue socks for their home <b>kit</b> <b>and</b> they wear white shirt, white shorts and white socks for their away kit.|$|E
5|$|The mod was {{developed}} by Long War Studios, a team that came to include four core members, with assistance from 29 contributors, 20 voice actors, and three members of Firaxis Games, the developer of Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. According {{to one of the}} mod's core developers, Amineri, the mod started as a series of changes to the base game's configuration file, and grew more expansive as the team's capabilities grew. By the end of the mod's development, the team was working directly with the Unreal Development <b>Kit,</b> <b>and</b> had created a Java-based tool to help manage the changes that the mod was making.|$|E
5|$|The only {{floppy disk}} drives that were readily {{available}} in 1975 were IBM compatible 8-inch drives. MITS selected the Pertec FD400 disk drive which could store over 300,000 bytes of data.
