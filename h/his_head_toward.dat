60|$|Andrew turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> his friend. The tone puzzled him.|$|E
60|$|Clayton nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the {{prostrate}} {{form of the}} Russian. For a time neither spoke.|$|E
60|$|He turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> {{the little}} orchestra, which {{was playing a}} low and tremulous waltz tune.|$|E
60|$|The {{turning of}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{slightly}} <b>toward</b> {{me at this}} point was like a sign of strong feeling in any other man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't go that way!" [...] cried Andy, {{as he saw}} <b>his</b> cousin <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> the brook. [...] "You'll {{get stuck}} and you'll never get out." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here the boy turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> again <b>toward</b> the water, without {{directly}} answering Phonny, {{though he}} called {{out at the same}} time in an audible voice, ...|$|R
60|$|Sheldon {{inclined}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Joan, and as {{he spoke}} she {{felt that he had}} become a trifle stiff.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not hankering {{to be the}} {{man that}} lays hands on you while he's around," [...] Pete {{announced}} conclusively, nodding <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Buck.|$|E
6000|$|... "What say?" [...] queried the man bending <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Albert, {{his form}} being almost {{lost in the}} snow that {{streamed}} against them both.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly he paused, his slender {{hand up to}} <b>his</b> lips, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> turned <b>toward</b> the door, an {{expression}} of tense expectancy in every line of his face.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a sudden}} deep buzz from outside the building. Shouts drifted up from below. Reinhart turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly <b>toward</b> the window, his heart frozen with fear.|$|R
6000|$|Shorty cocked <b>his</b> <b>head</b> triumphantly <b>toward</b> a tin pail of eggs on the table. [...] "Seven {{dollars a}} clatter, though," [...] he confessed, after another minute of silent rubbing.|$|R
6000|$|... "King! War!" [...] said McTurk, jerking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the wall, where hung a {{small wooden}} West-African war-drum, a gift to McTurk from a naval uncle.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{could draw}} like that, maâ€™am," [...] he said, with a jerk of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the ruined castle, [...] "I should {{give up the}} sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|While Dot and Tot {{were trying}} to make up their minds whether to be afraid or not, the Alligator turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the Queen and said, gently: ...|$|E
60|$|She put {{her arms}} round him and pillowed her <b>head</b> upon <b>his</b> breast. He turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly <b>toward</b> her, and now his eyes--hollowed and rimmed with purple--looked {{straight}} into hers.|$|R
60|$|The white dog {{had risen}} and stood warily {{shifting}} his nose. He sniffed the wind, turned round and round, and slowly stiffened with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> pointed <b>toward</b> the eastern {{rise of the}} plateau.|$|R
60|$|I saw Spears shake <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and look}} <b>toward</b> the bench. It was plain what that meant.|$|R
6000|$|He {{regarded}} her darkly. [...] "Well, I trust you. You won't give me away. I'm {{not so sure}} of her." [...] He nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the open door.|$|E
6000|$|The Florist: [...] "Dropic? With icepergs on the wintows?" [...] He nods <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the frosty panes, {{and wraps}} {{a sheet of}} {{tissue-paper}} around the cotton and the flowers.|$|E
60|$|The ape-man {{turned and}} raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the jungle, while there pealed from his lips, time after time, the fearsome {{cry of the}} bull-ape who would summon his fellows.|$|E
6000|$|The men at {{the table}} were clamoring for an {{explanation}} of the interruption. Two of them were approaching Billy with the avowed intention of [...] "turning him out," [...] when he turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> suddenly <b>toward</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] cried Mavering, and {{the fact}} seemed to {{brighten}} him immediately. [...] "If you want to, stuff these things in, while I'm doing up these other things." [...] He nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> side-wise <b>toward</b> the desk.|$|R
6000|$|... "They play a deep game altogether. What do {{you suppose}} she is, now?" [...] This {{question}} Archie asked in a whisper, bending <b>his</b> <b>head</b> forward <b>toward</b> <b>his</b> brother, {{though there was no}} one else in the carriage with them.|$|R
60|$|He turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> {{the door}} by which he had entered, for there was an altercation {{going on in the}} hallway and Mr. Conant's voice could be heard angrily protesting.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{all come}} from there," [...] he said. [...] "After a while we go there." [...] And this time he jerked <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the north. [...] "Be Galus," [...] he concluded.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{the fellow}} that {{assaulted}} you?" [...] {{asked the man}} at the desk, nodding <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Lemuel, who tried to speak; but it was like a nightmare; he could not make any sound.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Walters {{eyed him}} uneasily, {{and with his}} cap firmly gripped {{in his left hand}} saluted him with the right. Then he turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{sideways}} <b>toward</b> the passage. The captain repeated his question in a voice, if anything, louder than before.|$|R
60|$|The vaqueros {{were paying}} no further {{attention}} to him, and the Indian passed out and sought his pony; {{but when he}} had mounted and ridden from town he took a strange direction for one whose path lies to the east, since he turned <b>his</b> pony's <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the northwest.|$|R
60|$|Just then it {{occurred}} to Tarzan of the Apes that Numa had loitered beneath the tree for a sufficient length of time, so he raised <b>his</b> young <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the heavens, and there rang out upon the terrified ears of the two old men the awful warning challenge of the anthropoid.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was sitting}} in the smoking room there, a few moments ago," [...] he began, jerking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the door. [...] "There were some men talking--decent fellows, not dirty scandalmongers. They spoke of Louise Maurel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you {{recognise}} {{this young}} man {{as one of the}} persons who robbed you?" [...] interrupted the judge, nodding <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Lemuel, who now lifted his head and looked his accuser fearlessly in her pretty eyes.|$|E
60|$|He motioned with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> {{the window}} which was behind them, and which {{looked out over}} the river. They were all three silent for a moment. Then Weiss struck the table lightly with his clenched fist.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Keswick, hurriedly {{shaking hands}} with him. [...] "I am afraid {{something}} very unexpected has happened, and so beg you will excuse me. Good-morning." [...] And passing through the gateway, he rapidly strode toward the house, while Lawrence prepared to turn <b>his</b> horse's <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the Springs.|$|R
6000|$|... "He turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sharply <b>toward</b> me as I {{raised the}} rifle," [...] says Mr. Roosevelt, in writing of this adventure, [...] "and the bullet went fairly into his throat, {{just under the}} jaw, {{breaking}} his neck, and bringing him down in his tracks with hardly a kick." ...|$|R
60|$|The clergyman {{looked a}} little down again, and was silent; but still turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{slightly}} sideways <b>toward</b> <b>his</b> hostess, as if awaiting some reply to Pierre from her.|$|R
