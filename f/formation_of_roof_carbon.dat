Longwall Visual Analysis (LVA) is a software package that continuously monitors shield pressures and shearer position in longwall mines. LVA has been running on 22 Australian longwalls {{for up to five}} years, and as a result a very substantial database of shield pressure trends {{in a wide range of}} longwall situations has been collected. This database has been analysed to develop indicators that will give operators and geotechnical engineers advance warnings of developing conditions such as weighting events and difficult roof conditions. LVA displays live charts of data, such as shield leg pressures, loading rates, and yield frequencies. Data analysis techniques were applied to historical data records from multiple longwall sites in order to develop a “Cavity Risk Index” (CRI). The CRI indicates the relative risk <b>of</b> <b>roof</b> cavities developing, and it is based on pressure trends that indicate significant yielding and loading rates spanning a region of relatively low support. Case studies from two different longwalls are given, showing how the CRI can give real-time advance warning <b>of</b> the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>roof</b> cavities...|$|R

The results of treatment 18 children (21 joints) with the hip congenital dysplasia of II (14 joints) and III (7 joints) degree according to Tonnis have been analyzed. Gradual closed reduction of the dislocation has been performed in all the cases. Mean age {{at the time of}} reduction was 8, 2 ± 0. 56 months (5 - 14 months). Supraacetabular tunnelization was made six months after dislocation reduction. Indications for intervention were considered in view of the x-ray parameters and signs of acetabulum showing its potential developmental delay. Results. The initial value of the acetabular index on the side of dislocation amounted to 43 ± 0. 8 °. The impairment of the shape of acetabular vault and its upper-and-outer edge of moderate (9 joints) and severe (12 joints) degree has been observed in all the joints involved. The mean value of the acetabular index amounted to 22. 1 ± 0. 947 ° (P< 0. 01) 3 years after the first tunnelization procedure. In the mentioned period the pathological value of AI remained for seven joints, the value conformed to the norm in 11 observations, and it was considered as a boundary state in three cases.

Instead, we analyzed the embryos of a soft-shelled turtle species with highly emarginated skull. In fact, soft-shelled turtles have only a narrow bar of bone across the temporal region lateral to the external adductor muscles due to large scale emargination from the dorsal and ventral margins of the cheek (Ogushi, 1911, Sheil, 2003). In normal development of soft-shelled turtles, the postorbital bone does not grow in a posterior direction significantly, keeping its relatively small size within the dermatocranium (Sheil, 2003;Sánchez-Villagra et al.,, Sánchez-Villagra et al., Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2009). Therefore, the small postorbital bone of soft-shelled turtles does not largely contribute to the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a bony <b>roof</b> at the temporal region of the skull.|$|R

Embryologic and genetic mechanisms are still unknown, and to date, no animal models are available. Ultrasound diagnosis is generally suspected after 22 weeks of gestation, and usually the abnormality is suggested by ventriculomegaly. Morphological analysis of 40 fetuses after medical termination of pregnancy allowed us to confirm that rhombencephalosynapsis was always associated with other brain abnormalities or malformations: Purkinje cell heterotopias, fusion of colliculi, forking and/or atresia of the aqueduct and of the third ventricle resulting in a fusion of the thalami, agenesis of the corpus callosum, lobar holoprosencephaly and neural tube defects. Pons and medulla were very infrequently abnormal. Furthermore, complete autopsy {{made it possible to}} separate either pure neurologic phenotypes, or associated with extraneural anomalies from syndromic forms: Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez syndrome (1 case) and VACTERL-H syndrome (6 cases). The number of our fetal cases strongly suggests that VACTERL-H association related with rhombencephalosynapsis emerges as a non-random association. Furthermore, recurrence and consanguinity were noted in two different families, which argue for a sporadic or inherited cause. From our results, it could be suggested that rhombencephalosynapsis may be due to defective genes regulating <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>roof</b> plate and the development of midline cerebellar primordium at the junction of the mesencephalon and of the first rhombomere...|$|R

A model for tube <b>formation</b> by <b>roofing</b> <b>of</b> a channel is proposed and involves first describing lava as a Bingham liquid flowing down a slope. It is further assumed that lava flows in a channel with rectangular cross section: {{as a result of}} heat loss into the atmosphere, a crust is gradually formed on the upper surface of the flow and this crust eventually welds to the channel levees. We assume that a lava tube is formed when such a crust is sufficiently thick to resist the drag of the underlying flow and to sustain itself under its own weight. The minimum thickness of the crust satisfying such conditions depends on the tensile strength and shear strength of the crust itself. Assuming that the growth of the crust produces a downflow linear increase of the shear stress at the interface between flowing lava and the crust, the distance is evaluated between the eruption vent and the point where the tube is formed. The model predicts that if the flow rate is constant, the thickness of the flow increases as the crust fragments grow and weld to each other, and the velocity of the crust decreases to zero. Once the lava tube is formed, the initial flow rate can be achieved by a Row thickness smaller than the vertical size of the tube, with the same viscous dissipation: this may explain why under steady state conditions, the lava level inside a tube is frequently lower than the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the tube itself...|$|R
