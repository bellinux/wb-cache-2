6000|$|NAPOLEON (echoing her, {{with his}} <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table</b> and his cheeks on his hands, {{looking at the}} letter). I wonder! (The Strange Lady puts the letter down alight on the snuffers tray, and sits down beside Napoleon, in the same attitude, <b>elbows</b> on <b>table,</b> cheeks on hands, {{watching}} it burn. When it is burnt, they simultaneously turn their eyes and look at one another. The curtain steals down and hides them.) ...|$|R
60|$|The Pfarrer {{pushed aside}} his empty pot and leaned his <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{there is}} an {{opponent}} with <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table</b> lose $2000. If not, lose $4000.|$|R
60|$|Ed {{rested his}} <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table</b> and fixed his bright black eyes on his father.|$|R
60|$|Verrall leant {{forward on}} the <b>table,</b> <b>elbows</b> upon it, and {{the fingers of his}} two hands intertwined.|$|R
60|$|Elsie {{sat with}} her <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table,</b> gazing in silence towards the empty fireplace. She looked weary and sad.|$|R
60|$|Jake roused {{himself with}} a jerk. Dick leaned forward wearily with his <b>elbow</b> on the <b>table,</b> but he looked resolute.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat down}} {{opposite}} him, with her <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table,</b> her chin in her palm, her {{eyes full of}} shadows.|$|R
60|$|He leaned an <b>elbow</b> on her <b>table,</b> {{and covered}} {{his eyes with}} his hand. The table trembled in the silence that followed.|$|R
60|$|The coroner, one <b>elbow</b> on the <b>table,</b> {{one large}} hand holding firmly the {{somewhat}} fleshy chin, {{looked at the}} juryman somewhat contemptuously.|$|R
60|$|After supper, Borg, both <b>elbows</b> on <b>table</b> {{and huge}} {{misshapen}} hands supporting chin and jaws, sat puffing stinking Siwash tobacco and staring straight before him. It {{would have seemed}} ruminative, the stare, had his eyes been softer or had he blinked; as it was, his face was set and trance-like.|$|R
60|$|Torres {{leaned his}} <b>elbows</b> upon the <b>table,</b> {{swallowed}} {{a mouthful of}} smoke, and spake--each word being projected in a little puff of gray.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{looked at}} her again, but less {{steadily}} than before; and resting her <b>elbow</b> on the <b>table,</b> covered {{her eyes with her}} hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must sit up straight. I mustn't sprawl with my <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table.</b> It is only common, vulgar people behave that way." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{struck a}} match {{and held it}} for her. Joan sat with her <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table</b> and smoked in silence. She was thinking.|$|R
60|$|She shivered, as if cold, {{and setting}} her <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table,</b> {{she took her}} chin in her hands, and sat staring before her.|$|R
60|$|Leonard {{lost the}} indulgent air {{he had so}} far assumed, and Andrew, leaning forward with <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table,</b> fixed his eyes on him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir!" [...] adjudged Gearheart, after a pause, leaning his <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table</b> {{and looking}} {{out of the door}} on the far-stretching, sun-glorified plain.|$|R
60|$|Emlyn, who {{had been}} {{standing}} all this while, sat herself down, set her <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table</b> and rested her chin upon her clenched hands.|$|R
6000|$|And he, with {{a sudden}} change of manner, and leaning forward with an <b>elbow</b> on the <b>table</b> - [...] "Do you think this entirely wise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But what's she to {{do while}} we're away?' said I, putting my small <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table</b> to argue the point. 'She can't live by herself.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{threw himself}} with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table,</b> {{covering}} {{his face with his}} hands as he spoke.|$|R
60|$|She {{had never}} heard {{philosophy}} pass those lips before. Impressed even in her agitation, she leaned her <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table,</b> her chin on her hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, what's {{the matter}} with you, Tony?" [...] {{inquires}} Mr. Guppy, looking at him, snuffers in hand, as he sits down with his <b>elbow</b> on the <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|Armand {{led her to}} the bench, and {{she sank}} down on it, numb and inert, resting her <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table</b> and her head in her hands.|$|R
60|$|He {{was leaning}} with his <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table</b> and his chin on his hands, {{looking into a}} futurity {{which seemed to be}} sketched out on the tablecloth.|$|R
60|$|Martina {{rested her}} <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table</b> and her chin upon her little hand, staring me {{full in the}} face with her quick eyes that pierced like nails.|$|R
60|$|The {{old woman}} leaned her <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table,</b> and resting her face upon her two hands, {{made a show}} of being in great distress--or really was, perhaps.|$|R
60|$|He set his <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table,</b> {{and took}} {{his head in his}} hands. A groan escaped him. She heard it, and looked at him in her furtive way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Gregory, {{and for a}} {{long time}} he could not say any more. He sat with his <b>elbow</b> on the <b>table,</b> and his head against his lifted hand.|$|R
60|$|Neither of them answered. Blanca {{lay back}} in her chair; the priest sat with one <b>elbow</b> on the <b>table,</b> his cheek resting on his upturned palm. He was very tired.|$|R
60|$|He {{drew his}} chair nearer to my desk, and I leaned forward, with my <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table,</b> the finger-tips {{of one hand}} in contact {{with those of the}} other.|$|R
60|$|He {{sank into}} a chair and rested his <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table,</b> burying {{his face in his}} hands. Blakeney went up to him and placed a kindly hand upon his shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now tell me {{more about}} him," [...] he said finally, as he leaned both <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table</b> and {{fastened}} his glowing eyes upon the equally heated face of Surgeon-Captain Emery.|$|R
60|$|King and Cardinal {{looked into}} each other's eyes, the King's narrowing, the Cardinal's dilating, the King leaning {{forward in his}} chair, <b>elbows</b> on the <b>table,</b> the Cardinal {{standing}} tense and suddenly rigid.|$|R
