40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringDale E. SchinstockThe {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop methods and tools for generating <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A method of generating <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> is needed to describe data collection missions, such as taking aerial photographs. The <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> are two-dimensional and exist in a plane a fixed distance above the Earth. Since the flight areas are typically small, the Earth's curvature is not accounted for in <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation. Designed to completely cover a specified field area, the plans consist of a series of line and arc segments and are described in a format that is recognized by the Piccolo autopilot used by the Kansas State University Autonomous Vehicle Systems (AVS) Lab. Grids are designed to cover the field area, and turn maneuvers are designed to ensure efficient <b>flight</b> <b>plans.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation process is broken into several parts. Once a field area is defined, path lines covering this area are calculated. Optimal turn maneuvers are calculated to smoothly connect the path lines in a continuous <b>flight</b> <b>plan.</b> Two methods of determining path line order are discussed. One method flies the lines in the order that they are arranged spatially; the other method decides line order by calculating the shortest turn maneuver to another path line. After the <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> is generated, a text file is created in a format that is readable for the autopilot. In order to easily generate <b>flight</b> <b>plans,</b> a graphical user interface (GUI) has been created. This GUI allows a user to easily generate a <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> without modifying any code. The <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation software is used to build example <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> for this thesis. These <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> were flown with an UAV and test results are presented...|$|R

2500|$|Co-owners (referred to as ‘owners’) of a {{fractional}} program's {{aircraft are}} required to pay {{a percentage of the}} aircraft’s purchase price that is proportionate to the amount of hours they wish to fly per year, for the duration of their contract – typically 5 years.

2500|$|The recent {{decision}} {{to join the}} Brady and Brownwood MOAs will provide additional maneuver airspace for Air Intercept Control/Air Combat Maneuvering (AIC/ACM) training. When scheduled concurrently, these areas enable numerous aircraft from several units to participate in joint fighter/bomber training exercises. Brownwood MOA {{is the subject of}} an innovative test to improve the dissemination of SUA status information to non-participating aircraft. This test, conducted to address action items in meeting Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Free <b>Flight</b> <b>planning</b> commitments, will use a combination of recently deployed airspace scheduling and reporting systems, including the FAA's Special-Use Airspace Management System (SAMS) and the Department of Defense Military Airspace Management System (MAMS). The intent of the trial is to provide more accurate [...] "near real-time" [...] area status via the internet to civilian users, especially to regional air carriers particularly affected by required rerouting around Brownwood MOA. Should the test and the technology prove successful and cost-effective, the result could address long-standing civilian dissatisfaction with the quality and timeliness of FAA-distributed special use airspace status information. In particular, such functionality may be appropriate for incorporation into the next generation of Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) modernization equipment.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>plans</b> are {{documents}} {{filed by}} a pilot or flight dispatcher {{with the local}} Civil Aviation Authority (e.g. FAA in the USA) prior to departure which indicate the plane's <b>planned</b> route or <b>flight</b> path. <b>Flight</b> <b>plan</b> format is specified in the ICAO Doc 4444. They generally include basic information such as departure and arrival points, estimated time en route, alternate airports in case of bad weather, type of flight (whether instrument flight rules IFR or visual flight rules VFR), the pilot's information, number of people on board and information about the aircraft itself. In most countries, <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> are required for flights under IFR, but may be optional for flying VFR unless crossing international borders. <b>Flight</b> <b>plans</b> are highly recommended, especially when flying over inhospitable areas, such as water, as they provide a way of alerting rescuers if the flight is overdue. In the United States and Canada, when an aircraft is crossing the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), either an IFR or a special type of VFR <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> called a DVFR (Defense VFR) <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> must be filed.For IFR <b>flights,</b> <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> are used by air traffic control to initiate tracking and routing services.

50|$|Despite all {{the effort}} taken to {{optimise}} <b>flight</b> <b>plans,</b> {{there are certain}} circumstances {{in which it is}} advantageous to file suboptimal plans. In busy airspace with a number of competing aircraft, the optimum routes and preferred altitudes may be oversubscribed. This problem can be worse in busy periods, such as when everyone wants to arrive at an airport as soon as it opens for the day. If all the aircraft file optimal <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> then to avoid overloading, air traffic control may refuse permission for some of the <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> or delay the allocated takeoff slots.
