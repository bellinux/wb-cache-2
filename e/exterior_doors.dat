5|$|The Princess Block {{disappeared}} from Henderson’s Directory, a local city directory, in 1956, implying that its researchers {{thought it was}} completely vacant. The building was re-included in 1960, but the theatre's former address at 10337 Whyte Avenue remained vacant and unlisted for another six years. By 1966, the <b>exterior</b> <b>doors</b> had been removed entirely to create storefronts (see photo), and the theatre itself had been occupied by Quick Cash Exchange, a pawnshop. The third floor was split into several apartments, while the second floor was entirely occupied by Strathcona TV and Columbia Photo Studio. The basement was still a pool hall, Princess Billiards.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, one of Independence Hall's <b>exterior</b> <b>doors</b> was {{replaced}} by glass, allowing some view of the bell even when the building was closed. When Congress enacted the nation's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, the bell was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds. In {{the early days of}} World War II, it was feared that the bell might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, and city officials considered moving the bell to Fort Knox, to be stored with the nation's gold reserves. The idea provoked a storm of protest from around the nation, and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into which it could be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped when studies found that the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall. The bell was again tapped on D-Day, as well as in victory on V-E Day and V-J Day.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} DIN {{doors are}} defined in DIN 18101 (published 1955-07, 1985-01, 2014-08).

The DIN commission was also responsible for the harmonized European standard DIN EN 14351-1 for <b>exterior</b> <b>doors</b> and DIN EN 14351-2 for interior doors (published 2006-07, 2010-08), which defines the requirements for the CE marking giving standard sizes by examples in the appendix.|$|E
25|$|A {{flush door}} is a {{completely}} smooth door, having plywood or MDF fixed over a light timber frame, the hollow parts of which are often filled with a cardboard core material. Skins can also be made out of hardboards, {{the first of which}} was invented by William H Mason in 1924. Called Masonite, its construction involved pressing and steaming wood chips into boards. Flush doors are most commonly employed in the interior of a dwelling, although slightly more substantial versions are occasionally used as <b>exterior</b> <b>doors,</b> especially within hotels and other buildings containing many independent dwellings.|$|E

25|$|Of course, many conjectural {{decisions}} were made, {{such as the}} precise locations of the <b>exterior</b> <b>doors</b> and the size and locations of the windows. On the interior, {{the location of the}} staircase to the loft and the form of the large open hearths and built-in bed box also involved conjecture, but were based on historical precedent. In the original Brooklyn Museum installation, there were two bed boxes on the exterior wall of the north room. When the house was moved to its present location in 2006, it was decided that if the house did have a bed box it more logically was on an interior wall next to the hearth as you now will see it.|$|E
25|$|The {{offices on}} the second floor {{generally}} have been modernized with acoustical tile ceilings, fluorescent fixtures and vinyl floors. The old <b>exterior</b> <b>doors</b> remain, generally with glass replacing the shuttered sections, except for several windows on the rear lavatories and kitchen. Air conditioners are mounted in the transoms over the doors. On the southeast corner is a large inspector's office, with a counter for public business. Some old masonry partitions had been removed or altered to create this space. Along the east side, small rooms have been partitioned off and in the rear northeast corner is the large Port Director's office, in its original configuration. Across the north rear are a men's lavatory, a women's lavatory and a kitchen, all with black and white floor tiles. The kitchen appears to be original to the building and has traces of the original masonry cooking stove and flue. The left rear north corner room now used for training is also floored in old black and white tiles.|$|E

The transporter room set was also reused from The Next Generation, with alterations that included the addition of a glowing pattern along the transporter's walls inspired by one of Zimmerman's sweaters; the set had previously been used on The Final Frontier. The galley was the set used for Deanna Troi's office, the dining hall was a redress of the USS Enterprise-D's Observation lounge, and the Federation president's office was a redesign of the Ten-Forward lounge, the <b>exterior</b> <b>doors</b> to which accidentally retained their Enterprise-D markings.

2500|$|It is {{especially}} important to get the hand and swing correct on <b>exterior</b> <b>doors,</b> as the transom is usually sloped and sealed to resist water entry, and to properly drain. [...] In some custom millwork (or with some master carpenters), the manufacture or installer will bevel the leading edge (the first edge to meet the jamb as the door is closing) so that the door fits tight without binding. [...] Specifying an incorrect hand or swing will cause the door to bind, not close properly or leak (for <b>exterior</b> <b>doors).</b> Fixing this specification error will be expensive or time consuming.|$|E
