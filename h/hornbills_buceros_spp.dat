50|$|Preening {{may serve}} a {{secondary}} function in courtship displays with {{a role in}} signalling the health of birds. In Bohemian waxwings, preen oil increased the UV reflectance of feathers. During the breeding season, great white pelicans (Pelecanus onocrotalus) produce a uropygial gland secretion that is orange-red in colour which, on application to the feathers, imparts a pink flush to it. The yellow feathers of a great <b>hornbill</b> (<b>Buceros</b> bicornis) are also cosmetically coloured during preening.|$|R
50|$|The Nam Neun IBA area of Nam Et is {{adjacent}} to the NBCA. Nam Neun is 85,450 ha in size, and is {{at an altitude of}} 800 - 1500 m above sea level. The habitat is characterized as mixed deciduous forest, as well as dry evergreen forest, with stands of bamboo, and occasional conifers; cleared areas have been replaced by areas of secondary grassland.

This is a dense, carvable substance that makes up the solid casque growing above the upper mandible (from the bird's forehead). It is not ivory, horn, or bone, yet it has been called ivory for many centuries. It is softer than real ivory and is a creamy yellow in color, becoming red {{at the top and}} sides.|$|R
50|$|The great <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (<b>Buceros</b> bicornis) {{also known}} as the great Indian hornbill or great pied hornbill, is one of the larger members of the hornbill family. It is found in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Its impressive size and colour have made it important in many tribal cultures and rituals. The great hornbill is long-lived, living for nearly 50 years in captivity. It is predominantly frugivorous, but is an opportunist and will prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds.|$|R

40|$|Hornbill has an {{important}} role in forest regeneration, but the limited variety andamount of food available to birds will eventually threaten the population of hornbills. Identification of feed plant and hornbil species diversity was conducted at the HarapanRainforest from March to April 2011. Hornbills plant feed samples were taken right after thebirds were eating. The results showed there are nine plant species of hornbills feed found in theHarapan Rainforest: Santiria apiculata, Elaeocarpus sphaericus, Sapium baccatum, Lithocarpusreinwardtii, Disoxylum excelsum, Ficus curtipes, Knema globularia, Knema furfuracea, andSantiria oblongifolia.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of seed dispersal via animal link vectors (endozoochoric dispersal) may explain how most Burseraceae {{were able to}} expand their range so efficiently across the globe. Beiselia, Boswellia, and Triomma have dry fruits better suited for wind dispersal, but most Burseraceae have fleshy, edible fruit that is eaten by many animal dispersers. The seeds may provide a high reward in fat (24-73%) and protein (2.7-25.9%) if digested, but many animals eat just the fleshy part of the fruit and either discard the endocarp right away or excrete it some time later. Some known Burseraceae fruit consumers include <b>hornbills</b> (<b>Buceros</b> bicornis, Ceratogyma atrata, C. cylindricus, Penelopides panini), oilbirds (Steatnoris caripensis), fruit pigeons, warblers, vireos, orioles, flycatchers, tanagers, woodpeckers, loeries, primates (Cercopithecus spp., Lophocebus albigena), lemurs (Varecia variegate subsp. variegate), and sun bears (Helarctos malayanus).

40|$|The {{population}} of great <b>hornbills</b> (<b>Buceros</b> bicornis) in the United States is rapidly aging, and captive breeding efforts have not met population managersâ€™ expectations for a sustainable captive group. Little {{is known about}} the reproductive physiology of these birds. This study reports the first data on the re-productive endocrinology of the great hornbill. The hormone profiles of the only pair of these birds that hatched a chick in the 1999 â€“ 2000 breeding season are compared to the profiles of six other pairs of hornbills, from different institutions in the United States, that did not reproduce successfully that season. The study investigates the estradiol, corticosterone, and testosterone profiles of these seven pairs of birds, establishing a base of knowledge from which endocrine data may be used to improve the success of captive breeding programs. The estradiol profiles from this study indicate a difference in hormonal patterns between laying and non-laying female great hornbills. Egg-laying females had significantly higher estradiol concentrations during the breeding season than the non-laying females (Po 0. 003).

6000|$|In {{regard to}} birds which build in holes or {{construct}} domed nests, other advantages, as Mr. Wallace remarks, besides concealment are gained, such as {{shelter from the}} rain, greater warmth, and in hot countries protection from the rays of the sun;[210] {{so that it is}} no valid objection to his view that many birds having both sexes obscurely coloured build concealed nests.[211] The female <b>Hornbills</b> (<b>Buceros),</b> for instance, of India and Africa are protected, during nidification, with extraordinary care, for the male plaisters up the hole in which the female sits on her eggs, and leaves only a small orifice through which he feeds her; she is thus kept a close prisoner during the whole period of incubation;[212] yet female hornbills are not more conspicuously coloured than many other birds of equal size which build open nests. It is a more serious objection to Mr. Wallaceâ€™s view, as is admitted by him, that in some few groups the males are brilliantly coloured and the females obscure, and yet the latter hatch their eggs in domed nests. This is the case with the GrallinÃ¦ of Australia, the Superb Warblers (MaluridÃ¦) of the same country, the Sun-birds (NectariniÃ¦), and with several of the Australian Honey-suckers or MeliphagidÃ¦.[213] ...|$|R

Similarly, the Knobbed hornbill is more closely related to Rhyticeros, leaving the Rufous-necked hornbill {{the only member of the}} genus Aceros.|$|R

40|$|The loss of {{tropical}} forests and associated biodiversity {{is a global}} concern. Conservation efforts in tropical countries such as India have mostly focused on state-administered protected areas despite the existence of vast tracts of forest outside these areas. We studied hornbills (Bucerotidae), an ecologically important vertebrate group and a flagship for tropical forest conservation, to assess the importance of forests outside protected areas in Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India. We conducted a state-wide survey to record encounters with hornbills in seven protected areas, six state-managed reserved forests and six community-managed unclassed forests. We estimated the density of hornbills in one protected area, four reserved forests and two unclassed forests in eastern Arunachal Pradesh. The state-wide survey showed that the mean rate of encounter of rufous-necked hornbills Aceros nipalensis was four times higher in protected areas than in reserved forests and 22 times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The mean rate of encounter of wreathed hornbills Rhyticeros undulatus was twice as high in protected areas as in reserved forests and eight times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The densities of rufous-necked hornbill were higher inside protected areas, whereas the densities of great <b>hornbill</b> <b>Buceros</b> bicornis and wreathed hornbill were similar inside and outside protected areas. Key informant surveys revealed possible extirpation of some hornbill species at sites in two protected areas and three unclassed forests. These results highlight a paradoxical situation where individual populations of hornbills are being lost even in some legally protected habitat, whereas they continue to persist {{over most of the}} landscape. Better protection within protected areas and creative community-based conservation efforts elsewhere are necessary to maintain hornbill populations in this biodiversity-rich region...|$|R
