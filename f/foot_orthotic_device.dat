However, previous biomechanical research involving either custom or SCO has only focused on rearfoot biomechanics. The {{purpose of this study was}} therefore to determine changes in multi-segment foot biomechanics during shod walking with and without an SCO. We chose to investigate an SCO device that incorporates a heatmoulding process, to further understand if the moulding process would significantly alter rearfoot, midfoot, or shank kinematics as compared to a no-orthotic condition. We hypothesized the SCO, whether moulded or nonmoulded, would reduce peak rearfoot eversion, tibial internal rotation, arch deformation, and plantar fascia strain as compared to the no-orthoses condition. Methods: Twenty participants had retroreflective markers placed on the right limb to represent forefoot, midfoot, rearfoot and shank segments. 3 D kinematics were recorded using an 8 -camera motion capture system whil...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of the angle of a wedged insole on knee varus torque during walking. Fifteen healthy {{subjects}} were recruited. Knee varus torque was measured using three-dimensional motion analysis (Elite). Knee varus torque was normalized to gait cycle (0 %: initial contact; 100 %: ipsilateral initial contact) and stance phase (0 %: initial contact; 100 %: ipsilateral toe off). The average peaks of knee varus torque during the stance phase of the gait cycle according to the different insole angles (10 or 15 degrees) were compared using one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. The results showed that in the early stance phase, the average peak knee varus torque increased significantly for both the medial 10 and 15 degree wedged insole conditions and decreased significantly for both the lateral 10 and 15 degree wedged insole conditions as compared with no insole (p. 05). In the late stance phase, the average peak knee varus torque increased significantly for the medial 10 and 15 degree wedged insole conditions (p. 05). We suggest that these results may be beneficial for manufacturing <b>foot</b> <b>orthotic</b> <b>devices,</b> such as wedged insoles, to control medial an...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the relationship between anterior knee pain and lower limb biomechanics in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals during walking. Although <b>foot</b> <b>orthotic</b> <b>devices</b> are often prescribed to realign lower extremity mechanics, there is conflicting evidence to support this. A quantitative study explored the dynamics of walking barefoot, shod and with <b>orthotic</b> <b>devices</b> using the 3 D Kinematic Motion Analysis System, Vicon 370. Sample sizes of 30 control subjects and 30 subjects with anterior knee pain were recruited. Kinematic gait parameters and temporal-spatial gait parameters were compared between the two groups and a thorough static clinical examination was provided. The relationship of alignment and knee pain was also examined using the Positional Upright MRI Scanner. A group of 15 subjects with anterior knee pain and a group of 5 asymptomatic subjects were examined radiographically barefoot, shod and with <b>orthotic</b> <b>devices.</b> An increase in Q-angle was shown in the knee pain group with an added angle increase in the females in both groups. This could signify that a higher Q-angle may influence biomechanics of the knee joint by creating an abnormally increased valgus angle. Evidence was found that there was a strong relationship between eversion and inversion of the foot with internal and external tibial rotation of the leg. This coupling relationship may lend insight into the behavior of the lower leg and anterior knee pain whilst walking. Small changes were noted when wearing the <b>orthotic</b> <b>devices</b> which may be advantageous biomechanically and they were also of benefit in correcting pronatory changes or movements more distal to the foot. The results of the MRI study were disappointing but many limitations were shown to support the results. Upon finishing this thesis, it is apparent that documented evidence of any relationship between anterior knee pain and lower limb biomechanics is imperative to clinicians in order to aid in treatment plans of patients but also in preventative treatment. Further research is required to enhance the clinicians’ knowledge and understanding of the foot and leg dynamically...|$|R

Individuals suffering from stroke and other neurological disorders often experience inadequate dorsiflexion during swing phase of the gait cycle due to dorsiflexor muscle weakness.

Along with two commercially available AFOs some designs possess promising prospective to be used as daily-wear device.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral pain {{syndrome}} is a frequently reported condition in active adults. A {{wide variety of}} conservative treatment strategies have been described. As yet, no optimal strategy has been identified. Application of <b>orthotic</b> <b>devices</b> e. g. knee braces, knee straps, forms of taping of the knee, active training devices, knee sleeves and inlay soles to support the foot have been advocated to treat this condition. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of <b>foot</b> and knee <b>orthotics</b> for treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials register (Issue 2, 2000), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2000; EMBASE (January 1988 to March 2000); CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2000) and PEDro (up to March 2000). Relevant orthotic companies were contacted. The date {{of the most recent}} search was May 2000. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing the effectiveness of knee or <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics</b> for treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome were selected. Trials describing the use of <b>orthotic</b> <b>devices</b> in conjunction with operative treatment were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three reviewers independently assessed methodological quality of the identified trials by use of {{a modified version of the}} Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group assessment tool, consisting of 11 items. Two reviewers extracted data without blinding. Trialists were contacted to obtain missing data. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials involving 362 participants were included in this review. Five other trials await possible inclusion if further information can be obtained. Due to clinical heterogeneity, we refrained from statistical pooling and conducted analysis by grading the strength of scientific evidence. The level of obtained research-based evidence was graded as limited as all trials were of low methodological quality. This limited research-based evidence showed the Protonics brace at six week follow-up was significantly more effective for decrease in pain (weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups 3. 2; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 8 to 3. 6), functional improvement on the Kujala score (WMD 45. 6; 95 % CI 43. 4 to 47. 7) and change in patellofemoral congruence angle (WMD 17. 2; 95 % CI 14. 1 to 20. 3) when compared to no treatment. A comprehensive programme including tape application was significantly superior to a monitored exercise programme without tape application for decrease in worst pain (WMD 1. 6; 95 % CI 0. 4 to 2. 8) and usual pain (WMD 1. 2; 95 % CI 0. 2 to 2. 1), and clinical change and functional improvement questionnaire scores at four weeks follow-up.

40|$|Background. Accidental falls {{comprise}} a serious health concern in older adults. Partially {{accounting for the}} high incidence rates is postural instability. While customized <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics</b> can improve certain measures of functional stability, {{the purpose of this}} study was to explore the degree to which prefabricated orthotics benefit this population and to expand the evidence base to postural stability. Methods. Eighteen healthy older adults (72. 7 ± 4. 8 years) were evaluated with and without <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics,</b> and again following 2 - 3 weeks of use. Functional stability was evaluated via the Timed-Up-and-Go test and the Fullerton Advanced Balance scale. Computerized posturography was used to assess stability in altered sensory environments (Sensory Organization Test) and to assess overall stability limits (Limits of Stability test). A pressure analysis system assessed gait parameters and pressure distribution patterns. Results. <b>Foot</b> <b>orthotics</b> improved stability on the Timed-Up-and-Go (p= 0. 003) and the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (p< 0. 001) and decreased fall occurrence on the Sensory Organization Test. Times based changes of postural stability occurred for medio-lateral sway velocity and area when only the vestibular system providing accurate information (condition 5) (p= 0. 001, 0. 05, respectively), and under sensory conflict (condition 6) for sway velocity (medio-lateral and antero-posterior), sway path length and sway area (p= 0. 015, 0. 021, 0. 015, 0. 015, respectively). An interaction effect was found for maximum excursion composite score (p= 0. 001) on the Limits of Stability test, as well as a main effect of time for directional control in the ML direction and composite score (p= 0. 024. 0. 043). Contact area increase in the midfoot and rearfoot and peak force decreased in the rearfoot (p= 0. 001, 0. 03, 0. 027, respectively). Conclusions. Results indicate that <b>foot</b> <b>orthotic</b> use can improve functional measures of stability in older adults. It is unclear whether the time-based changes in postural stability are attributable to the orthotics or are a result of learning effects.

After calculating three-dimensional angles, vector coding method was used for assessing coupling. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the normal distribution of data and dependent samples t-test was used to compare means in each sub-phase.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an engineering {{approach to the}} modeling and analysis of custom <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics.</b> Although orthotics are widely used and accepted as devices {{for the prevention of}} and recovery from injuries, the design process continues to be based on empirical means. There have been many clinical studies investigating the various effects that the orthotics can have on the kinematics and kinetics of human locomotion. The results from these studies are not always consistent, primarily due to subject variability and experimental nature of the design. Alternatively, {{a better understanding of the}} therapeutic effects of custom <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics,</b> as well as designing for optimal performance, can be achieved through simulation-based engineering modeling and analysis studies. Such an approach will pave the way to clarify some of the ambiguous findings found in the clinical studies-based literature. Towards this goal, this research presents a methodical process for the replication of the orthotics’ complex three-dimensional geometry and for the construction of finite element analysis models using estimated nonlinear material properties. As part of this research, laser scanning techniques are used to capture the objects’ details and geometry through generation of point cloud surface images by taking multiple scans from all angles. Material testing and Mooney-Rivlin equations were used to construct the hyperelastic nonlinear material properties. Using the mid-stance phase of gait for loading conditions, the ANSYS finite element package was utilized to run analyses on three different load classifications and the corresponding maximum stresses and deflection results were generated. The results indicate that the simulated models can augment and validate the use of empirical tables for designing custom <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics.</b> They can also provide the basis for the optimal design thicknesses of custom <b>foot</b> <b>orthotics</b> based on an end-users’ weight and activities.
