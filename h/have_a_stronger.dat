40|$|A {{family of}} Jordan arcs, such that two arcs are nowhere tangent, defines a {{hypergraph}} whose vertices are the arcs and whose edges are the intersection points. We shall {{say that the}} hypergraph <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> intersection representation and, if each intersection point is interior to at most one arc, we shall say that the hypergraph <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> contact representation. We first characterize those hypergraphs which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> contact representation and deduce some sufficient conditions for a simple planar graph to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> intersection representation. Then, using the Four Color Theorem, we prove that a large class of simple planar graphs <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> intersection representation. 1.

This may explain why the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as {{a person with a}} stronger immune system would potentially <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> overreaction.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{fraction}} of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.|$|E

5|$|The {{skin of a}} giraffe {{is mostly}} gray. Its {{thickness}} allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur {{may serve as a}} chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.|$|E
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E

5|$|Météo-France issued their {{seasonal}} {{forecast of}} cyclone activity for the basin on November 12. MFR predicted a slightly below average to average season, citing {{the effects of}} a very strong El Niño event. Compared to an average of ten moderate tropical storms that usually form in the South-West Indian Ocean, a 70% chance was given to the probability of six to ten named storms forming. A 20% chance was given to the formation of only five cyclones or less, and a 10% was given to an above average level of activity. MRF expected that an above average number of named storms would develop in the central region of the basin (from 60°E to 77°E), and that there would be lower than average activity to the east of 77°E. Activity near normal was expected west of 60°E. MFR also predicted that the motion of cyclones during the season would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> meridional component than normal, having a tendency to track south quickly.|$|E
5|$|Wickliffe {{supported}} the annexation of Texas, {{an issue that}} helped seal Clay's defeat in the 1844 presidential canvass. In 1845, President James K. Polk sent Wickliffe as an envoy on a secret mission to the Republic of Texas. Originally, his purpose was to quash British and French attempts to forestall the U.S. annexation of Texas, but he later joined Commodore Robert F. Stockton in lobbying leaders of the Republic of Texas to order their military forces across the Rio Grande into Mexico. Stockton and Wickliffe believed that if they could provoke a Texan invasion of Mexico, the United States would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> case for annexing Texas. Ultimately, they failed in convincing the Texans to invade, but succeeded in drumming up support for annexation. Both Wickliffe's position on annexation and his willingness to carry out Polk's assignment further distanced him from the Whigs.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{relationship}} with South Korea has been strained due to Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly {{over the issue}} of comfort women. These women were essentially sex slaves, and although there is no exact number on how many women were subjected to this treatment, experts believe it could be in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Between 1910–1945, the Japanese government rebuilt Korean infrastructure, introduced over 800,000 Japanese immigrants onto the peninsula, and carried out a campaign of cultural suppression through efforts to ban the Korean language in schools and force Koreans to adopt Japanese names. With the surrender of Japan and the Axis at the end of WWII in 1945, the Korean Peninsula was once again independent. Despite their historical tensions, in December 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology, taking responsibility for the issue and paying money to the surviving comfort women. Today, South Korea and Japan <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> and more economically-driven relationship. Since the 1990s, the Korean Wave has created a large fanbase in East Asia, but most notably in Japan. Japan is the number one importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and films, but this was only made possible after the South Korean government lifted the 30-year ban on cultural exchange with Japan that had been in place since 1948. Korean pop cultural products' success in the Japanese market is partially explained by the borrowing of Japanese ideas such as the star-marketing system and heavy promotion of new television shows and music. Korean dramas such as Winter Sonata and Coffee Prince, as well as K-pop artists such as BIGBANG and SHINee are extremely popular with Japanese consumers. Most recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the 2017 G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany to discuss the future of their relationship and specifically how to cooperate on finding solutions for North Korean aggression in the region. Both leaders restated their commitment to solving the comfort women dispute, building positive relations in the region, and pressuring China to be more assertive with North Korea as it continues to test nuclear weapons and isolate themselves further form the international community.|$|E
