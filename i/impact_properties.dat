With flax fabric as the {{reinforcement}} and Unsaturated Polyester Resin (UPR) as the matrix, composites of two, {{three and four}} layers were fabricated respectively by the Vacuum Assisted Resin Infusion (VARI) technique. The wetting capability of the composites was tested firstly. The wetting rate illustrated that {{the weight of the}} composites were fast increased when immersed in the water. And the <b>impact</b> <b>property</b> of the composites after saturated in the water for different duration time was tested. The <b>impact</b> <b>property</b> of the four-layer plain fabrics composites was decreased after immersing in water for one-, two-and three-month.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that the enhancement effect of the wet flax fibre may be over-weighed by the degradation effect of the materials. The results indicated that the materials had experienced some forms of physical damage and/or chemical degradation. The weakening of bonding between fibre and matrix and softening of matrix material were also reasons of the decreased composite property...|$|R

50|$|Several metal {{consolidation}} {{techniques are}} used to produce the final product. Metal injection moulding (MIM) otherwise known as powder injection moulding is a well-established and cost-effective method of fabricating small-to-moderate size metal components in large quantities. It {{is derived from the}} method plastic injection moulding, whereby mixing of a metal powder with a polymer binder forms the feedstock, which is then injected into a mould, after which the binder is removed via heat treatment under vacuum before final sintering. With titanium however, the binders used in MIM results in the introduction of carbon into the matrix due to insufficient binder removal prior to sintering and/or deleterious reactions between the decomposing binder, the debinding atmosphere, and the metal phase. This results in titanium parts with mechanical properties unsuited for critical aerospace applications, but suitable for parts where tensile and <b>impact</b> <b>properties</b> are less important. Recently, work has been carried out to reduce the binder to < 8% volume fraction, resulting in the complete removal of the binder from the moulded component during heat treatment.|$|E
