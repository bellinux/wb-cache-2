The comparison between this rapid method (one step) and the tra-ditional procedure including ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by Blue Sepharose CL- 6 B chromatography shows that the new method gives a highest specific activity with a highest yield in a short time. The characterization of the purified GAPDH reveals that the native enzyme is a homotetramer of 150 kDa with an absolute specificity for the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD 1). Western blot analysis using purified monospecific poly-clonal antibodies raised against the purified GAPDH showed a single 36 kDa band corresponding to the enzyme subunit.

Although {{mammalian cell}} opsin migrates slower than rod outer segment opsin on SDS/polyacrylamide gels, presumably due to a different N-glycosylation pattern, their mobilities after deglycosylation are identical.
