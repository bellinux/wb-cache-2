25|$|This method {{can be used}} {{to compute}} the {{radiation}} resistance for any antenna whose far field radiation pattern has been found in terms of a specific antenna current. If ohmic losses in the conductors are neglected, the radiation resistance (considered relative to the <b>feedpoint)</b> is identical to the resistive (real) component of the <b>feedpoint</b> impedance. Unfortunately this exercise tells us nothing about the reactive (imaginary) component of <b>feedpoint</b> impedance, whose calculation is considered below.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the above}} {{expression}} for the radiation {{in the far}} field for a given <b>feedpoint</b> current, we can integrate over all solid angle to obtain the total radiated power.|$|E
25|$|The <b>feedpoint</b> {{impedance}} of a {{dipole antenna}} {{is sensitive to}} its electrical length and <b>feedpoint</b> position. Therefore, a dipole will generally only perform optimally over a rather narrow bandwidth, beyond which its impedance will become a poor match for the transmitter or receiver (and transmission line). The real (resistive) and imaginary (reactive) components of that impedance, {{as a function of}} electrical length, are shown in the accompanying graph. The detailed calculation of these numbers are described below. Note that the value of the reactance is highly dependent on the diameter of the conductors; this plot is for conductors with a diameter of 0.001wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|This large {{reflector}} can {{be avoided}} in the end-fire array. In this case the dipoles are again side by side, but are fed in different phases. Rather than being directive perpendicular to the line connecting their <b>feedpoints,</b> now the directivity is along the line connecting their <b>feedpoints.</b> By using an appropriate spacing and phasing, the radiation can be directed in a single direction along that line, with radiation mainly cancelled in the reverse direction {{as well as most}} other directions.|$|R
5000|$|Using this definition, the {{voltages}} {{present at}} the <b>feedpoints</b> {{of a set of}} coupled antennas can be expressed as the multiplication of the impedance matrix times the vector of currents. Written out as discrete equations, that means: ...|$|R
40|$|The Kakkonda Granite (Quaternary intrusion) {{has some}} <b>feedpoints,</b> which {{contribute}} to the steam production for the Kakkonda geothermal power plant. FMI (Schlumberger’s Fullbore Formation MicroImager) log, resistivity log, gamma ray log, spinner log and temperature logs from NEDO¢s well WD- 1 b have supplied information for determination of rock name and have revealed distributions of fractures. In the Kakkonda Granite, the fracture density analyzed from FMI log is {{far less than the}} other formations and the strike and dip of permeable fractures is partly {{different from that of the}} other formations...|$|R
25|$|However a short {{conductor}} {{fed with}} a RF voltage {{will not have}} a uniform current even along that short range. Rather, a short dipole in real life has a current equal to the <b>feedpoint</b> current at the <b>feedpoint</b> but falling linearly to zero over the length of that short conductor. By placing a capacitive hat, such as a metallic ball, {{at the end of the}} conductor, it is possible for its self capacitance to absorb the current from the conductor and better approximate the constant current assumed for the Hertzian dipole. But again, the Hertzian dipole is meant only as a theoretical construct for antenna analysis.|$|E
25|$|If the dipole is not driven at the center, {{then the}} feed point {{resistance}} will be higher. If the feed point is distance x {{from one end}} of a half wave (λ/2) dipole, the radiation resistance relative to the <b>feedpoint</b> will be given by the following equation.|$|E
25|$|Another solution, {{especially}} for receiving antennas, {{is to use}} common 300Ω twin lead {{in conjunction with a}} folded dipole. The folded dipole is similar to the simple half-wave dipole but with the <b>feedpoint</b> impedance multiplied by 4, thus closely matching that 300Ω impedance. This is the most common household antenna for fixed FM broadcast band tuners, which usually include balanced 300Ω antenna input terminals.|$|E
30|$|We {{determine}} the sum network capacity {{that can be}} achieved with MIMO reconfigurable antennas for different network topologies through channel measurements and electromagnetic ray-tracing simulations conducted in an indoor environment. We consider two prototype electrically reconfigurable antenna architectures in a 2 × 2 MIMO system employing SM: (i) a reconfigurable printed dipole array (RPDA) that makes use of two reconfigurable length dipole antennas, and (ii) a reconfigurable circular patch antenna (RCPA) that makes use of a single variable-radius circular patch antenna with two <b>feedpoints.</b> We show that parameters, like the number of antenna configurations, the spatial orthogonality between the array elements and the level of antenna radiation efficiency, can be used to predict the achievable performance with a particular reconfigurable antenna in an ad hoc network.|$|R
40|$|The {{permeability}} {{structure of}} the Sumikawa geothermal field in northern Japan {{has been the subject}} of an extensive pressure-transient testing investigation since 1986. In this paper, various pertinent data sets are presented and analyzed, including results showing reservoir heterogeneity (i. e. boundary) effects and apparent double porosity behavior. Interference tests between wells SB- 3 and SD- 2 (both of which have <b>feedpoints</b> in dacitic layers in the "marine-volcanic complex " formation) were carried out during 1990. The results have been interpreted to indicate the presence of a moderately high permeability (- 4 darcy-meters) layer with two impermeable boundaries intersecting at a right angle. The 1988 pressure buildup data for well SN- 7 D are also explained by assuming two impermeable boundaries in a high transmissivity reservoir within the deep "granodiorite " formation. Interference tests between wells S- 4 and KY- 1 have suggested that a very permeable north-south channel is present in the "altered andesite " layer. Although the response was successfully interpreted using an "anisotropic line-source model " by Garg et a 1. (1991), a "double porosity channel model " seems to be particularly applicable for explaining both the short-term and long-term behavior observed in this series of tests...|$|R
25|$|The {{impedance}} {{seen at the}} <b>feedpoint</b> of a dipole {{of various}} lengths has been plotted above, {{in terms of the}} real (resistive) component Rdipole and the imaginary (reactive) component jXdipole of that impedance. For the case of an antenna with perfect conductors (no ohmic loss), Rdipole is identical to the radiation resistance, which can more easily be computed from the total power in the far-field radiation pattern for a given applied current as we showed for the short dipole. The calculation of Xdipole is more difficult.|$|E
500|$|The inverted-F antenna is an {{evolution}} of the basic quarter-wave monopole antenna. [...] The wire F-type antenna was invented in the 1940s. [...] In this antenna the feed is connected to an intermediate point {{along the length of}} the antenna instead of to the base. [...] The base is connected to ground. [...] The advantage of doing this is that the input impedance of the antenna is dependent on the distance of the feed point from the grounded end. [...] The portion of the antenna between the <b>feedpoint</b> and the ground plane is essentially behaving as a short-circuit stub. [...] Thus, the designer can match the antenna to the system impedance by setting the position of the feed point (RF systems commonly have a system impedance of 50 Ω whereas a λ/4 monopole has an impedance of 36.5 Ω).|$|E
2500|$|From that, it is {{possible}} to infer the radiation resistance, equal to the resistive (real) part of the <b>feedpoint</b> impedance, neglecting a component due to ohmic losses.

2500|$|Horizontal wire dipole antennas {{are popular}} {{for use on}} the HF shortwave bands, both for {{transmitting}} and shortwave listening. [...] They are usually constructed of two lengths of wire joined by a strain insulator in the center, which is the <b>feedpoint.</b> The ends can be attached to existing buildings, structures, or trees, taking advantage of their heights. If used for transmitting, {{it is essential that}} the ends of the antenna be attached to supports through strain insulators with a sufficiently high flashover voltage, since the antenna's high voltage antinodes occur there. Being a balanced antenna, they are best fed with a balun between the (coax) transmission line and the <b>feedpoint.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{folded dipole}} is a {{half-wave}} dipole {{with an additional}} wire connecting its two ends. If the additional wire has the same diameter and cross-section as the dipole, two nearly identical radiating currents are generated. The resulting far-field emission pattern is nearly {{identical to the one}} for the single-wire dipole described above, but at resonance its <b>feedpoint</b> impedance [...] is four times the radiation resistance of a single-wire dipole.

2500|$|A true {{half-wave}} dipole is {{one half of}} the wavelength λ in length, where λ=c/f in free space. Such a dipole has a <b>feedpoint</b> impedance consisting of 73Ω resistance and +43Ω reactance, thus presenting a slightly inductive reactance. In order to cancel that reactance, and present a pure resistance to the feedline, the element is shortened by the factor k for a net length l of: ...|$|E
2500|$|Using the induced EMF method {{closed form}} {{expressions}} are obtained for both {{components of the}} <b>feedpoint</b> impedance; such results are plotted above. The solution depends on an assumption {{for the form of}} the current distribution along the antenna conductors. For wavelength to element diameter ratios greater than about 60, the current distribution along each antenna element is very well approximated [...] as a sine wave along each conductor: ...|$|E
2500|$|The short dipole, with a <b>feedpoint</b> {{current of}} I0, has an average current over each {{conductor}} of only I0/2. The above field equations for the Hertzian dipole of length δℓ would then predict the actual fields {{for a short}} dipole using that effective current I = I0/2. This {{would result in a}} power measured in the far field of one quarter that given by the above equation for the Poynting vector [...] if we had assumed an element current of I0. Consequently, {{it can be seen that}} the radiation resistance computed for the short dipole is one quarter of that computed above for the Hertzian dipole. But their radiation patterns (and gains) are identical.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the wide television frequency bands, the FM broadcast band (88-108nbsp&MHz) is narrow enough that a dipole antenna can cover it. [...] For fixed use in homes, hi-fi tuners are typically supplied with simple folded dipoles resonant {{near the center of}} that band. [...] The <b>feedpoint</b> impedance of a folded dipole, which is quadruple the impedance of a simple dipole, is a good match for 300Ω twin lead, so that is usually used for the transmission line to the tuner. [...] A common construction is to make the arms of the folded dipole out of twin lead also, shorted at their ends. [...] This flexible antenna can be conveniently taped or nailed to walls, following the contours of mouldings.|$|E

50|$|The actual antenna {{which is}} {{transmitting}} the original wave then also may receive a strong signal {{from its own}} image from the ground. This will induce an additional current in the antenna element, changing the current at the <b>feedpoint</b> for a given <b>feedpoint</b> voltage. Thus the antenna's impedance, given by the ratio of <b>feedpoint</b> voltage to current, is altered due to the antenna's proximity to the ground. This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength {{or two of the}} ground. But as the antenna height is increased, the reduced power of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allows the antenna to approach its asymptotic <b>feedpoint</b> impedance given by theory. At lower heights, the effect on the antenna's impedance is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground, as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna. Changing the antenna's height by a quarter wavelength, then changes the phase of the reflection by 180°, with a completely different effect on the antenna's impedance.|$|E
50|$|All grade {{crossing}} predictors {{rely on the}} changes in the electrical characteristics of the rails that occur as a train approaches {{the point at which the}} predictor is connected to the rails (the <b>feedpoint).</b> A railroad track occupied by a train or other electrical shunt can be viewed as a single-turn inductor shaped like a hairpin.
