500|$|The {{following}} year in 1957, Marchant unexpectedly left the sport, {{much to the}} dismay of the cycling community, which believed that he would continue to more success. He switched to playing Australian rules football because that was what his friends did. He felt that fitting in with his friends was more important, saying [...] "I was a funny bloke.

500|$|Emerson saw a kindred {{spirit in}} Very and defended his sanity. As {{he wrote to}} Margaret Fuller, [...] "Such a mind cannot be lost". Emerson was {{sympathetic}} with Very's plight because he himself had recently been ostracized after his controversial lecture, the [...] "Divinity School Address". He helped Very publish a small volume, Essays and Poems in 1839. The poems collected in this volume were chiefly Shakespearean sonnets. Very also published several poems in the Western Messenger between 1838 and 1840 {{as well as in}} The Dial, the journal of the Transcendentalists. He was disappointed, however, that Emerson, serving as editor of the journal, altered his poems. Very wrote to Emerson in July 1842, [...] "Perhaps they were all improvements but <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> my own lines. I do not know but I ought to submit to such changes as done by the rightful authority of an Editor but I felt a little sad at the aspect of the piece." [...] He was never widely read, and was largely forgotten {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century, but in the 1830s and 1840s the Transcendentalists, including Emerson, as well as William Cullen Bryant, praised his work.|$|E

Dayan wrote in his autobiography: [...] "I reflected with considerable misgivings on my future as a cripple without a skill, trade, or profession to provide for my family." [...] He added that he was [...] "ready to make any effort and stand any suffering, if only I could get rid of my black eyepatch. The attention it drew was intolerable to me. <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> to shut myself up at home, doing anything, rather than encounter the reactions of people wherever I went." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in this game, Maradona {{scored a}} second goal, voted in 2002 {{as the best}} goal in World Cup history, before English striker Gary Lineker pulled one back, but England could not score again and lost 2–1. Despite the skill of his second goal, Maradona wrote in his {{autobiography}} that, [...] "I sometimes think <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> the one with my hand... It was a bit like stealing the wallet of the English." [...] He also wrote, {{in reference to the}} Falklands conflict, that [...] "it was as if we had beaten a country, not just a football team... Although we had said before the game that football {{had nothing to do with}} the Malvinas war, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was revenge." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Qur'an speaks {{extensively}} about the Children of Israel (Banû Isrâ'îl) and {{recognizes that the}} Jews (al-Yahûd) are, according to lineage, descendants of Prophet Abraham through his son Isaac and grandson Jacob. They were chosen by Allah for a mission: [...] "And We chose them, purposely, above (all) creatures." [...] Allah raised among them many Prophets and bestowed upon them what He had not bestowed upon many others: [...] "And (remember) when Musa said unto his people: O my people ! Remember Allah's favor unto you, how He placed among you Prophets, and He made you Kings, and gave you that (which) He gave not to any (other) of (His) creatures." [...] He, also, exalted them over other nations {{of the earth and}} granted them many favors: [...] "O Children of Israel!

2500|$|Nobilo {{was born}} in Auckland, of Croatian and Italian descent, and is the great {{grandson}} of an Italian pirate. At birth, his right leg was shorter than his left, which has caused him some back problems throughout his life. He was educated at St Peter's College in Auckland where he was persuaded to play golf by schoolmates (Chris Treen and Mark Lewis). Nobilo preferred to play Rugby League for Glenora over Rugby Union for St Peter's, which was [...] "a bone of contention" [...] with the school. [...] "I got a bit of grief because <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> league over rugby then and I was {{a bit more of}} a rebel. I used to catch the train to and from school and it took about 30–40 minutes. My mum said it drove her crazy because I missed it often and my parents were living in Glen Eden and I would end up in Henderson and they'd have to come and collect me".|$|E
2500|$|Although 13 of North Vietnam's flying aces {{attained}} {{their status}} while flying the MiG-21 (cf. {{three in the}} MiG-17) many North Vietnamese pilots preferred the MiG-17 because the high wing loading of the MiG-21 made it relatively less maneuverable and the lighter framed canopy of the MiG-17 gave better visibility. However, {{this is not the}} impression perceived by British author Roger Boniface when he interviewed Pham Ngoc Lan and ace Nguyễn Nhật Chiêu (who scored victories flying both MiG-17 and MiG-21). Pham Ngoc Lan told Boniface that [...] "The MiG-21 was much faster, and it had two ATOLL missiles which were very accurate and reliable when fired between 1,000 and 1,200 yards." [...] And Chiêu asserted that [...] "...for me personally <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> the MiG-21 because it was superior in all specifications in climb, speed and armament. The ATOLL missile was very accurate and I scored four kills with the ATOLL.... In general combat conditions I was always confident of a kill over a F-4 Phantom when flying a MiG-21." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1927, a 26 {{years old}} Bourguiba {{returned}} to Tunisia, {{not only with}} a girlfriend and his son Habib Jr. but also a deep knowledge of French politics during the Third Republic. While in France, he had been influenced by liberal values of the social-radical secular country, shared earlier by his brother Mohamed. Following his come back in Tunisia, he married Mathilde, while Mahmoud Laribi was his best man and settled in the Capital City. At the time, he {{was not interested in}} politics but in his professional career, every debuting lawyer having to do a three-year traineeship under the supervision of another experienced lawyer. For a whole year, from October 1927 to October 1928, Bourguiba concatenated traineeship: First he was hired by a certain Mr. Cirier, who dismissed him after six weeks. Bourguiba testified in these words: [...] "It was hard to understand. I had not yet started my political action. He may sensed risks. He offered to compensate me. But <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> to leave without further ado. I had to look for another patronage. We were late November. Everything was settled; trainees were all installed. Nothing was offered to me".|$|E
