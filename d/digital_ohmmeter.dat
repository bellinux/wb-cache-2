40|$|This {{study is}} aimed {{to search the}} angle {{optimization}} of scraping/doctor knife in the drum dryers. Electrical measurements were made via a <b>digital</b> <b>ohmmeter</b> to calculate the real contact area between the drum and doctor knife. It was seen that the electrical resistance was decreased with the increment of drum’s load. It’s also seen that, the contact resistance between the couple was increased with the increment of temperature. This is an experimental practice; AISI 4140 for a drum material, HSS for a doctor knife were used. So as to increase the hardness and to reduce the resistance, the drum was coated with the harder chromium, {{and then it was}} ground for the enhancement of the surface quality...|$|E
50|$|Isolation {{resistance}} measurements may {{be achieved}} using a high input impedance <b>ohmmeter,</b> <b>digital</b> multimeter (DMM) or current-limited Hipot test instrument. The selected equipment should not overstress sensitive electronic components comprising the subsystem. The test limits should also consider semiconductor components within the subsystem {{that may be}} activated by the potentials imposed by each type of test instrumentation. A minimum acceptable resistance value is usually specified (typically in the megohm (MΩ) range per circuit tested). Multiple circuits having a common return may be tested simultaneously, provided the minimum allowable resistance value {{is based on the}} number of circuits in parallel.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the quality}} control the {{resistance}} of newly produced LHC main bus bar splices is now routinely measured at room temperature (RT) in order to conclude on the electrical continuity {{of the bus bar}} stabiliser across the splice under operating conditions. In this note we present splice resistance measurements that have been performed at RT and in liquid nitrogen (LN) in the CERN Cryolab with “ideal” splices (represented by continuous dipole and quadrupole bus bars), and with dipole and quadrupole splices with different defects, which cause an additional RT splice resistance of up to 60 µΩ. The RT resistance (RRT) results obtained with the Cryolab set-up are compared to the calculated resistance values and with the so-called R- 8 and R- 16 resistance results, as they are measured in the LHC tunnel with a <b>Digital</b> Low Resistance <b>Ohmmeter</b> with a voltage tap distance of 8 cm or 16 cm. The RT to LN resistance ratio has been determined for all splices in order to study the influence of the resistance of the splice contact surfaces on the overall splice resistance...|$|R
