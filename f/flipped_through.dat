500|$|Piano Concerto No. 2 was {{directed}} by Butoy with art director Michael Humphries. It originated in the 1930s when Walt Disney wished to adapt a collection of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales into an animated film. The artists completed a series of preliminary designs based on the stories, including ones for The Steadfast Tin Soldier from 1938 by Bianca Majolie that were stored in the studio's animation research library and used for a 1991 Disney book that retold the story accompanied with the storyboard sketches. When Disney suggested using the Shostakovich piece, Butoy <b>flipped</b> <b>through</b> the book and found the story's structure fit to the music. When Humphries saw the sketches he designed the segment with works by Caravaggio and Rembrandt in mind to give the segment a [...] "timeless" [...] feel, while keeping the colors [...] "as romantic as possible" [...] during the scenes when the soldier and ballerina are first getting acquainted. Live action footage of a real ballerina {{was used as a}} guide for the toy ballerina's movements. Butoy found the Jack-in-a-box a difficult character to design and animate with its spring base and how he moved with the box. His appearance went through numerous changes, partly {{due to the lack of}} reference material available to the team.|$|E

[...] As Smith <b>flipped</b> <b>through</b> the pages, a crowd of Marines formed around him, each of them urging him to look up their own names, and the names of their fathers, mothers, siblings, and girlfriends. [...] "While we were engaged in this incongruous diversion," [...] Smith wrote in his February 21, 1979 column, [...] "a photographer happened by and was curious. [...] What was going on here? [...] He was sick of death, shock and horror and was looking for something upbeat. [...] Human interest. [...] A sign that life would go on." [...] The photographer snapped several photos, one of which was distributed by the Associated Press and appeared in newspapers a few days later.|$|E
