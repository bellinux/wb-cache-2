5|$|After {{signing with}} Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band. The {{remaining}} members then {{spent the next}} few months looking for another drummer capable of playing double-time beats at a rapid pace. During this period, the band <b>Good</b> <b>Riddance</b> found their new drummer, and sent Rise Against the audition tape of their number two choice, Brandon Barnes. A mutual friend gave Barnes' phone number to Principe, and after listening to Transistor Revolt, Barnes accepted the band's invitation.|$|E

[...] Relations between Taiwan and the Solomon Islands are none of this yesterday man’s business. Taipei should tell Mr Downer to butt out." ...|$|E

It was released by Fat Wreck Chords on July 13, 2004, and features <b>Good</b> <b>Riddance's</b> Russ Rankin, Bane's Aaron Dalbec, and renowned drummer and producer, Bill Stevenson, of Black Flag and Descendents fame.

2500|$|In November 2000, {{the band}} entered {{the studio to}} start {{recording}} their third full-length release, The Price of Progression. Chris Byrnes came in December to add some second guitar parts as Nate was performing on bass and guitar, {{as well as the}} usual backing vocals. Chris Oliver had played bass on the initial takes as a favor to Nate, and continued to play for a while after. The band were also joined on vocals for guest spots by Russ Rankin of <b>Good</b> <b>Riddance</b> and Andy West of Kill Your Idols. The record was finally released in April, 2001. Also, in February 2001, Indecision Records re-released their split 7" [...] with Death By Stereo on CD as part of their Split Series compilation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{band that}} would {{ultimately}} become Fenix TX formed in late 1995 in Houston, Texas {{under the name}} Riverfenix by guitarists Will Salazar and Damon DeLaPaz (also the drummer for 30 Foot Fall at the time), and vocalist Carl Lockstedt. However, Carl's tenure was short-lived after recruiting bassist Adam Lewis and drummer Donnie Reyes. At this point, Salazar was forced to take over vocal duties. With this solidified line-up, the four piece immediately set to work by playing extensively on the Texas pop punk scene alongside such renowned bands as 30 Foot Fall, <b>Good</b> <b>Riddance</b> and Goldfinger. Popular venues included local clubs such as Fitzgerald's (whose head of security earned an homage in the Riverfenix song [...] "Skinhead Jessie"). In 1996, the band released their debut EP G.B.O.H. under the Houston-based record label Fuzzgun Records, which they then followed by playing the Mullets Across America Tour with Home Grown, Cousin Oliver and The Hippos. During this time the band would also concentrate on distributing copies of their demos to other record labels. Mojo Records showed interest in the band, however, due to procrastination and indecision the process never came to fruition. However, two Mojo interns Richard and Stefanie Reines, were {{on the brink of}} starting their own label, Drive-Thru Records, and agreed to sign Riverfenix as their first band.|$|E

5000|$|According to singer Russ Rankin, {{the idea}} to compile an album of <b>Good</b> <b>Riddance's</b> rare tracks came from their label, Fat Wreck Chords: [...] "they sort of {{thought that it would}} be a cool idea, and they knew that we had done all these other {{projects}} through the years and we sort of tossed it around—Chuck Platt, Luke Pabich and myself—and eventually decided that it might be kind of cool for our fans and, since we've been done for a few years and some of these songs that were not widely released, or some that were never released at all—if they saw the light of day, we thought it might be kind of cool." [...] Rankin noted that in choosing the material for Capricorn One, tracks that were still in print through other record labels were intentionally omitted: ...|$|R
