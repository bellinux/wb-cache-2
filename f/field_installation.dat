40|$|The 5300. 4 {{series of}} NASA Handbooks for Reliability and Quality Assurance Programs have {{provisions}} {{for the establishment}} and utilization of a documented metrology system to control measurement processes and to provide objective evidence of quality conformance. The intent of these provisions is to assure consistency and conformance to specifications and tolerances of equipment, systems, materials, and processes procured and/or used by NASA, its international partners, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. This Measurement Assurance Program (MAP) guideline has the specific objectives to: (1) ensure the quality of measurements made within NASA programs; (2) establish realistic measurement process uncertainties; (3) maintain continuous control over the measurement processes; and (4) ensure measurement compatibility among NASA facilities. The publication addresses MAP methods as applied within and among NASA installations {{and serves as a}} guide to: control measurement processes at the local level (one facility); conduct measurement assurance programs in which a number of <b>field</b> <b>installations</b> are joint participants; and conduct measurement integrity (round robin) experiments in which a number of <b>field</b> <b>installations</b> participate to assess the overall quality of particular measurement processes at a point in time...|$|R

He was assigned as Assistant A-3 to the Proving Ground of the Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command at Eglin Field, Florida, now Eglin Air Force Base. The Duke <b>Field</b> <b>installation</b> is about 12 mi north of the Eglin AFB East Gate on State Road 85.|$|E
50|$|A {{certification}} listing is {{a document}} used to guide installations of certified products. After a <b>field</b> <b>installation</b> is completed, it {{is compared to}} the list {{to make sure that}} it complies with a regulation (e.g., a building code). Often, products or items are required—by law, void of warranty, or other means—to be installed or used in accordance with a subject-related certification listing if those products or items are subject to product certification and must be used in a specific manner in order to be safe for use.|$|E
50|$|Fire {{protection}} products used in {{the construction}} of buildings, ships and offshore facilities are required to conform with the certification listings or approvals. The <b>field</b> <b>installation</b> will comply with code requirements if it is configured within the maximum and minimum tolerances in the listings and approvals. For example, if a drywall assembly has a listing of a 2 hour fire-resistance rating, and all the provisions of the listing were kept in the field, including materials, spacing, workmanship, etc., the 2 hour wall required by the building's designer is likely to withstand a 2 hour fire.|$|E

It was also found that results of meter testing in a four inch diameter test section can be extended to larger diameter pipes...|$|R
50|$|Another {{factor in}} the design of a precast shape {{has to do with the}} {{schedule}} and sequencing of the actual <b>field</b> <b>installation.</b> The shape design must take into account job accessibility, what other lining components are already in place when the shapes are installed, and how the shape can be handled physically on the job site. Weight and lifting limitations must be considered and planned for, as well as the type of access available into the furnace or vessel. If necessary, lifting lugs or other fixtures can sometimes be incorporated into the shape design.|$|E

50|$|A {{certification}} listing is {{a document}} used to guide installations of certified products, against which a <b>field</b> <b>installation</b> {{is compared to}} make sure that it complies with a regulation (e.g., a building code). Typically, products or items are required to be installed or used in accordance with a subject-related certification listing if those products or items are subject to product certification and must be used in a specific manner in order to be safe for use. Certification listings are issued by organisations that are usually nationally accredited for doing both testing and product certification work, in accordance with nationally accredited standards.|$|E
