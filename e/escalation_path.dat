30|$|To {{improve on}} {{scalability}} of the centralised approaches, researchers investigated decentralised approaches such as hierarchical and distributed frameworks. In [44], the authors proposed hierarchical controllers and divided the infrastructure into multiple clusters, where each cluster is managed {{by a local}} controller. The hierarchical controllers run at different intervals, with a local cluster controller running more frequently than a global controller. In [36], the authors chose to slice the hierarchy along {{the operations of the}} controllers. A Level 1 controller handles VM placement and load balancing, and runs every 30 minutes. A Level 2 controller handles the resources of a node, and runs every few minutes. The challenges with hierarchical approaches include choosing the run time interval of the global controller and the lack of an <b>escalation</b> <b>path</b> between the local and global controllers. Therefore in a sudden burst scenario, a workload may exhibit SLA violations before the global level controller is engaged. An additional challenge is limiting the size of each cluster so it does not become too large for the controller to manage, thus encountering the same challenge as centralised approaches.|$|E

In the United States, {{there are hundreds of}} thousands of shipments daily through a complicated supply chain with multiple points of vulnerability. Because of their nature, many hazmat shipments could become dangerous and ready-made weapons {{in the hands of a}} terrorist. And because of the large number of shipments, the exposure to these vulnerabilities is very broad. Most hazmat shipments in the United States are by motor carriers; however hazardous materials are also shipped by rail and barge. Vulnerable points in the supply chain include manufacturing facilities, shippers, hazmat carriers, and receiving facilities. A FMCSA study identified three terrorist attack profiles for hazmat shipments. 2 Theft is undertaken by means of stealth, deception, or force. Stealth and deception are deterred by detection, while force assumes detection and operates within parameters defined by the time to communicate and mount an interdiction. Stealth, deception, and force also define an <b>escalation</b> <b>path</b> for operational planning purposes...|$|E
40|$|Health Relationship Management Services (HRMS) {{is a new}} {{paradigm}} comprised of the 5 Rs which define a comprehensive patient healthcare system in the digital health age. This service uses a health monitoring system with sensors and a patient application portal that can Read data and securely {{send it to the}} cloud with amended data from Electronic Health Records (EHR). The read data is Restructured by analytics software for evaluation and personalization in an aggregated form represented by an individualized health scoring and demographic grading system. The Results are previously restructured data that must become actionable to lead to an <b>escalation</b> <b>path</b> to the Communication Center for a Response. On a periodic basis, Repeat of the cycle will improve patient health outcomes through an interconnected link of services for optimal continuous health relationship management. Providers can leverage the HRMS platform to generate data-driven approaches fostering a positive and lasting impact on their patient's health. Payers can track data to ensure a more healthy patient population and review meaningful outcomes...|$|E
