500|$|There are {{different}} ways in which the raw materials are charged into the blast furnace. Some blast furnaces use a [...] "double bell" [...] system where two [...] "bells" [...] are used to control the entry of raw material into the blast furnace. The purpose of the two bells is to minimize the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace. First, the raw materials are emptied into the upper or small bell which then opens to empty the charge into the large bell. The small bell then closes, to seal the blast furnace, while the large bell rotates to provide specific distribution of materials before dispensing the charge into the blast furnace. A more recent design is to use a [...] "bell-less" [...] system. These systems use multiple hoppers to contain each raw material, which is then discharged into the blast furnace through valves. These valves are more accurate at controlling how much of each constituent is added, as compared to the skip or conveyor system, thereby increasing the efficiency of the furnace. Some of these bell-less systems also implement a <b>discharge</b> <b>chute</b> in the throat of the furnace (as with the Paul Wurth top) in order to precisely control where the charge is placed.|$|E
50|$|A {{centrifugal}} discharge elevator may be vertical or inclined. Vertical elevators depend {{entirely on}} the action of centrifugal force to get the material into the <b>discharge</b> <b>chute</b> and must be run at speeds relatively high. Inclined elevators with buckets spaced apart or set close together may have the <b>discharge</b> <b>chute</b> set partly under the head pulley. Since they don't depend {{entirely on the}} centrifugal force to put the material into the chute, the speed may be relatively lower.|$|E
50|$|The waste {{materials}} usually travel through a <b>discharge</b> <b>chute</b> for disposal {{depending on the}} design of the gyratory screener. There will be at least one outlet for every deck of gyratory screener.|$|E
50|$|Hopper wagons {{can only}} be {{unloaded}} by gravity with no external assistance and are therefore also classed as self-discharging wagons. The majority may be filled, when at rail or road level, by high-level <b>discharge</b> <b>chutes</b> (whose ends are more than 70 cm above {{the top of the}} rails) or conveyor belts. Because a controlled amount of the load can be discharged at any place the wagons may be sent anywhere and are even used individually. Railway companies also use hoppers as departmental wagons in maintenance of way trains for ballasting the track.|$|R
50|$|Saddle-bottomed wagons are large-volume hoppers are {{exclusively}} unloaded {{by gravity}} {{and are therefore}} classed as self-discharging hoppers. Unlike normal hopper wagons, however, their discharge cannot be controlled and the entire load must be dropped. To unload the flaps on the side swing out allowing the load to empty. This is aided by the floor which slopes downwards on both sides like a gable roof. The <b>discharging</b> <b>chutes</b> on either side are relatively high up. These wagons are frequently seen in unit trains for transporting bulk goods such as coal or mineral ore from mines or ports to steelworks or power stations.|$|R

50|$|Snow blowers can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} two classes: single-stage and two-stage. On a single-stage snow blower, the auger (the paddle mechanism visible from the front) pulls snow into the machine and directs it out of a <b>discharge</b> <b>chute.</b> The auger contacts the ground, making single-stage snow blowers unsuitable for use on unpaved surfaces. On a two-stage snow blower, the auger pulls snow into the machine and feeds it into a high-speed impeller, which in turn directs it out of a <b>discharge</b> <b>chute.</b> Two-stage snow blowers can generally handle deeper snow depths than single-stage ones, and because their augers don't touch the ground, they can be used on unpaved surfaces.|$|E

50|$|A {{reversing}} {{drum mixer}} (also commonly called a non-tilting mixer) {{is a type}} of concrete mixer that produces concrete in single batches. The entire drum rotates around its axis as materials are loaded through a charge chute {{at one end of the}} drum and exit through a <b>discharge</b> <b>chute</b> at the opposite end of the drum.|$|E
5000|$|Industrial sized {{reversing}} drum mixers {{can have}} a capacity of 9 m³ and can produce a mid quality concrete mix {{in as little as}} 40 seconds. Reversing drum mixers provide for efficient mixing and leave very little build up within the mixer. [...] Wear is reduced as the drum rests on rubber or polyurethane wheels and there is no steel on steel contact. There is no direct contact between the stationary charge and <b>discharge</b> <b>chutes</b> and the rotating drum. The flexible tires, absorb vibration and make for low maintenance and a quiet operation. The efficient mixing within the concrete, results in a reduction in wear of the drum liners. The reversing drum mixers are known for the extremely low maintenance and operating costs, yet a good mixing effect relative to other drum mixers.|$|R

40|$|A rice destoner was {{developed}} locally for separating stone from milled rice. The major {{components of the}} machine includes: reciprocating screen and blower as well as hopper. The separation of stone is achieved by the vertical and horizontal oscillation of the reciprocating screen which as result of the forced air flow (produced by the blower) through the machine causes the rice kernels to float on a cushion of air just above the screen. This, then allows the reciprocating screen to convey the more dense stones up the screen to a <b>discharge</b> <b>chutes,</b> thereby ensuring {{the separation of the}} stones from the rice kernel. The machine was designed to be powered by a 2 hp electric motor. It was tested for its efficiencies in terms of stone and rice separation. The tray loss and impurity level after separation were also measured. The results showed that the machine has 69. 0 % and 87. 7 % stone and rice separation efficiency respectively.

Further applications of XDEM include thermal conversion of biomass on a backward and forward acting grate. Heat transfer in a packed bed reactor was also investigated for hot air streaming upward through the packed bed to heat the particles, which dependent on position and size experience different heat transfer rates.

40|$|The {{ironmaking}} {{process in}} blast furnace is complicated, and coupled with multiphase flow, chemical reaction and heat transfer, which make {{it one of}} the most complicated systems in industry. The process of ironmaking is very difficult to control but only few approaches are available, for example, improve the quality of the raw material, optimize burden distribution, and maximize coal combustion. The burden distribution significantly affects the blast furnace operation efficiency. The void fraction, gas flow distribution and burden descending behaviour depend on the burden distribution. Thus, understanding blast furnace burden distribution is very important for blast furnace operation. In most previous numerical studies, particle shape is not considered. Hence, in the first component, a discrete element method (DEM) based framework is established, aiming to bridge particle shape gap between simulation and practice. Spherical particle surface properties are adjusted by angle of repose to make spheres behave as non-spherical particles in practice. Then experimental results are used to validate DEM in the present study, showing a good agreement. Then variables related to burden distribution are investigated, such as particle surface properties, <b>chute</b> angles and <b>discharge</b> rate. <b>Chute</b> wear prediction has always been a problem for blast furnace schedule maintenance. In the second part, chute flow is analyzed in great details, and the microscopic information is generated to get better understanding of chute flow and thus used to predict the wear issue for rotating chute. Then size segregation phenomenon is also studied for both chute flow and in burden profiles. And finally, a practice case is simulated to further prove the capability of present DEM model, indicating DEM is capable to use for practice application. The purpose of taking control of burden distribution is taking control of the gas distribution in blast furnace thus can obtain smooth operation. In the third part, practice cases are simulated and analyzed. A thin sector frame is introduced to reduce total particle number in the system thus multi-layer burden profiles are studied, showing burden profile keeping changing in the charging process. Gas flow is simulated by coupling DEM with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and its distribution for different burden profiles are analyzed qualitatively. Hopper is the essential feeding mechanic for blast furnace, thus fundamental study is required in this area. In the fourth part, ellipsoidal particles are simulated in a rectangular hopper to study hopper flow phenomenon. The focus is particle shape effect on wall stress, meanwhile flow patterns and discharge rate have also been studied. The results indicate that particle shape changes the internal properties thus bulk material properties hence make impact on wall stress. The particles discharged from hopper can naturally form a pile, and the particle shape effect on angle of repose and force distributions are investigated. Furthermore, varies factors’ effects on stress dip phenomenon have been investigated...|$|R

40|$|Leak {{testing is}} being {{performed}} in 105 KW {{to verify the}} performance of the isolation barriers which have been recently installed. When an 11 inch differential head is established between the main basin and the <b>discharge</b> <b>chute,</b> a leak-rate of approximately 30 - 35 gpm is observed. The leak-rate would be achieved by a 1. 65 `` - 2 `` diameter hole (or equivalent). Analyses suggest that the flow is turbulent/laminar transitional (dominantly turbulent), which would be indicative of a single point leak, typical of a pipe or large opening. However, local vortex rotation is observed in the entry to the West transfer chute while no observable motion was seen in the East transfer chute: this may be an indication of seal leakage in the East isolation barrier. The potential for leakage had been considered during the design and field work planning stages. Review of potential leak detection technologies had been made; at the planning stage it was determined that location specific leak detection could be established relatively quickly, applying existing K Basins technology (dye or ultrasonics). The decision was made not to pre-stage leak detection since the equipment development is highly dependent on the nature and location of the leak, and the characteristics of the leak rate provides data which guides leak characterization technology. The expense could be deferred and potentially avoided without risk to critical path activity. Consistent with the above, a systematic recovery plan has been developed utilizing phased activities to provide for management discipline combined with timely diagnosis and correction. Because this activity is not critical path at this time, activities will be coordinated with other plant activity to optimize overall plant work. Particular care will be exercised in assuring that information gained from this recovery can be utilized in the more critical work in 105 KE...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of particulate material is very complex {{in comparison to}} solids, fluids and gases. It depends strongly on many properties such as particle size distribution, porosity, moisture content, overall stress and aeration. Most calculation theories are based on continuous mechanics and use widely accepted assumptions e. g. constant material properties and behaviour or plane stress conditions which lead to a steady state approach. Usually these theories incorporate empirically based factors which are usually sufficient when describing either thin layered or dispersed particulate flows. The steady state approach does not consider the real time dependant discrete behaviour of the particulate media or smaller particulate volume, {{which can lead to}} incorrect modelling of thick layered denser flows. The true physical behaviour of a particulate system is based on very many and very small interactions of the discrete particles. Each particle shows time dependent behaviour in accordance with all its neighbouring particles which subsequently affects the macroscopic behaviour of the system. In the field of bulk material handling, historically, the macroscopic behaviour is investigated. Recently, the microscopic effect of either small particulate volumes or single particle interactions can be studied by the help of new measurement equipment such as Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT), or through discrete element model (DEM) simulations. These investigations show a strong non-uniform behaviour of the particles for different problems. Continuum theories have also been developed to describe and predict dynamic macroscopic bulk material behaviour. The paper compares the real world behaviour of particulate materials and the classical calculation theory by the use of three examples: the pneumatic conveying of fine powders observed by ECT, the dynamic continuum modelling of particulates from a silo <b>discharge</b> <b>chute</b> and the discharge of granular material in a bucket elevators observed in experiment and simulated by DEM. The comparison of these very different problems with very different bulk material highlights the real time dependent behaviour of the particles and shows clearly the deficiencies in steady state modelling for dense layered flow regimes...|$|E
