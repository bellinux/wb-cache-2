Photograph shows area of the tannery known as the Lime Yard. The raw hides would spend 48 hours in the drums in the Lime Yard. These drums were approximately 80 years old and were built at the tannery. The hides {{have been removed from}} the drums and are being prepared to go into a <b>fleshing</b> <b>machine</b> which was a large rotating cylinder, about 25 metres long with spiral blades. These blades flayed the loose flesh and fat off the hides. The workers are trimming the loose flesh of the hides. The tannery specialised in making sole leather for shoes and boots supplying many Australian manufacturers including RM Williams when he was hand making boots himself [...] .

50|$|Afterwards, more {{complicated}} machinery, such as <b>fleshing</b> <b>machines,</b> were first built in Tabriz. The {{use of these}} machines continued until the production of more advanced mechanical and electrical machines. The leather industry in Tabriz started {{to use one of}} the most advanced machines built in Iran. Used for splitting it was produced by Reza Pourbagheri, of the Techno Machine Company, which was first located in Tehran. Later the company, Hydro Charm emerged and produced other leather processing machines.|$|R

5000|$|Self-described [...] "transgenic artist" [...] Eduardo Kac uses {{biotechnology}} {{and genetics}} to create works that both utilise and critique scientific techniques. In {{one of his}} works, Alba, Kac collaborated with a French laboratory to procure a green-fluorescent rabbit: a rabbit implanted with a green fluorescent protein gene from a type of jellyfish {{in order for the}} rabbit to fluoresce green under ultraviolet light. The members of the Critical Art Ensemble have written books and staged multimedia performance interventions around this issue, including The <b>Flesh</b> <b>Machine</b> (focusing on in vitro fertilisation, surveillance of the body, and liberal eugenics) and Cult of the New Eve(In order to analyze how in their words [...] "Science is the institution of authority regarding the production of knowledge, and tends to replace this particular social function of conventional Christianity in the west) ...|$|R
50|$|On October 28 2014 Lanois, {{released}} an album, entitled <b>Flesh</b> and <b>Machine</b> on ANTI- Records, based on Brian Eno's Ambient albums. The fully instrumental album consists primarily of original atmospheric and process-based sounds, blending pedal steel guitar {{and a variety}} of digital and analog sound processing devices. He was assisted by the drummer Brian Blade. In 2016, he released the album Goodbye to Language with Rocco DeLuca.|$|R
50|$|The {{war against}} {{humanity}} has begun. Only now {{things will be}} different. Victor Leben, once Frankenstein, has not only seen the future—he’s ready to populate it. Using stem cells, “organic” silicon circuitry, and nanotechnology, he will engender a race of superhumans—the perfect melding of <b>flesh</b> and <b>machine.</b> With a powerful, enigmatic backer eager to see his dream come to fruition and a secret location where the enemies of progress can’t find him, Victor is certain that this time, nothing {{and no one can}} stop him.|$|R
50|$|What {{began as}} a {{conflict}} over the transfer of consciousness from <b>flesh</b> to <b>machines</b> escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds. The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fueled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other.|$|R
40|$|Inspired by posthuman feminist theory, {{this paper}} explores young people’s {{entanglement}} with the bio-technological landscape of image creation and exchange in young networked peer cultures. We {{suggest that we}} are seeing new formations of sexual objectification when the more-than-human is foregrounded and the blurry ontological divide between human (<b>flesh)</b> and <b>machine</b> (digital) are enlivened through queer and feminist Materialist analyses. Drawing upon multimodal qualitative data generated with teen boys and girls living in urban inner London and semi-rural Wales (UK) we map how the digital affordances of Facebook ‘tagging’ can operate as a form of coercive ‘phallic touch’ in ways that shore up and transgress normative territories of dis/embodied gender, sexuality and age. We conclude by arguing that we need creative approaches that can open up spaces for a posthuman accounting of the material intra-actions through which phallic power relations part-icipate in predictable and unpredictable ways...|$|R
30|$|His {{standpoint}} {{allows him}} {{to take full advantage}} of what, in design terms, has been defined as the most sophisticated machine, that is, the biological body; it also grants him the possibility to expand the field of his enquiry. Since 2005, Warwick is involved in the development of biological AI, defined as “a form of AI realised by growing biological neurons” [72]. In his practice of merging the <b>flesh</b> and the <b>machine</b> through embodied narratives, in his scientific approach which empirically dismisses the separation of biology and technology in an evolutionary perception of species, I see the feminist potentials of his vision.|$|R
40|$|This article {{proceeds}} to investigate Antarctica as a preparatory zone for the Cold War and closed-world techno-power to come. Particularly, the essay steers {{in the direction}} of incorporations between the animate and the inanimate: <b>flesh,</b> ice, <b>machine,</b> combining into a new, cyborgic entity that emerges in the pre-Cold War Antarctic. The material under consideration includes Heroic Age exploration narratives and science fiction (SF) texts published prior to the Cold War, but rather than anachronistic, the point is to establish continuity between imperial, geopolitical and technological strategies that absorb white space—an ‘emptiness’ as promise of colonization—into its sphere of operations. The thrust of the argument centres on the formation of a ‘figure of steel’—the ‘Stahlgestalt’ —that develops in and against a space of erasure also experienced, paradoxically, as a process of emollition, or depletion: ice-cold, unyielding territoriality prompts a softening of the (male) body, whose movement and mind turn sluggish, slow. The modes of polar being as proto-cyborgic, then, arise in response to a corporeal inteneration in what figures, across expedition and SF texts, as a dream-space associated with ‘beyonds’: infinite absence, immeasurable time, both past and future, {{the far side of the}} ‘human’, shaping into a ‘fortified totality’...|$|R
5000|$|The story {{grew out}} of a {{challenge}} from the illustrator Lane Smith, who suggested Saunders [...] "write a story in which all the characters were abstract shapes". Saunders wrote [...] "Once there was a country that was too small for all its inhabitants to fit inside at once" [...] and the story developed from that point. The abstract shapes became what Saunders regarded as [...] "Conglomerates, composed of <b>flesh</b> and <b>machine</b> parts and vegetative portions" [...] divided into two groups, one of which, led by Phil, trying to eradicate the other. In his essay [...] "Why I wrote Phil", Saunders said the story became about [...] "the human tendency to continuously divide the world into dualities, and, soon after, cast one's lot in with one side of the duality and begin energetically trying to eliminate the other". Saunders initially wanted it to be a children's book before it [...] "became about genocide". He worked on the story for about six years, from 1999 to 2005, [...] "on and off" [...] as a side project, with the book reaching about 300 pages at one point. Saunders reduced the length of the story by removing several scenes which he said [...] "had to go, because they, {{in the context of the}} book, slowed things down, made a story that I hoped would feel catastrophic and a little scary, feel leisurely." ...|$|R
5000|$|While imprisoned on Alisbar, Raza Longknife (his {{last name}} is an English {{translation}} of his true last name) met and formed {{the band of}} smugglers and space pirates known as the Starjammers; with Corsair, Hepzibah, and Ch'od, and associated himself with the group. He is a cyborg, being partly living <b>flesh</b> and partly <b>machine.</b> Because Raza speaks an archaic dialect of his native language, his words are translated into an equally archaic form of English, which can be both an annoyance {{and a source of}} amusement to his allies. Raza was married, though his wife is now deceased, and he has a son named Rion. [...] "His initial grudge against the Shi'ar came about when their former emperor, D'Ken, slaughtered Raza's race of people, but Vulcan became the focus of Raza’s rage after he murdered Raza’s friend Corsair." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Aiming at obtaining lantern shape litchi <b>flesh,</b> a pitting <b>machine</b> was devised and made. Cutter shaft {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} part of the machine and its reciprocating motion cause impact load on the machine. Unilateral load on the surface of the groove result in excessive wear of the cutter shaft. In view of the above problem, dynamic characteristics and the optimum design model of the cutter shaft are established. Used nonlinear optimization toolbox of MATLAB, the best structure parameters of the cutter shaft were calculated. The results are: (1) minimum mass of the shaft is 0. 6421 kg,which is lighter 10. 07 % than before;（ 2 ）the best spiral angle of the groove is 38. 38 °. 3 D parameterized models of the cutter shaft were built and their kinematics simulation were made by using Pro/ENGINEER software. The simulation and test results show that the more rotate speed and spiral angle of the groove are, the higher press on the surface of the groove bears. The above results provide basis for improved design of the pitting machine for litchi fruit...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{articulate}} the contributions that experimental performance and feminist scholarship on reproduction have already made {{to one another and}} to highlight other fruitful areas for future engagement, I examine several key moments between 1991 and 2008 when two seemingly unrelated narratives have overlapped. These narratives concern (1) {{the development and implementation of}} reproductive technologies from the sonogram to in vitro fertilization to regenerative medicine, and (2) the expansion of a range of experimental performance practices in new media and bio art performance. The moments when these histories converge are marked by a series of performances by Deb Margolin, Critical Art Ensemble, Anna Furse, the Olimpias Performance Research Group, and the Tissue Culture and Art Project, and by a body of critical writings from the artists themselves and a group of performance scholars. This journey is also marked by strategic expeditions back into the 1960 s to revisit and reinterpret foundational moments in the histories of feminist, activist, and new media performance. Moving between the 1960 s and the 1990 s/ 2000 s, I use contemporary performance to re-imagine the relationship between gender, technology, and embodiment in some of our origin myths about performance art. I also use the historical performances to unpack the contributions and limitations of the contemporary work. In my analysis of these materials, I do two things: I tease out how the artists in question have used experimental performance to generate new theoretical, tactical, and physical ways of engaging with reproductive technologies. At the same time, I also examine the ways in which reproductive technologies - as a set of political, ethical, and representational issues and as material objects/practices - are pushing performance theory and practice in new directions, complicating our theorizations of participation and providing new avenues for spectatorial interaction. Positioning Carolee Schneemann's Eye Body (1963) as the beginning of an unfolding of feminist corporeal interrogations of technology and technological interrogations of corporeality, I argue in Chapter 1 that genealogies of new media and feminist performance must take seriously feminist performance's long history of investigating the politics of technology. I then lay out the project's topic, scope, and the secondary literature on notions of participation, reproduction, and technology within the fields of experimental performance, science and technology studies, and feminist theory. In Chapter 2, I present a close reading of feminist playwright and performance artist Deb Margolin's solo performance Gestation (1991) alongside cultural histories of the sonogram. I pair these stories to show how feminist performance artists' experience with technologies of representation became a place where important debates around technology, agency, and embodiment could be staged at a crucial time in the history of feminist theory. Intervening in ongoing debates within new media theory about interactivity and embodiment in Chapter 3, I detail the ways in which the tactical media collective Critical Art Ensemble crafted physical and affective structures of interactivity in order to engender certain forms of public resistance to in vitro fertilization in its groundbreaking 1998 performance <b>Flesh</b> <b>Machine.</b> In Chapters 4 and 5, I move on to analyze the risks and rewards that emerged from two long-term collaborations between art and biotechnology. In Chapter 4 I put British director and producer Anna Furse's Glass Body: Reflecting on Becoming Transparent (2006 - 2008) in conversation with performance projects by the Olimpias Performance Research Group to demonstrate how collaborations with biomedicine reshape issues at the center of debates around social practice. In Chapter 5, I recast the Tissue Culture and Art Project's 2002 bio art performance installation The Pig Wings Project within the tradition of feminist maintenance artists such as Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Betye Saar, and Mary Kelly in order to argue that together, this new constellation of maintenance artists has crafted a set of interactive performance practices which stage maintenance and the duration of performance in order to reveal the ways in which regenerative medicine disavows its dependence on feminized labor...|$|R
60|$|MR. BARLOW. Well--then {{the mines}} began to pay badly. The seams ran thin and unprofitable, work was short. Either we must close down or {{introduce}} a new system, American methods, which I dislike so extremely. Now it really became a case of men working against <b>machines,</b> <b>flesh</b> and blood working against iron, for a livelihood. Still, {{it had to be}} done--the whole system revolutionised. Gerald took it in hand--and now I hardly know my own pits, with the great electric plants and strange machinery, and the new coal-cutters--iron men, as the colliers call them--everything running at top speed, utterly dehumanised, inhuman. Well, it had to be done; it was the only alternative to closing down and throwing three thousand men out of work. And Gerald has done it. But I can't bear to see it. The men of this generation are not like my men. They are worn and gloomy; they have a hollow look that I can't bear to see. They are a great grief to me. I remember men even twenty years ago--a noisy, lively, careless set, who kept the place ringing. I feel it is unnatural; I feel afraid of it. And I cannot help feeling guilty.|$|R
