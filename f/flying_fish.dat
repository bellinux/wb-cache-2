5|$|Cabaniss' {{body was}} ordered to be embalmed but was not; the damage to his body was so severe that the {{embalming}} fluid would leak out. His body was buried in Kobe on February 24 with military honors. The entire crew of the Swatara attended, {{as well as the}} entire crew of HMS <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> and many noted Japanese citizens. Ensign Parker reportedly suffered from depression following the accident. Cabaniss' death received significant media coverage in the Eastern United States. The New York Times published an article on its second page, and among other papers that carried the story were the Wilmington Morning Star and the Petersburg Index-Appeal.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as gastropods, bivalves, and decapods. It has a greater list of known prey than any other sea turtle. Other food items include sponges, corals, sea pens, polychaete worms, sea anemones, cephalopods, barnacles, brachiopods, isopods, Portuguese men o' war, insects, bryozoans, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers, starfish, fish (eggs, juveniles, and adults), {{hatchling}} turtles (including members of its own species), algae, and vascular plants. During migration through the open sea, loggerheads eat jellyfish, floating molluscs, floating egg clusters, squid, and <b>flying</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dodd, {{also known}} as Mullawa or Mulla walla (<b>flying</b> <b>fish),</b> was an Arunta or Arrente Indigenous man from central Australia. It is unclear if Dodd was from the Northern Territory or South Australia: one source states {{he was born in}} Alice Springs, and another states he was born at the Hermannsburg Mission, to the town's south-west. However a third source {{suggests}} Oodnadatta, across the border in South Australia, while Dodd himself, in a 2011 interview, stated he was South Australian. A 1953 newspaper report states that he was from Coober Pedy and had been resident at Colebrook Home, which housed Indigenous children from northern South Australia; some residents subsequently identified as members of the Stolen Generation. The only record of a birth date is in the Department of Veterans' Affairs' Nominal Roll of Australian Veterans of the Korean War, which gives 1 June 1928.|$|E

5|$|Frigatebirds' feeding {{habits are}} pelagic, {{and they may}} forage up to 500km (310mi) from land. They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long, hooked bills. They mainly catch small fish such as <b>flying</b> <b>fish,</b> {{particularly}} the genera Exocoetus and Cypselurus, that are driven to the surface by predators such as tuna and dolphinfish, but they will also eat cephalopods, particularly squid. Menhaden of the genus Brevoortia {{can be an important}} prey item where common, and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten. Frigatebirds have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas. Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators. Frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds, including boobies, petrels, shearwaters and terns, in particular the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|Hill's {{entered his}} first drag race at the <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> Lodge in Karnack, Texas in 1955. Hill drove his home-built hot rod {{to the track}} and won the event. The hot rod had a Model T frame and an Oldsmobile V8 engine. In 1958, he built his second dragster using parts that his {{employer}} allowed him to scavenge {{while working as a}} sales engineer at a foundry in Wichita Falls, Texas. He used the dragster to set the Texas state low elapsed time (e.t.) that year with a 9.93-second pass. The following year, Hill won the state championship with a 9.25-second pass at 161miles per hour (259kilometers per hour). Hill won his first national event in 1959 in a Hot Gas race at an American Hot Rod Association (AHRA) national championship event in Great Bend, Kansas. Hill earned $500 for an appearance at Inyokern, California to race Jack Chrisman and his Sidewinder dragster. One of his four passes in the 1960 event set the B/Gas dragster record at 163.04mph (262.39km/h), so Hill quit his job to become a full-time drag racer. Later that season he set the a new A/Gas low e.t. at 8.84seconds and set the speed record in the class at 161.29mph (259.57km/h).|$|E
25|$|By {{at least}} July, <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> {{was under the}} command of Lieutenant Thomas Price. On 14 July she recaptured the Content, which the French {{privateer}} Republic (Republique) had captured the evening before off Black River. From the prisoners Price learned where he might intercept the privateer. The next day he encountered her and captured her after a five-hour chase. Republic was armed with one long gun and small arms, and had left St. Jago with a crew of 51 men. On her cruise she had taken three prizes.

50|$|Being a community-tank <b>fish,</b> <b>flying</b> foxes are {{compatible}} with acaras, angelfish, barbs, danios, eartheaters, gouramis, knifefish, loaches, tetras and rasboras. Sometimes the Flying Fox {{will be a little}} aggressive towards other smaller aquarium fish if it is hungry, resulting in eating them. Aquarium fishkeepers may also keep <b>flying</b> fox <b>fish</b> as a lone tank fish or in schools. A small congregation of <b>flying</b> fox <b>fish</b> may, however, exhibit territorial behavior. Lone foxes often challenge other species for dominance, particularly paradise fish males, which they will chase and be chased by, as well as swim in a tight circle with, though usually neither is injured, and usually the paradise fish wins.|$|R

50|$|Some {{mackerel}} species migrate vertically. Adult {{snake mackerels}} conduct a diel vertical migration, staying in deeper water {{during the day}} and rising to the surface at night to feed.

This species feeds on squid, pelagic crustaceans, lanternfishes, <b>flying</b> <b>fishes,</b> sauries and other mackerel. It is in turn preyed upon by tuna and marlin.|$|R

40|$|The Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago in {{the central}} {{tropical}} Atlantic, is an important ground of whale sharks that are commonly sighted throughout the year close to the fishing boats in the adjacencies of the islands. In sightings reported between February 2000 and November 2005, the lengths of the individuals ranged between 1. 8 to 14. 0 m. The causes of these concentrations in the archipelago are still unclear, once there are no upwellings and plankton concentrations for feeding, and no reproductive activities were reported. Nevertheless, they could be associated to the spawning period of the abundant <b>flying</b> <b>fishes,</b> mainly in the first semester, when sightings were more frequent...|$|R
