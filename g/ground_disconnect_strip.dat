40|$|The ALICE {{experiment}} at CERN {{will study}} heavy ion collisions at a center-of-mass energy 5. 5 ∼TeV per nucleon. Particle tracking around the interaction region at radii r< 45 cm {{is done by}} the Inner Tracking System (ITS), consisting of six cylindrical layers of silicon detectors. The outer two layers of the ITS use double-sided silicon strip detectors. This thesis focuses on testing of these detectors and performance studies of the detector module prototypes at the beam test. Silicon strip detector layers will require about 20 thousand HAL 25 front-end readout chips and about 3. 5 thousand hybrids each containing 6 HAL 25 chips. During the assembly procedure, chips are bonded on a patterned TAB aluminium microcables which connect to all the chip input and output pads, and then the chips are assembled on the hybrids. Bonding failures at the chip or hybrid level may either render the component non-functional or deteriorate its the performance such {{that it can not be}} used for the module production. After each bonding operation, the component testing is done to reject the non-functional or poorly performing chips and hybrids. The LabView-controlled test station for this operation has been built at Utrecht University and was successfully used for mass production acceptance tests of chips and hybrids at three production labs. The functionality of the chip registers, bonding quality and analogue functionality of the chips and hybrids are addressed in the test. The test routines were optimized to minimize the testing time to make sure that testing is not a bottleneck of the mass production. For testing of complete modules the laser scanning station with 1060 nm diode laser has been assembled at Utrecht University. The testing method relies of the fact that a response of the detector module to a short collimated laser beam pulse resembles a response to a minimum ionizing particle. A small beam spot size (∼ 7 μm) allows to deposit the charge in a narrow region and measure the response of individual detector channels. First several module prototypes have been studied with this setup, the strip gain and charge sharing function have been measured, the later is compared with the model predictions. It was also shown that for a laser beam of a high monochromaticity, interference in the sensor bulk significantly modulates the deposited charge and introduces a systematic error of the gain measurement. Signatures of <b>disconnected</b> <b>strips</b> and pinholes defects have been observed, the response of the <b>disconnected</b> <b>strips</b> to the laser beam has been correlated with the noise measurements. Beam test of four prototype modules have been carried out at PS accelerator at CERN using 7 GeV/c pions. It was demonstrated that the modules provide an excellent signal-to-noise ratio in the range 40 - 75. The estimated spatial resolution for the normally incident tracks is about 18 μm using the center-of-gravity cluster reconstruction method. A non-iterative method for spatial resolution determination was developed, it was shown that in order to determine the resolution of each individual detector in the telescope, the telescope should consist of at least 5 detectors. The detectors showed high detection efficiency, in the order 99 %. It was shown that the particle loss occurs mostly in the defected regions near the noisy strips or strips with a very low gain.

It belongs to an expanding family to control and diagnose incandescent lamps and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with enhanced precision. It combines flexibility through daisy-chainable SPI 5. 0 MHz, extended digital and analog feedbacks, safety and robustness. Output edge shaping helps to improve electromagnetic performance. To avoid shutting off the device upon inrush current, while still being able to closely track the load current, a dynamic overcurrent threshold profile is featured. Current of each channel can be sensed with a programmable sensing ratio. Whenever communication with the external microcontroller is lost, the device enters a Fail operation mode, but remains operational, controllable, and protected. This new generation of high side switch products family facilitates ECU design thanks to compatible MCU software and PCB foot print for each device variant. This family is packaged in a Pb-free power-enhanced SOIC package with exposed pad which is End of Life Vehicles directive compliant.

Winslow IIICollege campuses {{are places}} of {{education}} and innovation for students, faculty, and the community {{of which they are}} a part. Universities have a unique opportunity to serve as the premier catalyst for development, which gives them the power to create new communities that are more than educational facilities. Nova Southeastern University, in Davie, Florida, is one such institution. The project site is 30 acres in the southwest corner of Nova’s campus. The blighted and <b>disconnected</b> <b>strip</b> mall currently composing the site will transform into an integrated and diverse mixed-use development that acts as a thriving icon for the university and surrounding community. Program elements included in the project are a medical research center, a library/bookstore, a hotel, retail, office, entertainment, and residential. Enhancing the social network of the university and community on one site, while creating a sense of place, is the design’s priority. Making an informed connection between theory and practice in landscape architecture, planning, and design is what gives this project validity. The design solution is a product of research, precedent studies, regional and site specific inventory and analysis, and client and personal goals. Integration between the campus and community is achieved by three design principles: 1) Place Making, 2) Connections, and 3) Community. These design principles establish and inform the social, physical, and natural systems at work in the design, as well as the user experience. A welcoming, comfortable, exciting, and iconic environment is created through the character of the place by attracting people to the site through place making. Connections are made between the site and the existing campus, the surrounding community, and the site users by physical layout and relationships. Program elements, dimensions, spatial ratios, building type, and shared amenities all exploit interaction and instill a sense of community.

60|$|In {{turning the}} matter {{over in my}} mind {{at that time and}} since, I never was able to {{consider}} the African trade upon a <b>ground</b> <b>disconnected</b> with the employment of negroes in the West Indies, and distinct from their condition in the plantations whereon they serve. I conceived that the true origin of the trade was not in the place it was begun at, but at the place of its final destination. I therefore was, and I still am, of opinion that the whole work ought to be taken up together, and that a gradual abolition of slavery in the West Indies ought to go hand in hand with anything which, should be done with regard to its supply from the coast of Africa. I could not trust a cessation of the demand for this supply to the mere operation of any abstract principle, (such as, that, if their supply was cut off, the planters would encourage and produce an effectual population,) knowing that nothing can be more uncertain than the operation of general principles, if they are not embodied in specific regulations. I am very apprehensive, that, so long as the slavery continues, some means for its supply will be found. If so, I am persuaded that it is better to allow the evil, in order to correct it, than, by endeavoring to forbid what we cannot be able wholly to prevent, to leave it under an illegal, and therefore an unreformed existence. It is not that my plan does not lead to the extinction of the slave trade, but it is through a very slow progress, the chief effect of which is to be operated in our own plantations, by rendering, in a length of time, all foreign supply unnecessary. It was my wish, whilst the slavery continued, and the consequent commerce, to take such measures as to civilize the coast of Africa by the trade, which now renders it more barbarous, and to lead by degrees to a more reputable, and, possibly, a more profitable connection with it, than we maintain at present.|$|R

40|$|A {{common problem}} occurs when {{refrigerant}} fluids wick inside the insulation of thermocouple wires through a compressor's casing feedthrough and then leak into the adjacent disconnect box outside the casing. Leaking fluids create an unfavorable situation inside the disconnect box and may contaminate the fluids. To address this problem, NASA Lewis Research Center s Manufacturing Engineering Division developed a customized hermetic feedthrough for {{a bank of}} Worthington compressors. In these compressors, bearing temperatures are measured by internal thermocouples embedded in bearings located inside the compressor casings. The thermocouple wires need to be routed outside the casing and read at another location. These wires are short and are terminated to a <b>disconnect</b> <b>strip</b> inside the casing. The bearings operate at about 170 F, but because the casing is filled with R 12 refrigerant oil, the casing has a maximum temperature of about 100 F. The operating conditions of these compressors {{permit the use of}} an epoxy that is compatible with the R 12 fluid. The desired finished product is a stainless steel tube that has been filled solid with epoxy after thermocouple wires bonded and sealed by epoxy have been inserted through its length. Shrink tubing extends from both ends of the tube. The process that was developed to isolate the thermocouple wires from the R 12 fluid follows. For this application, use an 8 -in. -long piece of 0. 500 -in. 304 stainless steel tube with six pairs of 24 -gauge stranded, PTFE-insulated (polytetrafluoroethylene) type "T" thermocouple wires for each feedthrough. Use shrink tubing to strain relief the insulated wires at their exit from the stainless steel tube. Cut the wire to length and identify the location of the stainless steel tube sleeve with masking tape. Then, remove the outer insulation from a 2 -in. section of wire that will be inside the tube, and carefully strip to bare wire a 1 -in. section {{in the middle of the}} section with the outer insulation removed. For an effective seal, the epoxy must penetrate between the strands when stranded conductors are used. Make the seal with epoxy bond on the bare wire. The bare wire must be encapsulated with a thin layer of the epoxy that leaves only a very low profile. These encapsulated wires must cure before the assembly can be continued. Then, inspect the cured wires for complete encapsulation before going to the next step. Insert the wires in the stainless steel tube and orient them so that the epoxied stripped sections are staggered within the tube; then, apply shrink tubing to one end of the cleaned wires, positioning it inside the edge of the tube. The small gaps between the wires on the other end will be used to inject the epoxy into the tube. Let the epoxy cure inside the tube, free of any voids. Then, continue to fill the tube until the entire 8 -in. length is nearly filled, allowing room for the other strain-relieving shrink tubing. Since this first design, the process has been adjusted to fit many needs and situations. Customized feedthroughs have been assembled from various wire types, wire gauges, and/or stainless steel tube passages. The fittings selected to mount these feedthroughs allow their use in other areas, such as pressure or vacuum systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{establishing}} full connectivity and satisfying required traffic capacity between disconnected clusters in large wireless ad-hoc ground networks by placing a minimum number of advantaged high flying Aerial Platforms (APs) as relay nodes at appropriate places. We formulate the problem of providing both connectivity and required capacity between <b>disconnected</b> <b>ground</b> clusters as a constrained clustering problem with complexity costs. The basic requirement for connectivity between the ground clusters and APs is converted into a summation form distortion function. The additional requirement for connectivity between the various APs is encoded by adding a new (summation form) constraint to the distortion function. In order to satisfy the required capacity out of each cluster to all other clusters, we add a cost function that depends on the assignment probabilities of the APs and relate the source (prior) probabilities of each cluster to the required capacity out of this cluster. The cost function produces solutions which are load balanced, i. e., the capacities supported through each AP are nearly equal. We solve the resultant clustering problem using Deterministic Annealing in order to find (near) globally optimal solutions for the minimum number and locations of the APs to establish full connectivity and provide required traffic capacity between disconnected clusters. We establish the validity of our algorithm by comparing it with optimal exhaustive search algorithms and show that our algorithm is near-optimal for the problem of establishing connectivity and satisfying capacity requirements between disconnected clusters.

40|$|Cohasset is a South Shore {{community}} in which approximately 90 percent of the drinking water supply comes from the Lily Pond surface water treatment plant. Lily Pond is shallow and currently eutrophic. The reduction of nutrient loads and control of in-lake vegetation were identified as goals {{in the development of}} pond and water supply management strategy. Low Impact Development (LID) Techniques were instituted to treat roadway runoff within the water supply watershed prior to discharge to the pond. The stormwater Best Management Practices selected include bioretention cells (rain gardens) and vegetated bioretention swales. As a first step a demonstration rain garden was constructed at the Water Department parking lot – to serve as an educational tool for the community. Twenty rain gardens and two vegetated bioretention swales have been constructed so far within roadway rights-of-way. Twenty-nine additional rain gardens will be constructed in Spring of 2008. The runoff filters through specially engineered soil reducing pollutant and nutrient levels, reducing elevated temperatures of stormwater during summer months, and attenuating peak flows. The treated stormwater is collected by under-drains and returned to the stormwater system or infiltrated back into the ground. The Cohasset Rain Garden Project is an example of applying LID techniques to retro-fit existing drainage systems in a developed watershed. LID is an innovative approach to stormwater management involving site design that duplicates the hydrologic features of an undeveloped watershed. Instead of conveying, managing and treating stormwater in large, costly facilities located at the bottom of drainage areas, and often outside of the natural watershed, LID simulates natural hydrologic cycles by addressing stormwater through small, cost-effective landscape features located at the lot level. These landscape features include permeable paving, bio-retention cells / rain gardens, grass swales, filter <b>strips,</b> <b>disconnected</b> impervious areas, and cistern collection systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a small tube/wire type electrostatic precipitator (ESP). In the ESPs present form, particle charging and collecting voltages and airflow rates were individually varied throughout 200 ambient temperature test runs ranging from 10 to 30 kV in increments on 5 kV and 0. 5 m/s to 1. 5 m/s, respectively. It was repeatedly observed that, at input air velocities of between 0. 5 and 0. 9 m/s and voltage settings of 20 kV to 30 kV, the collection efficiency remained above 95 %. The outcomes of preliminary tests at combustion flue temperatures are, at present, inconclusive although {{indications are that}} {{there is little or no}} drop in comparable performance during ideal test conditions. A limited set of similar tests was carried out during which the collecting electrode was <b>grounded,</b> having been <b>disconnected</b> from the static generator. The collecting efficiency fell significantly, and for that reason, this approach was not pursued further. The collecting efficiencies during ambient temperature tests were determined by mass balance between incoming and outgoing dry PM. The efficiencies of combustion temperature runs are determined by analysing the difference in opacity of the flue gas at inlet and outlet compared to a reference light source. In addition, an array of Leit tabs (carbon coated, electrically conductive adhesive discs) was placed at inlet and outlet for a number of four-day continuous ambient temperature runs. Analysis of the discs’ contamination was carried out using scanning electron microscopy and ImageJ computer software that confirmed collection efficiencies of over 99 % which gave unequivocal support to all the previous tests. The average efficiency for these runs was 99. 409 %. Emissions collected from a woody biomass combustion unit, classified to a diameter of 100 µm, were used in all ambient temperature trials test runs apart from two which collected airborne dust from within the laboratory. Sawdust and wood pellets were chosen for laboratory and field combustion trials. Video recordings were made of three ambient temperature test runs in which the smoke from a wood smoke generator was drawn through the precipitator. Although these runs were visual indicators only, with no objective other than to display, they provided a strong argument for the device’s claimed efficiency, as no emissions were visible at exit when energised.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{concept of}} hydrological connectivity {{is difficult to}} quantify. Some indices have been proposed. The most cited is Borselli’s one. It mainly uses the DEM as input. The pixel size may strongly impacts {{the result of the}} calculation. It has not been studied yet in silty areas. Another important aspect is the choice of the weighting factor which strongly influences the index value. The objective of this poster is so to compare 8 different DEM’s resolutions (12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 204, 504 and 996 cm) and 3 different weighting factors (factor C of Wischmeier, Manning’s factor and rugosity index) in the Borselli’s index calculation. The IC was calculated in a 124 ha catchment (Hevillers), in the loess belt, in Belgium. The DEM used is coming from a UAV with a maximum resolution of 12 cm. Permanent covered surfaces are not considered in order to avoid artefact due to the vegetation (2 % of the surface). Regarding the DEM pixel size, the IC increases for a given pixel when the pixel size decreases. That confirms some results observed in the Alpine region by Cavalli (2014). The mean difference between 12 cm and 10 m resolution is 35 % with higher values up to 100 % for higher connectivity zones (flow paths). Another result is the lower impact of connections in the watershed (grass strips…) at lower pixel sizes. This is linked to the small width of some connections which are sometimes comparing to cell size. Furthermore, a great loss of precision is observed from the 500 cm pixel size and upper. That remark is quite intuitive. Finally, some very well disconnected zones appear for the highest resolutions. Regarding the weighting factor, IC values calculated using C factor are lower than with the rugosity index which is only a topographic factor. With very high resolution DEM, it permits to represent the fine topography. For the C factor, the zones up to very well <b>disconnected</b> areas (grass <b>strips,</b> wood…) are well represented with lower index values than downstream zones. On the contrary, areas up to very well connected zones (roads, paths…) are higher and much more connected than downstream areas. For the Manning’s factor, the values are very low and not very well contrasted. This factor is not enough discriminant for this study. In conclusion, high resolution DEM (1 meter or higher) is needed for the IC calculation (precison, impact of connections…). Very high resolution permits to identify very well disconnected areas but it multiplies the calculation time. For the weighting factor, rugosity index and C factor have each some advantages. It is planned to test other approaches for the IC calculation...|$|R

Clearly the breakdown voltage characteristics of such a gap need to be carefully co-ordinated with the transformer insulation and those of the arrester. Eskom (Electricity Supply Commission of South Africa) is the national electrical utility that provides the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in South Africa. The majority of Eskom's electricity reticulation is done with either 11 kV or 22 kV electrical overhead networks. An unacceptable number of Eskom's pole mounted power transformers on these networks have failed over the past few years. The high failure rate of Distribution transformers in Eskom, South Africa has previously been highlighted and investigated in an MSc thesis, the most recent being the thesis completed at the University of KwaZulu-Natal by Chatterton [6]. The thesis proposed possible solutions to the problem but experienced high implementation costs and particular technical issues before widespread implementation could prove viable for the Distribution System. The average transformer failure rate for the Distribution Eastern Region for the twelve month period taken as a moving average was calculated to be 5. 19 % per annum at the end of November 2005 and 3. 84 % at the end of November 2006. (Eskom Eastern Region Plant report, November 2006). International norms seem to indicate that a transformer failure rate of between 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % per annum is acceptable, Chatterton [6]. The reason for the increased failure rates during 2005 was attributed to incorrect <b>Ground</b> Lead <b>Disconnect</b> (GLD) specifications by one of the major surge arrester manufacturers. The incorrect GLD specifications have resulted in premature and nuisance operations. These were triggered by low intensity lightning storms {{as a result of the}} lower threshold trigger values. These premature operations have left numerous transformers vulnerable for periods as long as six months and have resulted in the transformer failures increasing from 2. 4 % quoted by Chatterton [6] in 2002 to 5. 19 % in 2005 and a reduction to 3. 84 % in November 2006 once the problem was identified and the GLDs corrected. See annexure A, Figure A 1 of the Plant report for November 2006 for performance details. Hence, this manufacturing flaw and the GLD's sensitivity to specification necessitate further investigation into the spark gap as back-up protection. The spark gap therefore becomes more viable than line or double surge arresters due to its cost effectiveness and robustness. This thesis was based on an idea proposed by Eskom's (Industrial Association Resource Centre) IARC. The aim was to investigate the technical feasibility of using a spark gap to grade with a distribution class surge arrester whilst the surge arrester was operational. The purpose of the spark gap was to act as back-up protection when the arrester fails. Experimentation was undertaken via simulation using the FEMLAB software to model the most suitable gap and geometry for a given rod diameter. The breakdown characteristic of the rod was well understood and verified. Thus, the results obtained from the simulation were compared against the laboratory experiments for the same rod diameters and tip shapes used in the simulation. The results have been analyzed to determine whether the spark gap is a feasible solution for use with surge arresters to protect the transformer from induced strikes following arrester failure.

40|$|Abstract Over {{the past}} few years, {{there have been some}} noticeably {{problematic}} trends threatening the place of the Other in Finland. Globalisation, as theorised in neo-liberal paradigms, calls for the opening up of markets, as well as a mobile citizenship able {{to meet the needs of}} economies underpinned by competition and innovation. This has led to a state of affairs in which hundreds of millions of people feel insecure about their place in both the employment market and wider society, with the Other as the most visible manifestation of this fear. Finland continues to have particular difficulties in adjusting to this situation owing to a specific journey towards nationhood, in which its public education system was given the twin tasks of engendering a national ethos and social equity. It is contended in this thesis that nation-building stories always carry the potential for ethnocentrism as they must — of necessity — define who belongs to the nation and who does not. This relationship between the national ethos and equity has never seriously been critiqued, and Finland’s growing far-right movement has thus been able to posit consensus and a culturally homogenous state as solutions to the challenges of neo-liberal globalisation. This thesis aims to understand the contemporary difficulties in the relationship between Finnishness and the Other, and is <b>grounded</b> in the <b>disconnect</b> between rhetoric and what can be observed on a daily basis. Finland has been framed as a tolerant nation with no history of racism or colonialism, and yet the anti-immigration Finns Party won the second largest number of seats during the last parliamentary election, there is still some debate as to whether the Finnish ‘n’-word is offensive or not, and successive administrations have pursued assimilationist policies towards the Sami and Roma minority populations. The thesis provides a holistic picture of the problematic discourses delineating the relationship between Finnishness and the Other. The epistemological and ontological assumptions here are based on the post-structural position that power and knowledge are continuously constructed and contingent, and the postmodernist distrust of metanarratives. This allows for a destabilisation of the socio-historical factors contributing to Finland’s mainstream nation-building narratives in order to demonstrate their subjective and provisional nature. The methodological framework of this thesis is critical discourse analysis, in which the utility of research is to find a social problem grounded in semiotics, investigate the factors that prevent the problem from being addressed and whether the issue is caused by the existing social order, before suggesting how things might be otherwise. The first research question asks which exceptionalist discourses can be found in research on the relationship between Finnishness and the Other and identifies three ‘Traits of Exceptionalism’ stemming from historical amnesia towards Finnish colonial complicity, Finland’s place in the West, and the popular image of Finland as a tolerant nation. The second question assesses how these discourses are reproduced and/or contested in the student responses to the EIHE survey on internationalism in higher education. Based upon a discourse analysis of these responses, the thesis asserts that these discourses are largely being reproduced and goes on to discuss the limitations this places upon interactions between Finns and the Other. In common with research orientations based upon post-structuralism and postmodernism, this thesis does not call for a prescribed solution to the existing problem but is rather part of wider calls to broaden the conversations it is possible to have regarding Finnishness and the Other. It recognises that the exceptionalist nature of this relationship is vital for the legitimacy of the existing social order, but also explicitly lists the possibly catastrophic implications of allowing this kind of relationship to continue. Finally, it challenges universalist assumptions about what constitutes a human subject and tries to offer more pluralistic lenses that position the Other as a subject in her own right...|$|R
40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{performance}} analysis and design of a wireless ad-hoc network using a virtual-circuit or reservation based medium access layer. In a reservation based MAC network, source nodes reserve a session's link capacity end-to-end over the entire path before sending traffic over the established path. An example of a generic reservation based MAC protocol is Unifying Slot Assignment Protocol (USAP). Any reservation based medium access protocol (including USAP) uses a simple set of rules to determine the cells or timeslots available at a node to reserve link capacity along {{the path to the}} next node. Given inputs of node locations, traffic pattern between nodes and link propagation matrices, we develop models to estimate blocking probability and throughput for reservation based wireless ad-hoc networks. These models are based on extending reduced load loss network models for a wireless network. For generic USAP with multiple frequency channels, the key effect of multiuser interference on a link is modeled via reduced available link capacity where the effects of transmissions and receptions in the link neighborhood are modeled using USAP reservation rules. We compare our results with simulation and obtain good results using our extended reduced load loss network models but with reduced available link capacity distribution obtained by simulation. For the case of generic USAP using a single frequency channel, we develop models for unicast traffic using reduced load loss network models but with the sharing of the wireless medium between a node and its neighbors modeled by considering cliques of neighboring interfering links around a particular link. We compare results of this model with simulation and show good match. We also develop models to calculate source-destination throughput for the reservation MAC as used in the Joint Tactical Radio System to support both unicast and multicast traffic. These models are based on extending reduced load loss network models for wireless multicast traffic with the sharing of the wireless medium between a node and its (upto 2 hop) neighbors modeled by considering cliques of interfering nodes around a particular node. We compare results of this model with simulation and show good match with simulation. Once we have developed models to estimate throughput and blocking probabilities, we use these models to optimize total network throughput. In order to optimize total throughput, we compute throughput sensitivities of the reduced load loss network model using an implied cost formulation and use these sensitivities to choose the routing probabilities among multiple paths so that total network throughput is maximized. In any network scenario, MANETs can get disconnected into clusters. As part of the MANET design problem, we look at the problem of establishing network connectivity and satisfying required traffic capacity between disconnected clusters by placing a minimum number of advantaged high flying Aerial Platforms (APs) as relay nodes at appropriate places. We also extend the connectivity solution {{in order to make the}} network single AP survivable. The problem of providing both connectivity and required capacity between <b>disconnected</b> <b>ground</b> clusters (which contain nodes that can communicate directly with each other) is formulated as a summation-form clustering problem of the ground clusters with the APs along with inter-AP distance constraints that make the AP network connected and with complexity costs that take care of ground cluster to AP capacity constraints. The resultant clustering problem is solved using Deterministic Annealing to find (near) globally optimal solutions for the minimum number and locations of the APs to establish connectivity and provide required traffic capacity between disconnected clusters. The basic connectivity constraints are extended to include conditions that make the resultant network survivable to a single AP failure. In order to make the network single AP survivable, we extend the basic connectivity solution by adding another summation form constraint so that the AP network forms a biconnected network and also by making sure that each ground cluster is connected to atleast two APs. We establish the validity of our algorithms by comparing them with optimal exhaustive search algorithms and show that our algorithms are near-optimal for the problem of establishing connectivity between disconnected clusters...|$|R
