Founded in 2001, Euratlas {{has created a}} collection of history maps of Europe from year 1 AD to year 2000 AD that present the evolution of every country from the Roman Empire [...] to present times. The evolution includes sovereign states and their administrative sub-divisions, but also unorganized peoples and dependent territories. The maps show European country borders at regular intervals of 100 years, but not year by year. This leaves out many important turning points in history.|$|E

50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>history</b> {{is the use}} {{of digital}} media to further {{historical}} analysis, presentation, and research. It is a branch of the Digital humanities and an extension of quantitative history, cliometrics, and computing. <b>Digital</b> <b>history</b> is commonly <b>digital</b> public <b>history,</b> concerned primarily with engaging online audiences with historical content, or, digital research methods, that further academic research. <b>Digital</b> <b>history</b> outputs include: <b>digital</b> archives, online presentations, interactive maps, time-lines, audio files, and virtual worlds to make history more accessible to the user. A researcher can interact with, and visualise, the output more easily than with conventional historiographical material. Recent <b>digital</b> <b>history</b> projects focus on creativity, collaboration, and technical innovation, text mining, corpus linguistics, 3D Modeling, and big data analysis. Utilising these resources the user can rapidly develop new analyses that can link to, extend, and bring to life existing histories.|$|R

Increasingly, university departments seek scholars to translate history into this fast-paced environment and to work in digital history; however, they have found that without well-defined examples of digital scholarship, established best practices, and, especially, clear standards of peer review for tenure, few scholars have fully engaged with the digital medium.

I will get you started with three expressive digital media that you can use to explore what it means to do guerilla <b>digital</b> <b>history</b> in the nation's capital. You will leave this course with an actual 'thing' you've created and deployed, and a toolkit of your own. We will do a mixture of activities, readings, and discussions to enable you to ground your guerilla <b>digital</b> <b>history</b> toolkit in the scholarship. You will build this toolkit as you put in train your own act of guerilla <b>digital</b> <b>history.</b> Course website at [URL]...|$|R

A purely <b>digital</b> <b>history</b> redefines the possibilities for urban history and public history.

40|$|Dr. Russell Bailey {{presented}} Creating <b>Digital</b> <b>History</b> - A Case Study: The Dorr Rebellion Project at the Eleventh International Conference on New Directions in the Humanities Conference in Budapest, Hungary, June 2013. <b>Digital</b> <b>history,</b> as {{a component}} of digital humanities, provides opportunities for scholars and students of history to create and contribute to the rapidly growing corpus of <b>digital</b> <b>history</b> research knowledge resources. This article describes and explicates an applied, non-theoretical, multifaceted, multimedia, fully-digital example of the creation of digital humanities by a small but broadly representative team of higher-education scholars and library staff (professional and support). The central topic and organizing principle is the 1842 North American Dorr Rebellion. The case study provides an adaptable model for other historical topics, other teams (higher-education or other researchers), including compelling reasons for this and other projects, the project’s organization and evolution, and both intended and incidental benefits from such collaborative projects. As an applied model, placement in, and specific connections to, the ongoing academic debate about the value of digital humanities and <b>digital</b> <b>history</b> versus the value of more traditional humanities and history is eschewed, rather emphasizing and focusing on practical guidance for collaborative creation of digital historical research knowledge resources. Dr. Bailey has also published an article on this subject which is available in English and Cyrillic. The article was published in the open access journal Infoteka...|$|R
