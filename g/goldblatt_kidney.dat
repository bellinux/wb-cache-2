Arteriogram, that is the figure of renal arteries and its intraren a l branches, was taken from 1 to 3 second (average 1. 8 second), and nephrogram was 2 - 6 second (average 4. 0 second) after initiation of translumbar injection of dye. We obtained aortogram and nephrogram satisfact o rily by 5 serial films with 1. 0 second interval for clinical use.

Renal sympathetic nerves stimulate renin secretion and increase renal tubular sodium reabsorption. We hypothesized that daily voluntary wheel running exercise by 2 K- 1 C rats will decrease {{mean arterial pressure}} (MAP), plasma angiotensin II (Ang II), and aldosterone as well as normalize urinary sodium and potassium excretion independent of changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Five-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats underwent sham clipping (Sham) or right renal artery clipping (2 K- 1 C). Rats were randomized to standard caging (SED) or cages with running wheels (EX). After 12 weeks, rats were assigned to either collection of aortic blood for measurement of Ang II and aldosterone or assessment of inulin clearances and excretory function. Running distances were comparable in both EX groups. MAP was lower in 2 K- 1 C EX vs 2 K- 1 C SED rats (P< 0. 05). Plasma Ang II and aldosterone were significantly higher in 2 K- 1 C SED rats and decreased in 2 K- 1 C EX rats to levels similar to Sham SED or Sham EX rats. Clipped kidney weights were significantly lower in both 2 K- 1 C groups, but GFR and urine flow rates were no different from right and left kidneys among the four groups. Total and fractional sodium excretion rates from the unclipped kidney of 2 K- 1 C SED rats were higher vs either Sham group (P< 0. 05). Values in 2 K- 1 C EX rats were similar to the Sham groups. Potassium excretion paralleled sodium excretion. These studies show that voluntary dynamic exercise in 2 K- 1 C rats decreases plasma Ang II and aldosterone, which contribute to the lower arterial pressure without deleterious effects on GFR. The effects on sodium excretion underscore the impact of pressure natriuresis despite elevated plasma Ang II and aldosterone in sedentary 2 K- 1 C rats. In contrast, potassium excretion is primarily regulated by circulating aldosterone and distal sodium delivery.

40|$|Background: The classic {{renin-angiotensin system}} (RAS) {{has a role}} in the {{cardiovascular}} system and water homeostasis in the body, but recently, the existences of this system with all of its components including angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and angiotensin receptors have been shown in the mammalian brain. Recent clinical studies suggest that treatment of hypertensive patients with the RAS affecting drugs, such as captopril improves their cognitive function. Aims and Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of captopril on the frontal cortex levels of ACE and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in renovascular hypertensive rats receiving captopril. Materials and Methods: The rats were randomly divided into 3 groups of 8 animals; control, <b>Goldblatt</b> two <b>kidney</b> one clip (2 K 1 C) hypertensive rats and Goldblatt 2 K 1 C hypertensive rats received 5 mg/kg captopril. After 8 days of treatment; the rats were sacrificed and expression of ACE and ChAT in the frontal cortex were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results were analyzed with two-way ANOVA test using SPSS software and the level of significance was set at P < 0. 05. Results: Captopril treatment decreased the levels of ACE mRNA in the frontal cortex of renovascular hypertensive rats but has no significant effect in the ChAT mRNA levels. Conclusion: Captopril as a nootropic drug has no significant effect on the ChAT gene expression in the frontal cortex of renovascular hypertensive rats and it may exert its memory enhancing effect on the frontal cortex via a non-cholinergic mechanism. © 2017 Farzaneh Ganji et al...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Goldblatt’s</b> 2 <b>kidney</b> 1 clip (2 K 1 C) rat {{animal model}} of {{renovascular}} hypertension {{is characterized by}} ischemic nephropathy of the clipped kidney. 2 K 1 C rats were treated with a specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor d (PPARd) agonist, HPP 593. Clipped kidneys from untreated rats developed tubular and glomerular necrosis and massive interstitial, periglomerular and perivascular fibrosis. HPP 593 kidneys did not exhibit any histochemical features of necrosis; fibrotic lesions were present only in perivascular areas. Necrosis in the untreated clipped kidneys was {{associated with an increased}} oxidative stress, up regulation and mitochondrial translocation of the pro-death protein BNIP 3 specifically in tubules. In the kidneys of HPP 593 -treated rats oxidative stress was attenuated and BNIP 3 protein decreased notably in the mitochondrial fraction when compared to untreated animals. In untreated clipped kidneys, mitochondria were dysfunctional as revealed by perturbations in the levels of MCAD, COXIV, TFAM, and Parkin proteins and AMPK activation, while in HPP 593 -treated rats these proteins remained at the physiological levels. Nuclear amounts of oxidative stress-responsive proteins, NRF 1 and NRF 2 were below physiological levels in treated kidneys. Mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy were inhibited similarly in both treated and untreated 2 K 1 C kidneys as indicated by a decrease in PGC 1 -a and deficiency of the autophagy-essential proteins LC 3 -II and ATG 5. However, HPP 593 treatment resulted in increased accumulation of p 62 protein, an autophagic substrate and an enhancer of NRF 2 activity. Therefore, inhibition of BNIP...|$|R
40|$|Objective:Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) regulates adipogenic {{response}} with adipocyte hypertrophy {{by increasing}} oxidative stress. Recent {{studies have shown}} the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-?? (PPAR??) agonist in attenuation of angiotensin II-induced oxidative stress. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore a potential mechanistic link between PPAR?? and the cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) and to elucidate the contribution of HO- 1 to the adipocyte regulatory effects of PPAR?? agonism in an animal model of enhanced RAS, the <b>Goldblatt</b> 2 <b>kidney</b> 1 clip (2 K 1 C) model. Method:We first established a direct stimulatory effect of the PPAR?? agonist (GW 501516) on the HO- 1 gene by demonstrating increased luciferase activity in COS- 7 cells transfected with a luciferase-HO- 1 promoter construct. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: sham-operated animals, 2 K 1 C rats and 2 K 1 C rats treated with GW 501516, in the absence or presence of the HO activity inhibitor, stannous mesoporphyrin (SnMP). Results: 2 K 1 C animals had increased visceral adiposity, adipocyte hypertrophy, increased inflammatory cytokines, increased circulatory and adipose tisssue levels of renin and Ang II along with increased adipose tissue gp 91 phox expression (P< 0. 05) when compared with sham-operated animals. Treatment with GW 501516 increased adipose tissue HO- 1 and adiponectin levels (P< 0. 01) along with enhancement of Wnt 10 b and ??-catenin expression. HO- 1 induction was accompanied by the decreased expression of Wnt 5 b, mesoderm specific transcript (mest) and C/EBP?? levels and an increased number of small adipocytes (P< 0. 05). These effects of GW 501516 were reversed in 2 K 1 C animals exposed to SnMP (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Taken together, our study demonstrates, for the first time, that increased levels of Ang II contribute towards adipose tissue dysregulation, which is abated by PPAR??-mediated upregulation of the heme-HO system. These findings highlight the pivotal role and symbiotic relationship of HO- 1, adiponectin and PPAR?? in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis in adipose tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{peripheral}} chemoreflex {{is known}} to be hyper-responsive in both spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and <b>Goldblatt</b> hypertensive (2 <b>kidney</b> 1 clip; 2 K 1 C) rats. We have previously shown that carotid sinus nerve denervation (CSD) reduces arterial blood pressure (ABP) in SHR. Here, we show that CSD ameliorates 2 K 1 C hypertension and reveal potential underlying mechanisms. Adult Wistar rats were instrumented to record ABP via telemetry, then underwent CSD (n =  9) or sham CSD (n =  9) five weeks after renal artery clipping, versus normal Wistar (n =  5). After 21  days renal function was assessed, and tissue collected to assess sympathetic postganglionic intracellular calcium transients ([Ca(2 +) ]i) and immune cell infiltrates. Hypertensive 2 K 1 C rats showed a profound elevation in ABP (Wistar: 98  ±  4  mmHg vs. 2 K 1 C: 147  ±  8  mmHg; P <  0. 001), coupled with impairments in renal function and baroreflex sensitivity, increased neuro-inflammatory markers and enhanced [Ca(2 +) ]I in stellate neurons (P <  0. 05). CSD reduced ABP in 2 K 1 C+CSD rats and prevented the further progressive increase in ABP seen in 2 K 1 C+sham CSD rats, with a between-group difference of 14  ±  2  mmHg by Week 3 (P <  0. 01), accompanied by improvements in both baroreflex control and spectral indicators of cardiac sympatho-vagal balance. Furthermore, CSD improved protein and albuminuria, decreased [Ca(2 +) ]i evoked responses from stellate neurons, and reduced indicators of brainstem inflammation. In summary, CSD in 2 K 1 C rats reduces the hypertensive burden and improves renal function. This may be mediated by improvements in autonomic balance, functional remodelling of post-ganglionic neurones and reduced inflammation. Our results suggest that the peripheral chemoreflex may be considered as a potential therapeutic target for controlling renovascular hypertension...|$|R

Purpose: {{to study}} the repercussion of arterial hypertension regarding body weight gain and body length, as well as liver and brain weight of offspring. Methods: a total of 82 animals in reproductive age were used. They {{were randomly assigned to}} 4 different groups (control, handled, nephrectomized and hypertensive). Renal hypertension was produced by a controlled constriction of the main left renal artery and contralateral nephrectomy, according to the technique described by Goldblatt (<b>Goldblatt</b> I: one <b>kidney</b> - one clip hypertension). Afterwards, they were distributed among nonpregnant and pregnant groups. The following newborn groups resulted from the pregnant groups: RN-C (control-newborn group of pregnant rats without surgical treatment), RN-M (manipulation-newborn group of the pregnant rats with surgical manipulation), RN-N (nephrectomized-newborn group of pregnant rats with nephrectomy) and Rn-H (hypertensive-newborn group of pregnant rats with hypertension). Results: the RN-N and RN-H groups showed body weight gain (= 3, 64 ± 0, 50; or = 3, 37 ± 0, 44), body length (= 3, 89 ± 0, 36; or = 3, 68 ± 0, 32) and brain weight (= 0, 16 ± 0, 01; or = 0, 16 ± 0, 05), respectively, smaller than the control group (= 5, 40 ± 0, 51; or = 4, 95 ± 0, 23 and or = 0, 22 ± 0, 04, respectively).
