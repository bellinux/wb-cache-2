As the piston ring at the top or lower oil attachment point works under worse lubrication condition, its wear increases severely, laser texturing was used to the piston ring/liner, lineary extending grooves and regular arranged dimples with predetermined parameters was well-matched {{with the needs of}} lubrication. The effects of different dimple shapes, such as sphere coronal, combined sphere coronal,columnar, hexahedral, and trapezoidal dimples was analyzed by the theory of hydrodynamic lubrication. It was deduced that trapezoidal dimples are <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> only single <b>running</b> orientation and sphere coronal and combined sphere coronal dimples are <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> double <b>running</b> orientations.

40|$|Abstract—Many of the ever-growing elderly {{population}} require exercise, such as running, for health management. One {{important element of}} a runner’s training is the choice of shoes for exercise; shoes are important because they provide the interface between the feet and road. When we purchase shoes, we may instinctively choose a pair after trying on many different pairs of shoes. Selecting the shoes instinctively may work, {{but it does not}} guarantee a suitable <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>running</b> activities. Therefore, if we could select suitable shoes for each runner from the viewpoint of brain activities, it would be helpful for validating shoe selection. In this paper, we describe how brain activities show different characteristics during particular task, corresponding to different properties of shoes. Using five subjects, we performed a verification experiment, applying weight, softness, and flexibility as shoe properties. In order to affect the shoe property’s differences to the brain, subjects run for 10 min. Before and after running, subjects conducted a paced auditory serial addition task (PASAT) as the particular task; and the subjects ’ brain activities during the PASAT are evaluated based on oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin relative concentration changes, measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). When the brain works actively, oxihemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentration drastically changes; therefore, we calculate the maximum values of concentration changes. In order to normalize relative concentration changes after running, the maximum value are divided by before running maximum value as evaluation parameters. The classification of the groups of shoes is expressed on a self-organizing map (SOM). As a result, deoxyhemoglobin can make clusters for two of the three types of shoes.

40|$|Multicore {{systems have}} become an {{indispensable}} part of our everyday life. They represent a viable alternative for increasing processor performance without hitting the memory and power walls. However, the shift from traditional programming to multicore programming has a critical influence in three dimensions: the applications, the software tools, and the hardware platforms. In this thesis, {{we focus on the}} application dimension, and we investigate the performance potential of a 3 D bodyscan SAR processing algorithm running on several multi-core processors. To allow for the processor variety, the solutions are based on OpenCL, a language that enables inter-platform portability for a large set of multicores. To allow for performance, we choose to mainly evaluate and optimize for NVIDIA GPUs, but also for Intel GPPs and ATI GPU. Our solutions design and implementation follow a step-by-step strategy. First, we analyse the application to determine its functionality, data characteristics, and performance requirements. Next, we design and implement a sequential reference solution, and we evaluate its performance. We use this particular solution to design a set of possible parallel solutions, which are also evaluated in terms of performance and platform utilization, using a generic prototyping platform. Further, we select the most promising parallel solution for a first portable OpenCL implementation. All platform-agnostic basic optimizations, are applied now, towards a new application, with increased performance and no decrease in portability. After these basic optimizations, we show how several platform-specific optimizations can be applied. Basically, in this step, we trade portability for performance. For this work, we specifically target NVIDIA GPUs, and we show the potential performance impact of data and memory-related optimizations on the case-study application. Finally, we gather all these steps and findings into a generic, empirical strategy that enables programmers to reason about OpenCL applications in a systematic manner, letting them decide the level of the trade-off between the application portability and performance. Our main conclusions are twofold. First, we conclude that OpenCL is a promising standard (and language) for enforcing the implementation of portable multicore applications. Second, we conclude that the bodyscan application is a good <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>running</b> on multicore platforms, and we recommend the GPUs as the target platform for such an application. For future work, we propose to advance in two directions. First, as generic research, we propose to focus on the strategy validation and refining, as well as on a more abstract way to derive the parallel OpenCL versions. Second, on the application/technical side, we plan to focus on finding and implementing hardware-dependent optimizations of the OpenCL solution on various hardware platforms.

25|$|In 1970, NIR {{purchased}} {{a fleet of}} eight new-build Mark 2B's to run with the 101 Class on the cross-border Enterprise service. These were painted in a maroon and blue livery and were <b>fitted</b> <b>for</b> push-pull <b>running.</b> Between 1981 and 1983, to compliment {{the arrival of the}} 111 Class and enhance the Enterprise service, NIR purchased 12 second-hand Mark 2's, of the B, C and F varieties, from British Rail. Some of the 1970-built coaches were refurbished for use in the new service. In the final years before the withdrawal of the 101's in 1989, they worked with Mark 2's to form suburban push-pull trains. Further Mark 2B's and F's were ordered in 1989 as part of a modernisation scheme by NIR. One notable vehicle was Mark 2F No. 904, which retained its British Rail livery in service with NIR. By 1997, all Mark 2's had been withdrawn following introduction of the DeDietrich rolling stock on the Enterprise. Today, five of these coaches survive - No.'s 300, 305 and buffet No. 547, all under the ownership of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland, No. 546, in use in England with West Coast Railways as No. 1800, and No. 911 (See below.) A sixth, No. 901, survived in Dalton, England until July 2012 when it was finally scrapped.|$|R

Since getting all three at once is impossible, we advocate a logical language, 2 D-LTL a bi-dimensional temporal logic <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> multiple sessions and for which efficient monitoring algorithms can be given, and a graphical language based on standard UML sequence diagrams with a tight correspondence between the two.

We argue that stateless functions represent a viable platform for these users, eliminating cluster management overhead, fulfilling the promise of elasticity. Furthermore, using our prototype implementation, PyWren, we show that this model is general enough to implement a number of distributed computing models, such as BSP, efficiently. Extrapolating from recent trends in network bandwidth and the advent of disaggregated storage, we suggest that stateless functions are a natural <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> data processing in future computing environments...|$|R
