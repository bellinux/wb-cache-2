5|$|James {{was born}} on December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James, who raised the child on her own. When James was growing up, life was often a {{struggle}} for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. Realizing that her son {{would be better off}} in a more stable <b>family</b> <b>environment,</b> Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{complications}} {{are associated}} with a bad prognosis. Examples are hypotension (low blood pressure), hypoxia (low blood oxygen saturation), lower cerebral perfusion pressures and longer times spent with high intracranial pressures. Patient characteristics also influence prognosis. Factors thought to worsen it include abuse of substances such as illicit drugs and alcohol and age over sixty or under two years (in children, younger age at time of injury may be associated with a slower recovery of some abilities). Other influences that may affect recovery include pre-injury intellectual ability, coping strategies, personality traits, <b>family</b> <b>environment,</b> social support systems and financial circumstances.|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that inadequate <b>family</b> <b>environments</b> (<b>family</b> material <b>environment</b> and <b>family</b> psychosocial <b>environment)</b> {{are not only}} social problems but also factors contributing to adverse neurocognitive outcomes. In the present study, the authors investigated the relationship among <b>family</b> <b>environments,</b> children&# 39;s naturalistic affective state, self-reported stress, and executive functions {{in a sample of}} 157 Chinese families. These findings revealed that in inadequate <b>family</b> material <b>environments,</b> reduced children&# 39;s cognitive flexibility is associated with increased naturalistic negative affectivity and self-reported stress. In addition, naturalistic negative affectivity mediated the association between family expressiveness and children&# 39;s cognitive flexibility. The authors used a structural equation model to examine the mediation model hypothesis, and the results confirmed the mediating roles of naturalistic negative affectivity and self-reported stress between <b>family</b> <b>environments</b> and the cognitive flexibility of Chinese children. These findings indicate the importance of reducing stress and negative emotional state for improving cognitive functions in children of low socioeconomic status...|$|R
5000|$|Genes and environments {{operating}} in tandem (interacting) {{were required to}} produce significant antisocial behavior, while neither was powerful enough to produce it independent of the other.

50|$|Parents and <b>family</b> <b>environments</b> {{can play}} a {{protective}} role against the risk of educational disadvantage. In fact, the home and <b>family</b> <b>environments</b> have {{the greatest impact on}} whether or not a child is ready to begin school (Pivik, 2012). For example, parents have many roles in preparing children for kindergarten, including providing the child with proper nutrition, health care, and opportunity for growth. Families can also act as advocates, teachers, and providers for their children.|$|R
5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing {{to the absence of}} family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the <b>family</b> <b>environment.</b> Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses, including education. Long concerned that the Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the Malian and Moroccan music preferred by younger people, in 2014, she created a Mauritanian Music Festival.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Krøyer started Chez Moi, {{a series}} of watercolours of Marie and their {{daughter}} Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen in a style inspired by the Art Nouveau approach adopted by Carl Larsson whom Krøyer probably met during his time in Paris. Larsson had started painting in watercolours while {{a member of the}} Grez-sur-Loing artists' colony in France. On returning to Sweden, he had begun {{a series of}} pictures of family life with his wife and children in Sundborn in the mid-1890s, publishing it as Ett hem (A home) in 1899. Krøyer's paintings display no signs of disturbance or frustration but leave an impression of a happy <b>family</b> <b>environment,</b> no doubt in accordance with Krøyer's own desires. He exhibited the three from Skagen in 1889 at Den Frie – the exhibition of the artists' association that had been formed in 1891 with Krøyer's support – under the collective title Fra mit Skagenshjem (From my Skagen Home).|$|E
25|$|Critics {{also argued}} that Rind et al.'s {{statistical}} approach for controlling for <b>family</b> <b>environment</b> {{as a cause of}} maladjustment was conceptually and methodologically invalid. Spiegel stated that inferring the source of maladjustment from analyzing the shared variance between CSA and <b>family</b> <b>environment</b> does not answer the question of which variable explains maladjustment better; the authors answered that this statement shows a misunderstanding of the statistical procedure used their meta-analysis. Dallam, however, addressed the topic of several prior studies having found statistically significant relations between CSA and maladjustment even after controlling for <b>family</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

The past studies about the <b>family</b> learning <b>environment</b> almost all concerned about the impact on children, especially on children’s growth (Anders et al., 2012; Becker, 2011; Foster et al., 2005). However, in this study, the results showed that the <b>family</b> learning <b>environment</b> also have a certain influence on parents’ career development.|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has found that <b>family</b> <b>environments</b> high in expressed emotion, in particular emotional overinvolvement, are beneficial to the clinical outcome of patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Aim: This study aims to investigate the relationship between expressed emotion, carer burden and carer wellbeing. Method: A total of 280 carers of a relative with BPD were administered the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD - Carer Version, The Family Questionnaire, Burden Assessment Scale and Mental Health Inventory. Results: Carers reported <b>family</b> <b>environments</b> high in expressed emotion, particularly criticism (82. 9 % of carers) and emotional overinvolvement (69. 6 %). Elevated emotional overinvolvement was correlated with higher burden and mental health problems. Conclusions: Elevated criticism and emotional overinvolvement in <b>family</b> <b>environments</b> represent a dynamic involving high conflict, anxious concern, overprotection and emotional closeness. The findings suggest that carers may benefit from intervention and support options considering the challenged interpersonal dynamic, burden and impaired carer wellbeing reported in this study...|$|R
40|$|Aims to {{understand}} more about the prevalence {{of different types of}} <b>family</b> <b>environments</b> in society and to explore the influence of these environments on different child outcomes. Introduction Families are the mainstay of safety and support for children. While most children live in safe and supportive environments, governments are aware that too many children are becoming known to child protection services. This has led to a shift in thinking away from solely concentrating on responding to ‘risk of harm’ reports towards a broader public health approach to protecting all of Australia’s children, reducing the likelihood of children coming to the attention of statutory authorities. This report aims {{to understand}} more about the prevalence of different types of <b>family</b> <b>environments</b> in society and to explore the influence of these environments on different child outcomes. Using data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, we used latent class cluster analysis to identify different <b>family</b> <b>environments</b> and analysed the associations between these environments and particular child outcomes...|$|R

25|$|The {{relative}} importance of nature versus environment in determining the level of extraversion is controversial and the focus of many studies.

30|$|The strongest {{correlation}} {{was between the}} <b>family</b> learning <b>environment</b> indicator and the workplace learning environment indicator (rho = . 783, p < . 01). The <b>family</b> learning <b>environment</b> indicator was also significantly correlated with the museum learning environment indicator (rho = . 641, p < . 01) (Table 4). In consequence, these three specific sub-level indicators of <b>family</b> learning <b>environment</b> were all significantly correlated with those three sub-level indicators of workplace learning environment (see in Table 6). Also, family digital devices (FamDig) (rho = . 714, p < . 01), family book procession (FamBook) (rho = . 758, p < . 01) and satisfaction with <b>family</b> learning <b>environment</b> (FamSat)(rho = . 560, p < . 01) were strongly correlated with utilization of the museum for learning(UtilMus).|$|R

A significant body of evidence suggests that those people who work long and unsocial hours spend less quality time with their families and friends and that most Australian families are suffering time pressure resulting from their work. An emerging body of international research shows that these long and atypical working patterns are associated with dysfunctional <b>family</b> <b>environments,</b> including: a) Negative health outcomes for those working these times, particularly if they are parents; b) Strained family relationships; c) Parenting marked by anger, inconsistency and ineffectiveness; And, critically, both long/atypical hours and dysfunctional <b>family</b> <b>environments</b> are associated with d) Reduced child wellbeing...|$|R

25|$|The {{official}} {{formal language}} used by governmental institutions, print, news, universities/schools, courts, theater {{and in any}} kind of written form is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, while the spoken language is Zürich German (Züritüütsch), one of the several more or less distinguishable, but mutually intelligible Swiss German dialects of Switzerland with roots in the medieval Alemannic German dialect groups. However, because of Zürich's national importance, and therefore its existing high fluctuation, one can hear all kinds of Swiss German dialects spoken by its inhabitants and commuters. As of the December 2010 census, 69.3% of the population speaks diglossic Swiss German/Swiss Standard German as their mother-tongue at home. Some 22.7% of inhabitants speak Standard German in their <b>family</b> <b>environment</b> ("at home"). Dramatically increasing, according to the last census in 2000, 8.8% now speak English. Italian follows behind at 7.1% of the population, then French at 4.5%. Other languages spoken here include Croatian and Serbian (4.1%), Spanish (3.9%), Portuguese (3.1%), and Albanian (2.3%). (Multiple choices were possible.) Thus 20% of the population speak two or more languages at home.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} question posed about congenital amusia {{is if it}} has a genetic origin. A study was conducted to test for the presence of a genetic origin by studying family aggregation of congenital amusia. Family members of amusics were studied, as well as family members of a control group. The study yielded interesting results. Amusia cannot be attributed solely to <b>family</b> <b>environment</b> due to the presence of at least one unaffected sibling in each tested family in the amusic group. Also, music was found to be present to a lesser extent, but not absent, in the environment of the amusic subjects than in that of the musically intact control group. This supports the claim that the occurrence of congenital amusia cannot be explained by a lack of environmental stimulation. Another interesting finding was that the next generation, or the offspring of those with congenital amusia, was more musical. A reason for this might be that musical stimulation for the offspring probably started early in life when their brains were more plastic.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s the {{residential}} {{part of the}} house was modified to accommodate youth with social difficulties that may face social problems for multiple reasons. Since then {{the main part of the}} building has served as a home generally for youth, with the exception for a short lived home for African migrant families. The home opened its doors for the youth in 1981, on the initiative of the founder Adrijan Cachia (OFM). During its mission as a home over 600 youth (between 10 and 13 years) residents have received temporal stay at the villa and admittance was irrelevant to religious belief of the clients. It was administered by two Roman Catholic priests and a number of secular workers. Cachia was the first director of the home and was later succeeded by Father P. Eddie Pace (OFM), and last was Father John Abela. The youth were provided with a bedroom (alone or shared) and access to most of the house as common space. The house provided for the needs of the residents, such as a better alternative in the lack of <b>family</b> <b>environment</b> and a social worker as a social reference support. This aimed to prepare the youth for independent living. More government funds, for works and service, were given in 1994. On 9 January (1998) Giacomo Bini, the Minister General of the OFM, was received by Pace at the building for breakfast.|$|E
