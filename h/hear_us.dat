25|$|A {{collection}} of short stories, <b>Hear</b> <b>Us,</b> O Lord from Heaven Thy Dwelling Place (1961), was published after Lowry's death. The scholar and poet Earle Birney edited Selected Poems of Malcolm Lowry (1962). He also collaborated with Lowry's widow in editing the novella Lunar Caustic (1968) for re-publication. It is a conflation of several earlier pieces concerned with Bellevue Hospital, which Lowry {{was in the process}} of rewriting as a complete novel. With Douglas Day, Lowry's first biographer, Lowry's widow also completed and edited the novels Dark as the Grave Wherein my Friend Is Laid (1968) and October Ferry to Gabriola (1970) from Lowry's manuscripts.|$|E

The recitatives are marked adagio in E-flat major, while the interspersed litany is presented dramatically (allegro in C minor).

500|$|While {{the event}} is {{considered}} a memorable one by several critics, they also agree {{that it was not}} one of the Stones' best performances, and the guitars played during the concert were out of tune. In a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Keith Richards evaluated their performance, [...] "We played pretty bad until near the end, because we hadn't played for years ... Nobody minded, because they just wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>us</b> play again." [...] The Stones' portion of concert was filmed by Granada Television and broadcast that September. It has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray. In April 2013, the band announced their intention to play two return concerts on 6 and 13 July, although the performances were not free.|$|E

So {{whether it was a}} Hanukkah album or a Kwanzaa album, it didn't make a difference, because the chemistry is there." [...] RuPaul and Visage interpreted Christmas songs as examples of camp while still holding a clear message; RuPaul explained, [...] "Even the camp stuff still holds the true meaning of Christmas, the sweetness and the love about another year gone by." [...] Rhino executive promoted the album through the following line: [...] "Celebrate Christmas with classic holiday songs and camp, RuPaul style!" ...|$|E

500|$|Finding the Persian fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, the Persians {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who <b>hear</b> <b>us,</b> understand what I say, for by no means will the Persians understand anything I charge you with when we join battle; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the Ionians, unbeknownst to the Persians, to fight for the Allies (or at least not to fight against them); or, if the message became known to the Persians, to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Lukather {{received}} {{an invitation to}} tour Japan with fellow guitarist Larry Carlton after Japanese promoters requested that Carlton's annual tours each {{be different from the}} last. Lukather and Carlton exchanged some recorded material and decided that a collaboration would be interesting. Lukather was flattered by the invitation to tour with Carlton, citing him as his favorite guitarist. Lukather speaks highly of their stage efforts, although the two were admittedly outside their normal realm of work. He stated in an interview that [...] "you can <b>hear</b> <b>us</b> having fun on the record—you can hear the smiles on our faces." [...] After several shows, the duo realized that they should record their collaboration even if just for their own use. Guitarist and producer Steve Vai heard one of the subsequent recordings and expressed interest in releasing it under his Favored Nations label, also home to such artists as Eric Johnson and Dweezil Zappa. Vai and Lukather mixed and produced the recording, which {{is said to be a}} mixture of jazz, blues, and fusion music. The resulting album, , won a 2001 Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Album reviewers described Lukather as having a heavier style than Carlton. Lukather and Carlton later did an international tour in support of the album.|$|E
500|$|Spin writer Marc Hogan {{wrote that}} [...] "Scream & Shout" [...] has {{similarities}} to Azealia Banks' song [...] "212" [...] (2011), and compared [...] "Scream & Shout"s background vocals {{to those of}} [...] "Are We All We Are" [...] (2012) by P!nk. Keith Caulfield of Billboard said that the song [...] "features a very different look for Spears, whose voice is roboticized to a nearly unrecognizable degree." [...] After the song was leaked, a reviewer for Idolator said, [...] "we're pleased to report that it's pretty goodand slightly kooky," [...] and that the lyrics, [...] "When you <b>hear</b> <b>us</b> in the club / You're gonna turn this shit up" [...] are [...] "probably accurate". Idolator also praised {{the use of the}} [...] "It's Britney, bitch" [...] line. Rebecca Macatee of E! Online wrote that the track is [...] "clubby, catchy, cool", and compared Spears' vocals to those of Madonna, and wrote about the use of pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune on the song. Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that [...] "the digital effects are seamless and the use of modulations of Britney Spears' voice to build the chorus sounds perfectly natural in this context", and that, [...] "the spacey, free form bridge is beautiful despite will.i.am's singing talent limitations." [...] A Rap-Up reviewer noted the use of Auto-Tune on will.i.am's vocals only.|$|E
