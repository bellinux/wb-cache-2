A lehr or annealing oven was used to anneal the product. A typical 20th-century lehr was a large conveyor inside a long oven. The newly made glass gradually moved from the hot <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lehr</b> to its opposite end, which was at room temperature. The glass would then be cut into the desired window glass size, placed in a box, and moved to inventory. [...] It is not known if (or when) the lehrs at the Hartford City plant had conveyors.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{numerical}} techniques for one-way coupling of CFD and Population Balance Equations (PBE) {{based on the}} incompressible flow solver FeatFlow which is extended with a) Chien’s Low-Reynolds number k − ε turbulence model [4], b) breakage kernel model <b>of</b> <b>Lehr</b> et al. [34, 35], c) coalescence kernel model <b>of</b> <b>Lehr</b> et al. [34]. The presented implementation ensures a strictly conservative treatment of sink and source terms – arising due to breakage and/or coalescence – which is enforced even for geometric discretization of the internal coordinate. Direct enforcement of the aforementioned property is achieved by formulating the population balance equation with respect to class holdups. The validation of our implementation which covers {{a wide range of}} computational and experimental problems enables us to proceed into a three dimensional application for a turbulent pipe flow. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight the influence of different formulations of the novel theoretical breakage [29] and coalescence models on the equilibrium distribution of the population, to reveal some misinterpretations in the literature and, ultimately, to propose an implementation strategy for the three-dimensional one-way coupled CFD-PBE model. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{partnership}} with Ford/Visteon, Sandia National Laboratories {{began work on}} design and implementation of improved end-to-end control for float glass production, under DOE Office of Industrial Technology sponsorship. The first task undertaken was to provide an intelligent control for the annealing lehr, both for optimum usage of sensors and for the ability to report digitally the state <b>of</b> the <b>lehr</b> to an end-to-end control system. The heat transfer simulation <b>of</b> the <b>lehr</b> enclosure for that purpose is described here. This includes a closed-form solution for the infinitely wide glass ribbon, which allow robust computations of the thermal profile and inverses of this function for controls use. This also allows useful initial temperature estimates for the case with counterflow in the lehr ducts, which should greatly simplify and speed the convergence of more detailed models in which the glass participates in the radiative exchanges. This is supplemented by software to compute radiative viewfactors <b>of</b> <b>lehr</b> elements for use in finite-width versions of the simulation. A brief discussion of how stresses could be computed from such a thermal solution is given, but not implemented in software...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a knowledge-based simulation sys-tem {{for a glass}} annealing process.

Attempts to sim-ulate the behavior <b>of</b> the <b>lehr</b> using conventional methods have not been successful due to the size and complexity <b>of</b> the <b>lehr.</b> Our knowledge-based approach is capable of both simulating the glass temperature curve in an annealing lehr and planning the necessary lehr control settings to achieve a desired curve. It consists of two cooperating expert systems, one rule-based and the other frame-based. The system also includes a high-bandwidth graphics display which allows op-erators to interactively test control-setting changes and ask for the control settings which meet desired specifications.

50|$|The Renke and Wubke Renken House, {{also known}} as the R.G. Renken Estate, is a {{historic}} residential building located in Parkersburg, Iowa, United States. The two-story, brick, Italianate style house was designed by F.M. Ellis and completed in 1884. The wrap-around porch, added in 1901, is influenced by the emerging Queen Anne style. The house was built for R.G. Renken, a native <b>of</b> <b>Lehr,</b> Germany who emigrated to the United States in 1870 and settled in Parkersburg the following year. He and his brother-in-law Fritz Tammen became partners in a successful general merchandise and clothing store named Renken and Tammen. Later on Renken became involved in banking and with Charles Wolf, whose house is also on the National Register, managed the community's finances. He also held the positions of school board treasurer and town recorder. Renken contributed $10,000 in 1898 to build the community's first electric power plant, Parkersburg Electric Light & Power Company. He served as one of the power plant's directors. The house was listed to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.|$|R

We say a real number is (k, b) -automatic if its fractional part has a base-b expansion that forms a k-automatic sequence, and we denote the set of all such numbers as L(k,b). Lehr (Theoret. Comput. Sci. 108 (1993) 385 – 391) proved that L(k, b) forms a vector space over Q. In this paper we give a shortened version of the proof <b>of</b> <b>Lehr's</b> result and, answering a question of Bach, show that the dimension of the vector space L(k, b) is infinite. We also give an example of a transcendental number such that all of its positive powers are automatic. The proof requires examining the coefficient of Xn in the formal power series (X + X 2 + X 4 + X 8 + …) r. Along the way we are led to examine several sequences of independent combinatorial interest. Finally, solving an open problem, we show that the automatic reals are not closed under (1) product; (2) squaring; and (3) reciprocal...|$|R
