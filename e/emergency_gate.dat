The band had also begun working on their 12th full-length album in late 2007/early 2008 and began recording in July 2008. Recording for the album, dubbed Hordes of Chaos, was wrapped up in late August, with the album being released in January 2009. On 23 January 2009, the band began their [...] "Chaos Over Europe" [...] tour in Tilburg (the Netherlands) with Caliban, Eluveitie and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Gate</b> as other acts. In April 2009, the band embarked on a North American headlining tour, co-headlined by Exodus, and featuring Belphegor, Warbringer, and Epicurean. In late 2009, Reil was forced to sit out some tour dates due to personal issues, with Marco Minnemann temporarily taking his place.|$|E

40|$|Failures of barrages or {{regulators}} {{or parts}} of them may be expected when excessive scour patterns are observed downstream of such structures. Severe and excessive scour may be largely due to unsymmetric operation of gates especially when a multi-vents barrages or regulator is being considered. Previous investigations proved that the scour patterns downstream hydraulic structures are functions of the bottom velocities among other relevant factors such as Froude number, operation of gates, …. etc. In this paper, {{the results of an}} experimental investigation on the effect of operations of gates of mutli-vents regulator on the pattern of bottom velocity (velocity near bed) are presented. The experimental program was carried under submeregd flow conditions. Symmetric and asymmetric operation of main <b>gates,</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>gates</b> and mixed operation of main and <b>emergency</b> <b>gates</b> are considered. An electromagetic flow meter is used to measure the velocity components (in x and y directions) near bed at a predefined mesh over both rigid and movable beds. The pattern of the velocity vectors for each run is plotted to indicate the relative magintude and direction of the bottom velocity, which in turn, could be used to predict the pattern of scour downstream of rigid bed of the multi-vents regulator. It is observed that the velocity pattern {{is a function of the}} operation of gates, type of <b>gates</b> (main or <b>emergency),</b> Froude number at the vena contracta, and submergence ratio. The qualitative and quantitative effects of all these parameters on the bottom velocity are presented in the present research paper...|$|R

Severe and excessive scour may be largely due to unsymmetric operation of gates especially when a multi-vents barrage or regulator is being considered. Previous investigations proved that the scour patterns downstream hydraulic structures are functions of the bottom velocities among other relevant factors such as Froude number, operation of gates, …. etc. In this paper, {{the results of an}} experimental investigation on the effects of operations of gates of mutlivents regulators on scour pattern are presented.

Two interactive instructional models are designed for this laboratory. The first is a model of a concrete dam. The dam is equipped with one bottom outlet, a hydraulic power plant and an <b>emergency</b> spillway crest <b>gate.</b> The discharge part of the model is equipped with a downflow baffle for regulating the tailwater level and a measuring weir enabling the flow rate to be measured at the discharge point from the model. The total capacity of the model is 10 l/s. The second model is a model of a weir structure. The weir structure consists of a controlled segment sluice gate weir composed of three sections. The model includes a one-nave lock chamber and hydraulic power plant. The tailwater level can also be regulated using a downflow baffle. The total capacity of this model is 20 l/s. The models can be used for teaching the subjects of hydraulics, hydrology and hydro-technical structures.

40|$|Danielle Sawyer, Kathryn <b>Gates</b> <b>Emergency</b> and Critical Care Department, Advanced Critical Care and Emergency Specialty Services, Culver City, CA, USA Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe a case of severe lamotrigine toxicosis in a dog, which was successfully treated using minimal medical interventions. Case summary: A 7 -month-old male, intact, Labrador mix was evaluated because of acute onset of vomiting, rigidity, and dull mentation after ingesting lamotrigine tablets. The estimated oral dose that had been ingested was 278 mg/kg (611. 6 mg/lb). Physical examination was unremarkable other than abnormalities noted in the cardiovascular and neurological systems. Neurological examination revealed dull mentation, vertical nystagmus, four-legged extensor limb rigidity, and alligator rolling. Cardiovascular examination revealed pale pink mucous membranes and multifocal ventricular tachycardia. Intravenous (IV) fluids were started at three times maintenance (180 mL/kg/day). Methocarbamol (100 mg/kg [220 mg/lb], rectally) and lidocaine (2  mg/kg [4. 4  mg/lb, IV]) were administered. Twenty-four and seventy-two hours after presentation, the dog was clinically normal with no ventricular tachycardia being noted. Conclusion: Lamotrigine (6 -[2, 3 -dichlorophenyl]- 1, 2, 4 -triazine- 3, 5 -diamine) is an anticonvulsant medication used in humans, which inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels. The clinical success of this case suggests that administration of only methocarbamol for the neurologic effects and lidocaine for the arrhythmias, as well as supportive IV fluid therapy, could be a successful treatment strategy for dogs, even with severe lamotrigine toxicosis.

40|$|Proceedings of the 1989 Georgia Water Resources Conference, May 16 - 17, 1989, Athens, Georgia. Optimal {{scheduling}} of hydropower {{operations is}} a process involving a plethora of complicating factors. On any given day, reservoir operators must skillfully balance upcoming inflow forecasts against available storage, turbine power, and discharge capacities to maximize energy generation. Hydropower is most valuable during the day's "peak" generation period and, therefore, hydro-plants must generate {{as much energy as}} possible during the peak hours. Ideally, hydropower turbines should operate at best efficiency, where a given release volume generates the most energy. However, at times of high flows, it pays to abandon best efficiency operation and "run" at full gate. During off-peak hours, energy is normally produced at a required minimum level except when peak generation cannot maintain desirable reservoir levels. During such occasions, off-peak generation should be invoked as much as necessary. At times of extremely high flows, <b>emergency</b> flood <b>gates</b> may have to be considered, while during extreme droughts, power generation may have to cease. This paper discusses a new control method for the optimal short-term scheduling of hydropower systems. The method is based on a problem formulation which allows the application of stochastic control techniques. Such techniques have successfully been employed in long-term reservoir control (see, for instance, Wasimi and Kitanidis [1983], Marino and Loaiciga [1985], Georgakakos and Marks [1987], and Georgakakos [1989 a, b]), while their application to short-term scheduling problems is at an early stage (see, Trezos and Yeh [1987]). The new model will be used for the day-to-day operations scheduling of the Lloyd Shoals hydroelectric project of Georgia Power Company. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that usage of this control model will considerably enhance hydropower generation. Detailed descriptions of the new model, the simulation analysis, and the associated computer software are provided in Georgakakos [1989 c,d]. Sponsored by U. S.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{synthesis}} of diverse observations of the first recorded eruption of Nabro volcano, Eritrea, which began on 12 June 2011. While no monitoring of the volcano was in effect at the time, it has been possible to reconstruct the nature and evolution of the eruption through analysis of re- gional seismological and infrasound data and satellite remote sensing data, supplemented by petrological analysis of erupted products and brief field surveys. The event is notable for the comparative rarity of recorded historical eruptions {{in the region and}} of caldera systems in general, for the prodi- gious quantity of SO 2 emitted into the atmosphere and the significant human impacts that ensued notwithstanding the low population density of the Afar region. It is also relevant in understanding the broader magmatic and tectonic signifi- cance of the volcanic massif of which Nabro forms a part and which strikes obliquely to the principal rifting directions in the Red Sea and northern Afar. The whole-rock compositions of Editorial responsibility: G. Giordano the erupted lavas and tephra range from trachybasaltic to trachybasaltic andesite, and crystal-hosted melt inclusions contain up to 3, 000 ppm of sulphur by weight. The eruption was preceded by significant seismicity, detected by regional networks of sensors and accompanied by sustained tremor. Substantial infrasound was recorded at distances of hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the vent, beginning {{at the onset of the}} eruption and continuing for weeks. Analysis of ground deformation suggests the eruption was fed by a shal- low, NW–SE-trending dike, which is consistent with field and satellite observations of vent distributions.
