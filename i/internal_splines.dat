50|$|The old {{method of}} gear cutting is {{mounting}} a gear blank in a shaper {{and using a}} tool shaped in {{the profile of the}} tooth to be cut. This method also works for cutting <b>internal</b> <b>splines.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of splines, {{internal}} and external. External splines may be broached, shaped (for example on a gear shaping machine), milled, hobbed, rolled, ground or extruded. There are fewer methods available for manufacturing <b>internal</b> <b>splines</b> due to accessibility restrictions. Methods include those listed above with the exception of hobbing (no access). Often, with <b>internal</b> <b>splines,</b> the splined portion of the part may not have a through-hole, which precludes use of a pull / push broach or extrusion-type method. Also, if the part is small {{it may be difficult to}} fit a milling or grinding tool into the area where the splines are machined.|$|E
40|$|Broaches {{are used}} for {{machining}} either internal or external surface (i. e. sizing of holds and cutting of serrations, straight or helical planes, gun rifling and key ways). In this work a broach cutting tool is design to perform <b>internal</b> <b>splines</b> of synch shuttle transmission for flange coupling. Broaching is a machining process in which a cutting tool, having multiple transverse cutting edges, is pushed or pulled through a hole or surface to remove metal by axial method. It is capable of production rates as much as 25 times faster than any traditional metal removing methods In this work a broach cutting tool is design to perform <b>internal</b> <b>splines</b> on sleeve main shaft. A sophisticated ANSYS 11 (FEM) package shall be {{used to analyze the}} displacements and stresses present in broach cutting tool. Further the solid model can be used to perform the finite element analysis which would help in knowing the characteristic of the broach tool under various cutting loads...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A tubular shafts {{have been}} {{considered}} for weight reduction and high quality in the automobile industry. However, {{in the case of}} long and thin tubular shafts, {{it is very difficult to}} form an <b>internal</b> <b>spline</b> under a cold extrusion process due to folding and buckling. In this study, multi-stage forming is applied to form precise teeth shape in a long and thin tubular shaft. The effects of die diameter and thickness of the material are investigated and analyzed to determine the number of processes based on a FE simulation. Extrusion experiments have been performed to verify the results obtained in the FE simulation. It is confirmed through these tests that a long spline shaft with high dimensional accuracy and improved mechanical properties is formed...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} 3 D {{method for}} colonic polyp segmentation was developed {{based on previous}} 2 D method. The method is based on combination of 3 D knowledge-guided intensity adjustment, fuzzy clustering, and dynamic deformable surfaces. After intensity adjustment and fuzzy clustering, a deformable surface is employed to locate the polyp boundaries. The surface is also dynamically maintained to preserve the resolution and topology. The deformable surface is operated on a sub-volume of the data set and driven by image forces, balloon forces and <b>internal</b> <b>spline</b> forces. Compared to previous 2 D method, the improved method produces much smoother polyp boundaries, and 3 D features {{can be derived from}} the segmentation, such as 3 D aspect ratio, curvatures, and polyp wall thickness etc. The computer segmentations were validated with manual segmentations. Preliminary results showed that the average volume overlap percentage among 25 polyp detections was 80. 6 %...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} “Failure Analysis of <b>Internal</b> <b>splines</b> in Torsion Shaft” of “TPE 331 - 5 - 252 D - GARRET ENGINE” {{which is used}} in Dornier aircraft. Garret Engine {{is a type of}} air {{breathing}} engine. It comes under the category of Turboprop engines of Gas turbine engine. As separate shafts are used for propeller and turbine, this aids them to rotate at different RPM. A torsion shaft is used to transmit the torque from main shaft to propeller shaft. Torsion shaft is used to give a deflection which is also used to measure the torque of the engine. This torsion shaft is internally connected with the main power transmission shaft and its other end is coupled to a coupler shaft with engagement of its <b>internal</b> <b>splines</b> to the external splines of coupler shaft. Further this coupler connects to the gearing system and transmits power to the propeller shaft. Due to Continues variable load over <b>internal</b> <b>splines,</b> it is subjected to high rate of wear and tear. This problem can be rectified by Failure Mode Analysis Method, in which heat treatment process of torsion shaft is being carried out. Two test pieces are heat treated separately at different temperatures of 5800 C and 5400 C at variable time durations. Tuffriding which is a Liquid nitriding process is done with this two test pieces and results are analyzed. The hardness of the material is increased to desired values and its life time is also increased which overcomes the problem...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{harmonic}} transmissions {{are relatively}} {{new kind of}} drives having several unusual features. For example, they can provide reduction ratio up to 500 : 1 in one stage, have very small teeth module compared to conventional drives and {{very large number of}} teeth (up to 1000) on a flexible gear. If for conventional drives manufacturing methods are well-developed, fabrication of large size harmonic drives presents a challenge. For example, how to fabricate a thin shell of 1. 7 m in diameter and wall thickness of 30 mm having high precision external teeth at one end and <b>internal</b> <b>splines</b> at the other end? It is so flexible that conventional fabrication methods become unsuitable. In this paper special fabrication methods are discussed {{that can be used for}} manufacturing of large size harmonic drive components. They include electro-slag welding and refining, the use of special expandable devices to locate and hold a flexible gear, welding peripheral parts of disks with wear resistant materials with subsequent machining and others. These fabrication methods proved to be effective and harmonic drives built with the use of these innovative technologies have been installed on heavy metallurgical equipment and successfully tested...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 83 - 85) Today???s Mechanical Engineering {{field is}} growing rapidly in designing techniques to manufacture Splines and Gears. Over the decades, numerous methods and manufacturing processes {{have been used}} in making the various kinds of Splines based on various criteria, including applications, reliability, life time, processing time and manufacturing cost. This thesis is also carried out with the same notion of experimenting to manufacture an External Involute Spline cutting tool using state-of-art CAD/CAM package and current trend CNC machines like Brother HS- 70 A Wire Electrical Discharge Machine and HAAS VF- 2 Vertical Milling Machine. This thesis is divided into two distinct phases: (1) analysis phase and (2) manufacturing phase. The analysis phase is dedicated to the study and simulation of involute splines, while the manufacturing phase covers the actual manufacturing process. This thesis starts with the extensive study of splines and the two different kinds of splines; a) Internal Involute splines and b) External Involute splines. The primary objective is to design the internal involute spline in Dassault Systems??? SolidWorks??. This entire design process is to be automated with embedding Microsoft EXCEL Spreadsheet with SolidWorks. Using this EXCEL spreadsheet, spline design parameters iterations are carried out in SolidWorks with the help of design tables. Based on the calculations made in EXCEL Spreadsheets and CAD design in SolidWorks, CNC machining parameters are defined in DP Technology???s CAM package ESPRIT and the machining process as well as tool/insert design is simulated. The main objective is to manufacture a spline cutting tool using Wire EDM machining process. For this Solid Carbide Machine Inserts are chosen as a cutting tool which cuts the external splines. Once the machine insert was manufactured, it was tested on 6061 Aluminum test specimen and successfully cut on 4340 Steel Drive shaft on the CNC Milling machine. These external splines are the inverse of the Involute splines on the drive shaft hub of the FSAE Formula one car. It can be concluded that, the involute spline cutting tool was successfully manufactured and tested by cutting external involute splines on drive shaft which match with <b>internal</b> <b>splines</b> on drive hub...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Segmenting {{objects or}} {{internal}} structures from volumetric images has found many applications in X-ray computer tomography. Owing to the data-intensive {{nature of these}} applications, increasing computational efficiency becomes a primary concern for the design and development of 3 D object segmentation methods. We propose an efficient deformable model with multiple templates to segment 3 D vessel objects in X-ray tomographic images of wood. In our approach, an automatic vessel segmentation method {{is applied to the}} first image of the 3 D sequence to obtain the initial template for object contours. A deformable energy minimization concept is applied, involving a balance between <b>internal</b> forces from <b>spline</b> contour stretching and bending and external forces from salient image features. The template then interacts with the adjacent frame and deforms iteratively toward the local target, which can be preserved as the input for the next frame in the sequence. This process is repeated for consecutive frames until the object leaves the field of view or a new object emerges. The deformable model is fast and accurate in tracking small object variation in a continuous space. However in our application, vessel diameters and orientations in most hardwoods can vary considerably along the longitudinal axis i. e. scanning direction. This may result in large variations in vessel shape and size from frame to frame, making it difficult to devise appropriate continuity constraints fo...|$|R
