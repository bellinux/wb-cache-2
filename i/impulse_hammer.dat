40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} characterize the vibro-acoustic behavior of composite fuselage structures developed using embedded viscoelastic damping treatments; it was assessed {{within the framework of}} a national research project named A. R. C. A where the Department of Aerospace En-gineering of the University of Naples (ITALY) acted as developer of experimental and numerical damping characterization procedures. The experimental tests were performed in a climatic room in order to simulate a cruise flight temperature level for commercial transport aircraft. The real influ-ence of viscoelastic materials on the damping of composite structures is currently unknown. For this reason experimental acquisitions and vibrational data analyses have been performed on both damped (with embedded viscoelastic damping treatments) and untreated composite fuselage skin coupon. The tests have been performed at temperatures of - 35 °C for no-treated composite fuselage structure, and 15 °C, - 20 °C, - 25 °C and - 35 °C for treated composite fuselage structure. The extrac-tion of the parameters useful to characterize the damping behavior was carried out by a modified Impulse Response Decay Method (IRDM). The first analysis step consisted in exciting the struc-ture by means of a mechanical impulse. Within the scientific literature, the commonly employed excitation systems are <b>impulse</b> <b>Hammers</b> or Shaker systems; the first one excites the structure gen-erally only up to 1000 Hz while the second, because directly connected to the structure, influences its structural behavior. Within this activity, an innovative excitation system has been used, which has been conceived and manufactured by the authors. It is able to excite the structure up to 3000 ÷ 3500 Hz without any influence on the structural behavior since it generates an impulse signal that approaches to the Dirac signal; for these reasons it allows a direct measurement of Impulse Re-sponse Function (time history) [3]. The best temperature interval for the treated composite fuselage skin coupon was evaluated, and the different structural behaviors for both composite fuselage struc-ture (treated and untreated) were characterized. Moreover, the high number of tests performed per-mitted to evaluate the confidence interval of the damping estimations and to validate the IRDM modified method by statistical analysis. Obtained results show that composite fuselage structures realized with embedded viscoelastic damping treatments can be utilized to reduce the transmitted vibration (main source of interior structure borne noise) and consequently to increase passengers comfort...|$|R

A desire to investigate the causal agents of these injuries in athletes has led to the development and use of several devices that track head impacts as well as improving helmet technology to protect players from said impacts. In order to determine which devices are able to best measure head impacts, a Hybrid III headform was used to quantify the accuracy for translational and angular accelerations. Testing was performed by means of administering impacts to a helmet on the headform, with each device mounted according to manufacturer instruction, using an <b>impulse</b> <b>hammer.</b> For peak translational acceleration, the worst locational root-mean-square error for a head mounted device was 74. 68 % while the worst for a helmet mounted device was 297. 62 %.

However, very few attempts have been made toward experimental investigations compared with numerical simulations, especially for mechanisms and manipulators with multiple flexible links. This paper presents an experimental study on active vibration control of a moving 3 -PRR parallel manipulator with three flexible intermediate links with bonded lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuators and sensors. First, experimental modal tests are conducted with an <b>impulse</b> force <b>hammer</b> and an accelerometer to identify structural vibration mode shapes and natural frequencies of the flexible manipulator. These modal test results are used to provide guidance for the determination of the location of PZT transducers and the design of an active vibration controller. Then, a strain rate feedback (SRF) controller is designed in modal space. A state-space model is formulated with the control input voltage applied to PZT actuators, and output generated voltage from PZT sensors. The design of an optimal active vibration controller is addressed based on SRF. Furthermore, to suppress the noise introduced through the differentiation of the strain signal, a second-order auxiliary compensator is introduced to the SRF controller. The design of the SRF controller and the noise attenuation compensator is addressed utilizing vibration theories. Finally, active vibration control experiments are implemented to demonstrate that the proposed active vibration control strategy is effective. Power spectral density plots of vibrations illustrate that the structural vibration of flexible links is suppressed effectively when the proposed SRF vibration control strategy is employed...|$|R

Following soft tissue removal, a 12 cm diaphyseal section was isolated, marrow removed using a water jet and the bones dried at 25 °C for 1 week. Bone volume was determined by water displacement, and mass by weighing. Bones were held in a vice at one end in a consistent manner and vibrated either using a miniature vibration motor (continuous vibration approach) or a miniature electronic <b>hammer</b> (<b>impulse</b> vibration approach).

NBG– 18 {{graphite}} {{is developed}} by SGL Carbon for the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Company (PBMR), {{and is used}} as the preferred material for the internal graphite core structures of a high–temperature gas–cooled nuclear reactor (HTR). The NBG– 18 graphite is manufactured using pitch coke, and is vibrationally molded. To assess the structural behaviour of graphite many destructive techniques have been performed in the past. Though the destructive techniques are easy {{and in some cases}} relative inexpensive to perform, these methods lead to waste material and require cumbersome time consuming sample preparations. To overcome this problem numerous non–destructive testing techniques are available such as sonic resonance, resonant inspection, ultrasonic testing, low and multifrequency Eddy current analysis, acoustic emission and impulse excitation techniques. The <b>Hammer</b> <b>Impulse</b> Excitation technique was used as a method in predicting the fatigue life of NBG– 18 graphite by focussing on the application of modal frequency analysis of determined natural frequencies. Moreover, the typical fatigue characteristics of NBG– 18 graphite were determined across a comprehensive set of load ranges.

An array of accelerometers {{is attached to the}} concrete structure and an impact is made on the concrete surface using a small <b>impulse</b> <b>hammer.</b> A reflection wave is generated from the crack position if a crack exists. Conventional methods for estimating the reflection point might seem to be useful for the detection of cracks. Because the concrete structure is elastic, however, it has three wave-propagation modes: the surface-wave mode, the primary-wave mode, and the secondary-wave mode. We cannot estimate the position using conventional methods because the necessary primary-wave mode is weaker than the surface-wave mode. To estimate the crack position precisely, we have already proposed two methods for eliminating the surface-wave and side-wall reflections. However, elimination using those methods was insufficient because they sometimes indicated a peak at a position where no crack existed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new method for estimating the surface wave more precisely to suppress such peaks. Some experiments were carried out, yielding better results...|$|E

Methods for modal {{identification}} and structural model updating are employed to develop high fidelity {{finite element models}} of an experimental vehicle model using accelera-tion measurements.

40|$|The {{main source}} of damping in {{laminated}} composite materials arises from the inelastic nature of the matrix and the relative slipping at the fiber/matrix interfaces. Damping in laminated composite materials is usually a function of many parameters including the volume fraction of the fibers, fiber diameter and fiber orientation relative to the axis of loading. Also the magnitude and frequency of the applied load and many environmental factors should be mentioned. Since the complex phenomenon of damping is difficult to incorporate into the structural dynamic analysis of laminated plates, a modal damping approximation is employed here.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} to {{construct}} long, slender floors with minimum supports for aesthetic and economic reasons especially in modern building developments {{has resulted in}} increased floor slenderness leading to vibration problems. As a result, vibration serviceability has become the governing design criterion {{for many of these}} new civil engineering structures. It is known that long span, slender floors possess lower natural frequencies and reduced damping leading to vibration serviceability problems. As vibration serviceability becomes a major concern in the design of concrete floors, investigations of the beneficial effects of non-structural elements to the vibration serviceability of floors are becoming increasingly important. The vibration serviceability of long span, slender concrete floors may be improved through the installation of non-structural elements such as partition walls and raised access floors. Little research exists into the quantification of the effects of various types of partitions on the vibration serviceability of concrete floors that support them. There are no guidelines available to designers which take into account the effects of partitions in the design of concrete floors for vibration serviceability besides the different damping ratios that are recommended in different codes for bare floors as well as floors with half- or full-height partitions. Therefore a research project was initiated with the objectives of investigating the effects of non-structural partitions on the vibration serviceability of concrete floors as well as proposing guidelines on how to account for partitions in the design of concrete floors for vibration serviceability. The research project consisted of modal testing on a prestressed pre-tensioned concrete floor slab. The excitation of the floor was generated by an electrodynamic shaker and instrumented <b>impulse</b> <b>hammer.</b> The electrodynamic shaker excitation was used mainly to extract the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the test floor. The instrumented <b>impulse</b> <b>hammer</b> excitation was used mainly for damping studies.

Furthermore, it is not desirable to identify {{a large number of}} unknown parameters in a full system because of numerical difficulty in convergence. A novel substructural strategy was presented for identification of stiffness matrices and damage assessment with incomplete measurement. The substructural approach was employed to identify large systems in a divide-and-conquer manner. In addition, the concept of model condensation was invoked to avoid the need for complete measurement, and the recovery process to obtain the full set of parameters was formulated. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated numerically through multi-storey shear buildings subjected to random force. A fairly large structural system with 50 DOFs was identified with good results, taking into consideration the effects of noisy signals and the limited number of sensors. Two variations of the method were applied, depending on whether the sensor could be repositioned.

40|$|A novel {{fiber optic}} sensing {{technology}} for high frequency dynamics detection is proposed in this paper, specifically tailored for structural health monitoring applications based on strain wave analysis, for both passive impact identification and active Lamb wave monitoring. The sensing solution relies on a fiber optic-based interferometric architecture associated to an innovative coherent detection scheme, which retrieves in a completely passive way the high-frequency phase information of the received optical signal. The sensing fiber can be arranged into different layouts, depending on the requirement of the specific application, {{in order to enhance}} the sensor sensitivity while still ensuring a limited gauge length if punctual measures are required. For active Lamb wave monitoring, this results in a sensing fiber arranged in multiple loops glued on an aluminum thin panel in order to increase the phase signal only in correspondence to the sensing points of interest. Instead, for passive impact identification, the required sensitivity is guaranteed by simply exploiting a longer gauge length glued to the structure. The fiber optic coherent (FOC) sensor is exploited to detect the strain waves emitted by a piezoelectric transducer placed on the aluminum panel or generated by an <b>impulse</b> <b>hammer,</b> respectively. The FOC sensor measurements have been compared with both a numerical model based on Finite Elements and traditional piezoelectric sensors, confirming a good agreement between experimental and simulated results for both active and passive impact monitoring scenarios...|$|E
40|$|An accelerometer-based {{force balance}} was {{designed}} and developed for the measurement of drag, lift, and rolling moment on a blunt-nosed, flapped delta wing in a short-duration hypersonic shock tunnel. Calibration and validation of the balance were carried out by a convolution technique using hammer pulse test and surface pressure measurements. In the hammer pulse test, a known impulse {{was applied to the}} model in the appropriate direction using an <b>impulse</b> <b>hammer,</b> and the corresponding output of the balance (acceleration) was recorded. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was operated on the output of the balance to generate a system response function, relating the signal output to the corresponding load input. Impulse response functions for three components of the balance, namely, axial, normal, and angular, were obtained for a range of input load. The angular system response function was corresponding to rolling of the model. The impulse response functions thus obtained, through dynamic calibration, were operated on the output (signals) of the balance under hypersonic aerodynamic loading conditions in the tunnel to get the time history of the unknown aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the model. Surface pressure measurements were carried out on the model using high frequency pressure transducers, and forces and moments were deduced thereon. Tests were carried out at model angles of incidence of 0, 5, 10, and 15 degrees. A good agreement was observed among the results of different experimental methods. The balance developed is a comprehensive force/moment measurement device that can be used on complex, lifting, aerodynamic geometries in ground-based hypersonic test facilities...|$|E
40|$|Full-scale shake table seismic {{experiments}} and low amplitude vibration tests on a masonry building {{are carried out}} to assess its seismic performance as well as study {{the effectiveness of a}} new textile material for retrofitting masonry structures against earthquakes. The un-reinforced and the retrofitted with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) strips masonry buildings were subjected to a series of earthquake excitations of increasing magnitude in or-der to progressively induce various small, moderate and severe levels of damage to the ma-sonry walls. The performance of the original and retrofitted building states is evaluated. Changes in the dynamic characteristics (lowest four modal frequencies and damping ratios) of the building are used to assess and quantify the damage states of the masonry walls. For this, the dynamic modal characteristics of the structure states after each earthquake event were estimated by performing low-amplitude <b>impulse</b> <b>hammer</b> and sine-sweep forced vibration tests. The retrofitting actions restored the stiffness characteristics of the reinforced masonry structure to the levels of the original undamaged un-reinforced structure. The results show that the despite a similar dynamic behavior identified, corresponding to reduction of the modal frequencies, the un-reinforced masonry building was severely damaged, while the rein-forced masonry building was able to withstand, without visual damage, the induced strong seismic excitations. The GFRP textile material, optimally wrapped along the masonry walls following existing guidelines, was proven to be very effective in reinforcing the masonry building to withstand earthquake events significantly larger in magnitude than the ones caused severe damage to the un-reinforced building...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Chatter {{vibration}} {{in cutting}} processes usually leads to surface finish degradation, tool damage, cutting noise, energy loss, etc. Self-excited vibration particularly {{seems to be}} a problem that is easily increased to large vibration. The regenerative effect is considered as one of the causes of chatter vibration. Although the chatter vibration occurs in various types of processing, the end-milling is a typical process that seems to cause the chatter vibration {{due to a lack of}} rigidity of one or more parts of the machine tools, cutting tool, and work-piece. The aim of our research is to propose a simple method to control chatter vibration of the end-milling process on the basis of a coupling model integrating the related various elements. In this study, hammering tests were carried out to measure the transfer function of a machine tool and cutting tool system, which seems to cause vibration. By comparing these results, finite elemental method (FEM) analysis models were constructed. Additionally, cutting experiments were carried out to confirm the chatter vibration frequencies in end-milling with a machining center. In the hammering tests, <b>impulse</b> <b>hammer</b> and multiple acceleration pick-ups are connected to a multi-channel FFT analyzer and estimate the natural frequencies and natural vibration modes. A simplified FEM model is proposed by circular section stepped beam elements on the basis of the hammering test results, considering a coupling effect. In comparisons of the calculated results and hammering test results, the vibration modes are in good agreement. As a result, the proposed model accurately predicts the chatter vibration considering several effects among the relating elements in end-milling. Moreover, it can be seen that the chatter vibration is investigated from a viewpoint of the integrating model of the end-milling process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose in}} this project is to {{classify}} different metal plates according to their size and material. The plates which are studied are small plates with the maximum size of: radius= 25. 75 mm and thickness= 2. 20 mm. The quantities of interest are the natural frequencies of the plate which may be estimated experimentally based on the plate's frequency response function (FRF) estimate produced using the measured input force signal applied to the plate which had been recorded simultaneously with the output vibrations of the plate. The small size of the studied plates makes the measurements different from the rdinary sound and vibration measurements. The difference was basically in the sensor size and excitation method due to {{the small size of}} the studied objects. As in the case of small plates, it was necessary to find a suitable excitation method which could excite the natural frequencies of the plates. Plates different in geometrical dimensions as well as having different material properties are likely to be distinguished by their natural frequencies. Plate vibrations were excited using two methods: impact excitation by means of an <b>impulse</b> <b>hammer</b> and shaker excitation. In the studied structures {{in this project}}, the plate is excited by a random or transient input signal. The vibrations of the plate are measured using an accelerometer or a laser vibrometer. Repeatability of the measurements was one of the important interests which we tried to fulfill. But the first and most important goal was exciting and measuring the natural frequencies of the plate apart from the natural frequencies of the other components of the system. In most of the structures it was difficult to excite the natural frequencies of the plates due to the small size of them. To solve this problem, different boundary conditions of the plates are studied...|$|E
40|$|In civil {{engineering}} {{it is very}} difficult and often expensive to excite constructions such as bridges and buildings with an <b>impulse</b> <b>hammer</b> or shaker. This problem can be avoided with the output-only method as special feature of stochastic system identification. The permanently existing ambient noise (e. g. wind, traffic, waves) is sufficient to excite the structures in their operational conditions. The output-only method is able to estimate the observable part of a state-space-model which contains the dynamic characteristics of the measured mechanical system. Because of the assumption that the ambient excitation is white there is no requirement to measure the input. Another advantage of the output-only method is the possibility to get high detailed models by a special method, called polyreference setup. To pretend the availability of a much larger set of sensors the data from varying sensor locations will be collected. Several successive data sets are recorded with sensors at different locations (moving sensors) and fixed locations (reference sensors). The covariance functions of the reference sensors are bases to normalize the moving sensors. The result of the following subspace-based system identification is a high detailed black-box-model that contains the weighting function including the well-known dynamic parameters eigenfrequencies and mode shapes of the mechanical system. Emphasis of this lecture is the presentation of an extensive damage detection experiment. A 53 -year old prestressed concrete tied-arch-bridge in Hünxe (Germany) was deconstructed in 2005. Preliminary numerous vibration measurements were accomplished. The first experiment for system modification was an additional support near the bridge bearing of one main girder. During a further experiment one hanger from one tied arch was cut through as an induced damage. Some first outcomes of the described experiments will be presented...|$|E
