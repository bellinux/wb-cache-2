5|$|Written and {{illustrated}} by Yūsei Matsui, the manga was originally serialized by Shueisha in the Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from February 21, 2005, to April 20, 2009. Shueisha compiled the 202 chapters into 23 tankōbon (collected volumes) released from July 4, 2005, to August 4, 2009. It has also been published {{as part of the}} Shueisha Jump Remix series of magazine-style books. Five volumes were released between January 7, 2011, and March 7, 2011. Between October 12, 2012, and October 16, 2012, the 23 volumes of Neuro: Supernatural Detective were re-published in Amazon Kindle format under the Jump Comics <b>Digital</b> <b>line.</b> The series started to be released on bunkoban format by Shueisha on January 18, 2013, and it lasted twelve volumes, the last of which was published on June 18, 2013. Volumes 11 and 12 of the bunkoban edition included the two one-shots that preceded its serialization. Outside Japan, it has been licensed in some countries such as in France by Glénat, in Hong Kong by Culturecom, in Italy and Spain by Planeta DeAgostini, in South Korea by Seoul Media Group, and in Taiwan by Tong Li Publishing.|$|E

The aim of the present paper is to give a mathematically exact and consistent description of <b>digital</b> straight <b>lines</b> according to Rosenfeld’s definition. The digitizations of the lines with slopes 0 < a < 1, where a is irrational, are considered. We formulate a definition of digitization runs, formulate and prove theorems containing necessary and sufficient conditions for digital straightness.

40|$|We propose in {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} to three-dimensional <b>digital</b> <b>lines</b> (3 DDLs) based on the study of the integer lattice generated by the projection of Z 3 onto an euclidean plane which reduces the problem to dimension 2.

This de nition is then used in an algorithm that calculates the intersection between a naive 3 DDL and an arbitrary digital plane. We also show that this algorithm can be extended to calculate the intersection between a plane and a set of adjacent 3 DDLs incrementally in a very e cient manner. 1 Investigating a de nition of 3 D <b>digital</b> <b>lines</b> 1. ...|$|R
