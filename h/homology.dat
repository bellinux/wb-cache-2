40|$|Abstract This article {{takes up}} the project of {{studying}} psychological categories as <b>homologies.</b> Ethologists have numerous theoretical ideas concerning the phylogeny and ontogeny of behavioral <b>homologies.</b> They also have well-developed operational methods for testing behavioral <b>homologies.</b> Many of these theoretical ideas and operational criteria {{can be applied to}} psychological <b>homologies.</b> This paper suggests that insights from ethology should be incorporated in adaptationist and functionalist approaches to psy-chology. Doing so would strengthen those approaches...|$|R
5|$|The Serre {{spectral}} sequence {{was used}} by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1, so the nth homotopy group of a space X is the first homotopy group of its (n−1)-fold repeated loop space, which {{is equal to the}} first <b>homology</b> group of the (n−1)-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces the calculation of homotopy groups of X to the calculation of <b>homology</b> groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence relates the <b>homology</b> of a space to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the <b>homology</b> of loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence tends to have many non-zero differentials, which are hard to control, and too many ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups. Consequently, it has been superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non-zero differentials, which give more information.|$|E

40|$|Amino acid (aa) {{sequence}} <b>homologies</b> between {{viruses and}} autoimmune nuclear antigens are suggestive of viral involvement in {{disorders such as}} systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and scleroderma. We analyzed the frequency of exact <b>homologies</b> of {{greater than or equal}} to 5 aa between 61 viral proteins (19, 827 aa), 8 nuclear antigens (3813 aa), and 41 control proteins (11, 743 aa). Both pentamer and hexamer <b>homologies</b> between control proteins and viruses are unexpectedly abundant, with hexamer matches occurring in 1 of 3 control proteins (or once every 769 aa). However, 2 nuclear antigens, the SLE-associated 70 -kDa antigen and the scleroderma-associated CENP-B protein, are highly unusual in containing multiple <b>homologies</b> to a group of synergizing immunosuppressive viruses. Two viruses, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1), contain sequences exactly duplicated at 15 sites in the 70 -kDa antigen and at 10 sites in CENP-B protein. The immediate-early (IE) protein of HSV- 1, which activates HIV- 1 regulatory functions, contains three <b>homologies</b> to the 70 -kDa antigen (two hexamers and a pentamer) and two to CENP-B (a hexamer and pentamer). There are four <b>homologies</b> (including a hexamer) common to the 70 -kDa antigen and Epstein-Barr virus, and three <b>homologies</b> (including two hexamers) common to CENP-B and cytomegalovirus. The majority of <b>homologies</b> in both nuclear antigens are clustered in highly charged C-terminal domains containing epitopes for human autoantibodies. Furthermore, most <b>homologies</b> have a contiguous or overlapping distribution, thereby creating a high density of potential epitopes. In addition to the exact <b>homologies</b> tabulated, motifs of matching sequences are repeated frequently in these domains. Our analysis suggests that coexpression of heterologous viruses having common immunosuppressive functions may generate autoantibodies cross-reacting with certain nuclear proteins...|$|R

5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} {{algebraic topology}} and <b>homology</b> theory, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces, known as their <b>homology</b> and cohomology groups. The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the <b>homology</b> or cohomology groups may be easier to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology groups of the space to the (co)homology groups of the subspaces. It is a natural long exact sequence, whose entries are the (co)homology groups of the whole space, the direct sum of the (co)homology groups of the subspaces, and the (co)homology groups of {{the intersection of the}} subspaces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This is an {{expansion}} on my {{talk at the}} Geometry and Topology conference at McMaster University, May 2004. We outline a program to relate the Heegaard Floer <b>homologies</b> of Ozsvath-Szabo, and Seiberg-Witten-Floer <b>homologies</b> as defined by Kronheimer-Mrowka. The center-piece of this program is {{the construction of an}} intermediate version of Floer theory, which exhibits characteristics of both theories. 1 The conjecture This is a preliminary report on a long program aiming at a proof of the conjectural equivalence between the Heegaard Floer <b>homologies</b> of Ozsvath-Szabo, and the monopole Floer <b>homologies</b> as defined by Kronheimer-Mrowka. Besides giving an overall picture, we give in § 5, 6, 8, and 9. 1 a survey of some partial results towards this goal, with details deferred to papers in preparation [17, 18].

5|$|The case i = n {{has also}} been noted already, and is an easy {{consequence}} of the Hurewicz theorem: this theorem links homotopy groups with <b>homology</b> groups, which are generally easier to calculate; in particular, it shows that for a simply-connected space X, the first nonzero homotopy group πk(X), with k > 0, is isomorphic to the first nonzero <b>homology</b> group H'k(X). For the n-sphere, this immediately implies that for n ge& 2, πn(S'n) = H'n(S'n) = Z.|$|E
5|$|This {{algebraic}} {{approach to}} topology was also developed independently in Austria. In a 1926–27 course given in Vienna, Leopold Vietoris defined a <b>homology</b> group, which {{was developed by}} Walther Mayer, into an axiomatic definition in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. <b>Homology</b> thus implies divergent evolution.

Two examples are given in the article: the analysis of planar shapes and their shadows and the detection of extruded shapes. The parameters that are needed to specify <b>homologies</b> are given, {{as well as their}} invariants. Since only 5 parameters are required, these invariants are simpler than general projective invariants. The work therefore further corroborates the existence of grouping-specific invariants.

40|$|Mammals’ mental <b>homologies</b> include {{that they}} look after their young, suckle and protect them; they acquire {{information}} about the world by learning. They have five types of sensory receptors and a brain to analyze the information and they feel: that is they are sentient. Mental <b>homologies</b> have been largely ignored by behavioural scientists since Darwin because of certain historical beliefs. This however {{has not been the}} case for people who have had to do with non-human mammals who have long recognized their mental similarities to humans. As a result, behavioural science has sponsored some inappropriate research (examples are given). The study of another mammal species epistemology, (knowledge and world view) requires a recognition of these mental <b>homologies.</b> The result of a 25 year multi-disciplinary study indicates that there are nine mammalian mental <b>homologies</b> which define mammals. These are discussed and reviewed and further mental aptitudes which logically follow from these are pointed out. A Conditional Anthropomorphic approach is proposed. By recognizing the body/mind, whole “being” <b>homologies</b> of mammals, we can advance in understanding other mammal species’ and individual’s epistemology (world view), and consequently better their welfare and enrich our own lives...|$|R

5|$|<b>Homology</b> was {{noticed by}} Aristotle (c. 350 BC), and was {{explicitly}} analysed by Pierre Belon in his 1555 Book of Birds, where he systematically compared the skeletons {{of birds and}} humans.

5|$|In biology, <b>homology</b> is the {{existence}} of shared ancestry between a pair of structures, or genes, in different taxa. A common example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of vertebrates, where the wings of bats, the arms of primates, the front flippers of whales and the forelegs of dogs and horses are all derived from the same ancestral tetrapod structure. Evolutionary biology explains homologous structures adapted to different purposes {{as the result of}} descent with modification from a common ancestor. <b>Homology</b> was explained by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before this, from Aristotle onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by Pierre Belon in 1555. The term was applied to biology by the anatomist Richard Owen in 1843.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments {{can also}} be used to identify functionally important sites, such as binding sites, active sites, or sites corresponding to other key functions, by locating conserved domains. When looking at multiple sequence alignments, it is useful to consider different aspects of the sequences when comparing sequences. These aspects include identity, similarity, and <b>homology.</b> Identity means that the sequences have identical residues at their respective positions. On the other hand, similarity has to do with the sequences being compared having similar residues quantitatively. For example, in terms of nucleotide sequences, pyrimidines are considered similar to each other, as are purines. Similarity ultimately leads to <b>homology,</b> in that the more similar sequences are, the closer they are to being homologous. This similarity in sequences can then go on to help find common ancestry.|$|E
