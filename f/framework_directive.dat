40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that the {{regulation}} of Intellectual Property (IP) protection should go beyond the traditional regulatory models and follow a more flexible regulatory framework. Considering the range of industrial needs and developments, the article develops a differentiated Community IP protection model that could stimulate growth and innovation, alter the behavior of patent users, and {{improve the quality of}} patents through spontaneous harmonization and convergence. To explain the model better, we distinguish two key elements: differentiated <b>framework</b> <b>directives</b> and epistemic patent communities. Differentiated <b>framework</b> <b>directives</b> dictate the establishment of general patentability standards at the EU level but allow national patent systems to set up stricter patent standards for particular subject matters at the national level. In this way, differentiated <b>framework</b> <b>directives</b> should lead to an appropriate balance between the principles of the IP protection regime and the ideals of economic integration. However, given the current diversity in innovation developments and industrial operations, we recognize the risk that not all IP stakeholders would agree to a differentiated Community IP protection model. To overcome the risk of deadlock within model negotiations, and to encourage the integration of countries that want to move forward and advance certain innovation developments, we propose the creation of epistemic patent communities. In this article, epistemic patent communities are perceived as strong mechanisms for establishing an inclusive patent protection environment that encourages various stakeholders to agree on certain patentability principles and to acquire better IP protection at the EU level...|$|R

The crinoid bed is located in an enclave of gravelly sand surrounded by muddy sediments, the latter constituting the typical habitat of Norway lobster. An overall description of the geological and oceanographic features off the Portuguese southern coast is presented, highlighting the complexity of factors influencing the research zone. A delimitation of the crinoid bed and a comparison of taxa richness for the epibenthic megafauna of the adjacent towed zone are carried out.

40|$|With {{increasing}} marine traffic, {{the global}} level of anthropogenic noise is likely to rise. This might induce further stress to already endangered marine mammals, which rely on their acoustic senses for foraging, orientation and communication. The Southern Ocean provides an important habitat for marine mammals, both residential and migratory.

Natural ambient noise is generated by the interaction of wind, waves, ice, biological and geological sources and subject to seasonal variations. Transient sounds such as whale and seal vocalisations strongly influence the acoustic spectra. Due to limited marine traffic and industrial activity the Southern Ocean contrasts regions with anthropogenic noise pollution on the northern hemisphere. This rather uninfluenced soundscape is analysed according to indicators as proposed under the European Union marine strategy <b>frameworks</b> <b>directive.</b> In this way a useful reference to the northern hemisphere oceans is given.
