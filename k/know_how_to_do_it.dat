25|$|By 2000, Steve Jobs {{expressed}} interest in developing a portable music player. But Rubinstein demurred, saying the necessary components were not yet available. While on a routine supplier visit to Toshiba Corp. in February, 2001, however, Rubinstein first saw the tiny, 1.8-inch hard disk drive that became {{a critical component of}} the iPod. While Toshiba engineers had developed the drive, they were not sure how it could be used. At a Tokyo hotel later that evening, Rubinstein met with Jobs, who was in Japan on separate business. “I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> now. All I need is a $10 million check,” he told Jobs.|$|E
500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Rings of Ahkaten" [...] {{was held}} on 17 October 2012, with filming beginning the next week on 22 October. Director Farren Blackburn had previously worked on the programme in the 2011 Christmas special [...] "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe". According to Matt Smith, there were [...] "between 50 and 60 prosthetic aliens" [...] in a scene set in an alien market. The Doctor features minimally in the first act because Smith was busy filming pick-ups or reshoots for [...] "Nightmare in Silver". Millennium FX's Neill Gorton remarked that he had [...] "always {{wanted to do a}} scene like the Star Wars cantina" [...] and had worked on different moulds in his spare time in case they could be used in the future, as making thirty different aliens at one time would be out of the budget. Much of the episode was constructed around talks of what could be created with limited resources. For example, Cross recalled that producer Marcus Wilson called him and asked, [...] "We've always wanted to have a speeder-bike like in Return of the Jedi and we <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> inexpensively, so can you get one into the story?" [...] However, Cross felt that the speeder-bike ended up having more in common with Flash Gordon. The songs were written by composer Murray Gold. To help establish the year {{at the beginning of the}} episode [...] "Ghost Town" [...] by The Specials is heard and the Doctor is seen reading a 1981 copy of The Beano. The issue of The Beano was reprinted and included in a special Doctor Who-themed edition on 15 May 2013.|$|E
2500|$|During a February 28, 2008 {{speech in}} Beaumont, Texas, Obama said, [...] "It's {{not good enough}} for you to say to your child, 'Do good in school,' and then when that child comes home, you got the TV set on, you got the radio on, you don't check their homework, there is not a book in the house, you've got the video game playing... So turn off the TV set, put the video game away. Buy a little desk or put that child by the kitchen table. Watch them do their homework. If they don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> give them help. If you don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> call the teacher. Make them go to bed at a {{reasonable}} time. Keep them off the streets. Give 'em some breakfast... I also know that if folks letting our children drink eight sodas a day, which some parents do, or, you know, eat a bag of potato chips for lunch, or Popeyes for breakfast [...] You can't do that. Children have to have proper nutrition. That affects also how they study, how they learn in school." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fat Joe {{was born}} on August 19, 1970, in the South Bronx area of New York City, where he was raised by parents of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent. He lived in public housing and began {{stealing}} {{at a young age}} to support his family. He also admits that he was a bully in his childhood. His brother introduced him to rap music. [...] As a teenager, he was highly influenced by fellow Latino rapper Big Pun. [...] Fat Joe explained the rapper's influence on him by saying [...] "Latinos before us who had the opportunity to do it just didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> They came in trying to do this black music, waving flags. [...] we're trying to kick in the doors for other Latinos and represent our people, and it shows." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September, Madonna shot some scenes {{involving}} Lourdes. Shooting {{took place}} around Mayfair, outside the hotel Claridge's, {{as well as}} in a set of Downing Street, created in Aldwych. Lourdes's scenes required her to be dressed as a schoolgirl. The same month, filming moved to New York, where Madonna shot scenes in Brooklyn. A dance sequence was shot where D'Arcy had to do a ballet, but he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and was requested by Madonna to learn the steps. D'Arcy described the sequence as [...] "this extraordinary beautiful dance with lifts and twirls and I can't do that, but you do because she [...] somehow makes the impossible possible and it gives you amazing self esteem when you do these things." [...] Although the dance scene did not make the final cut of the film, Madonna also asked D'Arcy to learn to play bagpipes in six weeks and to ride horses.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Fidel Castro {{attempted}} to motivate the Cuban people to harvest 10 {{million tons of}} sugar, in Spanish known as La Zafra, {{in order to increase}} their exports and grow their economy. [...] With the help {{of the majority of the}} Cuban population the country was able to produce 7.56 million tons of sugar. In July 1970, after the harvest was over, Castro took responsibility for the failure and later that same year he blamed the Sugar Industry Minister saying “Those technocrats, geniuses, super-scientists assured me that they knew what to do in order to produce the ten million tons. But it was proven, first, that they did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and, second, that they exploited the rest of the economy by receiving large amounts of resources [...] [...] [...] while there are factories that could have improved with a better distribution of those resources that were allocated to the Ten-Million-Ton plan”.|$|E

Edna Gunderson of USA Today rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that the band [...] "raise their game" [...] on the release [...] "by simply {{delivering}} fatter hooks, juicier melodies, dreamier vocals {{and more of the}} dark shimmer that enveloped the duo's 2010 debut." [...] At Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, stating that the release [...] "is at once sleek and world-weary, often homing in on that sexy moment of malaise when the Seventies wanted to turn into the Eighties so badly but didn't quite <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> yet."
