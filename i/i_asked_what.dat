2500|$|Under the {{presidency}} of Valdas Adamkus, Lithuania actively promoted democracy in the formerly Soviet Eastern European and Asian nations. President Adamkus, together with President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, Javier Solana, Boris Gryzlov and Ján Kubiš, served as a mediator during Ukraine's political crisis, when two candidates in the 2004 presidential election, Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Yushchenko, each claimed victory. President Adamkus recalled {{in an interview that}} [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> we could do to help, Kuchma said the friends of the Ukrainian people should drop whatever they were doing and come to Kiev immediately.". The next day international mediators met in Ukraine. The crisis was resolved after a new election was held.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> {{had become}} of his sister-in-law, the lady with the swollen face.|$|E
60|$|When we met again, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> {{had passed}} between the Prisoner and himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably," [...] returns Mr. Tulkinghorn, quietly blowing his nose. [...] "But <b>I</b> don't <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> {{you think}} of myself; <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> {{you think of}} the prison." ...|$|R
60|$|MITCHENER. May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> {{you were}} thinking, Mrs. Farrell? This {{suspense}} is awful.|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean Captain Sedgwick?" [...] Challoner's {{tone was}} discouragingly reserved. [...] "May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> {{leads you to}} plead his cause?" ...|$|R
60|$|I did a rash thing; <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> it {{was that}} he most wanted to know.|$|E
60|$|But on the {{way home}} was my opportunity, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> my half- brother really thought of M. d'Aubepine.|$|E
60|$|One man {{had written}} a play. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> the critics had said about him. They showed me his tomb.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Orange {{whispered to}} Mrs. Lemon, 'There is a pale, bald child, with red whiskers, in disgrace. Might <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> he has done?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Rowland {{hesitated a}} moment. [...] "I don't {{wish to be}} indiscreet, but may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> you propose {{to do with a}} {{thousand}} francs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That sounds mysteriously awful; could <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> {{nautical}} torture [...] "bowsing jibs" [...] is?' asked Mrs Jo, {{in a tone}} of deep interest.|$|R
60|$|Old {{tradition}} was strong in us; all English inns {{in those days}} charged the unexpected, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> our lunch was to cost.|$|E
6000|$|Slim said, [...] "I didn't. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> {{you feed}} animals. That's {{not the same}} as saying we were doing it. Besides, it's {{something}} else, Red." ...|$|E
60|$|Darius {{remained}} in the hold some time, and when he showed himself again as if his work was done, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> he had been about.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see. And your {{impending}} departure {{may explain}} certain strange coincidences. May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> was this same herb?" [...] in a mocking tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> your {{intentions}} are {{with regard to}} the child? You intend to take her to your home--to adopt her, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is the question," [...] rejoined Sir Patrick. [...] "You {{admit the}} {{existence}} of the public feeling and <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>what</b> good does it do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will repeat}} it, then. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> had so {{suddenly}} determined {{you to give}} up all idea of making any future experiments on the superstitious fears of Count Fabio?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then, suddenly, Darius {{pulled me}} {{back by the}} coat-collar, forcing me to run with him, and as we went swiftly past our guns toward the rear, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> he was doing.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{naturally}} interested me. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> sort of sermons Mr. Mirabel preached. Lady Janeaway said: 'Come up to {{our room}} after dinner. The subject is too distressing to be discussed in public.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{the other}} rejoined, [...] "I don't know that I accuse your sincerity. But, may <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>what</b> are your {{personal}} objections to immortality?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} would; utter ruin; he never could hold up his head again. Therefore it is <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>What</b> {{do you intend}} to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me {{introduce}} myself," [...] he said, and mentioned {{his name and}} titles. [...] "May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> you are doing here, and how you came?" ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{my belief}} that I could have felt no greater dismay, if the long arm of the Law had laid its hold on me while he was speaking. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> was to be done.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! that {{explains}} it," [...] Nellie said. [...] "He {{had been talking}} to father, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> it was about and he would not tell me, and I have been very angry with him ever since." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> {{manner of}} man, {{and what his}} name was; and this {{disclosed}} the cause of John's ill-humour; for it appeared the visitor refused to name himself except to me, a sore affront to the major-domo's consequence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Depths in me? Why I am a shallow, {{transparent}} stream {{like your}} West Fork! ... And as for possibilities--may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> of them you imagine you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> {{you call}} amiable, sir?--And, when that {{question}} is answered, I may venture to {{go so far as}} to inquire whom you call amiable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{persist in}} repeating the question," [...] Lady Lydiard rejoined. [...] "I say that Isabel Miller {{knew of the}} {{inclosure}} in my letter--and <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>What</b> of that?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt as if}} it {{were all}} a dream, and when {{presently}} my brother came and took my hand, I cried out: 'Oh, wake me! Wake me!' And when he burst into tears <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> he meant.|$|E
60|$|I had waited, {{surprised}} by my first {{view of the}} woman writing in my book. Having answered her to this effect, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> she had done or dreamed of doing at the later moment when I entered the summer-house.|$|E
60|$|No: my obstinate {{common sense}} was not reduced to submission, even yet. Looking back over a lapse of {{seventeen}} years, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> had happened, in that long interval, {{to justify the}} anxieties which still appeared to trouble my friend.|$|E
6000|$|She {{began by}} admiring the diamonds--with a certain reserve. [...] "Nothing like so large as Sir Jervis's diamonds; but choice {{specimens}} no doubt. Might <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> the value--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly {{it is very}} considerable,' Merton said, after a {{few minutes}} passed in arithmetical calculation. 'Am I too curious if <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> is the source of this opulence?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed,' said Sir Jasper. 'And may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> is {{your opinion}} as to this charge? I never knew {{a young man}} enlist with fifteen pounds in his pocket.' ...|$|R
