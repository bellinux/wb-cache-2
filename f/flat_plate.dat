5|$|A {{number of}} {{similarity}} solutions to this equation {{have been found}} for various types of flow, including <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> boundary layers. The term similarity refers to the property that the velocity profiles at different positions in the flow are the same apart from a scaling factor.

In low geographical latitudes (below 40degrees) from 60 to 70% {{of the domestic}} hot water use with temperatures up to 60°C can be provided by solar heating systems. The most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors (44%) and glazed <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> collectors (34%) generally used for domestic hot water; and unglazed plastic collectors (21%) used mainly to heat swimming pools.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions. For {{the problem of}} a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> with a temperature jump at , they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature {{at any point in}} the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E

5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|These guanine-rich {{sequences}} may stabilize chromosome ends {{by forming}} structures of stacked sets of four-base units, {{rather than the}} usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases form a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> and these flat four-base units then stack {{on top of each}} other, to form a stable G-quadruplex structure. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and chelation of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit. Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.|$|E
5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment. They made a model-size airfoil and a counter-acting <b>flat</b> <b>plate,</b> both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars. Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E

5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|E

25|$|The Parcel Post stamps of 191213 {{were printed}} on the <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> press which yielded plate blocks of six stamps with the plate number {{designated}} in the margin (designating a particular printing run).

25|$|Where {{temperatures}} below about 95°C are sufficient, as {{for space}} heating, flat-plate collectors of the nonconcentrating type are generally used. Because {{of the relatively}} high heat losses through the glazing, <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> collectors will not reach temperatures much above 200°C even when the heat transfer fluid is stagnant.

25|$|In {{the case}} of the first four designs, {{preparing}} printing plates for each stamp required two separate transfer phases. Two different steel dies were used, one containing the Washington or Franklin engraving, the other providing the framework and lettering. After every image on the steel plate had been impressed with both design components, the plate was heat-treated and hardened to prepare it for printing. In the lower-denomination Washington-Franklin Issues, 400 separate impressions appeared on a printing plate, referred to as a <b>flat</b> <b>plate.</b> The higher value of 1-dollar was printed from a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> of 200 subjects. The fifth design required different plates for each of the two elements, as printing took place in two stages: the frame was first printed in color and, in a second impression, the Franklin portrait was laid over it in black. These $2 and $5 values employed plates of 100 subjects.|$|E
25|$|Those {{engraved}} {{images on}} the 2 and 3 cent Washington-head issues that appear similar but whose lines vary significantly are referred to and often cataloged as types. Type I occurs on <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> printings only while types II & III also occur mostly in rotary press printings and in offset printings as they were produced from photo plates made from the former printing plates. The 2-cent Type II stamp does not occur on a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> stamp. Because the commonly used denominations of the Washington-Franklin issues were printed in greater quantities the worn printing plates {{would have to be}} replaced in the process from time to time. Though each new plate was made from the same die transfer, the plates would still differ slightly from the previous plate in use due to the bending process to fit the plate around the rotary press printing cylinder. Plates would also differ because the transfer die itself would wear from repeated image transfers to the printing plate.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, the {{observed}} pressure differences between {{front and back}} of the plate, and resulting drag forces, are much larger than predicted: for a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> perpendicular to the flow the predicted drag coefficient is CD=0.88, while in experiments CD=2.0 is found. This is mainly due to suction at the wake side of the plate, induced by the unsteady flow in the real wake (as opposed to the theory which assumes a constant flow velocity equal to the plate's velocity).|$|E
25|$|From 1908 to 1914 coil stamps {{were printed}} with <b>Flat</b> <b>Plate</b> presses in sheets of 400 {{which were then}} cut into strips for coiling. In 1915 the Bureau began {{printing}} coil stamps from continuous rolls of paper with the Rotary Press. The printing plates were curved and affixed around a rotating cylinder, a process that stretched the images somewhat, making them slightly longer than similar images printed from a flat-plate. The difference in size becomes evident when the two different types are placed side by side.|$|E
