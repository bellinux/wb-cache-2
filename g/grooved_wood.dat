50|$|Though {{there are}} some {{original}} finishes remaining in the tenant spaces, these spaces have been modified over time to suit {{the needs of the}} tenants. On the second floor, a small Magistrates' Court has been built. Though this court is new, it maintains the spirit of the original courtroom in the paneled wainscot and decorative wood panel behind the judge's bench. The original aluminum door and window surrounds, and picture rail exist here. Throughout the tenant spaces, the original tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>wood</b> plank flooring has been covered by carpet. Most of the tenant spaces retain {{at least some of the}} original aluminum molding.|$|R
50|$|Constructed as a {{post office}} and courthouse, the {{building}} originally included postal facilities on the first floor, offices {{around the perimeter of}} the upper floors, and a central two-story courtroom. The south and west corridors on the first floor both retain their original terrazzo and gray marble floors. The lobby features terrazzo floors, marble baseboards, tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>wood</b> paneling, and plasterwork above the windows and on the beams with raised gold-painted laurel wreaths and geometric patterns. The current post office occupies only a portion of the space originally designed for it. The wood floor and vaults are original, as are some doors and windows leading to internal corridors. The second and third floor hallways retain their terrazzo and marble flooring. When use of the building as a courthouse ceased, the courtroom was converted into offices. Offices and other internal spaces were modified as their uses changed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} novel electrotactile display {{that can be}} {{integrated}} into current handheld devices with touch screens. In this display, tactile information is presented to the fingertip of the user by transmitting small currents through electrodes. Experiments were conducted to investigate the perception of simulated textures using this electrotactile display technique. One fundamental feature of texture, which {{is the focus of}} this study, is roughness. The aim of the first experiment was to investigate the relationship between electrotactile stimulation parameters such as current and pulse frequency and the perception of roughness. An increase in the current magnitude resulted in an increase in perceived roughness. The aim of the second experiment was to investigate parameter combinations of electrotactile stimuli can be used to simulate textures. Subjects adjusted the intensity and frequency of the current stimuli until the simulated textures were perceived as being equal to reference textures such as sandpapers of varying grit numbers and <b>grooved</b> <b>woods</b> with varying <b>groove</b> widths. Subjects tended to find an electrotactile stimulus with a high current magnitude and a low pulse frequency more suitable to represent rough surfaces. They tended to find just-perceptible current magnitudes suitable for very smooth surfaces and did not show a preference for any frequency.

50|$|There {{has been}} little change made to the {{interior}} of the building, and the upstairs portion of the house in particular is well preserved. The interior features a fine central staircase, unpainted wood trim, and largely unpainted tongue and <b>groove</b> ceilings with <b>wood</b> medallions. Several original pieces of furniture, a trunk of papers belonging to Frank Drake, old patent medicine bottles, a bed with its original straw mattress, and many other artifacts dating to the resettlement period remain in the building.|$|R
5000|$|The frame {{building}} is about 20.17 ft by 30.25 ft in plan on a concrete and brick foundation. Windows {{are confined to}} the ends of the building, as are doors. The original [...] "triple sheathing" [...] has been covered by asphalt shingles. The triple sheathing system consisted of wood weatherboards over diagonal wood sheathing on wood studs with straw insulation, and an interior sheathing of horizontal beaded tongue and <b>groove</b> boards. A <b>wood</b> shingle roof has likewise been covered with asphalt shingles.|$|R

5000|$|The Britannia Heights Methodist Church {{was built}} between 1873 and 1874 {{on what is}} now Britannia Road and Carling Avenue. Begun in 1873 with first {{services}} the following summer, the interior wasn't completed until 1875. A plaque under the pulpit listed James West and William West, contractors Jul 3 1873. The Carpenter Gothic-style frame building had interior wood panelling. The pointed windows and doors were arched equilaterally in the Neo Gothic style. The roof over {{the front door and}} main building was decorated by a delicate barge-board trim of lacelike scrollwork. [...] The original ceiling was made of tongue and <b>groove</b> stained <b>wood</b> in an ornamental design carved in rectangular shapes. The Christmas concerts took place on a little wooden platform. The original heating was provided by stove and pipes. Later the church was heated by a furnace with a large central register. Although the lawn at the front entrance was small, the east lawn was large enough for the members to socialize after the services. The drive shed was on the easterly back side.|$|R
40|$|Plank (tongue and <b>groove)</b> <b>wood</b> decking is {{a product}} that is {{commonly}} used in post and beam timber construction to transfer gravity loads on roofs and floors. In 2010, The National Building Code of Canada changed the application area of the specified concentrated roof live loads from 750 mm x 750 mm to 200 mm x 200 mm. The change was made to better reflect the area which a construction worker with equipment occupies. Preliminary analysis showed that {{the change in the}} application area of concentrated loads may {{have a significant impact on}} the design of decking systems. Little research or development has been done on plank decking since the 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s. An experimental program was undertaken at the University of Ottawa’s structural laboratory to better understand the behaviour of plank decking under uniformly distributed and concentrated loads. Non-destructive and destructive tests were conducted on plank decking systems to investigate their stiffness and failure mode characteristics under uniformly distributed as well as concentrated loads. The experimental test program was complimented with a detailed finite element model in order to predict the behaviour of a plank decking system, especially the force transfer between decks through the tongue and groove joint. The study showed that the published deflection coefficients for uniformly distributed loads can accurately predict the three types of decking layup patterns specified in the Canadian Design Standard (CSA O 86, 2009). For unbalanced uniformly distributed loads on two-span continuous layup, it was found that the deflection coefficient of 0. 42 was non-conservative. It was also found that under concentrated loads, the stiffness of the decking system increased significantly as more boards were added. A deflection coefficient of 0. 40 is appropriate to calculate the deflection for the three types of decking layup patterns specified in the Canadian Design Standard (CSA O 86, 2009) under concentrated load on an area of 200 mm by 200 mm. Significant load sharing was observed for plank decking under concentrated loads. An increase in capacity of about 1. 5 to 2. 5 times the capacity of the loaded boards was found. Furthermore, it was found that placing sheathing on top of a decking system had a significant effect in the case of concentrated load with an increase of over 50 % in stiffness and over 100 % in ultimate capacity...|$|R

30|$|Knots {{have been}} {{considered}} an undesirable visual feature of lumber. To clarify the essence of this visual undesirability, eye-tracking data from 20 subjects, who freely observed 55 images of wood wall panels, were recorded and distribution maps of eye-fixation pauses were composed. These maps were compared with the arrangement of knots on each knotty wall panel image and the visual inducement of knots was evaluated using a new numerical index of pausing probability. The present study {{is the first to}} objectively quantify the visual inducement of knots. In addition, the subjective noticeability of knots and ten visual impressions of each wood panel image were investigated by a sensory evaluation. There was a very clear linear relationship between the visual inducement of knots and the subjective noticeability of knots. A correlation analysis suggested that many visual impressions of wood wall panels were influenced by a complementary effect between the subjective noticeability of knots and the visual inducement of knots. The visual impact of knots was masked to some extent by special visual stimuli such as deep red <b>grooves</b> on the <b>wood</b> wall panels.|$|R
