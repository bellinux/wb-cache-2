40|$|AbstractAiming to the {{reliable}} {{estimates of}} the ionosphere <b>differential</b> <b>corrections</b> for the satellite navigation system {{in the presence of}} the ionosphere anomaly, a fault-tolerance estimating method, which is based on the distributed Kalman filtering, is proposed. The method utilizes the parallel sub-filters for estimating the ionosphere <b>differential</b> <b>corrections.</b> Meanwhile, an infinite norm (IN) method is proposed for the detection of the ionosphere irregularity in the filter processing. Once the anomaly is detected, the sub-filter contaminated by the anomaly measurements will be excluded to ensure the reliability of the estimates. The simulation is conducted to validate the method and the results indicate that the anomaly can be found timely due to the novel fault detection method based on the infinite norm. Because of the parallel sub-filter architecture, the measurements are classified by the spatial distribution so that the ionosphere anomaly can be positioned and excluded more easily. Thus, the method can provide the robust and accurate ionosphere <b>differential</b> <b>corrections...</b>|$|R

The TDRSS Augmentation Service for Satellites (TASS) will broadcast its message on the S-band multiple access forward channel of NASA s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS).

Therefore, linear correction, by means of a second GPS rover, has been suggested as an alternative to <b>differential</b> <b>correction.</b> To test the accuracy of linearly corrected measurements, we compared the position estimates of raw, linearly corrected and differentially corrected GPS positional fixes with the true (known) geodetic position. The tests indicate that the accuracy of linear correction is highly unstable and is related to differences in the satellite constellation used by the GPS receivers. Linear correction is consequently strongly discouraged. If <b>differential</b> <b>correction</b> is not possible, we recommend the use of raw GPS measurements, of which the error is well known and more predictable. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Today, {{differential}} GPS techniques allow common GPS receivers {{to achieve}} the precision levels required for mapping purposes. The development of systems for mobile Internet access (mainly GPRS) provides a fast and reliable method for feeding <b>differential</b> <b>corrections</b> to a GPS receiver in any area covered by a cell telephone network.

40|$|Determined {{to become}} a new member of the {{well-established}} GNSS family, COMPASS (or BeiDou- 2) is developing its capabilities to provide high accuracy positioning services. Two positioning modes are investigated in this study to assess the positioning accuracy of COMPASS&# 39; 4 GEO/ 5 IGSO/ 2 MEO constellation. Precise Point Positioning (PPP) for geodetic users and real-time positioning for common navigation users are utilized. To evaluate PPP accuracy, coordinate time series repeatability and discrepancies with GPS&# 39; precise positioning are computed. Experiments show that COMPASS PPP repeatability for the east, north and up components of a receiver within mainland China is better than 2 cm, 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively. Apparent systematic offsets of several centimeters exist between COMPASS precise positioning and GPS precise positioning, indicating errors remaining in the treatments of COMPASS measurement and dynamic models and reference frame differences existing between two systems. For common positioning users, COMPASS provides both open and authorized services with rapid <b>differential</b> <b>corrections</b> and integrity information available to authorized users.
