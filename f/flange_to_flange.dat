50|$|Growing {{passenger}} figures quickly necessitated {{more powerful}} engines. In 1986 two larger locomotives were built, entering {{service for the}} 1987 season; these were the new 2-6-0+0-6-2 Garratt locomotive No 3 Norfolk Hero and the Bo-Bo diesel locomotive No 4 Norfolk Harvester. These two engines provided the main service, with Weasel in reserve and out-of-season use, whilst Pilgrim was sold. The need for a second high-powered steam engine was quickly established and locomotive No 5 arrived on loan in 1995. This engine, which was never owned by the railway, had marginally different gauge standards (the range of measurements of elements of the wheelsets of a vehicle, {{in addition to the}} strict gauge from <b>flange</b> <b>to</b> <b>flange),</b> and proved unsuitable, as the newly established practice of running in reverse from Walsingham to Wells meant that the engine led with its tender, and the slightly different measurements, coupled with the lighter weight of the leading tender, led to the tender regularly derailing. The engine was little used, and eventually withdrawn, and plans were made to replicate the highly successful Garratt design of Norfolk Hero, with an order placed for locomotive No 6 Norfolk Heroine, which entered service in 2010.|$|E

The report {{describes}} work by Westinghouse and the subcontractor, Gilbert/Commonwealth, in {{the fulfillment of}} completing Task 6. 0. A conceptual design for critical and noncritical components of the gas fired combustion turbine system was completed. The conceptual design included specifications for the <b>flange</b> <b>to</b> <b>flange</b> gas turbine, power plant components, and balance of plant equipment. The ATS engine used in the conceptual design is an advanced 300 MW class combustion turbine incorporating many design features and technologies required to achieve ATS Program goals. Design features of power plant equipment and balance of plant equipment are described. Performance parameters for these components are explained. A site arrangement and electrical single line diagrams were drafted for the conceptual plant. ATS advanced features include design refinements in the compressor, inlet casing and scroll, combustion system, airfoil cooling, secondary flow systems, rotor and exhaust diffuser.

40|$|Bolted, {{segmented}} cylindrical shells are {{a common}} structural component in many engineering systems especially for aerospace launch vehicles. Segmented shells are often needed due to limitations of manufacturing capabilities or transportation issues related to very long, large-diameter cylindrical shells. These cylindrical shells typically have a <b>flange</b> or ring welded <b>to</b> opposite ends so that shell segments can be mated together and bolted to form a larger structural system. As the diameter of these shells increases, maintaining strict fabrication tolerances for the <b>flanges</b> <b>to</b> be flat and parallel on a welded structure is an extreme challenge. Local fit-up stresses develop in the structure due <b>to</b> <b>flange</b> mating-surface mismatch (flange waviness). These local stresses {{need to be considered}} when predicting a critical initial flaw size. Flange waviness is one contributor to the fit-up stress state. The present paper describes the modeling and analysis effort to simulate fit-up stresses due <b>to</b> <b>flange</b> waviness in a typical bolted, segmented cylindrical shell. Results from parametric studies are presented for various flange mating-surface waviness distributions and amplitudes I...|$|R
