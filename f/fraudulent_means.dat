5|$|Following his {{swearing}} in as Lord Protector in 1653, Oliver Cromwell {{became a}} proponent of Blondeau's coinage method, which had yet to find favour in the nation's minting establishment. In 1654, Cromwell's government placed Blondeau {{in charge of a}} planned mint in Ireland, where the coinage was heavily debased by <b>fraudulent</b> <b>means.</b> The proposed mint never came into existence, but in 1656, Blondeau was given official appointment to strike £2,000 worth of coins bearing Cromwell's portrait with captured Spanish silver. The former Royal Mint superintendent, William John Hocking, believed that the edge lettering on Blondeau's coinage was created by means of a perforated steel strip, through which the coin's metal flowed during striking, creating the raised designs and wording. Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less costly than the older method involving the split collar, because the steel strip could be replaced more economically. However, the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau's Cromwell-era coinage was struck without a collar, which suggests that he used a machine to impart the edge lettering prior to striking.|$|E

The allegation was that when Tarrant asked a question, Whittock, one of that episode's nine other Fastest Finger First contestants, would cough to guide Ingram to the correct answer. Ingram won the £1 million top prize, but members of the production staff raised suspicions over Whittock's coughing along with the Ingrams' behaviour after the recording, and the police were called in to investigate. The defence claimed that Whittock simply suffered from allergies; however, all three were found guilty and given suspended sentences. After the trial, ITV aired a documentary about the scandal, along with Ingram's entire game, complete with Whittock's coughing sounds. As a joke, Benylin cough syrup paid to have the first commercial shown during the programme's commercial break.|$|E
25|$|The French psychic Jean-Pierre Girard {{has claimed}} he can bend metal bars by PK. Girard was {{tested in the}} 1970s but failed to produce any paranormal effects in scientifically {{controlled}} conditions. He was tested on January 19, 1977 during a two-hour experiment in a Paris laboratory. The experiment was directed by the physicist Yves Farge with a magician also present. All of the experiments were negative as Girard failed to make any of the objects move paranormally. He failed two tests in Grenoble in June 1977 with the magician James Randi. He was also tested on September 24, 1977 at a laboratory at the Nuclear Research Centre. Girard failed to bend any bars or change {{the structure of the}} metals. Other experiments into spoon bending were also negative and witnesses described his feats as fraudulent. Girard later admitted that he would sometimes cheat to avoid disappointing the public but insisted he still had genuine psychic power. Magicians and scientists have written that he produced all his alleged psychokinetic feats through <b>fraudulent</b> <b>means.</b>|$|E

40|$|With the {{continuing}} growth of E-commerce, credit card fraud has evolved exponentially, {{where people are}} using more on-line services to conduct their daily transactions. Fraudsters masquerade normal behaviour of customers to achieve unlawful gains. Fraud patterns are changing rapidly where fraud detection needs to be re-evaluated from a reactive to a proactive approach. In recent years Deep Learning has gained lot of popularity in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing. This paper seeks to understand how Deep Learning {{can be helpful in}} finding fraud in credit card transactions and compare Deep Learning against several state of the art algorithms (RF, GBM, GLM) and sampling methods (Over, Under, Hybrid, SMOTE and ROSE) used in fraud detection. The results show that Deep Learning performed best with the highest Recall (accuracy of identifying <b>fraudulent</b> transactions), which <b>means</b> lowest financial losses to the company. However, Deep Learning achieved the lowest Precision rate (classified more legitimate transactions as fraudulent), which can cause customer dissatisfaction. Among other chosen classifiers, oversampling method performed best in terms of AUC, precision was highest for GLM and F-Score was highest for model trained using ROSE sampling method. Recall and Precision both have high cost, so there cannot be any trade of one against the other. Selecting the best classifier to identify fraud is based on the business goal...|$|R
40|$|Porto de Moz {{is a small}} {{municipality}} (22. 460 inhabitants) {{bordered by}} the Xingu and Amazonas Rivers, {{in the state of}} Pará. The local economy is based on small-scale agriculture, fishing, and timber extraction. Land ownership is extremely concentrated, and {{a large part of the}} municipal lands are unclaimed and subject to land grabbing by <b>fraudulent</b> and violent <b>means.</b> Control over land is essential for the largest sawmills, which relies on illegal logging. The mayor and his relatives own three of the four local sawmills, and therefore have high stakes in the struggle for land. There are a few grassroots organizations in Porto de Moz whose members overtly oppose and try to resist the abuses of the municipal government. Among these efforts, they formed a “Natural Resource Municipal Committee” which laid plans for a more equitable and sustainable development model in the Municipality, but have never received any support from the local government. Federal and state agencies that could mediate the local conflicts are conspicuously absent from the municipality. The isolation and transportation problems contribute to this situation; however, the mayor’s effort to keep any authority that could interfere with his interests is evident. Porto de Moz is an extreme example of the excessive power that mayors have in the Brazilian system. Nevertheless, it does not mean that decentralization should be avoided, but rather that there must exist effective checks and balances on the local power to prevent this kind of abuse...|$|R
25|$|In 1907, Lafferty took a {{case that}} would define {{the rest of his}} career: {{representing}} 18 western Oregon counties against the Oregon and California Railroad to claim timber revenue from, and possession of, the O lands formerly granted to the railroad by the U.S. government. In 1870, the United States government had granted the railroad three million acres (12,000km²) of land to build a line from Portland south to California. The railroad was to sell land to settlers at $2.50 an acre, but widespread abuse resulted in developers, aided by politicians, acquiring large parcels through <b>fraudulent</b> <b>means</b> in {{what became known as the}} Oregon land fraud scandal. Then in 1903, the Southern Pacific Railroad, which had acquired the O, had stopped selling the parcels altogether. Lafferty fought the case for years and in 1915, it ended when the U.S. government took back control of the land, paying the railroad $2.50 per acre for the land. Lafferty did not consider this a victory since the railroad was compensated and the state of Oregon did not get possession of the land.|$|E

Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, explained that upholding partial ouster clauses promoted the certainty of the executive's actions.

40|$|Underpinning {{the law on}} {{documentary}} {{credits and}} independent guarantees is a legal principle of autonomy which dictates that these financial instruments should, {{as a matter of}} law, be treated separately from a trader’s contractual agreement. However, despite this, fraudulent behaviour may still occur when these financial and legal instruments are used in practice. In response, a fraud exception to the autonomy principle has been recognised by many national and international courts in an attempt to mitigate the effects of fraudulent trade practices. The application of this exception within the English courts is, however, problematic owing to the narrowness of its construction and application. Additionally, the paucity of alternate legal instruments for regulating <b>fraudulent</b> trade practices <b>means</b> that Jordanian courts are not in any better position than their English counterparts, leaving traders confused as to their legal position when a fraud dispute arises. Given the large financial value of fraudulent transactions and the risks involved, the use of these legal instruments has declined as has the banks’ investment in this area creating a problem for legal policy makers. The aim of this dissertation is to, first, critically examine the fraud exception under English and Jordanian law by exploring the problems associated with the application of the fraud exception; and, second, to propose legal reforms which would alleviate both the legal and practical problems associated with the fraud exception as it stands currently. The thesis is that, whilst the autonomy principle plays a vital role in international trade, the courts should facilitate the fraud exception application and recognise other exceptions, such as the non-genuinity and the underlying contract exception, where the former exception would be unable to prevent fraud occurrence. The approach is based upon a critical evaluation of Anglo-American and Jordanian case law, supplemented by secondary sources and a qualitative examination of the Jordanian approach to the fraud exception based upon interviews with Jordanian judges. The dissertation concludes that an effective legal approach to fraudulent transactions using documentary credits and independent guarantees must be founded upon objective rather than subjective principles and that the courts’ use of injunctions should be different in cases involving holders in due course from those not involving such parties. These findings will impact upon legal policy debates within both English common law and international trade law more generally and the examination of the Jordanian position is instructive in that it is the first such study of its kind...|$|R

He has been {{occupied}} all {{the day in the}} attempt to convince me that the ancient Amriccans governed themselves!--did ever anybody hear of such an absurdity?--that they existed in a sort of every-man-for-himself confederacy, after the fashion of the [...] "prairie dogs" [...] that we read of in fable. He says that they started with the queerest idea conceivable, viz: that all men are born free and equal--this in the very teeth of the laws of gradation so visibly impressed upon all things both in the moral and physical universe. Every man [...] "voted," [...] as they called it--that is to say meddled with public affairs--until at length, it was discovered that what is everybody's business is nobody's, and that the [...] "Republic" [...] (so the absurd thing was called) was without a government at all. It is related, however, that the first circumstance which disturbed, very particularly, the self-complacency of the philosophers who constructed this [...] "Republic," [...] was the startling discovery that universal suffrage gave opportunity for <b>fraudulent</b> schemes, by <b>means</b> of which any desired number of votes might at any time be polled, without the possibility of prevention or even detection, by any party which should be merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the fraud. A little reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render evident the consequences, which were that rascality must predominate--in a word, that a republican government could never be any thing but a rascally one. While the philosophers, however, were busied in blushing at their stupidity in not having foreseen these inevitable evils, and intent upon the invention of new theories, the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a fellow of the name of Mob, who took every thing into his own hands and set up a despotism, in comparison with which those of the fabulous Zeros and Hellofagabaluses were respectable and delectable. This Mob (a foreigner, by-the-by), {{is said to have been}} the most odious of all men that ever encumbered the earth. He was a giant in stature--insolent, rapacious, filthy, had the gall of a bullock with the heart of a hyena and the brains of a peacock. He died, at length, by dint of his own energies, which exhausted him. Nevertheless, he had his uses, as every thing has, however vile, and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger of forgetting--never to run directly contrary to the natural analogies. As for Republicanism, no analogy could be found for it upon the face of the earth--unless we except the case of the [...] "prairie dogs," [...] an exception which seems to demonstrate, if anything, that democracy is a very admirable form of government--for dogs.|$|R
