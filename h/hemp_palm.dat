5000|$|Bamboo basketry {{is often}} complemented with other {{materials}} such as rattan or <b>hemp</b> <b>palm.</b> Basketry of only these materials also exist. Another is tsuruzaiku (つる細工), the craft of vine weaving, which is popular {{in many parts of}} the northern Tōhoku region where bamboo is more scarce, specifically the weaving of akebia quinata called akebizaiku (アケビ細工).|$|E
50|$|Today {{the garden}} still {{contains}} numerous trees {{planted in the}} early 1900s. It contains good collections of palm trees (Butia, Phoenix canariensis, Washingtonia, <b>hemp</b> <b>palm,</b> and dwarf palm), evergreens (camphor, Cocculus laurifolius, Photinia serrulata, mimosa, Lagunaria patersonia, and Grevillea), and deciduous trees (catalpa, white poplar, Koelreuteria paniculata, Maclura pomifera). Its plantings include Liliaceae (agave, cordyline, dasylirion, dracaena, yucca), and cactus and cycads (Cycas, Dioon, Encephalartos), as well as Cocculus laurifolius, euonymus, oleander, etc.|$|E
40|$|The {{cross section}} of main frame {{structure}} is preferable to be a cylinder for plants and animals in order to adapt to their environment. There are some exceptionals. One of those is a <b>hemp</b> <b>palm</b> branch. It has an up side-down isosceles triangular shape. Since the <b>hemp</b> <b>palm</b> branch has unusually large leaves and a relatively slender branch stem as compared with other trees, the branches must be subjected a large bending moment. A triangular cross section must be a solution for that problem, which can reduce the induced stress about 30 % under a bending stress. Furthermore, the branch is a composite material reinforced by strong fibers. It also constructs a functionally graded structure on fiber distribution. This structure provides a higher strength in the critical loded region than the induced stress there...|$|E
30|$|Many {{studies have}} been carried out on several types of {{lignocellulosic}} fibers such as sisal [10], <b>hemp</b> [11], date <b>palm</b> [12], bamboo [13] and jute [14] and focused on the mechanical properties and chemical modifications to improve fiber/polymer compatibility. Zhou et al. [15] have found that the silane treatment of sisal fibers modifies surface topography, surface chemical structure and thermal degradation of sisal fibers. Li et al. [10] studied the influence of the treatment of sisal fibers with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane in acetone with a concentration of 6 % for 24  h on the performance of vinyl ester composites. The results obtained showed an improvement of 3 % of the tensile strength and 14 % of the tensile modulus of the composites. The strength and bending modulus of the silane fiber composites increased by 15 % and 30 %, respectively, compared to the untreated composites. However, the treatment of the fibers by the silane did not affect the impact energy. Benzerzour et al. [5] studied the effects of silane treatment on the bond characteristics of recycled unsaturated polyester/glass fiber in a cementitious matrix, results showed an enhancement of the fiber-matrix interfacial properties in terms of the pull out energy and the bond strength with an optimal silane content of 0.5  wt%. Michelena et al. [16] considered that addition of organosilane coupling agent to epoxy resin may be a good alternative to the direct chemical pre-treatment of lignocellulosic fibers before composites manufacture.|$|R
40|$|This chapter has {{explored}} {{some of the}} key issues with respect to the sustainable use of materials in construction. It has identified the need to produce quality buildings that are comfortable and healthy to inhabit whilst being energy efficient and utilizing natural resources to their optimum potential. It has highlighted the need to evaluate the use of materials with a whole life cycle approach considering impacts of using the material from cradle to grave, from initial mining or harvesting to eventual disposal including the potential for recycling at interim stages. Methodologies such as ‘environmental profiles’ and the ‘code for sustainable homes’ are available in the UK to facilitate improvement of environmental standards however, it is necessary for each material to be considered in the context of its location and availability as they will affect the resource depletion and the requirement for transportation. A material that can be used sustainably {{in one part of the}} world may not be environmentally benign in another. Local materials generally have minimal embodied transport energy and fast growing renewable local materials can have further advantages of carbon sequestration during their growth period thus reducing their net greenhouse gas emissions. Much scientific research is being undertaken to define the physical properties of local crops such as <b>hemp,</b> straw, date <b>palms</b> and pineapple leaves. Understanding individual materials and the processes they have undergone must be key to the optimal use of the earth’s resources. A re-cycled product may not necessarily be the best environmental option if it has been transported around the world to undergo an energy intensive re-cycling process. As ever the designer must make a decision that will involve compromise in order to optimize the environmental impacts of the building. The decision will also be driven through economic constraints but the selection of sustainable construction materials will benefit from the availability of good data bases and an appreciation of the complex inter-relationships of the individual environmental impacts of materials...|$|R

This paper presents a torsional analysis of a triangular bar based on the 2 -layerd model. Deriving an analytic solution using conformal mapping and complex warping function, the stress distributions and torque were computed. The two layerd bar reduced the maximum shear stress {{as compared with the}} one of a homogeneous bar...|$|E
