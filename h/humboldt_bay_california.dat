5|$|The first {{specimens}} of C.mutica outside of its native range was recovered from <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay,</b> <b>California</b> by Donald M. Martin in 1973. Martin misidentified {{them as a}} subspecies of C.acanthogaster. He named them Caprella acanthogaster humboldtiensis. Additional specimens (also treated as C.acanthogaster or C. acanthogaster humboldtiensis) were recovered between 1976 and 1978 from the Oakland Estuary, Elkhorn Slough, and San Francisco Bay. It wasn't until 1981, when the specimens were correctly identified as C.mutica by Dan C. Marelli.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2010 An {{understanding}} of population demographics {{is a key}} component for developing successful wildlife conservation and management plans. However, elusive and secretive carnivores such as river otters {{can be difficult to}} trap and observe, making investigations of population number and social structure extremely challenging. Advances in molecular genetics techniques have facilitated the use of non-invasive methods to examine abundance and genetic structure of wild populations when traditional wildlife survey methods may not be appropriate. I applied non-invasive methods to estimate abundance, sociality and kinship of a population of North American river otters (Lontra canadensis) inhabiting the <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay</b> area, <b>California,</b> USA. Through microsatellite multi-locus genotyping and closed population mark/recapture modeling, I estimated abundance as 41 - 51 river otters in the <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay</b> region. Coastal river otters associated in family groups, with evidence for the temporary formation of male bachelor groups. There was fine scale population structuring that was most likely a function of social family groups and isolation by distance gene flow.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2012 A {{geographic}} information system allows for the ability to predict potential distributions of spreading non-native species by identifying suitable, unoccupied habitat. Zostera japonica (Asch. and Grabn.), a non-native seagrass from the subtropical western Pacific, has expanded its distribution in the NE Pacific since its introduction in the mid- 1900 s. <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay</b> in northern <b>California</b> and the nearby Eel River estuary now represent the southern extent of its non-native range. In this study, in situ intertidal temperature data were used to predict optimal Z. japonica habitat in <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay.</b> Kriging {{analysis was used to}} produce an interpolated temperature map of the <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay</b> intertidal mudflat during the 2010 growth season, and the scenario of a warmer growth season was examined. Optimal habitat was identified by the amount of time a given section of mudflat spends within a temperature range that is optimal for Z. japonica growth (20 oC ??? 30 oC). The spatial extent of native eelgrass (Zostera marina, Linnaeus) habitat was used to exclude areas of intertidal that, due to interspecific competition, would not provide suitable Z. japonica habitat. The model identifies large areas of upper-intertidal mudflat as optimal potential Z. japonica habitat, especially in northern <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay</b> where Z. japonica has been spreading since 2001, and describes southern <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay,</b> where the non-native is absent, as less optimal than northern <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay.</b> Additionally, the warmer scenario predicts a substantial increase in optimal Z. japonica habitat in South Bay???s upper intertidal and an increase in relative habitat suitability in unvegetated North Bay mudflat as compared to the cooler scenario. The predictions generated by this model have important implications for resource managers monitoring spread and attempting local eradication of this species...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Fisheries, 1972 Studies were {{undertaken}} in 1972 {{on the potential}} of artificial reefs in intertidal waters of <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay,</b> northern <b>California.</b> Underwater observations were made of two types of "low profile" reef structures, made of car tires, placed near an existing reef located in Southport Channel of South <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay.</b> Fish populations around an old shipwreck in intertidal waters of Hookton Channel in South <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay</b> were enumerated by sampling with rod and reel and by direct underwater observations. The "low profile" structure I designed proved effective in attracting fish and producing growth of attaching organisms. The structure was not subject to excessive siltation. The shipwreck attracted transient fish populations, with fish entering the area on the incoming tide and leaving on the out-going tide. Over-fishing an intertidal reef is probably more difficult than depleting subtidal reefs which develop a more resident population of fish. Fishing intertidal and subtidal reefs should result in greater fishing success if fishermen can be directed to them at times when seasonal abundance of fish are the greatest. Fish and invertebrates were studied at a proposed site for an intertidal fishing reef in a newly excavated small boat basin near the City of Arcata, located on North <b>Humboldt</b> <b>Bay.</b> Fauna was sampled over a nine month period using beach seines, plankton nets, and benthic grabs. I found evidence that nine species of fish spawn and that the larvae and juveniles of these species feed and grow for {{extended periods of time}} in the area. The larvae and juveniles of another eight species, presumably having spawned elsewhere, migrated into the vicinity of the basin to feed and mature. Overlying waters of the basin were abundant with plankton. Benthic fauna was low in diversity but high in numbers of individuals. The design of the artificial reef tested in Southport Channel would presumably be unsuitable to the Arcata Small Boat Basin due to a high siltation rate from the surrounding mud flats into the boat basin...|$|R
