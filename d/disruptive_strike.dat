[...] After calls {{to return to work}} by both the airline and Philippine Government, PAL subsequently sought to file charges against the pilots involved for breach of contract. [...] In the same month, PAL announced that it would be outsourcing jobs, with retrenchments resulting. [...] Disputes with flight attendants, ground crew, airport staff as well as reservation agents escalated, with threats of potentially <b>disruptive</b> <b>strike</b> action, which took place in October. [...] On Friday, November 12, 2010, the Department of Labor and Employment approved the lay-off of 2600 employees of Philippine Airlines.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} that flails don't {{reliably}} detonate all the mines in the area being swept, leaving it potentially hazardous. Some mines, such as the Italian MAT/6 mine, {{are designed to be}} flail resistant. Mines that have been buried for many years may become unreliable and fail to detonate when struck, yet they may still be hazardous. Also, some mines are smashed without being detonated. This is referred to as a <b>disruptive</b> <b>strike</b> and still renders the mine harmless, but the ground is contaminated with metal debris and undetonated explosive material. This makes it harder to carry out the necessary manual check of the area after the flail had finished, either with metal detectors or explosive sniffer dogs. There were also anecdotes of mine flails flinging live mines out of the mine field and into safe areas. An experiment with inert mine-analogues demonstrated that this could happen; some mines were thrown over 10 m by the flail and, in one case, 65 m.|$|E
40|$|According to Paul Pierson and R. Kent Weaver, the "new {{politics}} of the welfare state" is about escaping the popular blame generated by cutbacks affecting {{a significant portion of}} the population. Although the concept of blame avoidance helps to explain the political logic of welfare state retrenchment, one can argue that a careful analysis of social policy reform should take into account a largely understudied phenomenon: protest avoidance. Especially present in countries with single party governments and politically active labor unions, protest avoidance is analytically distinct from blame avoidance because it occurs when policy-makers, facing direct and nearly inescapable blame, attempt to reduce the scope of social mobilization triggered by unpopular reforms. In recent decades, successive French governments have successfully introduced major [...] and unpopular [...] reforms in the field of pensions, despite the difficulties to frame blame avoidance strategies in the context of France's strong concentration of state power. Focusing on the 1993, 1995, and 2003 pension reform episodes, this paper seeks to demonstrate that right wing governments have generally tried to avoid protest rather than escape blame. We claim that the key element has been avoiding <b>disruptive</b> <b>strike</b> activities by the labor movement, which are highly political in France. We argue that right wing governments have attempted to divide the fragmented labor movement and overload the reform agenda while enacting its most controversial reforms during the summer holiday season. Protest avoidance thus represents a key political variable worthy of study in the literature on welfare state retrenchment. In the future, the concept of protest avoidance could be applied to other countries and policy areas in which elected officials attempt to impose unpopular reforms that trigger social mobilization. protest avoidance; pension reform...|$|E
50|$|The Steelworkers union {{attempted}} to mollify {{the problems of}} competitive foreign imports by entering into a so-called Experimental Negotiation Agreement (ENA) in 1974. This was to provide for arbitration {{in the event that}} the parties were not able to reach agreement on any new collective bargaining agreements, thereby preventing <b>disruptive</b> <b>strikes.</b> The ENA failed to stop the decline of the steel industry in the U.S.|$|R
50|$|Workers of the Ursus tractor factory {{played a}} large role in the {{solidarity}} movement in the 1970s and 1980s. On 25 June 1976 in response to a rise in food prices, the workers of Ursus, acting in solidarity with workers in Radom and many other areas, went on strike and blocked and destroyed parts of the main east-west and north-south rail lines leaving Warsaw. This was {{one of the largest and}} most <b>disruptive</b> <b>strikes</b> that occurred that day, and resulted in the prime minister announcing on television the withdrawal of the food price increase.|$|R
50|$|Facing {{unsatisfactory}} sales results, {{as well as}} <b>disruptive</b> <b>strikes</b> at the Poissy {{plant at}} the turn of the decade, Ford had been trying to dispose of the factory since shortly after the end of the war. An opportunity arose in 1954, when Henri-Theodore Pigozzi, the founder of the increasingly successful French automaker Simca, was looking for a new plant to expand its operations. Ford France was merged into Simca with both the Poissy plant and the rights to all models manufactured there — including a newly designed new Vedette. The new car had debuted already in France under the name of Simca Vedette, but was sold as the Ford Vedette in some markets (including Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany) at least until 1956.|$|R
25|$|The ACWA also {{benefited from}} the {{relatively}} pro-union stance {{of the federal government}} during World War I, during which the federal Board of Control and Labor Standards for Army Clothing enforced a policy of labor peace in return for union recognition. Hillman was particularly receptive to the opportunities that government intervention in labor relations presented the union; he not only did not have the ingrained distrust of governmental regulation that now marked Samuel Gompers and other leaders of the AFL, but had a firm belief in the sort of industrial democracy in which government helped mediate between labor and management. The government's interest in maintaining production and avoiding <b>disruptive</b> <b>strikes</b> helped the Amalgamated organize non-union outposts such as Rochester and control the cutthroat competition that had prevailed in the industry for decades.|$|R
50|$|An {{overtime}} ban {{is a form}} {{of industrial}} action where employees limit their working time to the hours specified in their contracts, refusing to work any overtime. Overtime bans are less <b>disruptive</b> than <b>strike</b> action, and since there is no breach of contract by the employees there is less chance of disciplinary action by the employer than there is with strikes. However, an overtime ban can {{have a significant impact on}} industries which normally operate outside of regular office hours, such as emergency services, public transport, or retail.|$|R
40|$|The late Prof. Hans Van Werveke, in {{two very}} {{contentious}} articles, had {{contended that the}} monetary policies of Count Lodewijk van Male (Louis de Male) ‘had checked, for some time at least, the decay of the Flemish cloth industry’ by allowing its industrial entrepreneurs (weaver-drapers) to pay their artisans in continually debased silver coins, thereby reducing their real costs and sales prices, which provided the only means by which ‘it could hold out against foreign competition,’ namely the growing threat from the English cloth trade. Although he subsequently wrote an important article on the 1390 monetary reform of the count’s son-in-law and successor, Duke Philip the Bold, neither he nor anyone else has examined the possible impact of that entirely contrary monetary policy, in strengthening the coinage, upon the Flemish cloth industry, {{at the very time}} that the English and Dutch cloth trades had taken advantage of the damages inflicted by the Ghent Revolt of 1379 - 85 and the Hanseatic Embargo of 1388 - 92, to invade Baltic and German markets. This study focuses in upon the consequences of that policy in aggravating ongoing conflict in the industry’s labour relations: in particular the ongoing strife between the weaver-draper entrepreneurs and the fullers, the one group of wage-earning employees that enjoyed some protection from a guild organization. This 1390 monetary reform had necessitated a 25 -percent reduction in wages, along with other prices; and such wage cuts were bitterly resented, with threats of strikes from the fullers of Ghent, Kortrijjk, and Wervik. While compulsory arbitration from the ducal Council of Flanders did impose settlements, and new wages that endured unchanged until the 1420 s, it unwittingly set the stage for subsquent strikes, {{especially in the case of}} Kortrijk, by specifying wages in gold coins as well as in silver coins, with a fixed bimetallic ratio. When the duke’s grandson, Philip the Good, resumed drastic coinage debasements in the 1420 s (to help finance his wars), and in manner that drove up the relative value of gold coins, the Kortrijk fullers then demanded to be paid in gold; and with the drapers’ refusal and a sharp rise in the cost of living, they and the Ghent fullers engaged in <b>disruptive</b> <b>strikes.</b> But the most serious consequence of Philip the Good’s monetary policy was to provoke an English retaliation in the form of bullionist payment regulations at the Calais Wool staple, where the Flemish drapers secured almost all their wools. Those onerous regulations and the conflicts that followed doomed both the English wool trade and the Flemish cloth industry to a sudden and irredeemable decline. ...|$|R
50|$|Work-to-rule is an {{industrial}} action in which employees {{do no more}} than the minimum required by the rules of their contract, and precisely follow all safety or other regulations, which may cause a slowdown or decrease in productivity, as they are no longer working during breaks or during unpaid extended hours and weekends (checking email, for instance). Such an action is considered less <b>disruptive</b> than a <b>strike</b> or lockout, and obeying the rules is less susceptible to disciplinary action. Notable examples have included nurses refusing to answer telephones, teachers refusing to work for free at night and during weekends and holidays, and police officers refusing to issue citations. Refusal to work overtime, travel on duty, or sign up to other tasks requiring employee assent are other manifestations of using work-to-rule as industrial action.|$|R
40|$|Disruptive and {{stabilizing}} selection {{were applied}} to thorax and wing length in Drosophila melanogaster. Disruptive selection with negative assortative mating (D-) practiced on thorax length caused a large increase of the phenotypic variance; practiced on wing length the increase was less <b>striking.</b> <b>Disruptive</b> selection with random mating (DR) caused in most lines only a temporary increase in phenotypic variance, but mean values increased considerably. Stabilizing selection (S) on thorax length or wing length did not decrease the phenotypic variance, but the mean value of the selected character declined. —The proportion of flies emerging decreased in all lines, while development time increased. Variance of development time increased in the D [...] lines.
