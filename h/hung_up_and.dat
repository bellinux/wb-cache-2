500|$|Ned Flanders calls Marge for help. Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney {{are hanging}} around outside the Leftorium, making Ned {{worried that they}} will start causing trouble. Marge {{suggests}} that he shoo them away. The trio are about to leave, but when he goes and asks them to, they decide to harass him instead. Ned calls Marge again, whilst he is standing on a chair with the three boys circling him on their minibikes, so she suggests that he [...] "lay down the law", and {{when one of the}} boys snips the phone cord, Marge assumes that Ned has <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> that everything is fine.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} Saldívar was banned from {{contacting}} Selena, Quintanilla, Jr. drove to Q-Productions and chased {{her from the}} premises and {{told her she was}} no longer welcome there. The same day, Selena and Saldívar argued by telephone; Selena <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> told her husband she could no longer trust Saldívar. According to Quintanilla, Jr. there were four attempts to murder Selena. Selena removed Saldívar's name from the boutique's bank account on March 10, 1995; she was replaced as fan club president by Irene Herrera. The next day, Saldívar purchased a gun at A Place to Shoot, a gun shop and shooting range in San Antonio. She bought a Taurus Model 85 snub-nosed [...]38-caliber revolver and [...]38 caliber hollow-point bullets; the bullets were designed to cause more extensive injuries than normal bullets. Saldívar told the clerk she needed protection in her job as an in-home nurse because a patient's relatives had threatened her.|$|E
500|$|American {{producers}} Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Penelope Magnet, known {{collectively as}} RedZone Entertainment, presented Spears {{with the third}} song they had written and produced, [...] "Pop Culture Whore". While her management liked the track, she rejected it, telling them the song [...] "sucked". After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City to [...] "get in her world", as Magnet explained, {{it was easier to}} [...] "actually write and know what she would and wouldn't say, to know where her real vibe is". Stewart and Magnet began working on the first version of the song; Stewart came up with the track, while Magnet developed the melody on a piano and some of the lyrics. American producer The-Dream became involved after Stewart proposed him to work together on the track for Spears. He explained, [...] "I was just getting into the business. I'm in Atlanta, driving home in a '92 Cadillac, and I get the call [...] I <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> just screamed out joyous sounds." [...] During the recording sessions, Stewart recalls that the studio's air-conditioning died for three days, but Spears [...] "didn't complain or anything, and for me that shows she's where she is for a reason." ...|$|E

2500|$|He drinks whiskey or brandy {{frequently}} and in relatively large quantities. For example, in The High Window, {{he gets out}} a bottle of Four Roses, and pours glasses for himself, for Det. Lt. Breeze and for Spangler. At other times he is drinking Old Forester, a Kentucky bourbon: [...] "I <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> fed myself a slug of Old Forester to brace my nerves for the interview. As I was inhaling it I heard her steps tripping along the corridor." [...] (The Little Sister) However, in Playback he orders a double Gibson at a bar while tailing Betty Mayfield. Also, in The Long Goodbye, he and Terry Lennox drink Gimlets.|$|E
2500|$|General intransitive verbs {{describe}} {{actions or}} events. They {{are divided into}} active, resultative, and neutral subtypes. For example, mwenge (to eat) and laid (to fish) are active; langada (to be <b>hung</b> <b>up)</b> <b>and</b> ritidi (to be closed) are resultative (static); and deidei (to sew, to be sewn) and pirap (to steal, to be stolen) are neutral — they can have either an active or a resultative meaning. Though resultative verbs sometimes resemble passive transitive verbs in English, {{they are in fact}} a class of intransitive verbs in Pohnpeian, which entirely lacks a comparable active-passive voice distinction. For example, Ohlo pahn kilel means both [...] "That man will take a photograph" [...] and [...] "That man will be photographed." [...] Reduplication is frequently productive among general intransitives and adjectives alike. Derivations often include reduplication: pihs > pipihs (to urinate); us > usuhs (to pull out).|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} the fleet kept up their fire, {{with the greatest}} vigour, upon the enemy's works; and, before nightfall, the enemy's fire was completely silenced.

What made me such a fool? Thats what I want to know. Thats the great secret.|$|E
60|$|He {{was a very}} {{substantial}} citizen indeed. His face was like the full moon in a fog, with two little holes punched out for his eyes, a very ripe pear stuck on for his nose, and a wide gash to serve for a mouth. The girth of his waistcoat was <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> lettered in his tailor's shop as an extraordinary curiosity. He breathed like a heavy snorer, and his voice in speaking came thickly forth, {{as if it were}} oppressed and stifled by feather-beds. He trod the ground like an elephant, and eat and drank like - like nothing but an alderman, as he was.|$|E

Job was the only man that ever lived who was really qualified to write a play, and he would have found it pretty tough going if his leading woman had been anyone like Vera Silverton!" ...|$|E
6000|$|On Wednesday a short {{service was}} held, {{the first ever}} known in Mota; and then Mr. Ashwell and Mr. Kerr embarked, leaving Mr. Patteson and Mr. Dudley with their twelve pupils in possession. Mr. Dudley had skill to turn their {{resources}} to advantage. Space was gained below by making a frame, to which knapsacks, bags, &c., could be <b>hung</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> the floor was only occupied by the four boxes, which did the further part of tables, desks, and chairs in turn. As to beds, was not the whole floor before them? and, observes the Journal: 'Now I see the advantage of having brought planks from New Zealand to make a floor. We all had something level to lie on at night, and when you are tired enough, a good smooth plank or a box does {{just as well as}} a mattress.' ...|$|E
60|$|Like {{all great}} inventions, {{this one of}} ours was accidental. We {{discovered}} {{it the first time}} we ran on a snag {{in a bit of a}} rapid. The head-boat <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> anchored, and the tail-boat swung around in the current, pivoting the head-boat on the snag. I was at the stern of the tail-boat, steering. In vain we tried to shove off. Then I ordered the men from the head-boat into the tail-boat. Immediately the head-boat floated clear, and its men returned into it. After that, snags, reefs, shoals, and bars had no terrors for us. The instant the head-boat struck, the men in it leaped into the tail-boat. Of course, the head-boat floated over the obstruction and the tail-boat then struck. Like automatons, the twenty men now in the tail-boat leaped into the head-boat, and the tail-boat floated past.|$|E
