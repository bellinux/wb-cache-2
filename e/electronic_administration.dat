40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare between <b>electronic</b> {{medication}} <b>administration</b> records and paper-based {{records in the}} nursing time spent on various activities in a medication round and the medicationadministration processes followed by nurses in an Australian residential aged care home. It also aimedto identify the benefits and unintended adverse consequences of using the electronic medication admin-istration records. Methods: Time-motion observation, taking of field notes, informal conversation and document reviewwere used to collect data in two units of a residential aged care home. Each unit had one nurse admin-ister medication. Seven nurses were observed over 12 morning shifts. Unit 1 used electronic medicationadministration records and Unit 2 used paper-based records. Results: No {{significant difference between the}} two units was found in the nursing time spent on variousactivities in a medication round, including documentation, verbal communication, medication adminis-tration, infection control and transit. Comparison of the medication administration processes between the <b>electronic</b> and paper-basedmedication <b>administration</b> records identified a procedural problem which violated the organization 2 ̆ 7 sdocumentation requirement. This problem was documenting before providing medication to a residentwhen using the paper-based records. It was not observed with the electronic medication administrationrecords. Benefits of introducing the <b>electronic</b> medication <b>administration</b> records included improving nurses 2 ̆ 7 compliance with documentation requirements, freedom from the error of signing twice, reducing thepossibility of forgetting to medicate a resident, facilitating nurses to record the time of medicationadministration to a resident and increasing documentation space. Unintended adverse consequencesof introducing the <b>electronic</b> medication <b>administration</b> records included inadequate information aboutresidents, late addition of a new resident 2 ̆ 7 s medication profile in the records and nurses 2 ̆ 7 forgetting tomedicate a resident due to power outage of the portable device. Conclusions: The <b>electronic</b> medication <b>administration</b> records may not change nursing time spent onvarious activities in a medication round or substantially alter the medication administration processes,but can generate both benefits and unintended adverse consequences. Future research may investigatewhether and how the adverse consequences can be prevented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As a {{consequence}} of the advance of information technology into the realm of public administration, we are now faced with a potential increase in efficiency of a scope and power not previously seen. The intentional use of information technology to modernise the public sector goes internationally by the name of e-Government. While e-Government’s greatest impact thus far has been to promote customer satisfaction, its guiding spirit is more ambitious, with the fundamental reorganisation of the entire public sector in its sights. The overall {{purpose of this paper is}} to contribute to the understanding of how public administration at a local authority level adapts to impending e-Government by considering the discourses that are manifested and how they are used to understand and legitimise <b>electronic</b> <b>administration.</b> The present study uses critical discourse analysis to shed light on those discursive orders that are revealed in the course of deliberations on <b>electronic</b> <b>administration</b> at the local government level. On the one hand, it is possible to see <b>electronic</b> <b>administration</b> as a refinement- and a reform- of a bureaucracy’s techniques. On the other hand, it is equally possible to view it in the light of free market ideology...|$|E
