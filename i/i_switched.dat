In 1805, he joined Britain in the War of the Third Coalition against Napoleon, but after the massive defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz he switched and formed an alliance with Napoleon by the Treaty of Tilsit (1807) and joined Napoleon's Continental System. He fought a small-scale naval war against Britain, 1807–12. He and Napoleon could never agree, especially about Poland, and the alliance collapsed by 1810.|$|E

2500|$|Mr Dinos {{was then}} aimed, as expected, at the Group One Ascot Gold Cup over {{two and a}} half miles. The {{build-up}} to the race was exceptionally difficult for Paul Cole as seventy percent of the horses at Whatcombe were affected by a viral infection and Mr Dinos had to be kept in isolation, attended only by his stable lad Tom Pirie. Kieren Fallon took over the ride in Gold Cup 19 June and Mr Dinos started 3/1 second favourite behind his old rival Mamool. Black Sam Bellamy, Pole Star, Kasthari and Persian Punch were again in the field whilst the other runners were Fight Your Corner (Chester Vase), Tholjanah (Noel Murless Stakes), Jardines Lookout (Goodwood Cup), Savannah Bay (Prix de Lutece), Pugin (runner-up in the Irish St Leger) and Alcazar. Persian Punch set the pace with Mr Dinos settling third before moving up into second place with nine furlongs left to run. Fallon sent the colt into the lead three furlongs out and Mr Dinos [...] "forged clear" [...] in the straight to win [...] "easily" [...] by six lengths from Persian Punch. After the race Fallon said [...] "I rode a horse who could take me there. He travelled well, he travelled all the way, even though he was a bit lazy.

Cole commented [...] "I've never had a runner in the Gold Cup and it's a race I've always wanted to win. I can't believe it's happened.

40|$|The motor protein myosin uses energy {{derived from}} ATP {{hydrolysis}} to produce force and motion. Important conserved components (P-loop, <b>switch</b> <b>I,</b> and <b>switch</b> II) help propagate small conformational {{changes at the}} active site into large scale conformational changes in distal regions of the protein. Structural and biochemical {{studies have indicated that}} <b>switch</b> <b>I</b> may be directly responsible for the reciprocal opening and closing of the actin and nucleotide-binding pockets during the ATPase cycle, thereby aiding in the coordination of these important substrate-binding sites. Smooth muscle myosin has displayed the ability to simultaneously bind tightly to both actin and ADP, although it is unclear how both substrate-binding clefts could be closed if they are rigidly coupled to <b>switch</b> <b>I.</b> Here we use single tryptophan mutants of smooth muscle myosin to determine how conformational changes in <b>switch</b> <b>I</b> are correlated with structural changes in the nucleotide and actin-binding clefts in the presence of actin and ADP. Our results suggest that a closed <b>switch</b> <b>I</b> conformation in the strongly bound actomyosin-ADP complex is responsible for maintaining tight nucleotide binding despite an open nucleotide-binding pocket.

There was Father on his right side with the other arm under him, just as if his dead body had been thrown there all in a heap.

40|$|Adams and Siegel (1982) {{proposed}} an extra stage cube interconnection network that tolerates one switch failure with one extra stage. We extend their results and discover {{a class of}} extra stage interconnection networks that tolerate multiple switch failures with a minimal number of extra stages. Adopting the same fault model as Adams and Siegel, the faulty switches can be bypassed {{by a pair of}} demultiplexer/multiplexer combinations. It is easy to show that, to maintain point to point and broadcast connectivities, there must be at least S extra stages to tolerate <b>I</b> <b>switch</b> failures. We present the first known construction of an extra stage interconnection network that meets this lower-bound. This 12 -dimensional multistage interconnection network has n+f stages and tolerates <b>I</b> <b>switch</b> failures. An n-bit label called mask is used for each stage that indicates the bit differences between the two inputs coming into a common switch. We designed the fault-tolerant construction such that it repeatedly uses the singleton basis of the n-dimensional vector space as the stage mask vectors. This construction is further generalized and we prove that an n-dimensional multistage interconnection network is optimally fault-tolerant if and only if the mask vectors of every n consecutive stages span the n-dimensional vector space...|$|R
