We used correlation analyses to measure the relationships between mining activities, tourism visits and local <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>productions.</b> We also employed a distance-based technique to investigate the nature of any dependency between mining and tourism sites. Results showed that mining activities tend to be in relatively fluent areas while tourism tends to occur in less developed areas. Our results showed that the location of tourism and mining sites are likely to be close to one another but the two industries usually perform better economically when they are apart from each other. These findings can provide insights on how mining and tourism together may impact the economy and environment in biodiversity rich areas, and provide important information for managers and planners on balancing mining and tourism development in these areas.

Three results emerge: leisure is highly countercyclical while nonmarket hours are acyclical; there has been a large decrease in hours spent in home production since the 1970 s; fluctuations in market output are a good measure of fluctuations in individual utility as long as home consumption and market consumption are either extreme complements or extreme substitutes in the production of utility.

However, the relations among these variables are neither linear nor simple. In an attempt to base said relations on a "bottom-up" perspective, the individual behavior of representative agents of economy, in terms of energy consumption and related carbon emissions, was stud-ied, with particular emphasis on their investment in human capital. It was found that a higher investment in human capital (e. g., education, research) was translated into a better distribution of consumption, with a higher level of energy efficiency and a slight improvement in carbon emissions intensityFil: Castesana, Paula.

It is known that before 1990, the Romanian statistics used a methodology {{which was based on}} the Material Production System (MPS) {{in order to determine the}} macroeconomic indicators (social product, national income). Taking into consideration the experience of the occidental countries and Romaniaï¿½s intention to integrate in the European Economic Community, the Romanian statistics has adopted and gradually introduced after 1990 the National Accounts System (NAS), which is used in the European Community. This article will reveal some aspects regarding the characteristics of the two systems, as well as some observations which aim at the methodology which is used within these systems in order to determine the macroeconomic indicators. Thus, the main characteristics of the methodology of Material Production System are presented together with a particularization of the components of the Global Social Product.
