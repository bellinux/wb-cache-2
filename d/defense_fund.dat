50|$|Similar {{to legal}} <b>defense</b> <b>funds,</b> legal {{financing}} companies provide money for lawsuits but {{are more often}} used by those without strong financial resources. Furthermore, legal financing {{is more likely to}} be used by plaintiffs, whereas legal <b>defense</b> <b>funds</b> are more likely to be used by defendants. Money obtained from legal financing companies can be used for any purpose, whether for litigation or for personal matters. On the other hand, money obtained through legal <b>defense</b> <b>funds</b> are solely used to fund litigation and legal costs.|$|R

Unlike legal financing from legal financing companies, legal <b>defense</b> <b>funds</b> provide a separate account for litigation rather than a one-time cash advancement, though both are used for purposes of financing litigation and legal costs.|$|R

5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental <b>Defense</b> <b>Fund</b> in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E

In 1941, Star Film released two productions starring him and featuring his name in the title. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, PahWongso was held in a series of concentration camps in South-East Asia. He returned to the then-independent Indies by 1948, and raised funds for the Red Cross and ran an employment office until his death.|$|E
5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal <b>defense</b> <b>fund</b> to provide bail funding. The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{noted that}} the Fifth Circuit agreed with Abramski's claim that falsifying the answer to Question 11.a is not {{considered}} material, if the true-buyer can legally buy and possess the gun. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split between the circuit courts, even though Abramski's defense had changed, and he now claimed {{that the answer to}} Question 11.a is never material. Various parties filed amicus briefs supporting either side. Parties supporting Abramski included the National Rifle Association Civil Rights <b>Defense</b> <b>Fund,</b> and West Virginia and 25 other states, while others, like the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hawaii and 8 other states (plus the District of Columbia), filed amicus briefs supporting Abramski's conviction.|$|E
