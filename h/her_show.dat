5|$|In July 2007, the Stuckists held an {{exhibition}} at A Gallery, I Won't Have Sex with You {{as long as}} We're Married, titled after words apparently said to Thomson by his ex-wife, Stella Vine on their wedding night. The show coincided {{with the opening of}} Vine's major show at Modern Art Oxford and was prompted by Thomson's anger that the material promoting <b>her</b> <b>show</b> did not mention her time with the Stuckists. Tate chairman Paul Myners visited both shows.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} in mid-2012 that Sheindlin was the highest-paid television personality, making $123,000 per day, or $45,000,000 annually for the 52 days per year that she tapes <b>her</b> <b>show.</b> In October 2013 it {{was reported}} that Sheindlin was still the highest paid TV star, earning $47 million per year for Judge Judy.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March, Ellen DeGeneres had Grace, Keir, Ceitlin, and Cecelia {{as guests}} on <b>her</b> <b>show.</b> After {{revealing}} that {{she sees the}} dress as white and gold, DeGeneres presented each of them with gifts of underwear patterned after the dress but combining both colour schemes, and show sponsors also gave the Johnstons a gift of $10,000 and a honeymoon trip to Grenada, as they had left their honeymoon early {{to participate in the}} show.|$|E
50|$|Apart from this, she has compeered a lot {{of stage}} shows and {{anchored}} {{a lot of}} programs all around Andhra Pradesh. <b>Her</b> <b>shows</b> were very popular {{and she was the}} star attraction in almost all <b>her</b> <b>shows.</b>|$|R
50|$|She hosts many of <b>her</b> <b>shows</b> barefoot.|$|R
50|$|She hires local erotic dancers for <b>her</b> <b>shows,</b> {{who perform}} {{on stage and}} around the {{audience}}. At one point, there is an audience breakout section: audience members go onto the stage and start dancing. As in all <b>her</b> <b>shows,</b> speaking personally to the audience {{is an important part}} of the performance.|$|R
5|$|The Drowned World Tour was {{originally}} {{scheduled to begin}} with two shows in the Kölnarena in Cologne, Germany but both concerts had to be canceled due to technical difficulties. As a result, 35,000 tickets were refunded. <b>Her</b> <b>show</b> of August 3 at the Continental Airlines Arena in New Jersey was also cancelled, this time due to illness. Therefore, total tour dates numbered forty-seven instead of fifty.|$|E
5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on <b>her</b> <b>show</b> became too much of an effort.|$|E
5|$|Rix Nicholas {{continued}} to experience success in her exhibitions and with regular favourable reviews in the press, such as for <b>her</b> <b>show</b> in the Queen Victoria Markets in September 1920. Nevertheless, Pigot {{has argued that}} {{her place in the}} Australian art world at the time was complex, and her style was affected by vigorous debate around the emergence of modernism, which was being resisted by local critics. Her experience of this more conservative Australia, and the effects of the deaths of all those close to her, contributed to Rix Nicholas abandoning her more experimental art, and returning to more academic and figurative subjects. This ultimately had a detrimental effect on the long-term trajectory of her career. Pigot also argues that her refusal to conform to the gendered expectations of the Australian artistic establishment led to her rejection.|$|E
50|$|In <b>her</b> <b>shows,</b> Kraus {{likes to}} play self-ironically with her image as a silly blonde but having {{achieved}} a straight-A in her Abitur exams, along with more eloquent appearances in talk shows and interviews proves this image to be an act {{for the benefit of}} mild entertainment. Kraus also presents some of <b>her</b> <b>shows</b> barefoot.|$|R

5|$|The shorts were {{featured}} on the first three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show. By the fourth and last season of The Tracey Ullman Show the first season of the half-hour show was on the air. In the two first seasons the shorts were divided into three or four parts, but in the third season they were played as a single story. Tracey Ullman later filed a lawsuit, claiming that <b>her</b> <b>show</b> {{was the source of}} The Simpsons success and therefore should receive a share of the show's profit. Eventually the courts ruled in favor of the network.|$|E
5|$|A sexual {{harassment}} lawsuit was filed against Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{in the previous}} episode, and she must take a {{sexual harassment}} training as a result. In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because she was just like Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets {{so caught up in}} their lifestyle that she forgets to watch <b>her</b> <b>show,</b> The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting to come back to work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order for her to get out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E
5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on <b>her</b> <b>show.</b> Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E

5|$|For {{the part}} of bordello-keeper Fauna, the duo fixed on the famous diva, Helen Traubel. There was {{precedent}} for such casting—former opera star Ezio Pinza had starred as suave Frenchman Emile de Becque in South Pacific, and had received rave reviews for his performance. Traubel, {{in addition to being}} well known for her Wagnerian roles, was also noted for her nightclub singing. In 1953, the new Metropolitan Opera impresario, Rudolf Bing, feeling that she was lowering the tone of the house, declined to renew her contract. Hammerstein had seen Traubel at her first appearance at the Copacabana nightclub in New York, and afterwards had gone backstage to predict to Traubel that she would be coming straight to Broadway. He saw <b>her</b> <b>show</b> again in Las Vegas several months later, and offered her the part. When offered the role, Traubel eagerly accepted, though she later noted that she had never represented herself as much of an actress.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Booker {{attended}} a {{dinner at a}} conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he was seated with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, who had no known ties to Newark, announced in September 2010 that he was donating $100 million of his personal fortune to the Newark school system. According to an article in the New York Times, Booker and Zuckerberg continued their conversation about Booker's plans for Newark. The initial gift was made to start a foundation for education. The gift was formally announced when Booker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Zuckerberg appeared together on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The timing of Zuckerberg's donation was questioned by some as a move for damage control to his image, as it was announced on the opening day of the movie The Social Network, a film that painted an unflattering portrait of Zuckerberg. On <b>her</b> <b>show,</b> however, Winfrey told the audience that Zuckerberg and Booker had been in talks for months and had actually planned the announcement for the previous month, and that she and Booker had to force Zuckerberg to put his name to the donation, which he had wanted to make anonymously.|$|E
5|$|The pair's {{pumpkins}} {{growth is}} slow, and Seth and Emma often clash during their collaboration. They grow closer while watching old films together and discussing their pasts. Seth {{talks about his}} degree in engineering from Stanford University and his decision {{to move out of}} the city in favor of the country, and Emma reveals her childhood dream of hosting her own talk show. When they are interviewed by Emma as part of <b>her</b> <b>show,</b> the Pumpkin Widows share stories of their husbands' obsessions with growing pumpkins. Emma and Seth sneak onto the mayor's farm to find out his pumpkin growing secrets. Emma asks Seth on a date while they appear at a promotional photo shoot in Seattle. Their date is interrupted by Emma accepting an offer from a television executive to be an anchor on a New York City morning news program. The pair's pumpkin starts growing larger; Emma finds the real pumpkin growing journal and learns that the other book was actually Walt's poems to his wife. Emma and Seth win the contest, and beat the record. Rejecting the New York job offer, Emma starts her own talk show in Valleyville along with Seth. Emma pays off Walt's debt with the prize money, and Seth opens his own car repair shop. The film ends with the couple becoming engaged.|$|E
