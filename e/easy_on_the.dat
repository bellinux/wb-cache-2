25|$|In the Canadian oil sands, bitumen {{produced}} by surface mining is generally upgraded on-site and delivered as synthetic crude oil. This makes delivery {{of oil to}} market through conventional oil pipelines quite <b>easy.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, bitumen {{produced by}} the in-situ projects is generally not upgraded but delivered to market in raw form. If the agent used to upgrade the bitumen to synthetic crude is not produced on site, it must be sourced elsewhere and transported {{to the site of}} upgrading. If the upgraded crude is being transported from the site by pipeline, and additional pipeline will be required to bring in sufficient upgrading agent. The costs of production of the upgrading agent, the pipeline to transport it and the cost to operate the pipeline must be calculated into the production cost of the synthetic crude.|$|E
25|$|Night {{operations}} {{gave the}} Luftwaffe valuable experience in using night navigation equipment, such at the Knickebein (crooked leg). By taking bearings and cross-bearings on German medium-wave transmitters, aircraft could find their position sufficiently accurately {{to make the}} discovery of landmarks <b>easy.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> night of 6/7 June, the first Luftwaffe bomb to fall on Greater London was dropped on at Addington, and small raids continued through the month. Thirteen airfields, 16 factories and 14 ports were bombed to little effect. By flying at low altitudes, {{it was possible for}} British defences to detect German bombers with searchlights. Two were shot down in June by anti-aircraft guns. After this period, the bombers flew too high for anti-aircraft fire to be effective. Fighter Command claimed 21 German bombers at night over Britain in June. Seven German aircraft crashed and were credited to fighters. Fighter Command defences at night were weak. The British lacked a specialised night fighter or widespread use of reliable Airborne interception radar. Coastal radar looked out to sea, once a raider had penetrated into the interior, they became difficult to track. Until the following year, night fighter defences remained ineffective at finding enemy aircraft and shooting them down. At the beginning of The Blitz in October, the Luftwaffe flew 5,900 sorties and lost 23—a 0.4 percent loss rate. The failures would cost Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Hugh Dowding, his command in November 1940.|$|E

His voice and lyrics haven't always been <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He's disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful." ...|$|E

Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense as some of the other characters.

500|$|Reviewers have praised Chulip for {{a charming}} presentation, quirky characters, and absurd, Japanese humor. Admitting {{that the game}} had some blurry or {{pixelated}} textures and cramped environments, both Seff and Davis noted the peculiar art style of Chulip to be aesthetically pleasing. Seff specifically found the game [...] "surprisingly <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eyes" [...] and to feature unique character designs, [...] "wacky" [...] dialogue, and an art style comparable to other titles like the Mother series and Katamari Damacy. Davis was amused by the script and the townsfolk's gibberish speech, and was satisfied with largely a cappella soundtrack. Seff was unimpressed by the game's audio, remarking the music as [...] "entirely boring".|$|E
500|$|Walsh was {{partnered with}} new-signing Paul Stewart for the 1988–89 season, whilst fellow new arrival Paul Gascoigne boosted both the club's attacking {{potential}} and drinking culture.

Walsh felt that manager Terry Venables was too <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> players, and particularly too easy on Walsh himself who [...] "needed someone on my case a bit more". He later described the season as [...] "just a blur" [...] as Spurs turned their campaign around to finish in sixth place despite Walsh scoring just six goals from 32 starts and five substitute appearances.|$|E

[...] He commented, [...] "it should be clear that a reader seeking a single, nonredundant and objective account of targeted killing should find another book. On the other hand, this collection of essays provides several original and useful treatments of various aspects of the subject."

500|$|Jon Minifie of The New Zealand Herald {{appreciated}} the game's story, calling it an [...] "entertainingly dark third-person shooter with a well-crafted, noir storyline". In particular, Minifie praised Remedy {{for what he}} deemed a successful port of the game to consoles, especially for the Xbox, noticing that the version features visuals that look similar to those on the PC. However, {{he found that the}} PlayStation 2 port was only [...] "an okay job" [...] that resulted in quality that was [...] "considerably less <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eye", and asserted that it is outperformed by more powerful platforms. The Sunday Timess Steven Poole observed that Max Payne 2 does [...] "exactly the same , only better." [...] He found that enemies react convincingly to damage taken from bullets, thanks to the physics engine. Ultimately, however, Poole described the game as [...] "entertaining but not earth-shattering".|$|E
500|$|For the US press, Gary Arnold in The Washington Post {{thought the}} film was [...] "undeniably <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eyes", and further added [...] "maybe too easy to prevent the mind from {{wandering}} and the lids from drooping."

Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News felt that Fernández's vocals [...] "caresse... every song on Me Estoy Enamorando" [...] and praised his delivery. Taradell also complimented the production commenting that the recording [...] "benefits from Mr. Estefan Jr's hallmark production: uncluttered, bright, <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ears" [...] as well as Santander's songwriting. On the title track, he compared Fernández to Mexican ranchera singer Javier Solís: [...] " [...] Like Solis, Fernandez can whisper soft and compassionate requests for requited love, and belt out tortured sobs of pain while still retaining a macho posture that says, 'Yes, I'm crying, but I'm not giving up'." ...|$|E

[...] Raam Tarat of Future Movies rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praising its performances ("The lead actors share a great chemistry, are <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eye and oh so charming that they, along with beautiful Miami make for a visual treat") and calling it [...] "a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music."

500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] was {{received}} with mostly mixed reviews by music critics. Although a few critics called the song a [...] "peppy" [...] number, others commented {{that they did}} not like the song, and criticized the sexuality of its lyrics and the over-usage of digital sound manipulators. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated that the song and [...] "A Little Bit", the second single released from the parent album, were a [...] "double-punch" [...] and picked the former song as a standout from the album. Cashbox Canada, ranking the song at number ten on [...] "Top 10 Love Songs: The Crush", praised it as [...] "an ode to love at step one". Similarly, Chuck Taylor of Billboard reviewed [...] "Irresistible" [...] favorably, calling it [...] "a sexy, uptempo romp about new found love that proves Simpson's pop intuition." [...] In another review, Taylor complimented the contemporary appeal of the track and felt {{that it would be a}} staple at radios. He also noticed that the breakdown and spoken passages of the song gave it a [...] "street edge", something not previously heard from Simpson. Teresa Gubbins of The Dallas Morning News had mixed feelings towards the song in her review, writing that its sound might help Simpson get attention on urban radios, but did nothing to demonstrate her voice. Larry Printz of The Morning Call also expressed a similar view of the song, stating that the song [...] "is loaded with platitudes, but [...] <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ears." ...|$|E
