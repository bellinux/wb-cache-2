The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of <b>graph</b> <b>theory,</b> specifically of planar <b>graph</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{demonstrate}} the relationships established between an economy’s productive sectors and the water consumption generated during their productive processes. We study de Andalusian reality, region of the South Spain characterized by its scarcity, and we will examine if the excessive dependence on water resources which may occur in some productive sectors might affect not only the conservation and quality of this resource, but also have negative effects upon {{the stability of the}} economy itself. A mixed methodology has been used, combining Input-Output analysis with <b>Graphs</b> <b>Theory.</b> We obtain a water Input-Output model and an interrelationship matrix which is analysed by <b>Graphs</b> <b>Theory.</b> The main conclusion is that Andalusian’s economic specialisation does not make a positive contribution to water conservation and, moreover, that the regional economy’s sustainability might be seriously endangered if the authorities do not take into account water limitations in their economic policy.

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this letter}} is to {{determine}} the minimum node density to achieve a connected large-scale ad hoc network, where every node has the same transmitting and receiving capa-bilities. Due to the log-normal shadowing, links are unidirectional in general. Contrary to the prevailing opinion, we argue that such asymmetries result into a “reduced ” connectivity graph, which, {{from the point of view}} of MAC and routing protocols, is to be considered the true or effective connectivity graph. Accordingly, we derive a new formula for the connection probability between two nodes in order to compute global connectivity. Finally, theoretical findings, borrowed from random <b>graphs</b> <b>theory,</b> are compared to numerical simulation results in synthetic wireless network scenarios.

5|$|In <b>graph</b> <b>theory,</b> a {{bipartite graph}} is a graph whose {{vertices}} are {{split into two}} colors, such that neighboring vertices have different colors. If a connected graph has no odd cycles, then a bipartition can be constructed by choosing a base vertex v and coloring every vertex black or white, depending on whether its distance from v is even or odd. Since the distance between v and itself is 0, and 0 is even, the base vertex is colored differently from its neighbors, which lie {{at a distance of}} 1.|$|E

The book thickness of a graph is the smallest possible number of half-planes for any book embedding of the graph. Book thickness is also called pagenumber, stacknumber or fixed outerthickness. Book embeddings have also been used to define several other graph invariants including the pagewidth and book crossing number.|$|E

5|$|A classic {{result of}} <b>graph</b> <b>theory</b> states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E

40|$|For {{high-level}} synthesis transformational {{design is}} a promising design methodology which combines correctness by construction and interactive design. In this design methodology the design steps are behaviour preserving transformations of one design representation into another. Because {{of the importance}} of visualisation of design-information several kinds of graphs are used as design representations. Transformational design based on graph representation is closely related to rewriting of (sub) graphs. In this paper the formal aspects of transformational design are related to <b>graph</b> rewriting <b>theory.</b> It is shown how a formal framework for transformational design can benefit from <b>graph</b> rewriting <b>theory.</b> Especially preconditions for the application of transformation rules can be based on generally formulated preconditions from <b>graph</b> rewriting <b>theory.</b> Moreover a general graph concept unifies graph representations and a formal framework for transformational design based on this general graph [...] ...|$|R
