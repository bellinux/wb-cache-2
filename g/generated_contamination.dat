El depósito en rellenos sanitarios, la incineración y la aplicación en suelos, son los principales métodos de disposición; los dos primeros son costosos, mientras que el último ha tenido aceptación {{debido a}} que puede ser usado como abono orgánico en cultivos y mejorar la fertilidad de suelos degradados, pero se pueden generar problemas de contaminación. En este estudio se evaluó el efecto de la aplicación de biosólidos en el crecimiento de Jacaranda mimosifolia (Gualanday) y en las condiciones físicas y químicas de un suelo degradado. En invernadero, se sembraron plántulas, utilizando un diseño completamente al azar con cuatro tratamientos y diez repeticiones. Los tratamientos correspondieron a contenidos de materia orgánica en la mezcla suelo-biosólido de 0 %, 2 %, 4 % y 8 %. Se muestreó mensualmente la sobrevivencia, altura, diámetro del tallo y número de hojas, y la biomasa seca al final del experimento. Se realizaron análisis físicos y químicos del suelo, al inicio del estudio y a los tres meses. Los análisis químicos incluyeron pH, carbono orgánico oxidable, Al, Ca, Mg, K, CICE, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, P, S, B, NO 3 -, NH 4 +; y los análisis físicos estabilidad de agregados, densidad aparente, densidad real y retención de humedad. El análisis estadístico se realizó entre tratamientos por cada mes, mediante análisis de varianza y pruebas de comparación de medias (Duncan, 95 % nivel de confianza). Los tratamientos con 4 % y 8 % de materia orgánica, afectaron negativamente el crecimiento de J. mimosifolia, debido posiblemente a la alta concentración de nutrientes y metales pesados hallados en el suelo, lo que pudo generar toxicidad, antagonismo y/o sinergismo. Las condiciones físicas se favorecieron al adicionar biosólidos, aumentándose la estabilidad de agregados y la retención de humedad, y disminuyéndose la densidad aparente y densidad real. The biosolids are organic materials, derived from {{wastewater}} treatment of domestic and industrial sewage. One of the main problems of wastewater treatment plants is the final destination of the biosolids. Their deposit in sanitary fillers, the incineration and land application are the main methods of dispose; the first two methods are expensive, while the last one, is gaining acceptance, because the biosolids are a resource that can be used as supplementary organic fertilizer. Furthermore, land application of biosolids can help to improve declined soil fertility in degraded soils, but it can be <b>generated</b> <b>contamination</b> problems. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of biosolids application on the growth of Jacaranda mimosifolia (Gualanday) and the changes on physical and chemical conditions of a degraded soil. This arboreal specie was planted in a degraded soil amended with biosolids, and was grown in a greenhouse. The treatments corresponded to contents of organic matter in the mixture (soil-biosolid) of 0 %, 2 %, 4 % and 8 %, in a completely randomized design with four treatments and ten replications. Monthly samplings were realized to get information about the variables: survival, height and diameter of stem, and number of leaves. The dry biomass was evaluated {{at the end of the}} study. The physical and chemical analyses were made at the beginning of the experiment and three months later. The chemical analyses included pH, oxidable organic carbon, Al, Ca, Mg, K, CICE, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, P, S, B, NO 3 -, NH 4 +, and the physical analyses included aggregate stability, bulk density, real density and water retention. The statistical analysis between treatments was realized every month, by analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range test, using a 95 % confidence level. The treatment with a 2 % of organic matter was not affected the plant growth and was similar with the untreated control. The treatments with a 4 % and 8 % of organic matter caused a lower survival, a lower growth in height, diameter, and lesser number of leaves and a lower production of biomass. The high concentration of nutrients found on the soil, probably generated toxicity, antagonism and/or synergism problems. The physical soil properties were favored with the addition of biosolids, possibly for its organic matter contents, appearing an increase in the aggregate stability and the humidity retention, and a diminution of the bulk density and the real density...|$|E
40|$|Estuaries are {{sensitive}} environments regarding {{their response to}} anthropogenic events. The accumulation of toxic trace elements, such as Cd and Pb, has detrimental consequences on benthic community composition and function {{that can lead to}} human health issues when seafood is consumed. Eutrophic water can generate blooms of macroalgae and can induce adverse changes in the structure of an entire food web. Environmental research is of fundamental importance to understand the sources, fates and effects of contaminants. It will permit the development of remediation strategies to improve sustainable practices. The approach taken in the research presented is focused on the measurement of trace elements in sediment, water and biota, and the application of stable isotopes in the detection of sources of contaminants. A novel set of data on New Zealand estuarine species, not usually screened for pollutants, has been assembled {{in the context of a}} number of estuarine systems that have been influenced by a range of anthropogenically <b>generated</b> <b>contamination</b> events. The combined use of diffuse gradient ‘in thin films’ (DGT) and the analysis of δ 15 N-NO 3 and δ 18 O-NO 3 in water, are new for New Zealand estuarine systems; the correlations generated will enhance baseline datasets for future environmental studies. This research additionally led to the development of a novel environmental indicator, “Ecohardness”, reflecting the estuarine chemical budget by the analysis of the material strength of cockle shell. From this research, lead, cadmium and zinc were found to be the most concerning polluting elements in the study location, with levels above sedimentary ANZECC safety guidelines. Phosphorus was found in high concentration in urban and rural estuaries heavily impacted by agricultural practices. Isotopic analysis confirmed sources of pollution with higher values of δ 13 C and δ 15 N near treated wastewater ponds. The accumulation of contaminants was also associated with river and stormwater inputs and the intensive use of fertilisers. The accumulation of trace elements was specifically associated with metal pathways rather than sedimentary composition. However, metal speciation is of fundamental importance in ecotoxicology and is regarded as more significant than bulk concentrations in water and sediment in the understanding of biological response of organisms to trace elements. Accumulation of trace elements in biota was found to be strongly associated to those that were captured in DGT devices deployed in the water (‘DGT-labile’ elements). DGT-labile elements can be defined as the “bioavailable” fraction, as this technique uses a hydrogel layer to control the diffuse transport of trace elements in solution, to a binding resin. All labile elements were found in higher concentration in the stream/estuarine environment than the ocean, demonstrating the characteristic of estuaries as a sink for trace elements. Further insight into the speciation of the various elements was permitted by calculating the rate of accumulation in different hydrogel thicknesses. Each element could be classified according to their behaviour ranking from putatively free simple inorganic cations with no resupply from complex ligands (e. g. Cd at Bureta), to fully sustained conditions with a constant degree of resupply of free ions and labile complexes (e. g. Ni, Fe and Cu at Bureta). The development of a novel environmental parameter “EcoHardness”, has application to examining pollutant response in estuarine bivalves. While microhardness has been measured previously in bivalves (cockle shell) and correlated to microstructure, this is the first time that microhardness for the same species was analysed in different estuaries that have different anthropogenic pollution attributes. The method demonstrated an increase of microhardness in response to a decrease of Ca content, that appeared to be inversely correlated to an increase of trace elements that were associated with the general chemical state of estuaries. Hence, harder shells were associated with more polluted estuarine areas. This parameter could be a valuable tool in the assessment of environmental changes linked to the increase of trace metal pollutants as observed around the world in the last few decades. This work has extended research into the environmental health of estuaries by combining a number of known analytical methodologies in a novel manner and through the development of a new technology. In addition, the work has examined a relevant trophic cascade of species further providing an insight into ecosystem functioning against a backdrop of human presence...|$|E

We measured the emission of viable and non-viable forms of airborne contamination from an arbitrary selection of FAW blowers (n= 25) in the operating room. A laser particle counter measured particulate concentrations of the air near the intake filter and in the distal hose airstream. Filtration efficiency was calculated as the reduction in particulate concentration in the distal hose airstream relative to that of the intake. Microbial colonization of the FAW blower’s internal hose surfaces was assessed by culturing the microorganisms recovered through swabbing (n= 17) and rinsing (n= 9) techniques. Particle counting revealed that 24 % of FAW blowers were emitting significant levels of internally <b>generated</b> airborne <b>contamination</b> in the 0. 5 to 5. 0 mm size range, evidenced by a steep decrease in FAW blower filtration efficiency for particles 0. 5 to 5. 0 mm in size. The particle size-range-specific reduction in efficiency could not be explained by the filtration properties of the intake filter. Instead, the reduction was found to be caused by size-range-specific particle generation within the FAW blowers. Microorganisms were detected on the internal air path surfaces of 94 % of FAW blowers. The design of FAW blowers was found to be questionable for preventing the build-up of internal contamination and the emission of airborne contamination into the operating room.

On the device level, new topologies of battery chargers are proposed while, on the system level, the adoption of new filters is a possibility for canceling the harmonics. Another possibility is compensating the harmonics generated by EV chargers [24]. Since the phase angles of harmonic currents generated by one charger are different from those generated by another, natural harmonic compensation or even cancellation may occur. Another concern of recharging the battery of EVs is the additional electricity demand especially that EV electricity consumption is relatively high – around 4000 – 6000  kWh/year for a car (as calculated previously). If vehicles are recharged during normal or peak periods, an additional burden on the power system is created. There are two possible solutions to this issue; the first is charging at night during off-peak hours when electricity consumption is normally low and the other is minimizing the peak current demand which can be achieved through the coordination between charging current and charging time to charge a group of EVs at the same charging station [25].|$|R
40|$|Although the {{randomised}} controlled {{trial is}} the “gold standard” for studying the efficacy and safety of medical treatments, {{it is not necessarily}} free from bias. When patients do not follow the protocol for their assigned treatment, the resultant “treatment contamination” can produce misleading findings. The methods used historically to deal with this problem, the “as treated” and “per protocol” analysis techniques, are flawed and inaccurate. Intention to treat analysis is the solution most often used to analyse {{randomised controlled trial}}s, but this approach ignores this issue of treatment contamination. Intention to treat analysis estimates the effect of recommending a treatment to study participants, not the effect of the treatment on those study participants who actually received it. In this article, we describe a simple yet rarely used analytical technique, the “contamination adjusted intention to treat analysis,” which complements the intention to treat approach by producing a better estimate of the benefits and harms of receiving a treatment. This method uses the statistical technique of instrumental variable analysis to address contamination. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the current methods of addressing treatment contamination and the contamination adjusted intention to treat technique, provide examples of effective uses, and discuss how using estimates <b>generated</b> by <b>contamination</b> adjusted intention to treat analysis can improve clinical decision making and patient care...|$|R
30|$|These examples, {{common in}} Central America, {{represent}} non-destructive human activities that have modified the natural fire {{regimes in the}} region. The practices have the purpose of supporting subsistence food production, but their philosophy is to conserve the forest. These are technologies that have been applied adequately and responsibly, and with the consensus of the community. On the other hand, the poor use of fire is widespread and evident throughout the region. In many parts, the producer simply burns grasslands of the forests at high a rate of spread and intensity to cover the largest surface before the fire-fighting crews arrive. As a result, they have enough new growth to complement feed for livestock, mostly cattle, but also sheep and goats. In these fires, many trees die and erosion is propitiated, along with the <b>contamination</b> <b>generated</b> by smoke.|$|R
