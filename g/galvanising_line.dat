40|$|Model-based {{advanced}} {{control of}} industrial processes requires well-developed process models. The established models are often complex with {{the features of}} multi-dimension, high nonlinearity, strong coupling, etc. Those features make the computational demand of the models conceptually high, especially for large-scale systems, resulting in difficulties in implementation of real-time control systems. This paper reports our efforts in overcoming the difficulties for a large-scale industrial process: a continuous hot dip <b>galvanising</b> production <b>line.</b> The process model is developed first, which {{is a set of}} partial differential equations. It is then transformed into a discrete state space model suitable for computation using digital computers. In order to meet the requirements of real-time control, algorithms are designed to significantly reduce the computational time. The process model and its computational algorithms are implemented and embedded into the real-time control system of the <b>galvanising</b> production <b>line</b> in the real plant. 1...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{becomes one}} of the main concerns of our modern society. A huge amount of energy is wasted in industrial plants as low grade heat. Thermoelectricity is a promising way to partly harvest this heat. However, three main challenges prevent its implementation in large-scale applications: (i) available thermoelectric (TE) materials are expensive and cannot be mass-produced; (ii) the classical thermoelectric generator (TEG) structure is not adapted to large-scale applications; (iii) design methods adapted to large-scale TE systems do not exist. The objectives of this thesis were to face these challenges. Firstly, several prototypes of TEG have been developed using a low-cost TE material processable at large-scale, the Fe 2 VAl compound. Their characterisation showed the importance of the joining technique on the contact resistances and its inﬂuence on the performances of a TEG. Secondly, a new planar TEG has been proposed. The experimental proof-of-concept of this TEG has been carried out and models have been developed for the understanding and the design of this TEG. Finally, a global design procedure for large-scale TE systems based on multi-objectives optimisation has been proposed and applied to design a TE heat harvesting system adapted to a <b>galvanising</b> steel <b>line.</b> The power density of Fe 2 VAl-based TEG has been improved by several orders of magnitude when using techniques involving Cu-Fe 2 VAl reaction. The planar TEG developed during this thesis shows performances similar to classical TEG but could be processed more easily and at a lower cost. The global design procedure overcomes existing procedures. Finally, the TE system designed with this method for a <b>galvanising</b> steel <b>line</b> could recover more than 150 kW of electrical power through the use of Fe 2 VAl.

50|$|After {{the end of}} World War II {{reconstruction}} of the Netherlands began; {{as part of this}} process the steelworks was invested in. A separate company, Breedband NV, was established 19 June 1950, receiving funding from both the state and the United States Marshall Plan. The project introduced a hot and cold rolling mills for thin plate, of 60 and 75 thousand tonnes per year capacity respectively, and a <b>galvanising</b> <b>line.</b> All three installations were operating by the end of 1953. During the same period Architect Willem Marinus Dudok was commissioned to design a head office for the company in Velsen; completed 1953.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} {{residual}} generator for Fault Detection and Isolation in the dynamic closed-loop systems based on the balance of energy which “enters” and “leaves” plants. The main contribution of this paper consists in developing a suitable Fault Detection and Isolation technique to detect faults in single-input single-output closed-loop system based on major signals without the requirement of an accurate static or dynamic model. Indeed, in the absence of conventional input-output models, the proposed method involves the on-line energy balance evaluation to detect a sensor fault. The application to the monitoring of a <b>galvanising</b> <b>line</b> in steel industry shows the effectiveness of the suggested approach when a sensor fault occurs...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} on-line trials have been {{performed}} at steel processing plants where laser ultrasonics {{have been used to}} monitor changes in the material properties along the band. At SSAB Tunnplåt, a major producer of high strength low carbon sheet steels, the equipment was placed in the hot rolling line, during continuous annealing and in the hot dip <b>galvanising</b> <b>line.</b> Trials have also been performed at Outokumpu Stainless steel works in the continuous annealing of the stainless steel strip. Our results show that the laser ultrasonics equipment is fit for industrial steelworks applications, although it is necessary to take the local environment into account when designing the set up. Many mechanisms during steel processing influence the strength level which makes it difficult to find a simple relation between the wave attenuation and mechanical properties for different steel types...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Recent product {{development}} has focussed on developing {{a range of}} higher strength structural grades, covering the strip thickness range 0. 9 - 1. 5 mm, utilising Nb microalloying. A wide range of Nb levels have been successfully strip cast by the CASTRIP ® process. Niobium was found to retard austenite grain refinement and substantially enhanced hardenability, which produced significant microstructural hardening and higher strength hot band. Niobium was retained in solid solution enabling further significant strengthening to be achieved from an age hardening heat treatment. Strength levels ranging from 400 MPa to in excess of 550 MPa, in combination with high ductility, were achieved in the age hardened and hot dip galvanised condition, utilising the annealing furnaces of a conventional hot dip <b>galvanising</b> <b>line.</b> The effect of microalloying content and processing conditions on the microstructure and final mechanical properties of Nb microalloyed UCS products produced by the CASTRIP process are described...|$|E
40|$|The {{object was}} the {{development}} of a measuring method allowing the non-destructive determination of the yield strength Rp 0, 2 and the deep drawing parameters rm (vertical anisotropy) and /r (planar anisotropy) on hot-dip galvanised steel strips during the production process. To determine the mentioned quantities two different non-destructive methods have been developed and tested in a hot-dip <b>galvanising</b> <b>line.</b> An electromagnetic method which allows the measurement of the incremental permeability and futher derived quantities has been used to determine the yield strength. Using a multiple-parameter analysis, correlation relations between the micro-magnetic measuring quantities and the destructively yield strength values of the investigated steel strips have been evaluated. Beside the multiple regression method also a neutral network has been tested. An ulrasonic methods also working on an electromagnetic basis has been used to determine the deep drowing properties represented by the para meters of the plastic anisotropy. The method is based on the direction dependence of the velocity of a SH-wave, (Shear Horizontal) which is strongly correlated to the texture of the material. Both measuring methods were tested online on strips of different steel grades of which the properties were between 130 MPa to 300 Mpa (yield strength), 1. 0 to 1. 9 (rm) and 0. 3 to 0. 7 (/r) ...|$|E
