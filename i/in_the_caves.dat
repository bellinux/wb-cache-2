5|$|A 1000-year-old {{skeleton}} of a woman was discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> by Balch in 1912, and has also traditionally {{been linked to the}} legendary witch. The remains {{have been part of the}} collection of the Wells and Mendip Museum, which was founded by Balch, since they were excavated, though in 2004 the owner of the Caves said that he wanted them to be returned to Wookey Hole.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} were undertaken from 1859 to 1874 by William Boyd Dawkins, {{who moved}} to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey. On hearing {{of the discovery of}} bones by local workmen he led excavations {{in the area of the}} hyena den. His work led to the discovery of the first evidence for the use by Palaeolithic man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caves</b> of the Mendip Hills. Middle Paleolithic tools have been found in association with butchered bones with a radiocarbon age of around 41,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Balch became {{interested}} in stratigraphy and cave archaeology after attending a talk by William Boyd Dawkins. Balch led much of the exploration through the caves near Wookey Hole village, discovering and mapping many caves. He also made discoveries of artefacts used {{by the people who}} lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> during the Iron Age. Balch was a founder member of the Wells Natural History and Archaeology Society and through the society he founded the Wells Museum, largely including his own collection of artefacts.|$|E
50|$|Weingartenloch is a <b>cave</b> near <b>the</b> German town of Osterhagen. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> past, <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> was {{supposed}} to harbor treasures and these rumors lead to several deadly accidents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> <b>In</b> fact, <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> is just a geological monument.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> {{he meets}} with the goblin chief who leads him to a goblin's corpse, the same goblin that was killed on Hangman Hill. Vimes ventures further <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> <b>in</b> search of <b>the</b> blacksmith, but he instead finds Miss Beedle, who spends her spare time here <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> {{teaching}} goblin girls {{how to read and}} communicate with humans.|$|R
50|$|Small mammals whose remains {{have been}} found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> include pikas, jackrabbits, cottontail rabbits, marmots, chipmunks, Peromyscus mice, woodrats, Microtus voles, and {{collared}} lemmings. Larger mammals represented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> include Canis species, red foxes, short-faced bears, weasels, martens, wolverines, American cheetahs, American lions, Equus species, Camelops, deer, antilocaprids, bison, bighorn sheep, and mammoths. Remains of the American cheetah are particularly abundant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b>|$|R
5|$|Eos– The Goddess of Dawn and {{the sister}} of Helios. Eos told Kratos of the machinations of Morpheus, who had taken {{advantage}} of her brother's disappearance. When Kratos found Eos <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caves</b> of Olympus, she advised him to find the Primordial Fires and free Helios' loyal Fire Steeds, as they could find the Sun God. She also provided him with the magical ability, Light of Dawn. She did not appear in God of War III, leaving her fate unknown. The character was voiced by Erin Torpey in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Hollyleaf's Story was {{released}} on 3 March 2012. It details Hollyleaf's experiences beginning from when she is buried {{in a set of}} tunnels at the conclusion of Sunrise until she goes to the tunnels beneath ThunderClan territory to find Ivypool and Dovewing spying on Sol and a group of WindClan cats (in The Forgotten Warrior). When she first goes into the cave, she is saved by Fallen Leaves, the spirit of an ancient cat who died in the tunnels, and lives with him for the remainder of her time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves.</b> The novella describes various ways in which she continues to help ThunderClan during her absence.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas is a rodent in {{the genus}} Juliomys of the {{subfamily}} Sigmodontinae known {{from a single}} broken skull. The specimen was collected by Peter Wilhelm Lund <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, {{in the first half}} of the 19th century and described by Herluf Winge in 1887 as Calomys anoblepas. The species remained unstudied and its affinities unclear until 2011, when it was recognized as a member of the genus Juliomys, which includes three other species from southern Brazil and nearby Argentina and Paraguay. J.anoblepas is probably a separate extinct species of the genus, which is no longer found at Lagoa Santa.|$|E
50|$|Artifacts {{recovered}} from <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> indicate that <b>the</b> <b>cave's</b> inhabitants used spears {{to hunt and}} fish. A ring of smaller stones surrounding a larger stone was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> suggesting that ceremonies were held. Pottery shows that more recent Native Americans also lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gilindire Cave was {{discovered}} by a shepherd <b>in</b> 1999. When <b>the</b> state-owned Mineral Research and Exploration Co. (MTA) undertook exploration works <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> they discovered <b>the</b> lake {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> 450 m from <b>the</b> entrance. <b>In</b> 2002, two Turkish photographers came to <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> by sea, and took photos for the magazine Atlas both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and underwater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake. Archaeologists found potsherds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> belonging to <b>the</b> New Stone Age, Copper Age, and Early Bronze Age periods.|$|R
50|$|While the {{earliest}} human evidence in Guilá Naquitz Cave dates to about 10,750 years BP, inhabitation was not continual {{and was not}} year-long. Humans ceased living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> about 500 BP. Humans lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> six separate timeframes from about 10,750 to 8,900 years BP and again from about 1,300 to 500 years BP. The earlier inhabitants were pre-ceramic hunter-gatherers who lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> only from August to October-December.|$|R
5|$|The early Yavapai practiced {{traditional}} dances {{such as the}} Mountain Spirit Dance, War Dances, Victory Dances and Social Dances. The Mountain Spirit {{dance was}} a masked dance, which was used for guidance or healing of a sick person. The masked dancers represented Mountain Spirits, who were believed by Yavapai to dwell in Four Peaks, McDowell Mountains, Red Mountain (near Fort McDowell), Mingus Mountain-(Black Hills) near Camp Verde, and Granite Mountain near present-day Prescott. The Yavapai also believe that the Mountain Spirits dwelled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> of Montezuma Castle and Montezuma Well in the Verde Valley.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of computer animator Frank Foster, 350 people worked to convert the film into the digital 3D format, for which every scene had to be individually restored, colour-corrected and re-composited in 3D to match the depth. New set-pieces, particularly those suited to the new format were also included, such as digital logs which scatter {{in the direction of}} the camera during the first half of the film when the train collides with them, the gunshot scene which frees Jai and Veeru from their handcuffs, and panoramic views of Gabbar's hideout <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lundomys molitor {{was first}} {{described}} in 1887 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhelm Lund had collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated maxilla (upper jaw) {{from the cave}} chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr.5 and a mandible (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later {{turned out to be}} from a different species, probably Gyldenstolpia fronto. Lund named the animal Hesperomys molitor and placed it in the same genus (Hesperomys) as what is now Pseudoryzomys simplex and two species of Calomys. Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned in the literature on South American rodents; those authors who did mention it placed it in either Oryzomys or Calomys.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> air <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> is very {{different}} from the outer atmosphere. The level of oxygen is only a third to half of <b>the</b> concentration found <b>in</b> open air (7-10% O2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> atmosphere, compared to 21% O2 in air), and about one hundred times more carbon dioxide (2-3.5% CO2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> atmosphere, versus 0.03% CO2 in air). It also contains 1-2% methane (CH4) and both the air and waters of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> contain high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cave</b> is {{more than}} 3 million years old. Finds of Neanderthal bones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> prove that <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> {{was used as a}} shelter by these early {{inhabitants}} of Europe. Wooden footbridges were set up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> <b>in</b> 1860, making it accessible to visitors. <b>The</b> <b>cave</b> became better known between 1860 and 1870, when it was explored by Anton Franz Reibenschuh, a professor from Graz. It was also explored {{at the end of the}} 19th century by Ivan Kač, a municipal secretary <b>in</b> Žalec. <b>The</b> speleologist Anton Suwa died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> <b>in</b> 1969. <b>In</b> 1972 <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> was opened to the public and it was visited by 25,000 people the following year. It has been managed by the local tourist association since 1972.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{named after}} a {{homestead}} that was built near its entrance. The ultimate failure of the homesteaders to find water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> spelt <b>the</b> end to the homestead but their efforts can still be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> entrance.|$|R
5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these {{are probably the result}} of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones {{to the floor of the}} cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves.</b>|$|E
5|$|The steep gorge walls make {{an ideal}} habitat for {{peregrine}} falcons, with a plentiful {{supply of food}} nearby {{in the form of}} pigeons and sea gulls. Peregrines have a history of nesting in the gorge, but having become rare in the British Isles they did not breed and were rarely seen in the gorge after the 1930s. In 1990 Peregrines returned to the gorge, and have successfully bred in most of the following years. On warm days a strong uplift forms in the gorge, on which birds of prey soar while hunting. The gorge also houses large populations of Jackdaw and horseshoe bats, both of which find homes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> and bridge buttresses.|$|E
25|$|Dozens of men, {{women and}} {{children}} lodge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> and shelters for several days, and day and night participate in prayers, processions and songs.|$|E
50|$|Mastodon remains, {{saber-toothed tiger}} bones, American bison bones, {{and other animals}} have been found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> Native American artifacts, human remains, and guns parts have also been located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> Most were taken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> looting that {{followed}} its closure during the 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|There is a <b>cave</b> to <b>the</b> {{south of}} the village known as [...] "Köşekbükü cave". It is {{believed}} that respiration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> cures asthma. According to legend a certain Anna, allegedly a daughter of a Roman Emperor had been cured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b>|$|R
50|$|Crag Cave attracts {{thousands}} of visitors every year. Tourists are given {{a guided tour of}} <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> which takes a half an hour. There are many chambers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> including <b>the</b> Cathedral and the Crystal Gallery. Many of <b>the</b> features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> have been named after locations or characters from J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth.|$|R
25|$|Ruc Caroong Grotto (Hang Rục Caroòng): This {{the habitat}} of Arem ethnic group. They live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves,</b> grottos and on hunting, {{harvesting}} natural products.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} form a sea cave, the host rock must first contain a weak zone. In {{metamorphic}} or igneous rock, this is typically either a fault as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> of the Channel Islands of California, or a dike as in the large sea caves of Kauai, Hawaii’s Na Pali Coast. In sedimentary rocks, {{this may be a}} bedding-plane parting or a contact between layers of different hardness. The latter may also occur in igneous rocks, such as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> on Santa Cruz Island, California, where waves have attacked the contact between the andesitic basalt and the agglomerate.|$|E
25|$|The first {{paintings}} of France {{are those that}} are from prehistoric times, painted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> of Lascaux well over 10,000 years ago. The arts were already flourishing 1,200 years ago, at the time of Charlemagne, {{as can be seen in}} many hand made and hand illustrated books of that time.|$|E
50|$|A Masonic {{ceremony}} was held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> <b>in</b> 1868, {{led by a}} past grand master {{of the state of}} Kentucky. The first Masonic lodge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land, known as the Royal Solomon Mother Lodge No. 293, met <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> on May 7, 1873.|$|R
50|$|Edelmann {{searches}} {{for him and}} finds that Talbot survived the fall, but has turned into the Wolfman. The Wolfman attacks, but suddenly returns to his human form. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> they find <b>the</b> catatonic Frankenstein monster (Strange), still clutching the skeleton of Dr. Niemann. Humidity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> is perfect for propagating the clavaria formosa, and a natural tunnel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> connects to a basement of the castle. Dr. Edelmann takes the monster back to his lab, but considers it too dangerous to revive him.|$|R
5000|$|In 1940, Ion Dinu, a lawyer, found a cave in Ion Corvin, Constanța {{and spread}} the word that Saint Andrew lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> According to Dinu, this revelation came to him within a dream. <b>In</b> 1943, <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> was consecrated and soon a monastery was built around it, named the [...] "Saint Andre <b>the</b> Apostle <b>Cave</b> Monastery". <b>The</b> monks tell that early Christian objects were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> but they were lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meantime.|$|R
25|$|Bohmers {{interpreted}} this to {{mean that}} Cro-Magnons had left these stones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> over 70,000 years before, and this was therefore the oldest Cro-Magnon site in the world. To validate his claims, Bohmers traveled around Europe speaking with colleagues and organizing exhibitions, notably in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to large animals, they also ate very {{large quantities of}} small mammals and birds. 80% of the bones found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> are those of rabbits, {{which would have been}} abundant in the coastal sand dunes. The Neanderthals exploited Gibraltar's location as one of Europe's focal points for migratory birds, by catching and eating them in large quantities. 145 species, representing a quarter of Europe's total, are represented in the finds from the caves, making them the richest sites for fossil bird remains anywhere in Europe. They also ate tortoises and even monk seals, suggesting that they might have hunted or at least scavenged marine mammals. They certainly ate shellfish in large quantities; many mussel shells have been found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves,</b> indicating that the Neanderthals harvested them from the seashore and brought them back over a considerable distance, perhaps carrying them in bags made from animal skins.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinguished}} {{cause of}} endangerment is the past use of DDT and other chemicals which has hurt {{all of the}} birds of prey populations {{as well as the}} bat population (mainly Microchiroptera) which were also killed by human made lighting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> due to the suspicion that fruit-eating bats were harming local crops.|$|E
50|$|Other life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> {{includes}} <b>the</b> Ozark blind salamander. This salamander is {{endemic to}} the Ozarks, {{where it is}} found in several caves. It {{is related to the}} Olm (Proteus anguinus). Though there are also crawdads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> these are not believed to be native.|$|R
50|$|Also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> are fossils, {{a remnant}} {{from the time}} when the area was beneath the sea. There are still living creatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> such as: <b>the</b> glowworms for which <b>the</b> Waitomo <b>Caves</b> are famous. <b>The</b> walls of <b>the</b> glowworm <b>caves</b> were covered with pinpricks of light, giving the effect of a starry night.|$|R
50|$|Natural Trap Cave is a pit <b>cave</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bighorn Mountains, <b>in</b> {{northern}} Wyoming, United States. Excavations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> are {{an important}} source of paleontological information on the North American Late Pleistocene, due to a rich layer of fossils from animals that became trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b>|$|R
