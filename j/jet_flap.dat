50|$|In general, blown flaps {{can improve}} the lift of a wing by two to three times. Whereas a complex triple-slotted flap system on a Boeing 747 {{produces}} a coefficient of lift of about 2.45, external blowing (upper surface blowing on a YC-14) improves this to about 7, and internal blowing (<b>jet</b> <b>flap</b> on Hunting H.126) to 9.|$|E
50|$|The lift of a wing can {{be greatly}} {{increased}} with blowing flow control. With mechanical slots the natural boundary layer limits the boundary layer control {{pressure to the}} freestream total head. Blowing with {{a small proportion of}} engine airflow (internal blown flap) increases the lift. Using much higher quantities of gas from the engine exhaust, which increases the effective chord of the flap (the <b>jet</b> <b>flap),</b> produces supercirculation, or forced circulation up to the theoretical potential flow maximum. Surpassing this limit requires the addition of direct thrust.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was designed purely for test purposes, and thus lacked {{features such as}} retractable landing gear. The shoulder-level wing featured a set of struts, not for support {{but in order to}} provide piping for the compressed air used in the blown flaps. The rear control surfaces consisted of a fairly small triangular T-tail, similar to the one on the Gloster Javelin. The fuselage was fairly simple, similar to the Hunting Jet Provost in layout, but with a smaller cockpit for a single pilot. The air intake for the single Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine was located in the extreme nose. The <b>jet</b> <b>flap</b> system consisted of a series of sixteen nozzles arranged along the trailing edge of the wing, which were fed about half of the engine's hot exhaust gases. A smaller amount, about 10%, was also fed into small nozzles on the wing tips to provide control thrust at low speeds. A similar system was later used on the Hawker Siddeley Harrier for similar reasons. This left little power for forward thrust, and the {{aircraft was}} limited to low speeds, but the takeoff speed was a mere 32 mph (52 km/h), a speed most light aircraft would have trouble matching.|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of twin supersonic plume resonance is defined and studied {{as it pertains}} to high level dynamic loads in the inter-nozzle region of aircraft like the F- 15 and B 1 -A. Using a 1 / 40 th scale model twin jet nacelle with powered choked nozzles, it is found that intense internozzle dynamic pressures are associated with the synchrophased coupling of each plume's <b>jet</b> <b>flapping</b> mode. This condition is found most prevalent when each plume's <b>jet</b> <b>flapping</b> mode has constituent elements composed of the B-type helical instability. Suppression of these fatigue bearing loads was accomplished by simple geometric modifications to only one plume's nozzle. These modifications disrupt the natural selection of the B-type mode and thereby decouple the plumes...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>jetted</b> <b>flap</b> pocket is {{standard}} for hip pockets, {{with a small}} strip of fabric taping {{the top and bottom}} of the slit for the pocket.

[...] However, because this fact is now often ignored and the flap is seen as an accessory that completes the style, it is commonly left out indoors, even during formal events.|$|R

40|$|A submerged, {{vertical}} turbulent plane {{water jet}} impinging onto a free surface will be self-excited into a flapping oscillation when the jet velocity, leaving the jet orifice, exceeds a critical value. The flapping phenomenon was verified simultaneously {{in this paper}} by laser Doppler velocimeter measurement and numerical analyses with volume of fluid approach coupled with a large eddy simulation turbulent model. The general agreement of mean velocities between numerical predictions and experimental results in self-similar region is good for two cases: Reynolds numbers 2090 and 2970, which correspond to the stable impinging <b>jet</b> and <b>flapping</b> <b>jet.</b> Results show that the <b>flapping</b> <b>jet</b> is a new flow pattern for submerged turbulent plane <b>jets</b> with characteristic <b>flapping</b> frequency, and that the decay of the mean velocity along the jet centerline is considerably faster {{than that of the}} stable impinging state...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} {{were made of}} the force characteristics of a naturally ventilated hydrofoil of finite span submerged below a free surface and equipped with a <b>jet</b> <b>flap.</b> Jet momentum coefficients up to 0. 35 were attained. The increment of lift associated with action of the <b>jet</b> <b>flap</b> was primarily dependent on the jet momentum coefficient and the flap angle. Measured lift increments were considerably less than those calculated by Ho from linearized theory for two-dimensional foils and zero cavitation number. Thrust recovery was dependent on the jet momentum coefficient and the flap angle, decreasing as these parameters were increased. In. all cases thrust recovery was greater than the horizontal component of the jet reaction. A brief series of tests was also conducted with a restrained, <b>jet</b> <b>flap</b> foil moving through a regular wave train.

40|$|A 0. 25 -scale semispan wing/body {{model with}} {{two types of}} jet flaps was tested in the Ames 11 - by 11 -Foot Transonic Wind Tunnel.

Maximum thrust coefficients were limited to 0. 12. Angle of attack was varied from - 4 deg to 15 deg for Mach numbers between 0. 6 and 0. 95 at a constant unit Reynolds number of 18. 0 million/m (5. 5 million/ft).

40|$|A {{large-scale}} STOL {{transport model}} with a new <b>jet</b> <b>flap</b> propulsive-lift system was subject to wind-tunnel testing. Aerodynamically, this IBF system combines {{the benefits of the}} <b>jet</b> <b>flap</b> and the mechanical flap with boundary layer control. Structurally, it creates its own spanwise air duct with the deflection of the mechanical flap. An additional short-chord control flap, located at the jet-flap exit, provides a powerful means for flight path and lateral controls. The results show that the overall effectiveness of this flap system compares well with other <b>jet</b> <b>flap</b> propulsive-lift systems.

50|$|Blown <b>flaps,</b> or <b>jet</b> <b>flaps,</b> are powered {{aerodynamic}} high-lift devices used on {{the wings}} of certain aircraft to improve their low-speed flight characteristics. They use air blown through nozzles to shape the airflow over the rear edge of the wing, directing the flow downward to increase the lift coefficient. There are a variety of methods to achieve this airflow, most of which use jet exhaust or high-pressure air bled off of a jet engine's compressor and then redirected to follow the line of trailing-edge flaps.|$|R
40|$|A submerged, vertical, {{turbulent}} plane jet impinging onto a {{free water}} surface will be self-excited into a flapping oscillation when the jet velocity, exiting the jet orifice, exceeds a critical value. The {{dependence of the}} critical velocity W- 0 c and the flapping frequency f(0) on the water depth H and the jet orifice width d was investigated in detail in this study. The <b>jet</b> <b>flapping</b> motion was visualized by a laser induced fluorescence technique and measured with a laser Doppler velocimeter; a supplemental measurement of the displacement of water surface by a surface wave gauge was made. The <b>jet</b> <b>flapping</b> characteristics are interpreted {{in terms of the}} effective water depth given by H-e = H-z 0, where z(0) is the virtual origin of the jet. The critical jet exit velocity was found to increase linearly with the effective water depth and to decrease with the square root of the jet orifice width. The flapping frequency decreased with the root square of the effective water depth and independent of the jet orifice width. These results led to a critical condition for the onset of instability as St = 0. 929 [(H - z(0)) /d](- 3 / 2), where St is the critical Strouhal number defined by St = f(0) d/W- 0 c...|$|R

40|$|Wind-tunnel {{acoustic}} investigations {{were performed}} to determine the acoustic characteristics {{and the effect of}} forward speed on the over-the-wing externally blown <b>jet</b> <b>flap</b> (OTW), the under-the-wing externally blown <b>jet</b> <b>flap</b> (UTW), the internally blown <b>jet</b> <b>flap</b> (IBF), and the augmentor wing (AW). The data presented represent the basic noise generated by the powered-lift system without acoustic treatment, assuming all other noise sources, such as the turbofan compressor noise, have been suppressed. Under these conditions, when scaled to a 100, 000 -lb aircraft, the OTW concept exhibited the lowest perceived noise levels, because of dominant low-frequency noise and wing shielding of the high-frequency noise. The AW was the loudest configuration, because of dominant high-frequency noise created by the high jet velocities and small nozzle dimensions.
