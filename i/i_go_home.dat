500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} seventh win {{of the season in}} front of 90,000 who attended the race. Johnson also earned $267,001 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I guess {{it could have been a}} statement we were sending. There was a lot of pressure. All week long, we wondered if we could step up like we did today. I'm very proud how we rose to the occasion.", he continued, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> tonight, I'm going to be (mentally) driving laps, what I think I need to do in qualifying trim so I can put my best effort in on Friday. Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas was such a good lesson. And I hope that the points we lost in Texas isn't what keeps us from winning this championship." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "That {{might be}} my longest run ever", Martin (a Pittsburgh native) {{said after the}} game about his 78-yard score. [...] "College, Pop Warner, everything. To me, the Steelers are my second-favorite team. I kind of worry about when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> how infamous I'll be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{previously}} {{stated that}} filming the baby swap storylines [...] "did not stretch her acting abilities". She told Buzz: [...] "None of it's been really tough for me, {{to tell you}} the truth. I go in, do my scenes and then <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> As an actress you want to get roles you can get your teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E

2500|$|Williams stated {{his love}} for Toronto and {{mentioned}} the possibility of returning to the Canadian game during his professional career. [...] "I was thinking it wouldn't be bad to come back up here and kind of follow the same steps as Pinner – play here a couple years and maybe {{get a chance to}} coach up here", Williams said. [...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You feel like you have a life. I come to work, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> play with my kid, walk to the store. It's really nice. I get to teach. It's wonderful here." [...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I came back here, you can put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. The NFL is so structured— 'You do this.' Here I can do so much." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, this is {{my first}} visit to any place of the sort, but I thought that I should like to go the rounds before <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> again." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> pleasantly {{excited by}} this encounter. After months of {{unbroken}} solitude {{in the midst}} of throngs of strangers, this man's cordial invitation meant much to me.|$|R
