5|$|After playing only 22 total minutes since January 27, Morgan played {{more minutes}} (17) {{than the other}} low post players (McGary, Horford, and Max Bielfeldt) {{for the first time}} on February 24 against Illinois. Michigan {{defeated}} Illinois 71–58 behind 26 points and 8 assists from Burke. In the game, Burke became the seventh Wolverine sophomore to reach 1000 career points. On February 27, Michigan surrendered a 15-point second-half lead to give Penn State its only conference win of the season. Following the game, the team called a rare players-only meeting at the Pizza House, with fifth-year reserve Corey Person <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> talking.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rachel (Lea Michele) {{realizes that}} some glee club members are faking their singing. She tells glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), complaining {{that she is}} <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work, exhausting herself and getting ill in the process. She reveals the non-participants as Finn (Cory Monteith), Quinn (Dianna Agron), Puck, Brittany (Heather Morris), and Santana. Will gathers the students and gives them a new task for the week: each club member {{will have to do}} solos, and each must choose a song that best represents their feelings.|$|E
5|$|When hunting large prey, {{the coyote}} often works in pairs or small groups. Success in killing large {{ungulates}} depends on {{factors such as}} snow depth and crust density. Younger animals usually avoid participating in such hunts, with the breeding pair typically <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work. Unlike the wolf, which attacks large prey from the rear, the coyote approaches from the front, lacerating its prey's head and throat. Like other canids, the coyote caches excess food. Coyotes catch mouse-sized rodents by pouncing, whereas ground squirrels are chased. Although coyotes can live in large groups, small prey is typically caught singly. Coyotes have been observed to kill porcupines in pairs, using their paws to flip the rodents on their backs, then attacking the soft underbelly. Only old and experienced coyotes can successfully prey on porcupines, with many predation attempts by young coyotes resulting in them being injured by their prey's quills. Coyotes sometimes urinate on their food, possibly to claim ownership over it.|$|E

5|$|In January 2016, Wintory {{started a}} Kickstarter for a Journey Live concert tour, {{in which the}} fifteen-piece Fifth House Ensemble from Chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works {{their way through the}} game. The {{ensemble}} will react to the player's actions, using a specially-scored version of the soundtrack, composed by Patrick O'Malley with Wintory's oversight, that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction. Wintory had wanted to do a performance of the Journey soundtrack in this interactive manner, but did not have the time to rework the soundtrack for this purpose. Wintory came to know Dan Visconti, the composer for Fifth House Ensemble, after Visconti published his praise for the Journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members of the ensemble to play the game. The group saw how Journeys soundtrack had been used for various Video Games Live concerts and believed they could pull off Wintory's vision of an interactive concert, <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reworking of the soundtrack under Wintory's direction. Sony has provided Wintory with a version of the game developed by Tricky Pixels that disables the music to allow the ensemble to provide this, and other modifications required for the concert performance. The Kickstarter was launched for $9,000 in funding for a four-city tour, but within a few days already surpassed its funding levels, allowing for more cities to be included.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

25|$|In January 1789, Arthur St. Clair, American {{governor}} of the Northwest Territory, concluded two separate peace treaties {{with members of the}} Western Confederacy. The first was with the Iroquois, except for the Mohawk, and the other was with the Wyandot, Lenape, Ottawa, Potawotami, Sac, and Ojibway. The Mohawk, the Shawnee, the Miami, and the tribes of the Wabash Confederacy, who had been <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting, not only refused to go along but became more aggressive, especially the Wabash tribes.|$|E
25|$|The match, {{scheduled}} for three days, was finished in two. Cambridge scored 147 {{in their first}} innings. Oxford made 175 in reply, with Cobden taking 4/41. Cambridge slumped to 40/5 in their second innings, only 12 runs ahead, with C.K. Francis <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damage. W. Yardley then came in to join J.W. Dale, and they added 116 for the sixth wicket. Yardley made exactly 100, the first hundred ever made in the fixture. Dale scored 67. Cambridge finished with 206, with Francis taking 7/102.|$|E

25|$|In 1916 the NAWSA {{purchased}} the Woman's Journal from Alice Stone Blackwell. The newspaper {{had been established}} in 1870 by Blackwell's mother, Lucy Stone, and had served as the primary voice of the suffrage movement {{most of the time}} since then. It had significant limitations, however. It was a small operation, with Blackwell herself <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work, and with much of its reporting centered on {{the eastern part of the}} country at a time when a national newspaper was needed.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, the {{problems}} with pushers and helpers arose not from the hardware but the politics and the economics. In the 1880s, the BR and the Erie shared locomotive facilities at Clarion Junction. They had an agreement that each company would provide helper service {{to each other on}} the basis of whose engine was first up at the enginehouse when a train came along needing a push. After some years of this, the BR management realized that their engines were <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work. The Erie crews had acquired the knack of finding something wrong with their engines, keeping them conveniently immobilized {{when it was time for}} work. The agreement ended.|$|E
25|$|Hayes {{moved to}} Sausalito, California in 2000. He became {{the public face}} of the duo, <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> media. Hayes {{announced}} that Savage Garden had broken up in October 2001 during a chat with an Australian journalist. Hayes thought the information would be saved for a later article; it was not. When confronted with this information during the early morning hours, before an unrelated interview, Jones denied the break-up of the band. However, it appears that Jones did not believe the reporter was accurately quoting Hayes and denied what he thought was yet another breakup rumour. Still, the fact that Jones took a back seat in all promotional activities for Affirmation seems indicative that Jones was not content to remain within Savage Garden as it had operated in the past. Savage Garden had sold over 23 million albums by that stage.|$|E

25|$|Len Hutton (80) and Bill Edrich (20) saw England {{though to}} stumps {{and took the}} score to 60 the next morning before the first wicket fell. Cowdrey (79) added 99 with Hutton looking certain for a century before he smashed the ball into Alan Davidson's back, where it lobbed up for an easy, if painful, catch. Colin Cowdrey and Denis Compton (44) took the score to 230/3 {{by the end of}} the day and England were {{confident}} of a first innings lead, but they both fell early next morning and though the lower middle order all got going the tail collapsed again and the last four wickets fell for 20 runs and the last seven wickets for 111. Still 341 was England's highest score so far in the series and gave them a slim 18 run lead, the leg-spinner Richie Benaud (4/120) <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work.|$|E
25|$|Anstis did {{not stand}} for {{election}} to Parliament in 1705. In May 1707 Anstis was nominated Carlisle Herald of Arms Extraordinary and Norfolk Herald. This {{was part of a}} plan to persuade Garter St George to administer the office jointly with Anstis <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work. In spite of the nomination, Anstis was never appointed to either post. Anstis's main rival to succeed St George was now John Vanbrugh, who had become as Clarenceux King of Arms in March 1704 to strengthen his own claims to the office. In December 1710 Anstis used a change in administration to try again at securing the Gartership. On 20 January 1711 Anstis was re-elected to Parliament and changed his strategy with St George. He continued to secure offices related to public records for himself and he remained loyal to the tory ministry in Parliament. With his influential political friends Anstis was eventually able to obtain promise of an appointment to the office of Garter King of Arms, on 2 April 1714.|$|E
25|$|With Alec Bedser and the spinners <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{work against}} South Africa in 1951, Statham {{had to do}} {{very little in the}} Tests, but he only missed 100 {{first-class}} wickets due to injury and showed himself a formidable bowler on a pitch offering help. In India, his average was good, but the heat and humidity certainly seemed to take their toll upon his body and he did little in the Tests, with the result that he was not chosen for a Test match in 1952 even though he was gaining speed and straightness and was often extremely formidable despite conditions rarely favouring bowlers. In 1953, Statham was within a whisker of heading the first-class averages and bowled wonderfully on the most placid of pitches against Hampshire, but Bedser ensured he was not needed in the Ashes Tests. Statham and fellow fast-bowler Fred Trueman were on occasion, in 1953, called up to the Test squad, but with the England team maturing, the captain, Len Hutton did not feel comfortable playing two fast-bowlers, often preferring the more economical, slower bowling of Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. This meant that Statham and Trueman rarely bowled in tandem in this period.|$|E
