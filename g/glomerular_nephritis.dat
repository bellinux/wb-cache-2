40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} pattern of glomerular disease (GD) from the result of renal biopsies at our center. Methods: We {{conducted}} a retrospective review of 190 adult native renal biopsy reports from the pathology registry of renal biopsy performed at our hospital between 1992 and 2010. Results: Lupus nephritis {{was the most common}} pathology 48 / 133 (36. 1 %) with a female preponderance. The most common primary glomerular disease was focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) 26 / 133 (19. 5 %), followed by membranous glemerulopathy (MGN) 13 / 133 (9. 8 %), and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis 6 / 133 (4. 5 %). IgA nephropathy and acute proliferative glomerulonephritis each accounted for 4 / 133 (3. 0 %). Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis accounted for 3 / 133 (2. 3 %). Focal proliferative and cresentic glomerulonephritis each accounted for 2 / 133 (1. 5 %). Vasculitis was not common and there was no report of anti-GBM disease. Conclusion: Among the secondary <b>glomerular</b> diseases, lupus <b>nephritis</b> was the commonest condition with a female preponderance.

40|$|It is {{believed}} by many that acute <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> follows as {{a sequel to}} some infectious process, the cause of which is usually streptococci, often of the hemolytic type. Observations on the forms of infection associated with acute diffuse <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis,</b> and the varieties of bacteria producing these infections have been published elsewhere (1). In another paper (2) there was some discussion {{of the idea that}} the onset of the acute attack of <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> was dependent, not exclusively upon the acute infection, but, in addition, upon an altered reaction of the body to the infection, an allergic state which might render the ceils and capillaries of the kidney peculiarly vulnerable to injury. The attempts of many investigators to produce <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> in animals by the intravenous or subcutaneous injections of bacteria, or by the products of their growth or disintegration, have been only partially and irregularly successful. A series of experiments was therefore devised to determine whether an induced state of hypersensitiveness could be produced, that would increase or alter the response of the kidney cells to large doses of bacterial bodies when they were brought in concentrated form directly in contact with the renal circulation. The experimental production of <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> in animals has been recently reviewed by McNider (3), Leiter (4) and Fishberg (5).

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in this paper that {{structural}} and functional changes in acute <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> in rabbits produced by nephrotoxins by the method of Masugi are the same as those found in human <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis.</b> The morbid anatomy is characterized by glomerular cell proliferation, and in some cases by deposition of fibrin and crescent formation of the glomeruli and by fatty changes of the tubules. The functional changes are: oliguria, proteinuria, hematuria, cylindruria, edema, rise in blood urea, and according to Masugi (1933, 1934) and Smadel (1936, 1937), rise in blood pressure, lipuria, and fall in urea clearance and plasma proteins. As we are unaware of any discrepancies between the experimentally induced disease and human nephritis, the conclusion follows that the two so closely resemble each other that they appear to be identical. As to the pathogenesis, it {{has been shown}} that the disease begins with a period of latency. This is characterizied anatomically by hyperemia of the glomeruli; and functionally, in at least a number of cases, by an increased diuresis. It follows, therefore, that the theory of Volhard, according to which <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> is caused by arteriolar spasms, can no longer be maintained. It has further been demonstrated that proliferation of glomerular cells is the typical lesion, and that deposition of fibrin and crescent formation occur only in certain cases, and in these only in a widely varying number of glomeruli. As crescents are found as early as the proliferation itself, it follows that they should not be regarded as pathognomonic of the subacute phase, but that they represent a complication which probably aggravates the disease. As to correlation of morphological and functional changes, it has been demonstrated that oliguria, marked proteinuria and diminished excretion of cyanol appear at the time when the glomerular changes are at their peak. Evidence has been presented that the oliguria and the decrease in cyanol excretion in acute <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> are chiefly the result of the glomerular damage. It has further been demonstrated that the excretion of azofuchsin was unchanged, except for a diminution in the rabbit which at autopsy showed a marked fatty change of the tubules. We regard these observations as evidence, that, in acute <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> in rabbits, glomeruli and tubules may function independently of each other...|$|E
40|$|Podocytes hold a {{strategic}} {{position in the}} regulation of the trafficking between the glomerular and tubular compartments. Defects in the expression of podocytic proteins or injury to podocytes may result in heavy proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and loss of kidney function. The process {{is associated with the}} infiltration to the tubulointerstitium by inflammatory cells. Previous findings suggest that soluble mediators from renal tubular epithelial cells (TEC) stimulate the proliferation of mesangial cells, which involves a bi-directional tubuloglomerular ‘crosstalk' mechanism, and is likely to operate in different <b>glomerular</b> and interstitial <b>nephritis.</b> While increasing evidence has demonstrated the pathogenic role of glomerulopodocytic communication in podocytic injury from various forms of glomerulonephritides, research into the implication of podocyte-TEC crosstalk in the progression of tubulointerstitial injury is still limited. We review in this article how podocyte pathology leads to subsequent tubulointerstitial atrophy and fibrosis and explore whether tubulointerstitial injury affects the development or progression of podocytic injury. A cytokine crosstalk network between TEC and podocyte with the participation of interstitial immunocompetent cells can be envisaged as the driving force of tubulointerstitial injury, which is a strong predictor of renal failure. An in-depth understanding of the interaction between podocyte and TEC in acute or chronic injury may lead to better design of potential therapeutic options. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|R

Primary glomerular disease {{was found to be}} the most prevalent, accounting for 63. 5 &#x 0025; of all glomerular diseases. Among primary glomerular diseases, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was the most common histological lesion (34. 6 &#x 0025;) and was associated with a high prevalence of hypertension (86. 4 &#x 0025;), nephrotic syndrome (68. 18 &#x 0025;), hematuria (63. 6 &#x 0025;) and renal functional impairment (27. 3 &#x 0025;).

To assess the functional relevance of fibrillin- 1 for cell–matrix interactions in the glomerulus, we studied the attachment, spreading, migration and proliferation of mesangial cells on fibrillin- 1 and the regulation of fibrillin- 1 in experimental anti-Thy 1. 1 nephritis displaying mesangial cell migration and proliferation in vivo. During the acute phase of experimental Thy 1. 1 <b>nephritis,</b> <b>glomerular</b> fibrillin- 1 messenger ribonucleic acid expression and protein immunoreactivity were significantly induced as compared to controls. In a hexosaminidase-based adhesion assay, mesangial cells showed concentration-dependent attachment to fibrillin- 1, similar to what was observed for fibronectin. The cell attachment was Arg–Gly–Asp dependent. Further, fibrillin- 1 significantly promoted spreading and focal contact formation detected by immunostaining for vinculin. Mesangial cell migration, assessed by a transmigration assay, and proliferation, measured by a 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxy-uridine incorporation assay, were augmented by fibrillin- 1. In diabetic mice underexpressing fibrillin- 1, glomerular cell proliferation, determined by counting proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells in renal sections, was significantly lower than in diabetic control mice. We conclude that fibrillin- 1 promotes mesangial cell attachment, spreading, migration, and proliferation. We speculate that fibrillin- 1 may thus contribute to mesangial hypercellularity during glomerular disease...|$|R
40|$|Production of anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} is {{a hallmark}} of lupus nephritis, but how these antibodies deposit in organs and elicit inflammatory damage remains unknown. In this study, we sought to identify antigens {{on the surface of}} human mesangial cells (HMC) that mediate the binding of human anti-dsDNA antibodies and the subsequent pathogenic processes. We isolated anti-dsDNA antibodies from patients with lupus nephritis by affinity chromatography. We used multiple methods to identify and characterize antigens from the plasma membrane fraction of mesangial cells that crossreacted with the anti-dsDNA antibodies. We found that annexin II mediated the binding of anti-dsDNA antibodies to HMC. After binding to the mesangial cell surface, anti-dsDNA antibodies were internalized into the cytoplasm and nucleus. This also led to induction of IL- 6 secretion and annexin II synthesis, mediated through activation of p 38 MAPK, JNK, and AKT. Binding of anti-dsDNA antibodies to annexin II correlated with disease activity in human lupus <b>nephritis.</b> <b>Glomerular</b> expression of annexin II correlated with the severity of nephritis, and annexin II colocalized with IgG and C 3 deposits in both human and murine lupus nephritis. Gene silencing of annexin II in HMC reduced binding of anti-dsDNA antibody and partially decreased IL- 6 secretion. In summary, our data demonstrate that annexin II mediates the binding of anti-dsDNA antibodies to mesangial cells, contributing to the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.

40|$|Of the {{two methods}} of {{correlating}} morphologic and functional changes in renal disease, clinical and experimental, the former has been repeatedly utilized with but moderate success, for when most patients die {{it is difficult}} to interpret the complex morphological alterations in the kidneys. The application of the experimental method, on the other hand, has been limited by our inability to reproduce the more important disorders.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{comparative}} and {{longitudinal study of}} the previous history of the renal diseases and urine abnormalities in the students of Kyushu University. The past history of the renal diseases and/or urinary abnormality was previously obtained by the questionnaire {{at the time of}} the freshman registration. In case of incomplete or obscure history, the students were interviewed by one of the medical staffs of the Institute of Health Science and detailed medical histories were obtained. These medical histories of the renal diseases were compared with the results of urine examination carried out {{at the time of the}} annual health examination. 1). Among 13, 438 freshmen and women of Kyushu University during the last 7 years (from 1980 to 1986), the history of the renal diseases and/or urinary abnormalities were found in 1, 322 students (9. 8 %). The incidence of renal diseases was higher than that of 8. 6 % studied in the previous period from 1975 to 1979 and the persistent increase was observed in the incidence of the renal diseases and/or urinary abnormalities during the last 14 years (6. 4 % in students during the years from 1972 to 1974; 4. 0 % during the years from 1967 to 1971) (p< 0. 01). This was mainly due to the increase of the cases with urinary abnormalities found by urinalyses which had been conducted every year under the guidance of the Ministry of Education based on the revised regulation for the annual school health examinations since 1974. 2). Out of 1, 322 students with the history of the renal diseases and/or urinary abnormalities, 800 (60. 5 %) were the students found at the annual school health examinations. This rate of 60. 5 % was much higher than that of 44. 3 % in the previous period of 5 years Institute of Health Science, Kyushu University 11. Kasuga 816, Japan.

During the last 7 -year period, however, there was no significant, yearly increase in the rate of urinary abnormalities found by the school health examination. 3). Among the diagnoses of the renal diseases in the students, acute <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> was found in 187 students (incidence: 13. 9 / 1, 000 students; the cases found by the school health examination were included). This was the significant. decrease in the incidence of acute <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> compared with that of 20. 1 / 1, 000 students (1975 - 1979) and 25. 8 / 1, 000 (1972 - 1974) during the previous periods (p< 0. 01). 4). The analysis of the questionnaire revealed that urinary abnormalities found at the precollege annual health examination were rechecked at the school in 84. 0 % cases (rechecking rate: 43 % during the previous period of 1975 - 1979). Continued urine abnormalities were found only 21. 8 % out of 671 students on rechecking. Among the students who visited the hospitals for further evaluation, 50 % were found no renal disease or genitourinary abnormality. Renal disease was diagnosed in 111 Students (36 %) including acute <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> in 24, chronic <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> in 24, nephrotic syndrome in 2, and possible chronic <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> in 32 students. 5). Urine examination after the entrance to the college demonstrated abnormal findings in 311 out of 1, 322 students with the history of the renal diseases and/or urine abnormalitieses (23. 5 %). When the precollege urine abnormality patterns were compared with the results of the urine examination in the college, isolated proteinuria became negative in 76 % and isolated hematuria in 26 %, while proteinuria with microhematuria became negative in 67 % of the students. These results indicate that, further study to obtain the results of long-term follow-up studies to determine the incidence of progressive renal disease and the ultimate outcome is needed although most of the urine abnormalities in schoolchildren are transient and non-progressive.

We investigated [3 H]lysoPAF metabolism in isolated glomeruli from normal and NTN rabbits studied both in the heterologous and in the autologous phases of the disease. [3 H]lysoPAF was converted to [3 H] 1 -O-alkyl-glycerol and [3 H] 1 -O-alkyl- 2 -acyl-GPC by phospholipase C and acyltransferase, respectively, both in normal and NTN glomeruli. Glomerular metabolism of [3 H]lyso-PAF was normal during the heterologous phase of NTN. By contrast, in isolated glomeruli from NTN rabbits studied in the autologous phase of the disease, a significantly lower [3 H]lysoPAF degradation occurred with respect to normal ones. This defective degradation resulted in a significantly reduced formation of [3 H] 1 -O-alkyl-glycerol. The apparent Km for enzymatic conversion of [3 H]lysoPAF to [3 H] 1 -O-alkyl-glycerol, determined at 15 minutes as a function of [3 H]lysoPAF concentration, was doubled in glomeruli from rabbits studied in the autologous phase of NTN as compared to normal ones, while Vmaxvalues were similar in the two groups. These results show a defective glomerular lysoPAF degradation in the autologous phase of NTN, likely due to a decreased affinity of phospholipase C to lysoPAF.

40|$|Puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN) is a {{model for}} human minimal change {{nephropathy}} induced in rats by injection of puromycin. In PAN, defective sialylation of a major sialoprotein of podocytes, podocalyxin, has been demonstrated and the consequent decrease of anionic charge suggested as a causative factor for increased glomerular permeability and proteinuria. Whether defective sialylation is a general feature of PAN affecting also glomerular glycosphingolipids is not known. We have shown that rat glomeruli are rich in disialogangliosides GD 3 and O-acetyl GD 3, the functions of which are not known. Here, we made a sequential analysis of the glomerular gangliosides, especially of GD 3 and its O-acetyl derivative in acute PAN using immunohistochemical and biochemical techniques and compared the results with another rat model of <b>glomerular</b> disease, Heymann <b>nephritis.</b> The prominent immunohistochemical finding was the almost total disappearance of glomerular O-acetyl GD 3 and a substantial decrease of its precursor GD 3 peaking at 10 days after injection of puromycin. Segmental areas lacking these gangliosides remained in glomeruli still at 30 days after injection. The response was dose dependent. Semiquantitative analysis by thin layer chromatograms showed that O-acetyl GD 3 was decreased by 41 % already at 3 days and by 60 % at 10 days after injection of puromycin. Also GD 3, the immediate precursor of O-acetyl GD 3, was decreased by 20 and 19 %, respectively, at 3 and 10 days after injection. At 3 days after injection, overt proteinuria had not started. At these times, no other changes were observed in the glomerular gangliosides. The decrease of glomerular GD 3 and O-acetyl GD 3 indicates a decrease of GD 3 synthase activity and perhaps of O-acetyltransferase activity in PAN nephrosis. As these changes preceded the overt proteinuria, {{they may have a}} causal relationship to it.

We performed the present study to investigate what portion of the gp 330 molecule is shed, using a rabbit antiserum against a peptide deduced {{to be in the}} cytoplasmic domain of gp 330, as well as a rabbit antiserum and two monoclonal antibodies that recognize extracellular epitopes of gp 330. The anti-cytoplasmic peptide antiserum precipitated from Fx 1 A (a crude renal cortical membrane preparation), a protein with a mass of about 440 kd that was reactive with two monoclonal anti-gp 330 antibodies. (In our experiments, the protein called gp 330 generally has a mass estimated to be about 440 kd.) The anti-cytoplasmic peptide antiserum also reacted with a truncated gp 330 protein produced in transfected COS cells. Immunohistochemical studies showed that all the antibodies recognized the same group of epithelial cells. However, as seen in immunoultrastructural studies of proximal tubules, the anti-cytoplasmic peptide antiserum reacted only with components at the base of microvilli, whereas the anti-gp 330 ectodomain antibodies identified material not only at the base, but over the surface of microvilli as well. In rats with Heymann <b>nephritis,</b> <b>glomerular</b> deposits and material shed into tubule lumens reacted with antibodies against extracellular epitopes of gp 330, but not with the anti-cytoplasmic peptide antiserum.

The hemorrhagic lesion of the glomerular tuft may show a process of repair characterized by the ingrowth, into the hemorrhagic masses, of endothelial cells from the uninjured part of the tuft. This process is, however, more analogous to the organization of a red thrombus than it is to any form of glomerular lesion known in man, and can hardly serve as an experimental demonstration of the mode of development of a subacute or chronic <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis.</b> On the other hand, crotalus venom causes a persistent albuminuria and extensive tubular degeneration and cast formation, with death, preceded by great emaciation, after five to six weeks...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} serum lipids and various serum proteins in kidney disease, serum lipid levels were made to determine and the characteristic pattern of serum protein fractions was analyzed in 51 patients with kidney disease. (These fiftyone patients are 51 cases of <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> and 16 cases of nephrotic syndrome.) <b>Glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> was associated with mild disturbances of lipid and protein metabolism, although analysis failed to establish any difinite relationships between the two. From {{the standpoint of the}} degree of kidney disturbances, total cholesterol tended to increase with aggravation of kidney function in chronic nephritis. In nephrotic syndrome, however, disturbances of lipid and protein metabolism were found to be very severe and serum lipid was remarkably increased in many cases, but normal value were found to be present in some cases in convalescence; therefore, the fluctuation was considerably great {{during the course of the}} disease. The increase of total cholesterol with a marked disturbance of kidney function was found to be not as great in severe cases as those suffering from mild disturbances of kidney function, with none of the cases showing normal values throughout the course of their illoess. Furthermore, ratio of high degree was found to be present in the almost all cases. Paper electrophorosis of the serum from the patients with nephrotic syndrome revealed a characteristic pattern of protein fractions : albumin was markedly decreased, α_ 2 -globulin and β-globulin were markedly increased, α-globulin was decreased. In glycoprotein fractions α_ 2 -globulin was remarkably increased, while β-fraction and the ratio of β/α showed considerably increase in lipoprotein and phospholipid fractions. These various changes of protein were related to the increase of serum lipid and the relationship was confirmed by clinical cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of Lindemann (1) that a condition closely simulating <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> {{can be produced}} in laboratory animals by intravenous injections of anfikidney serum has been confirmed {{by a number of}} investigators. A review of the literature has already been published (2). It has been shown that the animals develop albuminuria, hematuria, cylindruria, moderate oliguria, or occasionally anuria. There is an increase in blood urea, with moderate edema, and a rise in blood pressure. At autopsy the kidneys show extensive glomerular lesions which are a close approximation to those seen in human <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis.</b> These experiments support the theory that acute hemorrhagic nephritis is due to the development in the patient of some nephrotoxic substance. However, in each instance, the nephrotoxic serum was produced in an animal of a heterologous species. There is therefore no explanation as to how such a nephrotoxln could be developed in human cases of hemorrhagic nephritis, where only the homologous kidney can be involved. The following investigations were therefore undertaken to determine whether {{it would be possible to}} demonstrate in rabbits the development of antikidney antibodies following the injection of emulsions of homologous kidney to which streptococcus toxin had been added. Because the well known resistance of rabbits to streptococcus toxin might retard the formation of antibodies, a second group of rabbits was injected with emulsions of rabbit kidney to which staphylococcus toxin had been added. As control three additional groups of rabbits were included in the experiment. The animals of one of these received injections of streptococcus toxin alone, those of the second group, staphylococcus toxin, and for the third group emulsions of kidney tissue alone were used. Following the period of injections the blood sera of these rabbits were tested by complement fixation tests against emulsions of rabbit kidney to determine the possible development of antikidney antibodies...|$|E
40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens and tissue destruction. While {{the sources of}} autoantigens in SLE are unknown, release of contents from dying cells and/or inadequate clearance of resulting debris are likely possibilities. Prior reports suggest that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and its associated death pathway, NETosis, are sources of autoantigen in SLE. However, we showed that inhibition of NETs by targeting the NADPH oxidase complex, via Cybb-deletion, exacerbated disease in the MRL/lpr model of SLE. To clarify the contribution of NETs in SLE pathogenesis, we employed a genetic approach to delete peptidyl arginine deiminase IV (Padi 4) and neutrophil elastase (Elane), two distal mediators of NET formation, in MRL/lpr mice. Both Padi 4 and Elane deficiency did alter disease course, directly challenging the concept that NETs promote autoimmunity. Therefore, it remains unknown how NADPH oxidase regulates autoimmunity. NADPH oxidase can constrain inflammation by neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte dependent mechanisms. To identify the cell lineage in which Cybb deficiency drives SLE, we employed bone marrow chimera and conditional knockout approaches to delete Cybb in the myeloid compartment of MRL/lpr mice. Myeloid Cybb deficiency is sufficient to worsen <b>glomerular</b> and interstitial <b>nephritis,</b> suggesting that Cybb is protective in SLE due to a fundamental regulatory activity of Cybb within the myeloid compartment. NADPH oxidase is a critical mediator of LC 3 -associated phagocytosis (LAP), which {{is important for the}} clearance of dead cells by macrophages. As Cybb modulates SLE pathogenesis by its function in myeloid cells, we assessed LAP in lupus. To test the hypothesis that exacerbated SLE in Cybb-deficient mice is due to defective LAP, we genetically deleted another critical LAP mediator, Rubicon, in Cybb-sufficient and Cybb-deficient SLE prone mice. Unexpectedly, Rubicon deficiency increased the lifespan and ameliorated renal disease in Cybb-deficient MRL/lpr mice. Strikingly, Rubicon deficiency reduced the autoantibody responses to RNA associated autoantigens. These data suggest that a defect in LAP is not a major driver of SLE and highlights RUBICON as a novel mediator of lupus pathogenesis. The mechanism by which myeloid Cybb regulates SLE remains enigmatic and requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Requirement of {{heat shock}} protein 90 in mesangial cell mitogenesis. BackgroundHyperplasia of mesangial cells (MCs) is a {{frequent}} finding in glomerulonephritis. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP 90) is a major cellular chaperone that assists protein folding under physiological and stress conditions. MethodsTo identify genes that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis, we analyzed glomerular gene expression in mesangioproliferative rat anti-Thy 1. 1 nephritis by representational difference analysis (RDA). Expression of HSP 90 β in anti-Thy 1. 1 nephritis was studied by Northern and Western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry. In cultured rat MCs, the requirement of HSP 90 for mitogenic signaling steps and MC replication was studied by incubation with the specific HSP 90 inhibitor geldanamycin. ResultsBy RDA, a cDNA fragment homologous to HSP 90 β was identified. Glomerular mRNA and protein expression of HSP 90 β was markedly and transiently up-regulated {{during the course of}} anti-Thy 1. 1 nephritis, with a maximum at day 6, coinciding with the peak of MC proliferation. By immunohistochemistry, HSP 90 β expression in normal glomeruli was detected in podocytes. However, in anti-Thy 1. 1 <b>nephritis,</b> <b>glomerular</b> HSP 90 β protein expression was strongly and transiently increased in mesangial localization. In vitro, mitogenic stimulation of rat MCs led to the induction of HSP 90 β mRNA and protein. Incubation of MCs with geldanamycin dose-dependently inhibited DNA synthesis and replication. Moreover, geldanamycin interfered with mitogen-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and transcription of c-fos and Egr- 1, but not with transactivation of STAT 1 transcription factor. Cell cycle analysis of serum-stimulated MCs revealed that geldanamycin inhibited kinase activity of cyclin D 1 /CDK 4 complexes and blocked progression in the G 0 /G 1 phase and at the S/G 2 phase transition. ConclusionsThe up-regulation of HSP 90 β in anti-Thy 1. 1 nephritis may reflect its functional involvement in phenotypical alterations of MCs in mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. Our in vitro studies indicate that HSP 90 governs the capacity of MCs to respond to proliferative stimuli by regulating critical mitogenic signaling steps necessary for G 1 entry and S-phase progression...|$|R
40|$|Lupus nephritis is {{a severe}} organ manifestation of {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus (SLE), and {{is characterized by the}} production of anti-dsDNA antibodies. It is an important cause of renal failure. The mechanism through which anti-dsDNA antibodies bind to tissues and mediate kidney injury remains to be fully elucidated. Emerging evidence suggests that anti-dsDNA antibodies can bind to cells and extracellular antigens directly through cross-reactivity, independent of bridging chromatin material. Mesangial cells {{play an important role in}} normal kidney structure and functions, and its pathophysiology. Mesangial abnormalities in lupus nephritis precede more severe injuries such as lesions in the glomerular capillary loop. We previously demonstrated that the binding of human anti-dsDNA antibodies to mesangial cells (HMC) correlated with disease activity and induced inflammatory as well as fibrotic pathways. The aim of this project is to identify the cross-reactive antigen(s) on the mesangial cell surface that mediates anti-dsDNA antibody binding and the alterations in cell functions that result from this interaction. HMC plasma membrane proteins were purified. Using proteomic and biochemical approaches, we identified annexin II as the predominant cross-reactive antigen on the HMC surface that mediated human polyclonal anti-dsDNA antibody binding. Following this interaction, anti-dsDNA antibodies were internalized in a time- and temperature-dependent manner, and translocated to both the cytoplasm and nucleus within 30 min. This resulted in induction of annexin II synthesis, IL- 6 secretion and cell proliferation, which was mediated through the activation of p 38 MAPK, JNK and AKT. The binding activity to annexin II in the serum immunoglobulin fraction correlated with the titre of anti-dsDNA antibody. Binding activity of anti-dsDNA antibodies to annexin II correlated with clinical disease activity and circulating anti-dsDNA antibody levels. These correlations were more prominent in male patients with lupus <b>nephritis.</b> <b>Glomerular</b> annexin II expression was increased in patients with active lupus nephritis and co-localized with IgG and C 3 deposition. Gene silencing of annexin II in HMC reduced anti-dsDNA antibody binding, which was accompanied by reduced IL- 6 secretion and cell proliferation. Using female NZB/W F 1 mice, an established murine model of lupus nephritis, we demonstrated that intra-glomerular annexin II expression increased with disease progression and was accompanied by an increase in the expression of p 11, its cellular protein ligand. Our data suggest that annexin II may exist in the kidney as a heterotetramer and is involved in disease pathogenesis. At the ultrastructural level, annexin II was detected in the mesangial matrix, amongst electron dense deposits in the glomerular basement membrane, on the foot processes in podocytes and within the Bowman’s capsule. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that annexin II is the major cell surface antigen on HMC that mediates the cross-reactive binding of human anti-DNA antibodies. Through this interaction, cellular processes are triggered that contribute to the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis. published_or_final_versionMedicineDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Intravenous {{administration}} of disrupted Streptococcus mutans into rabbits over 23 - 76 weeks led to severe nephritis involving glomeruli, tubules, and interstitium. Light-microscopic observation of glomeruli documented diffuse endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis accompanied often (65 %) by epithelial crescents. Electron-microscopic observation revealed humps in glomeruli of 70 % of kidney specimens. In the glomeruli of some rabbits, extensive fibrin deposits and sclerosis were evident. Immunofluorescence showed linear, granular, often ribbonlike or patchy immune deposits encompassing, {{in order of}} decreasing frequency, C 3, IgG, streptococcal antigen, IgA, and IgM. The histopathologic and immunohistologic features of the nephritis seen in rabbits given S mutans thus shows many features of Streptococcus-associated nephritides in man, in particular, the diffuse <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> encountered in subacute bacterial endocarditis.

40|$|Oxidants {{and iron}} in chronic kidney disease. Oxidants derived either from leukocytes in proliferative <b>glomerular</b> <b>nephritis</b> or from {{resident}} glomerular cells in nonproliferative glomerulonephritis {{have been shown}} to have several biologic effects relevant to chronic kidney disease. These include: the ability of oxidants to damage glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and to directly induce proteinuria; effects that would lead to a fall in the glomerular filtration rate; and effects that would account for the morphologic changes observed in chronic kidney disease. In experimental models the role of oxidants has been demonstrated in both proliferative glomerulonephritis (e. g., anti-GBM antibody disease) as well as experimental models of minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy. Oxidants have also been shown to be an important mediator of the various pathways that have been implicated in diabetic nephropathy. Antioxidants and iron chelators have also been shown to retard functional and morphologic changes observed in progressive kidney disease. Taken together, these experimental studies suggest an important role of oxidants in chronic kidney disease...|$|E
40|$|Forty-one wild house mice (Mus musculus) {{were trapped}} in an urban area, near railways, in Santa Fe city, Argentina. Both kidneys from each mouse were removed for {{bacteriological}} and histological examination. One kidney was inoculated into Fletcher semi-solid medium and isolates were serologically typed. The other kidney was microscopically examined after hematoxylin-eosin, silver impregnation and immunohistochemical stains. Leptospires, all of them belonging to the Ballum serogroup, were isolated from 16 (39 %) out of 41 samples. The presence of the agent was recorded in 18 (44 %) and in 19 (46 %) out of 41 silver impregnated and immunohistochemically stained samples respectively. Additionally, leptospires were detected in high number on the apical surface of epithelial cells and in the lumen of medullary tubules and they were less frequently seen on the apical surface of epithelial cells or in the lumen of the cortical tubules, which represents an unusual finding in carrier animals. Microscopic lesions consisting of focal mononuclear interstitial <b>nephritis,</b> <b>glomerular</b> shrinkage and desquamation of tubular epithelial cells were observed in 13 of 19 infected and in 10 of 22 non-infected mice; differences in presence of lesions between infected and non-infected animals {{were not statistically significant}} (P= 0, 14). The three techniques, culture, silver impregnation and immunohistochemistry, had a high agreement (k³ 0. 85) and no significant differences between them were detected (P> 0. 05). In addition, an unusual location of leptospires in kidneys of carrier animals was reported, but a relationship between lesions and presence of leptospires could not be established. Foram capturados 41 camundongos (Mus musculus) na região urbana, próximo à ferrovia da cidade de Santa Fé, Argentina. Os rins de cada animal capturado foram removidos para estudos bacteriológicos e histológicos. Um dos rins foi imerso em meio semi-sólido de Fletcher para isolamento de leptospiras, as quais foram serologicamente tipificadas. O outro rim foi microscopicamente examinado por coloração de cortes histológicos pela hematoxilina-eosina, impregnação pela prata e imunohistoquímica. Leptospiras pertencentes ao serogrupo Ballum foram isoladas em 16 (39 %) das 41 amostras availadas. A presença do agente foi observada em 18 (44 %) e 19 (46 %) das 41 amostras avaliadas por impregnação pela prata e imunohistoquímica, respectivamente. Leptospiras foram detectadas em grande numero na superfície apical das células epiteliais e no lumen dos túbulos medulares e foram menos frequentemente encontradas na superficie apical de células epiteliais ou no lúmen dos túbulos corticais, o que é considerado achado raro em animais portadores. Lesões microscópicas consistindo de nefrite mononuclear intersticial focal, atrofia glomerular e descamação das células tubulares epiteliais foram observadas em 13 dos 19 animais infectados e em 10 dos 22 animais não infectados.
