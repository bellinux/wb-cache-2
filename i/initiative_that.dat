5|$|In 1978, Gravel {{authored}} {{and secured}} the passage into {{law of the}} General Stock Ownership Corporation, that became Subchapter U of the Tax Code under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. While that was originally done as a prerequisite to a failed 1980 Alaskan ballot <b>initiative</b> <b>that</b> would have paid dividends to Alaskan citizens for pipeline-related revenue, it also {{turned out to be}} significant in the development of binary economics.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} OPP model {{became an}} inspiration for other municipalities around the country. In 1999, Khan helped to create Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP) to collaborate with Lodhran municipal committee. Learning from past experiences, the project extended its scope to the whole town instead of concentrating on low-income settlements only. The municipal partnership was itself a new <b>initiative</b> <b>that</b> ensured wider civic co-operation.|$|E

Henceforth, neither adversary respected Kentucky's proclaimed neutrality, and the Confederate advantage was lost. The buffer zone that Kentucky provided between the North and the South was no longer available to assist in the defense of Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|Adam is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the fourth season of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Portrayed by George Hertzberg, he is a monster created from a man and the collected parts of demons, vampires, and technology: {{the product of a}} perverse experiment carried out by military scientists. The series' main character, Buffy Summers, encounters and ultimately defeats him in the fourth season. Adam is the creation of Dr. Maggie Walsh (Lindsay Crouse), the head of a military-like organization called The <b>Initiative</b> <b>that</b> studies how to alter the harmful behavior inherent to demons. Adam and the Initiative are the fourth season's primary antagonists, or Big Bad.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{a popular}} <b>initiative</b> <b>that</b> sought {{to stop the}} {{procurement}} of the 34 F/A-18 Hornets (chosen by the Federal Council in 1988) to replace the Mirages was defeated {{by a majority of}} 57%. Two versions, a twin-seat D-model and a single-seat C, were built in the United States and flight-tested in 1996, delivered in December 1996and 1998respectively. Thirty-two production kits were shipped to Switzerland for assembly, with the first in service in January 1997and the final aircraft delivered in December 1999. One crashed during workups, leaving 28C's and 5Ds assigned to three squadrons. Seven instructor pilots were trained at NAS Cecil Field, Florida, and the United States Navy also provided two instructors on exchange to train Hornet pilots.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{piece of}} public art, an {{advertising}} sign, a retail kiosk selling newspapers and hot food, as well as a bus shelter. It has been criticised by local residents who liken it to a carrot or a space ship, although it is meant to symbolise man's harmony with the sea. This was part of North Somerset Council's ongoing civic pride <b>initiative</b> <b>that</b> has sought to revitalise Weston-super-Mare's public spaces, which had suffered a period of decline. Other public space improvements have been made throughout the town such as improvements to the street scene in Grove Park Village.|$|E

The New Think Festival is a yearly weekend event that is part of NewThink, a non-profit <b>initiative</b> <b>that</b> aims to inspire youth to think about the world in an innovative way. The festival {{is one of the many}} events throughout the year to get youth involved. In 2015 the festival hosted 40 different organizations at King Hussein Business Park in Amman that inspired their audience to be visionary and think differently about the world through presentations and workshops. The variety of organizations included business, environmental, medical and educational groups.|$|E
5|$|President Barack Obama set {{the goal}} of {{bringing}} 1 million plug-in electric vehicles on the road by 2015. However, considering the actual slow rate of PEV sales, as of mid-2012 several industry observers have concluded that this goal is unattainable. In September 2014 Governor of California Jerry Brown signed a bill, the Charge Ahead California <b>Initiative,</b> <b>that</b> sets a goal of placing at least 1 million zero-emission vehicles and near-zero-emission vehicles {{on the road in}} California by January 1, 2023.|$|E
5|$|Romney used a {{bully pulpit}} {{approach}} towards promoting his agenda, staging well-organized media events to appeal {{directly to the}} public rather than pushing his proposals in behind-doors sessions with the state legislature. He dealt with a public crisis of confidence in Boston's Big Dig project– that followed a fatal ceiling collapse in 2006– by wresting control of the project from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. After two years of negotiating the state's participation in the landmark Regional Greenhouse Gas <b>Initiative</b> <b>that</b> instituted a cap-and-trade arrangement for power plant emissions in the Northeast, Romney pulled Massachusetts out of the initiative shortly before its signing in December 2005, citing a lack of cost limits for industry.|$|E

5|$|The {{system was}} {{published}} in 1960 {{as a result of}} an <b>initiative</b> <b>that</b> began in 1948. It is based on the metre–kilogram–second system of units (MKS) rather than any variant of the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 24th and 25th General Conferences on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 2011 and 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram, linking it to an invariant of nature rather than to the mass of a material artefact, thereby ensuring long-term stability.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City as soon as it could get out of its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and said the city did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide <b>initiative</b> <b>that</b> sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E
5|$|The design {{report for}} the Bay Freeway project was {{published}} on February 10, 1970, and was subsequently distributed to the project. The report featured a new design for the freeway, including ramps to a parking garage serving the domed stadium and aesthetic standards meant to complement the existing Seattle Center. Five additional public hearings were held by the Seattle City Council in 1970, as support for the R.H. Thomson Expressway and other proposed freeways were the subject of highway revolts {{similar to those in}} other American cities. During the April hearing, former State Department of Highways director Charles Prahl spoke out against the Bay Freeway and predicted that it would cause traffic to back up onto I-5 during rush hour. Voters rejected a Forward Thrust <b>initiative</b> <b>that</b> would have built the proposed domed stadium at the Seattle Center on May 19, removing {{one of the main reasons}} to build the freeway and forcing the city council to consider scaling down the proposal. The June hearing resulted in the removal of the R.H. Thomson Freeway from the comprehensive plan as well as the widening of the Bay Freeway to six lanes to support an expected 2,610 drivers during rush hour.|$|E

5|$|Three more {{attempts}} {{to revive the}} plan were made after Operation Flash in early May, when Croatia captured a portion of western Slavonia previously controlled by the RSK. The first <b>initiative,</b> <b>that</b> began later that month, failed because the RSK demanded that the Croatian forces pull back from western Slavonia (which Croatia declined to do). The second attempt failed simply because neither party wanted to negotiate. The final round of negotiations where the Z-4 Plan was proposed by international diplomats occurred in early August, when a major Croatian attack against the RSK seemed imminent. Despite last-ditch efforts by Galbraith to persuade Milošević and the RSK leadership to accept the plan, disagreement among the RSK leaders allowed Croatia {{to claim that the}} RSK had no intention of negotiating. The Croatian delegation, which had little interest in the negotiations and wanted to lay the diplomatic groundwork for the imminent military operation, presented its own demands to the RSK (which were also rejected). On 4 August Croatia launched Operation Storm, defeated the RSK and effectively ended the political process which {{led to the creation of}} the Z-4 Plan.|$|E
