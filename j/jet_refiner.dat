50|$|CODAG Water <b>jet</b> And <b>Refined</b> Propeller, {{a system}} {{developed}} by Blohm + Voss as option for their MEKO line of ships, also falls {{in this category}} but avoids the above-mentioned problems. CODAG WARP uses two diesel engines to drive two propellers in a CODAD arrangement, i.e. both shafts can also be powered by any single engine, and a centerline water jet powered by a gas turbine. The idling water jet doesn't cause drag and since its nozzle can be placed further aft and higher it doesn't affect {{the size of the}} propellers.|$|R

40|$|Various {{metals and}} {{metallic}} glass systems have bene processed into hollow spheres with sizes ranging from 3 mm to 440 microns in diameter. The technique {{for the formation}} of the large hollow spheres, in general, is based on the fluid-dynamic instability of a hollow annular <b>jet.</b> A <b>refined</b> technique has also been developed for microshell formation, in which discrete bubbles are injected into the stream of the molten material and individually 'flushed' out at a frequency related to the Rayleigh jet instability. The surfaces of those spheres of all sizes exhibit a range of contrasting solidification behaviors and characteristics.

40|$|In this paper, a {{gradient-based}} {{refinement of}} the rotation rate-based Smagorinsky (RoSM) subgrid scale (SGS) model is presented. The refined model satisfies the Galilean invariance condition generally, without any assumptions. The suggested model retains the advantages {{offered by the}} original RoSM, thus being simple and efficient. It provides a Smagorinsky model constant that is always positive, with low fluctuations in space and time, {{without the need for}} any numerical stability control algorithms. The validity of the proposed SGS model is shown through three test cases, namely, a turbulent channel flow, subcritical flow past a stationary cylinder, and a spatially developing free round <b>jet.</b> The <b>refined</b> RoSM provides comparable results with the dynamic Smagorinsky, while matching well to reference data. The refined RoSM is shown to be computationally efficient, being 20 % faster than the dynamic Smagorinsky model. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
500|$|Recent {{assessments}} of the album have been mostly positive, with AllMusic and Blender giving the album five stars, their highest ratings. AllMusic's Steve Huey compared the album to Here Come the Warm Jets, writing [...] "not quite as enthusiastic as Here Come the Warm Jets, Taking Tiger Mountain is made accessible through Eno's mastery of pop song structure". Douglas Wolk of Blender had rated it more highly than Here Come the Warm Jets, calling it [...] "more immediately likeable". Select gave the album a {{four out of five}} rating, calling it [...] "excellent" [...] and described the songs [...] "Mother Whale Eyeless", [...] "Put A Straw Under Baby" [...] and [...] "Third Uncle" [...] as highlights. Chris Jones of BBC Music called Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) [...] "a work of genius because it didn't know the meaning of repetition" [...] and [...] "merely took Warm <b>Jets</b> and <b>refined</b> it into a smoother lump of oddness." ...|$|R

40|$|A closely-coupled canard fighter with vectorable {{two-dimensional}} nozzle {{was designed}} for enhanced transonic maneuvering. The HiMAT maneuver goal of a sustained 8 g turn at a free-stream Mach number of 0. 9 and 30, 000 feet was the primary design consideration. The aerodynamic design process was initiated with a linear theory optimization minimizing the zero percent suction drag including <b>jet</b> effects and <b>refined</b> with three-dimensional nonlinear potential flow techniques. Allowances were made for mutual interference and viscous effects.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{relatively}} strong upstream acoustic excitation on {{the mixing of}} heated jets with the surrounding air are investigated. To {{determine the extent of}} the available information on experiments and theories dealing with acoustically excited heated jets, an extensive literature survey was carried out. The experimental program consisted of flow visualization and flowfield velocity and temperature measurements for a broad range of jet operating and flow excitation conditions. A 50. 8 -mm-diam nozzle was used for this purpose. Parallel to the experimental study, an existing theoretical model of excited <b>jets</b> was <b>refined</b> to include the region downstream of the jet potential core. Excellent agreement was found between theory and experiment in moderately heated jets. However, the theory has not yet been confirmed for highly heated jets. It was found that the sensitivity of heated jets to upstream acoustic excitation varies strongly with the jet operating conditions and that the threshold excitation level increases with increasing jet temperature. Furthermore, the preferential Strouhal number is found not to change significantly with a change of the jet operating conditions. Finally, the effects of the nozzle exit boundary layer thickness appear to be similar for both heated and unheated jets at low Mach numbers...|$|R
50|$|After D-Day, {{attacks on}} the German oil {{industry}} assumed top priority which was widely dispersed around the Reich. Vast fleets of B-24s and B-17s escorted by P-51Ds and long-range P-38Ls hit refineries in Germany and Czechoslovakia in late 1944 and early 1945. Having almost total air superiority throughout the collapsing German Reich, Eighth Air Force hit targets as far east as Hungary, while Fifteenth Air Force hit oil industry facilities in Yugoslavia, Romania, and northeastern Italy. On at least eighteen occasions, the Merseburg refineries in Leuna, {{where the majority of}} Germany's synthetic fuel for <b>jet</b> aircraft was <b>refined,</b> was hit. By the end of 1944, only three out of ninety-one refineries in the Reich were still working normally, twenty-nine were partially functional, and the remainder were completely destroyed.|$|R
40|$|Methods to {{investigate}} the response of hydrocarbons and sulfur compounds to different extents resulting from thermal oxidation of <b>jet</b> fuels <b>refined</b> via the mercaptan oxidation (Merox) process have been developed. Relative comparison of hydrocarbon contents including n-paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics (PIONA) was performed by using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography hyphenated with a quadrupole-accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC × GC-Q-TOFMS). A simple approach for quantification of sulfur compound groups was then developed using both GC × GC and GC hyphenated with flame photometric detection (GC × GC-FPD; GC-FPD). The approach largely separated the sulfur compounds into two distinct regions comprising of lower polarity S 1 (thiophenes, thiophenols, thiols, disulfides, sulfides, and alkyl thianaphthenes) and higher polarity S 2 (sulfones and phenylsulfides) groups. The reliability of this approach was evaluated using higher resolution GC × GC-FPD, showing less than ± 1 % error arising from the coelution of minor compounds in GC-FPD analysis. The calibration method was further applied to reduce the error caused by the dependence of analyte contents on the sample dilution effect from ± 14 % to ± 4 %. The GC-FPD analysis showed {{a significant increase in}} S 2 content from 47 to 59 % after 113 min oxidation. This approach was then applied for characterization of 15 practical jet fuel samples from airforce bases...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} adequacy of future U. S. jet fuel supplies, the potential for large increases {{in the cost of}} jet fuel, and to what extent a relaxation in jet fuel properties would remedy these potential problems. The results of the study indicate that refiners should be able to meet jet fuel output requirements in all regions of the country within the current Jet A specifications during the 1990 - 2010 period. The results also indicate that it will be more difficult to meet Jet A specifications on the West Coast, because the feedstock quality is worse and the required jet fuel yield (<b>jet</b> fuel/crude <b>refined)</b> is higher than in the East. The results show that jet fuel production costs could be reduced by relaxing fuel properties. Potential cost savings in the East (PADDs I-IV) through property relaxation were found to be about 1. 3 cents/liter (5 cents/gallon) in January 1, 1981 dollars between 1990 and 2010. However, the savings from property relaxation were all obtained within the range of current Jet A specifications, so there is no financial incentive to relax Jet A fuel specifications in the East. In the West (PADD V) the potential cost savings from lowering fuel quality were considerably greater than in the East. Cost savings from 2. 7 to 3. 7 cents/liter (10 - 14 cents/gallon) were found. In contrast to the East, on the West Coast {{a significant part of the}} savings was obtained through relaxation of the current Jet A fuel specifications...|$|R
40|$|Multiphase flows {{represent}} {{a central issue}} in many natural, biological and industrial fields. For instance, liquid <b>jets</b> vaporization, petroleum <b>refining</b> and boiling, emulsions in pharmaceutical applications, are all characterized by a disperse phase, such as solid particles or liquid bubbles, which evolve in a Newtonian carrier fluid. Features such as the global evaporation rates of liquid fuels in air or the homogeneity of the emulsions are controlled by the finest interaction details occurring between the two phases. In this paper we study the rising motion of a bubble induced by buoyancy in a viscous fluid. Usually this issue is tackled by tracking the bubble interface by means of sharp interface methods. However this approach requires "ad hoc" techniques to describe changes in the topological features of the deforming interface and to enforce the mass preservation. Here the problem is addressed by using a different philosophy based on a diffuse interface method, that allows a straightforward analysis of complex phenomena such as bubbles coalescence and break up without any numerical expedient. The model we adopt, funded on a solid thermodynamical and physical base, relies on the Cahn-Hilliard equation for the disperse phase, see Cahn & Hilliard (1958) and Elliott & Songmu (1986) ...|$|R
