The activities of these enzymes were also determined in cultured skin fibroblasts of a patient with GM 1 gangliosidosis and in cultured amniotic fluid cells. While cerebrosidase activity was deficient in GLD fibroblasts and leucocytes, its activity in GM 1 gangliosidosis fibroblasts was increased. Two forms of each enzyme were found on isoelectric focusing, but in the GM 1 gangliosidosis fibroblasts, cerebrosidase activity occurred as a single but intermediate peak.

40|$|GM 1 {{gangliosidosis}} {{is due to}} <b>beta-galactosidase</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Only {{patients with}} type 3 disease survive into adulthood and develop movement disorders. Clinical descriptions of this form are rare, particularly in non-Japanese patients. We describe four new patients and systematically analyze all previous reports found by a literature search and contacts with the authors for additional information. Generalized dystonia remained the predominant feature throughout the disease course and was often associated with akinetic-rigid parkinsonism.

40|$|The {{purification}} of dog liver acid beta-galactosidase is described. The dog enzyme migrated as {{a single}} major band on polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulphate, with a molecular weight of 60000. Antiserum raised against purified human liver acid beta-galactosidase cross-reacted with beta-galactosidase from dog liver, but not with those from cat liver or Escherichia coli. Tryptic peptide maps of the dog and human acid beta-galactosidases indicate that 21 of the 24 peptides observed were homologous; a similar result was obtained after chymotryptic peptide mapping. We conclude that dog and human acid beta-galactosidases are structurally similar, and that canine GM 1 gangliosidosis (acid <b>beta-galactosidase</b> <b>deficiency)</b> is an excellent model for the same disease in man...|$|R
40|$|An infant {{presented}} with multifocal myoclonus and cyanotic hypoxemia immediately after birth, and severe feeding problems, a protein-losing enteropathy, massive ascites and grand-mal epilepsy marked his rapid downhill course, with death at 17 weeks. At 2 weeks, brain MRI revealed grey matter heterotopias in the parieto-occipital regions suggestive of a cortical morphogenetic disorder. In cultured skin fibroblasts, lipid storage and reduced activities of ceramidase, <b>galactosylceramide</b> <b>beta-galactosidase</b> and glucosylceramide beta-glucosidase were evident. Autopsy disclosed generalised lysosomal lipid storage with macrophages and adrenal cortex prominently affected. The pattern of stored lipids in cultured fibroblasts and in dewaxed spleen tissue blocks was compatible with {{a diagnosis of}} prosaposin (pSap) deficiency (pSap-d). Neuropathologically, there was a pronounced generalised neurolysosomal storage combined with a severe depletion of cortical neurons and extreme paucity of myelin and oligodendroglia. This pathology, in particular the massive neuronal loss, differed from that in other neurolipidoses and {{could be explained by}} the reduced hydrolysis of multiple sphingolipids and the loss of pSap's neurotrophic function. The absence of immunostainable saposins on tissue sections and the presence of a homozygous c. 1 A > T mutation in the prosaposin gene confirmed the diagnosis. PSap-d may be an underdiagnosed condition in infants with severe neurological and dystrophic signs starting immediately after birth.

40|$|GM 1 {{gangliosidosis}} is {{an inherited}} neurodegenerative disorder caused by lysosomal <b>beta-galactosidase</b> <b>deficiency,</b> {{resulting in the}} storage of GM 1 and GA 1, primarily in the central nervous system. This disease typically afflicts infants and young children and there is currently no effective therapy. Substrate reduction therapy (SRT) could be of potential benefit. The imino sugars N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ, miglustat, Zavesca) and N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin (NB-DGJ) used for SRT inhibit glucosylceramide synthase (GlcCerS) that catalyses the first committed step in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. We have compared the efficacy and tolerability of NB-DNJ and NB-DGJ in the beta-galactosidase knockout mouse. NB-DGJ was better tolerated than NB-DNJ, due to intrinsic gastrointestinal tract dysfunction that was exacerbated by NB-DNJ. However, functional improvement was greatest with NB-DNJ treatment which may potentially be caused by novel anti-inflammatory properties of NB-DNJ...|$|R
40|$|The pSSVx genetic element from Sulfolobus islandicus REY 15 / 4 is {{a hybrid}} between a plasmid and a fusellovirus, {{able to be}} {{maintained}} in non-integrative form and to spread when the helper SSV 2 virus {{is present in the}} cells. In this work, the satellite virus was engineered to obtain an Escherichia coli-Sulfolobus solfataricus shuttle vector for gene transfer and expression in S. solfataricus by fusing site-specifically the pSSVx chromosome with an E. coli plasmid replicon and the ampicillin resistance gene. The pSSVx-based vector was proven functional like the parental virus, namely it was able to spread efficiently through infected S. solfataricus cells. Moreover, the hybrid plasmid stably transformed S. solfataricus and propagated with no rearrangement, recombination or integration into the host chromosome. The high copy number of the artificial genetic element was found comparable with that calculated for the wild-type pSSVx in the new host cells, with no need of genetic markers for vector maintenance in the cells and for transfomant enrichment. The newly constructed vector was also shown to be an efficient cloning vehicle for the expression of passenger genes in S. solfataricus. In fact, a derivative plasmid carrying an expression cassette of the lacS gene encoding the beta-glycosidase from S. solfataricus {{under the control of the}} Sulfolobus chaperonine (thermosome tf 55) heat shock promoter was also able to drive the expression of a functional enzyme. Complementation of the <b>beta-galactosidase</b> <b>deficiency</b> in a deletion mutant strain of S. solfataricus demonstrated that lacS gene was an efficient marker for selection of single transformants on solid minimal lactose medium...|$|R
40|$|A 7 -month-old Korat cat was {{referred}} for a slowly progressive neurological disease. Circulating monocytes and lymphocytes showed {{the presence of}} single or multiple empty vacuoles and blood leukocytes enzyme assay revealed a very low beta-galactosidase activity level (4. 7 nmol/mg per h) as compared to unaffected parents and relatives. Histologically, the cat, euthanized at the owner request at 21 months of age, presented diffuse vacuolization and enlargement of neurons throughout the brain, spinal cord and peripheral ganglia, severe cerebellar neuronal cell loss, and moderate astrocytosis. Stored material was stained with periodic acid-Schiff on frozen sections and with the lectins Ricinus communis agglutinin-I, concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin on paraffin-embedded sections. Ultrastructurally, neuronal vacuoles were filled with concentrically whorled lamellae and small membrane-bound vesicles. In the affected cat, beta-galactosidase activity was markedly reduced in brain (18. 9 %) and liver (33. 25 %), while total beta-hexosaminidase activity showed a remarkable increase. Quantitation of total gangliosides revealed a 3 -fold increase in brain and 1. 7 -fold in liver of affected cat. High-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) detected a striking increase of G(M 1) -ganglioside. On densitometric analysis of HPTLC bands, the absorption of G(M 1) -ganglioside band was 98. 52 % of all stained bands (G(D 1 a),G(D 1 b), G(T 1 b)). Based on clinical onset, morphological and histochemical features, and biochemical findings, the Korat cat G(M 1) -gangliosidosis is comparable with the human type II (juvenile) form. However, clinical progression, survival time and level of <b>beta-galactosidase</b> <b>deficiency</b> do not completely fit with those of human type II G(M 1) -gangliosidosis. The disease in the Korat cat is also different from other reported forms of feline G(M 1) -gangliosidosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{turnover}} of lysosomal beta-galactosidase was studied in fibroblast cultures from patients with Gm 1 -gangliosidosis and combined <b>beta-galactosidase</b> and neuraminidase <b>deficiency,</b> which had 5 - 10 % residual beta-galactosidase activity. beta-Galactosidase was specifically inactivated with the suicide substrate beta-D-galactopyranosylmethyl-p-nitro-phenyltriazene (beta-Gal-MNT) {{and from the}} subsequent restoration of enzyme activity in cell cultures turnover times were calculated. By using [3 H]beta-Gal-MNT, the hydrolytic activity per molecule of beta-galactosidase was determined. 3 H-labelled beta-D-galactopyranosylmethylamine, the precursor of [3 H]beta-gal-MNT, was obtained by Raney-nickel-catalysed exchange with 3 H 2 O. The rate of synthesis of beta-galactosidase in normal and all mutant cells tested {{was found to be}} 0. 4 - 0. 5 pmol/day per mg of cellular protein. The GM 1 -gangliosidosis cells tested contain the normal amount of 0. 5 pmol of beta-galactosidase/mg of protein with a normal turnover time of about 10 days, but only 10 % of beta-galactosidase activity per enzyme molecule. Cells with combined <b>beta-galactosidase</b> and neuraminidase <b>deficiency</b> contain only 0. 3 pmol of beta-galactosidase/mg of protein with a decreased turnover time of 1 day and normal hydrolytic properties (200 nmol of 4 -methylumbelliferyl galactoside/h pmol of beta-galactosidase) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{lysosomal}} storage disorder galactosialidosis {{has been}} recognized as a distinct genetic and biochemical entity, associated with a combined <b>beta-galactosidase</b> and neuraminidase <b>deficiency</b> that {{is due to the}} lack of a 32 -kilodalton (kDa) glycoprotein. The molecular basis of different clinical variants of galactosialidosis has been investigated. In the early-infantile form, the synthesis of the 52 -kDa precursor of the 32 -kDa "protective protein" is markedly reduced and the absence of the latter protein explains the severe neuraminidase deficiency. In the juvenile-adult form, there is relatively more 52 -kDa precursor but no 32 -kDa protein can be detected. Cells from the late-infantile form have in comparison with controls, besides a small amount of the 32 -kDa glycoprotein, an accumulation of the 52 -kDa precursor. Apparently, this protein is genetically altered in such a way that its further processing is impaired. Furthermore, in this mutant, the residual neuraminidase activity is stimulated four- to sixfold upon leupeptin treatment together with an increase of the 32 -kDa glycoprotein...|$|R
40|$|Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycolipids {{which are}} formed by a {{hydrophobic}} portion, the ceramide, and a hydrophilic part, i. e. the oligosaccharide chain. First described in neural tissue, {{several studies have}} shown that gangliosides are almost ubiquitous molecules expressed in all vertebrate tissues. Within cells, gangliosides are usually associated with plasma membranes, where they can act as receptors for a variety of molecules and have been shown to take part in cell-to-cell interaction and in signal transduction. In addition, gangliosides are expressed in cytosol membranes like those of secretory granules of some endocrine cells (adrenal medulla, pancreatic islets). As far as the role of gangliosides in diseases is concerned, there are some cases in which an aberrant ganglioside expression plays {{a crucial role in the}} disease pathogenetic process. These diseases include two major forms of ganglioside storage, namely GM 2 -gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs and its beta-hexosaminidase deficiency) and GM 1 -gangliosidosis (<b>beta-galactosidase</b> <b>deficiency),</b> where the most prominent pathological characteristic is the lysosomal ganglioside accumulation in neurons. Other inflammatory or degenerative diseases both within and outside the nervous system have been shown to be associated with an altered pattern of ganglioside expression in the target organ. Since monoclonal antibodies have been discovered and used in immunology, a large variety of ganglioside antigens has been described both as blood group antigens and as tumour-related antigens. Several studies have also indicated that gangliosides can act not only as antigens, but also as autoantigens. As a matter of fact, auto-antibodies to gangliosides, detected by immunostaining methods performed directly on TLC plates or by ELISA, have been described in several autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and, last but not least, insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. This last disease is caused by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells in genetically predisposed individuals. Autoantibodies and T lymphocytes directed towards multiple islet autoantigens have been detected in the circulation, well before the clinical onset of the disease, in a prodromal phase during which pancreatic islet beta-cells are presumably destroyed. Among the target autoantigens, some are of protein nature but others are acidic glycolipids such as sulphatides 158 and the gangliosides GT 3, GD 3 and especially GM 2 - 1. This last component is specifically expressed in pancreatic islets and has been shown to represent a target of IgG autoantibodies highly associated with diabetes development in first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetic individuals. In addition, the GM 2 - 1 ganglioside appears to be one of the antigens recognized by cytoplasmic ICA, a heterogeneous group of antibodies which specifically react with islets on pancreatic frozen sections. In conclusion, studies performed in the last decade have clearly indicated that gangliosides represent a heterogeneous class of molecules that are involved in several cellular processes that are of crucial importance in physiological as well as in pathological conditions. Interestingly, these molecules, despite their small size, have been shown to represent not only important antigens in tumour immunology but are also able to elicit a specific autoimmune response, thus representing important autoantigens in some autoimmune disorders. It is of interest that, in addition to neurological autoimmune disorders where autoimmunity to gangliosides is frequent and usually of considerable magnitude, an autoimmune response to this class of molecules has been observed in autoimmune diabetes...|$|R
