5|$|The AEC would {{eventually}} concede, as well, that even {{low levels of}} radiation were harmful. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> rising public support for a test ban and {{the shock of the}} 1957 Soviet Sputnik launch that encouraged Eisenhower to take steps towards a test ban in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Typically, {{tropical}} cyclones do {{not form}} in the South Atlantic Ocean, due to strong upper level shear, cool water temperatures, {{and the lack of}} a convergence zone of convection. Occasionally though, as seen in 1991 and early 2004, conditions can become slightly more favorable. For Catarina, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> climatic and atmospheric anomalies. Water temperatures on Catarina's path ranged from 24 to 25°C, slightly less than the 26.5°C temperature of a normal tropical cyclone, but sufficient for a storm of baroclinic origin.|$|E

5|$|In 1746 Franklin {{began working}} on {{electrical}} experiments with Ebenezer Kinnersley after he bought all of Archibald Spencer's electrical equipment that he used in his lectures. Later he was also associated with Thomas Hopkinson and Philip Syng in experimentation with electricity. In the summer of 1747 they had received an electrical system from Thomas Penn. While no records exists to tell us exactly what parts {{were included in the}} system, historian J. A. Leo LeMay believes <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> an electricity generating machine, a Leyden jar, a glass tube, and a stool that was electrically insulated from the ground. This gave Franklin a complete system to experiment with generating and storing electricity.|$|E

25|$|The name Småland ("small lands") {{comes from}} the fact that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> several {{independent}} lands, Kinda (today a part of Östergötland), Tveta, Vista, Vedbo, Tjust, Sevede, Aspeland, Handbörd, Möre, Värend, Finnveden and Njudung. Every small land had its own law in the Viking age and early middle age and could declare themselves neutral in wars Sweden was involved in, at least if the King had no army present at the parliamentary debate. Around 1350, in the reign of king Magnus Eriksson, the first national law code was introduced in Sweden, and the historic provinces lost much of their old autonomy.|$|E
25|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} inspired by Roald Dahl's experience of chocolate companies during his schooldays. Cadbury would often send test packages to the schoolchildren {{in exchange for}} their opinions on the new products. At that time (around the 1920s), Cadbury and Rowntree's were England's two largest chocolate makers and they each often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies, posing as employees, into the other's factory. Because of this, both companies became highly protective of their chocolate-making processes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> this secrecy and the elaborate, often gigantic, machines in the factory that inspired Dahl to write the story.|$|E
25|$|When Fleury died in January 1743 {{at the age}} of 90, Louis XV {{took control}} of government. While Britain and France were not yet {{formally}} at war, they were funding different sides in the War of the Austrian Succession and open hostilities seemed imminent. This meant Louis was more open to Jacobite requests and in August sent James Butler, his Master of Horse to England to assess their prospects. Butler was provided lists of supporters, including one claiming 190 of the 236 members of the powerful trade body the Corporation of London as 'Jacobite.' When Louis asked why the English needed help if support was so widespread, his advisors attributed it to dislike of foreigners and government repression. In reality <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> wishful thinking and confusing indifference to the Hanoverians with enthusiasm for the Jacobites.|$|E

25|$|Although the Black Hills {{became a}} popular tourist {{destination}} {{in the late}} 1890s, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> local efforts, {{the popularity of the}} automobile, and construction of improved highways that brought tourists to the Black Hills in large numbers after World War I. Gutzon Borglum, already a famous sculptor, began work on Mount Rushmore in 1927 and his son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the carving of the presidents' faces in rock following his father's death in 1941. The work was halted due to pressures leading to the US entry into World War II and the massive sculpture was declared complete in 1941. Although tourism sustained the city throughout the Great Depression of the 1930s, the gasoline rationing of World War II had a devastating effect on the tourist industry in the town, but this was more than made up for by the war-related growth.|$|E
25|$|As for {{the reasons}} of Castillo in staying neutral, there are several {{interpretation}}s. One interpretation focuses on the Argentine tradition of neutrality. Others see Castillo as a nationalist, not being influenced by the power structure in Buenos Aires (since he was from Catamarca), so, {{with the support of}} the army, he could simply defy the pressure to join the Allies. A similar perspective considers instead that Castillo simply had no power to go against the wishes of the army, and if he declared war he would be deposed in a military coup. A third interpretation considers that only the United States wanted Argentina to declare war, whereas the United Kingdom was benefited by Argentine neutrality because the country was able to supply the British with livestock. This interpretation, however, fails to acknowledge the constant requests to declare war from Anglophile factions. Most likely, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the desires of the British diplomacy and the Argentine army, which prevailed over the pro-war factions.|$|E
25|$|Proto-Elamite civilization grew up {{east of the}} Tigris and Euphrates {{alluvial}} plains; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> {{the lowlands}} and the immediate highland areas {{to the north and}} east. At least three proto-Elamite states merged to form Elam: Anshan (modern Khuzestan Province), Awan (modern Lorestan Province) and Shimashki (modern Kerman). References to Awan are generally older than those to Anshan, and some scholars suggest that both states encompassed the same territory, in different eras (see Hanson, Encyclopædia Iranica). To this core Shushiana (modern Khuzestan) was periodically annexed and broken off. In addition, some Proto-Elamite sites are found well outside this area, spread out on the Iranian plateau; such as Warakshe, Sialk (now a suburb of the modern city of Kashan) and Jiroft in Kerman Province. The state of Elam was formed from these lesser states as a response to invasion from Sumer during the Old Elamite period. Elamite strength was based on an ability to hold these various areas together under a coordinated government that permitted the maximum interchange of the natural resources unique to each region. Traditionally, this was done through a federated governmental structure.|$|E

500|$|After {{the contest}} finished, the BBC {{published}} {{the reaction of}} several journalists and singers towards Tyler finishing 19th.

Otherwise you're just going to hope to pick up 10 or 11 votes." [...] Similarly, Nathan Moore agreed that the song was not strong enough, but said [...] "It was a great idea to get Bonnie involved, there's a lot of love for Bonnie out there." [...] Mick Dalley (of Yahoo! News) agreed that [...] "although Tyler herself was on form, singing beautifully and rousing the crowd with her podiumed finale, [...] "Believe in Me" [...] was simply not good enough as a song". 1997 UK winner Katrina Leskanich (of Katrina and the Waves) stated that she was underwhelmed by Denmark's entry, and expected Tyler to have scored higher than she did.
