5|$|The Aston Martin DB9 is a British grand tourer first {{shown by}} Aston Martin at the 2003 Frankfurt Auto Show. Available {{both as a}} coupe and a {{convertible}} known as the Volante, the DB9 was the successor of the DB7. It was the <b>first</b> <b>model</b> built at Aston Martin's Gaydon facility.|$|E
5|$|The Model D was the <b>first</b> <b>model</b> {{to enter}} actual production. A {{small number of}} Model D {{instruments}} were sold, beginning in July 1941, before it was superseded by the DU.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>model</b> to be commercially {{manufactured}} was the Mk I in 1963. An updated version, the Mk II, {{was released}} {{the following year}} which featured the full set of sounds selectable by banks and stations. The instrument was expensive, costing £1,000, {{at a time when}} a typical house cost £2,000–£3,000.|$|E

5|$|Haifa has {{developed}} in tiers, {{from the lower}} to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part {{to make way for}} government buildings. Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the <b>first</b> <b>model</b> of urban planning in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1995, Boeing {{delivered}} the <b>first</b> <b>model</b> with General Electric GE90-77B engines to British Airways, which entered service five days later. Initial service {{was affected by}} gearbox bearing wear issues, which caused British Airways to temporarily withdraw its 777 fleet from transatlantic service in 1997, returning to full service later that year. General Electric subsequently announced engine upgrades.|$|E

5|$|The CQC-6 (Close Quarters Combat— Six) or Viper Six is a {{handmade}} tactical {{folding knife}} with a tantō blade manufactured by knifemaker Ernest Emerson. Although initially reported as the sixth design in an evolution of fighting knives and the <b>first</b> <b>model</b> {{in the lineup}} of Emerson's Specwar Custom Knives, Emerson later revealed that the knife was named for SEAL Team Six. It has a chisel-ground blade of ATS-34 or 154CM stainless steel and a handle made of titanium and linen micarta. The CQC-6 is credited as the knife that popularized {{the concept of the}} tactical folding knife.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 is the <b>first</b> <b>model</b> to be {{built at}} Aston Martin's Gaydon {{facility}} in Warwickshire, England. In a 2007 interview, Aston Martin CEO Dr. Ulrich Bez stated that, though Aston Martin was traditionally a maker of more exclusive automobiles, he believed Aston Martin needed to be more visible and build more cars. At launch, Aston Martin planned to build between 1,400 and 1,500 DB9s per year.|$|E
5|$|The Sholes and Glidden {{typewriter}} incorporated several components {{adapted from}} existing devices, such as escapement (a mechanism governing carriage movement) adapted from clockwork, keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers {{adapted from the}} piano. In developing the <b>first</b> <b>model,</b> however, Sholes and Soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and, consequently, developed several poor designs {{which could have been}} avoided. The failure to research earlier designs also led to the reinvention of features which had already been developed. Soule, for example, suggested a circular typebar orientation. A circular arrangement had been used more than 30years earlier in a machine designed by Xavier Progin in 1833.|$|E

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>model</b> in production, in June 1935, was the Model A. It {{contained}} most of {{the features}} {{that came to be}} standard on all console Hammonds, including two 61-key manuals, a 25-key pedalboard, an expression pedal, 12 reverse-color preset keys, two sets of drawbars for each manual, and one for the pedals.|$|E
5|$|The square-windowed Comet 1 was the <b>first</b> <b>model</b> produced, a {{total of}} 12 {{aircraft}} in service and test. Following closely the design features of the two prototypes, the only noticeable change was the adoption of four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units, replacing the single main wheels. Four Ghost 50 Mk 1 engines were fitted (later replaced by more powerful Ghost DGT3 series engines). The span was 115ft (35.05m), and overall length 93ft (28.35m); the maximum takeoff weight was over 105,000lb (47.628kg) and over 40 passengers could be carried.|$|E
5|$|To {{keep costs}} down while {{ensuring}} sufficient longevity, Sega opted to create the platform from popular off-the-shelf components. The <b>first</b> <b>model</b> to be developed was actually the SC-3000, a computer version with a built-in keyboard, but when Sega learned of Nintendo's plans to release a games-only console, they began developing the SG-1000 alongside the SC-3000.|$|E

5|$|Eidos hired several {{models to}} portray Lara Croft at {{publicity}} events, promotions, trade shows, and photo shoots. Nathalie Cook was the <b>first</b> <b>model,</b> portraying the character from 1996 to 1997. Cook {{was followed by}} British actress Rhona Mitra from 1997 to 1998. Eidos then updated the Croft costume to match its video game depiction. Core Design reportedly restricted Mitra's dialogue as the character at trade shows and out of costume. French model Vanessa Demouy succeeded Mitra {{for a brief time}} until fashion model Nell McAndrew took over the role at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo. McAndrew portrayed Croft from 1998 until 1999, when Eidos fired her for posing in Playboy, which used the character and Tomb Raider franchise to promote the McAndrew's issue without Eidos's approval. Core Design was granted an injunction against the magazine to protect the character's image; Playboy was ordered to place stickers {{on the cover of the}} issue to conceal the reference to Tomb Raider. Eidos later donated McAndrew's Tomb Raider costume to a UNICEF charity auction.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 2000, Boeing {{launched}} its next-generation twinjet program, initially called 777-X, and began issuing offers to airlines. Development was slowed by an industry downturn {{during the early}} 2000s. The <b>first</b> <b>model</b> {{to emerge from the}} program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France, along with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004. The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins and Edgar Anderson wrote a {{paper in}} 1954 on the {{importance}} of hybridization in adapting to new environments. They proposed novel adaptations would facilitate the invasion of habitats not utilized previously by either parent and that novel adaptations may facilitate the formation of stabilized hybrid species. Following this paper, Stebbins developed the <b>first</b> <b>model</b> of adaptive radiation. He proposed that a high degree of genetic variability was necessary for major evolutionary advances, that because of slow mutation rates, genetic recombination was the most likely source of this variation, and that variation could be maximised though hybridization. As of 2006, research is ongoing regarding whether hybridization is an accidental consequence of evolution or if it is necessary for the creation and evolution of plant species; {{it has been argued that}} contemporary studies are part of an intellectual lineage that started with the work of Stebbins and Anderson.|$|E
