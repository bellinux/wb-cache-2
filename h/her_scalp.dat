2500|$|Mrs. Schneider was {{attacked}} {{in the early}} evening hours of August 5, 1918. [...] The 8 months pregnant, 28-year-old of Elmira Street, [...] awoke to find a dark figure standing over her, and was bashed in the face repeatedly. [...] <b>Her</b> <b>scalp</b> had been cut open, and her face was completely covered in blood. [...] Mrs. Schneider was discovered after midnight by her husband, Ed Schneider, who was returning late from work. Schneider claimed that she remembered nothing of the attack, and gave birth to a healthy baby girl two days after the incident. Her husband told police that nothing was stolen from the home, besides six or seven dollars that had been in his wallet. [...] The windows and doors of the apartment appear to have not been forced open, and authorities {{came to the conclusion that}} the woman was most likely attacked with a lamp that had been on a nearby table. James Gleason, who police said was an ex-convict, was arrested shortly after Schneider was found. [...] Gleason was later released due to a complete lack of evidence, and stated that he originally ran from authorities because he had so often been arrested. [...] Lead investigators began to publicly speculate that the attack was related to the previous incidents involving Besumer and Maggio.|$|E

5000|$|Author Anthony C.

2500|$|Proponents of nonsubordination theory propose {{several reasons}} why it works best to explain {{domestic}} violence. [...] First, there are certain recurring patterns in domestic violence that indicate {{it is not the}} result of intense anger or arguments, but rather is a form of subordination. [...] This is evidenced in part by the fact that domestic violence victims are typically abused in a variety of situations and by a variety of means. [...] For example, victims are sometimes beaten after they have been sleeping or have been separated from the batterer, and often the abuse takes on a financial or emotional form in addition to physical abuse. [...] Supporters of nonsubordination theory use these examples to dispel the notion that battering is always the result of heat of the moment anger or intense arguments. [...] Also, batterers often employ manipulative and deliberate tactics when abusing their victims, which can “rang from searching for and destroying a treasured object of hers to striking her in areas of her body that do not show bruises (e.g. <b>her</b> <b>scalp)</b> or in areas where she would be embarrassed to show others her bruises.” [...] These behaviors can be even more useful to a batterer when the batterer and the victim share children, because the batterer often controls the family’s financial assets, making the victim less likely to leave if it would put her children at risk.|$|E
2500|$|On February 24, 2010, Dawn Brancheau, {{a female}} 40-year-old trainer with 16 years of {{experience}} at the park, died in another incident involving Tilikum. SeaWorld's head of animal training said that during a rubdown after the show, Tilikum pulled the trainer into the water by her ponytail, and she drowned. Eyewitness trainers and audience members, however, stated that Tilikum dragged her into the water by her left forearm, {{near the end of}} the show. The autopsy report said she died from drowning and traumatic injuries, including removal of <b>her</b> <b>scalp.</b> This was the third time since being first put on public display that Tilikum has been involved in a human death. By February 27, SeaWorld Orlando whale shows resumed with trainers practicing increased caution and not joining the whales in the water. SeaWorld announced they have invited experts from outside marine parks and aquariums to review SeaWorld's handling of killer whales and also Tilikum specifically. On August 23, 2010, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fined the park US$75,000 for three infractions, two of which were directly related to this incident. One related citation was designated as [...] "willful" [...] and was [...] "committed with plain indifference to or intentional disregard for employee safety and health". The other related citation was a [...] "serious" [...] violation relating to a missing safety rail at Shamu Stadium. At the time of the fine, SeaWorld called OSHA's findings [...] "unfounded". Later hearings revealed that SeaWorld had concealed an earlier incident when another whale, Ikaika, had bitten a trainer in 2006. During a hearing where SeaWorld continued its challenge of OSHA's findings, former SeaWorld trainer Jeff Andrews - being presented as an expert - stated his opinion that the victim died as a result of a mistake she had made while near the water. He continued that he did not agree that Tilikum showed [...] "aggressive behavior" [...] during the incident. On May 31, 2012, Occupational Safety and Health Administration administrative law judge Ken Welsch cited SeaWorld for two violations in the death of the trainer and fined the company a total of $12,000. The final decision was issued on June 11, 2012.|$|E

Then, as the happy throng sped by her with loads of things to make the children sick, she leaned against an iron lamp-post in front of a bake-shop and turned on the wicked envy. She thought, poor thing, she would like to be a cake--for this little girl was very hungry indeed. Then she tried again, and thought she would like to be a tart with smashed fruit inside; then she would be warmed over every day and nobody would eat her. For the child was cold as well as hungry. Finally, she tried quite hard, and thought she could be very well content as an oven; for then she would be kept always hot, and bakers would put all manner of good things into her with a long shovel." ...|$|E

50|$|The first Smoke Hole {{settlers}} followed {{quickly on}} the heels of the first in the South Branch valley, which arrived in the late 1740s. A man named Steele (given name now lost) was the first Smoke Holer, arriving sometime in the 1750s. He built a cabin near the (still standing) Palestine Church and his daughter Katie married another pioneer, George Full — the first wedding celebrated in the Canyon. Another young Steele daughter, Susie, out alone searching for a family cow, fell victim to a wandering band of Native Americans. Her father found <b>her</b> <b>scalped,</b> she died soon after, and he buried her nearby on a small promontory still known as “Susie Hill”. George Full built his home and a grist mill in the same vicinity. The parents of Revolutionary War veteran William Eagle (1761-1848) arrived shortly afterward. (Eagle returned after the war and is buried near the 300-foot-high crag that bears his name.) Another Revolutionary War veteran settled there in the years after the conflict, but he — Charles Bleachynden — had been one of the enemy: he was one of the Hessian soldiers (German mercenaries) surrendered at Yorktown in 1781 with Lord Cornwallis' forces.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{strength}} was failing her fast now, but she struggled on determinedly; {{at least she}} had saved her father and mother. Two minutes later she started at the report of a gun behind, and the splash of a ball in the water alongside the canoe. She {{felt that she was}} safe now. The red-skins would not have stopped to fire had they not felt that it was their last chance of revenge. A few more strokes and she looked round. The Indians were already on their way towards the shore. Then she let her paddle drop, and collapsed {{in the bottom of the}} canoe, hearing but faintly the sound of repeated shots from the scow, which was now but a little more than a quarter of a mile away. Hitherto they had been unable to fire, as the two canoes were in a line. Faintly she heard a shout in her father's voice: [...] "Are you hit, Mary?" [...] But she was incapable of making an effort to reply, and it was not until the scow came alongside and she was lifted on board that she was able to answer. The relief of her father and mother was intense when they found that she was unwounded. They had heard the Indians fire, and at the distance they were away it had seemed to them that the canoes were close to each other. They then saw the red-skins at once make for shore, and she had so quickly afterwards sunk into the canoe that they greatly feared she was wounded. The men with them, however, were unanimous in agreeing that she had not been hit. If she had been, they argued, her pursuers would certainly have paddled up to the canoe and taken <b>her</b> <b>scalp</b> before making for the shore. It was some time before she was able to tell her story, and the frontiersmen were as warm in their expressions of admiration for her coolness as were her parents.|$|E
60|$|In General Fraser's {{division}} {{was a young}} officer, Lieutenant David Jones, an American loyalist. His family had their home {{in the vicinity of}} Fort Edward before the Revolution. A mutual attachment had taken place between the youth and a beautiful girl named Jane McCrea, who resided with her brother {{on the banks of the}} Hudson, a few miles below Fort Edward. The lovers were engaged to be married, when the breaking out of the war severed families and disturbed all the relations of life. The Joneses were royalists; the brother of Miss McCrea was a stanch whig. The former removed to Canada, where he joined the royal standard, and received a lieutenant's commission. The attachment between the lovers continued, and it is probable that a correspondence was kept up between them. Lieutenant Jones was now in Fraser's camp; in his old neighborhood. Miss McCrea was on a visit to a widow lady, Mrs. O'Niel, residing at Fort Edward. The approach of Burgoyne's army had spread an alarm through the country; the inhabitants were flying from their homes. The brother of Miss McCrea determined to remove to Albany, and sent for his sister to return home and make ready to accompany him. She prepared, reluctantly, to obey, and was to embark in a large bateaux which was to convey several families down the river. The very morning when the embarkation was to take place the neighborhood was a scene of terror. A marauding party of Indians, sent out by Burgoyne to annoy General Schuyler, were harassing the country. Several of them burst into the house of Mrs. O'Niel, sacked and plundered it, and carried off her and Miss McCrea prisoners. In her fright the latter promised the savages a large reward if they would spare her life and take her in safety to the British camp. It was a fatal promise. Halting at a spring, a quarrel arose among the savages, inflamed most probably with drink, as to whose prize she was, and who was entitled to the reward. The dispute became furious, and one, in a paroxysm of rage, killed her on the spot. He completed the savage act by bearing off <b>her</b> <b>scalp</b> as a trophy.|$|E
