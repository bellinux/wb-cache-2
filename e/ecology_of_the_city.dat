50|$|According to {{contemporary}} research surrounding {{the notion of}} the city it is suggested {{that the best way to}} understand its existence is through the prism of an <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Viewing the city in this way as a living, bustling and thriving organism helps to cast light on the nature of the city, which is urban and to begin to home in on particular salient features of urban life. It is only with the advent of this relatively modern perspective on the urban that it has become possible to speak in terms of street sports. Today, with this view established, a variety of sub-disciplines within the phenomena have evolved, with each successive development representing a further refinement of the concepts expression. For example, whereas earlier it may have been natural to discuss skateboarding or stickball in isolation as cultural phenomena occurring in the urban environment, with the introduction of the broader concept of street sports it has become possible to explore a range of urban phenomena in the broader context of the urban. The result has been a greater scope and complexity to our understanding and appreciation of how urban life manifests itself culturally.|$|E
40|$|Having {{agreed and}} shown the {{importance}} of the acoustic dimension of everyday urban life in Cairo (Egypt) and proved the inclusion of these ambiances in social life as social productions, it was appropriate to carry on with ethnography. To do this, the first difficulty encountered is a low-verbalization by Cairo people of this sensory dimension. The authors have therefore developed an original methodology by testing an experimental procedure, "Mics in the Ears", opening access to the "natural language on the sounds" This ethnography of acoustic environments of the Egyptian metropolis highlights two trends we summarize as follows: socialization of sound and a "soundization" of the social. Remain to fully develop what is already hinted at in the sound descriptions of the city by its inhabitants: an acoustic <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Cairo...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until September 2018. Mobile music {{listening}} {{has become an}} increasingly pervasive part of urban life. Yet it represents an area of enquiry with which urban studies scholars have yet to meaningfully engage. This paper considers <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> mobile music devices in creating new sonic, emotional and social interactions with and within <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> While academic {{work in this area}} has emphasized <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> these devices as a ‘tuning out’ <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physicality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> we suggest that they might also be used as part of a ‘tuning in’ that enhances the meaning and intensity <b>of</b> engagements with <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> In making this case, the paper considers two areas of academic enquiry that highlight <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> mobile music devices in intensified engagements with the city: first, recent writing on <b>the</b> sonic <b>ecologies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> that emphasize ‘city sounds’ as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban experience; and second recent advances in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> urban computing that provide technologies for location-aware music-exchanges and mediated social interactions.

First, it focuses on the functional crisis that growing demands for domestic and industrial use posed to traditional water collection and drainage methods. Second, it analyzes <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> new networks for urban water supply and removal and shows that changes to infrastructure were driven not only by hygienic concerns but also by <b>the</b> functional reorganization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban system. Finally, it argues that water management deeply transformed <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emerging modern <b>city,</b> since it resulted in <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> a unitary and mechanized water circuit, in new forms of soil and water pollution, and in relations between <b>cities</b> and <b>the</b> territorial water system...|$|R
40|$|Many changes wrought {{during the}} {{construction}} of "designer ecosystems" are intended to ensure - and often succeed in ensuring - that a city can provide ecosystem goods and services; but other changes have unintended impacts on the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> impairing its ability to provide these critical functions. Indian Bend Wash, an urbanizing watershed in the Central Arizona-Phoenix (CAP) ecosystem, provides an excellent case study of how human alteration of land cover, stream channel structure, and hydrology affect ecosystem processes, both intentionally and unintentionally. The construction of canals created new flowpaths that cut across historic stream channels, {{and the creation of}} artificial lakes produced sinks for fine sediments and hotspots for nitrogen processing. Further hydrologic manipulations, such as groundwater pumping, linked surface flows to the aquifer and replaced ephemeral washes with perennial waters. These alterations of hydrologic structure are typical by-products of urban growth in arid and semiarid regions and create distinct spatial and temporal patterns of nitrogen availability. © 2008 American Institute of Biological Sciences...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} of population, environmental and accessiblity variables to registration and attendance by mothers of children under 6 at the Family Health Clinic in Calabar, Nigeria are investigated. The technique {{used to analyze}} the data collected is categorical data analysis which proceeds in two stages, variable selection to reduce the variable set and fitting a log-linear model to the reduced set. Details of the statistical procedures used are provided to indicate how categorical data analysis {{can be used as a}} valuable tool of analysis in medical geographical studies that employ count or frequency data. It was found that younger mothers and Ibibio women registered more often at the clinic than did their counterparts. However, if the relatively sparse data on fathers is accepted, the association between age and registration is found to be spurious and a model can be substituted which shows younger fathers and fathers who spoke a non-Efik/Ibibio language to be associated with higher clinic registration of mothers. It was further found that for registered mothers the probability of a clinic visit was decreased by mother's age, increased by distance given no travel cost, unaffected by distance given some travel cost, increased by travel cost given a short distance to the clinic and decreased by travel cost given a longer distance from the clinic. These results are discussed in relation to population characteristics such as socio-economic status, clinic procedures such as health worker activities, transportation availability in Calabar, the spatial <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and local environmental conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Boomtown,” a {{collection}} of poems by James Engelhardt, explores the landscape, culture, and non-human nature of Lincoln, NE from deep pre-history to the contemporary era. Based on research into the history and <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> “Boomtown”’s early sections resist the familiar first-person narrative in favor of descriptive lyric, short narrative, and persona poems. The collection rejects boosterism and teleology by focusing on marginalized populations and settings, including non-human nature, immigrants, women and men, and domestic life (many poems rely on recipes as an organizing principle). Major events and figures are touched on, often as a frame within which a more intimate scene takes place. By the final section, the reader has a context for contemporary life in the city. The introduction, “Ecology of a Boomtown,” describes the research process and situates the poems in the developing fields of ecopoetics and ecocriticism. The ideas of scholars such as Joni Adamson, Leonard Scigaj, David Gilcrest, Scott Bryson, Neil Evernden, Leslie Paul Thiele, and Glen Love are used to develop and extend the place- and nature-based poetry of “Boomtown” beyond the nature writing tradition. The ecopoetry of the collected poems relies on fiction, an understanding of interdependence between human and non-human, and a respect for deep history. The introduction also notes poetic influences ranging from mid-twentieth century poets Muriel Rukeyser and William Carlos Williams to germinal ecological poets such as Gary Snyder and Simon Ortiz, and from fairly formal poets such as W. S. Merwin, and William Stafford to the more experimental contemporary poets Arthur Sze and Brenda Hillman, among others. By taking on one small city {{in the middle of}} the country, “Boomtown” deepens our understanding of life in the last century and a half. ...|$|E
30|$|The ‘smart city’—insofar as {{the concept}} has any {{definitive}} purchase—is really what I termed in my (2008) a ‘hyperspatial’ city. That is, its social {{world is not}} just connected, but hyperconnected. This means that the risks it generates are not just those of an everyday physical space, or even what was once termed a ‘cyberspace’, but perils with multidimensional properties—ones which go far beyond mass data-veillance, or <b>the</b> hacking <b>of</b> a home hub by tech-savvy burglars. For as McLuhan once warned, when citizens are multiply interconnected, the second order nervous system which emerges risks generating debilitation as much as facilitation, deformation rather than information and insecurity rather than security. In this paper I address <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> this risk from two angles. First the way <b>the</b> advent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smart <b>city</b> concept has also revealed a striking level of unpreparedness for managing everyday life and security within hyperconnected urban space. Given that cities have always been technologies rather than merely technologized, there are profound questions to be asked about why this latest evolution of our most successful tool for enabling mass proximity social organisation has been perceived to be so different from previous transitions. A second angle focuses more directly upon <b>the</b> metaphysics and <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hyperconnected <b>city.</b> Utilising two key determinants of contemporary urban life, the virtualised economy and automated governance I consider whether life within <b>the</b> smart <b>city</b> may so reorder traditional ideas <b>of</b> security and <b>the</b> citizen that both are rendered obsolete.|$|R
40|$|An {{infrastructure}} system – here, <b>the</b> industrial <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> Gothenburg — is {{more important}} for society than we usually credit it for (cf. Technology is society made durable, Latour 1990) and is taken for granted by most inhabitants. Gothenburg is an unusually well-developed and interconnected infrastructure system. The first district heating facility was put in operation in 1952. Soon enough, waste was re-used and recycled into energy, into both electricity and heat. With time, more varied materials and sources became integrated into the system to also produce biogas and compost. The project makes a historiographic description <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> industrial <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gothenburg <b>city</b> region developed since the Gothenburg technical environmental flow system is unique in size, age, diversity of flows and functions. The study describes environmental flows and their actors in a networked organization. The focus on interconnectivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different actors, flows and sectors <b>of</b> Gothenburg requires <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> several theoretical fields. Such theoretical fields include Networked Learning, which takes a relational stance in which learning takes place both in relation to others, and in relation to learning resources (Dirckinck-Homfeld et al., 2009); STS (Science Technology and Society), which study how technical innovation are affected by social, political and cultural values, and how these innovation affect, in turn, political, social and cultural values; (Joerges & Novotny, 2003); and Urban Metabolism, which uses models to facilitate the description and analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy and materials within cities, such as Material Flow Analysis of a city, and provides a metaphorical framework to study <b>the</b> interactions <b>of</b> natural and human systems in specific regions.

[...] University <b>of</b> Washington, 2014 <b>The</b> {{stresses}} {{caused by}} rapid urbanization in the Greater Seattle area have reignited the importance for neighborhood associations, citizens, {{health and human}} service providers, parks and recreation, and the local government to work together, through resource collaboration, to promote livable and thriving communities. In this case study, I describe <b>the</b> neighborhood <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lake <b>City</b> community utilizing four objectives to understand the urban planning and community building processes. This first objective was to understand <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood urban design and planning process, led by the local government and private developers, in <b>the</b> urban core <b>of</b> Lake City. This was accomplished by analyzing the historical and operative dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban design and planning processes, to then understand <b>the</b> impacts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood planning by various stakeholders in the urban core. The second objective was to understand how a community-oriented design and planning processes might affect <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> citizen engagement within the neighborhood, finding, surprisingly that it increased stress in residents and neighborhood leaders. The third objective was to assess if increased social engagement can promote increased social cohesion and decrease perceptions of fear and unsafe zones within <b>the</b> neighborhood. Examples <b>of</b> small events that promoted positive engagement included trash cleanups and father's day events, and although there were of positive impact, there was a limit as to how far these resident-led projects changed {{the internal and external}} urban planning process.

40|$|Urban {{growth is}} a complex {{dynamical}} process associated with landscape change driving forces such as the environment, politics, geography and many others that affect the city at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Istanbul, {{one of the largest}} agglomerations in Europe and the fifth-largest city in {{the world in terms of}} population within city limits, has been growing very rapidly over the late 20 th century at a rate of 3. 45 %, causing to have many environmental issues. Recently, Istanbul’s new third bridge and proposed new routes for across the Bosphorus are foreseen to not only threaten the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> but also it will give a way to new areas for unplanned urbanization. The dimensions of this threat are affirmed by the urban sprawl especially after the construction of the second bridge and the connections such as Trans European Motorway (TEM). Since the spatial and temporal components of urbanization can be more simply identified through modeling, this study aims to analyze the urban change and assess the ecological threats in Istanbul city through the proper modeling for the year 2040. For this purpose, commonly used urban modeling approach, the Markov Chain within Cellular Automata (CA), was selected to simulate urban/non-urban growth process. CA is a simple and effective tool to capture and simulate the complexity of urban system dynamic. The key factor for a Markov is the transition probability matrix, which defines change trend from past to today and into the future for a certain class type, and land use suitability maps for urban. Multi Criteria Analysis was used to build these suitability maps.

40|$|The 21 st {{century has}} been {{designated}} the Urban Century given that over {{fifty percent of the}} world's population is reported to be living in cities. Indigenous populations are not alien to this demographic trend. In Mexico, an underestimated 35 percent of the indigenous population lives in cities. Over the last decade, the global demographic transition towards urbanization coupled with city-based indigenous activism has drawn scholars to systematically study indigenous urban experiences as forms of cultural resilience and innovation. Yet, little {{attention has been paid to}} the intersection between indigenous populations and the political ecology of urbanization as a dynamic process. This dissertation contributes to a better understanding of the intersection between indigeneity and urbanization by taking a political ecology approach to study the relationship between the Yaqui people and the city of Hermosillo in Sonora, Mexico. The Yaqui people [...] Yoemem [...] locate their ancestral homeland along the Yaqui River, about 220 kilometers south of Hermosillo. In the last century, however, they established diasporic communities across the Greater Southwest, including in Hermosillo. This dissertation specifically addresses three overarching questions. First, it asks how urbanization plays a role within indigenous Yaqui struggles over resource governance in a context where people have little political and economic power. Second, it asks how indigenous communities have adapted the cultural practices of their ancestors to marginal urban environments and specifically how they deal with the environmental and legal challenges imposed by the process of urbanization. Finally, it asks how analytical attention to urban indigenous struggles and indigenous accounts of those struggles present a more nuanced history of the urbanization of nature. These research questions were addressed through a mixed-methods approach that integrated twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork, comparative analysis of museum collections, and review of legal materials and documentary sources associated with indigenous rights and urban development at the municipal, state, and national levels. At its core, this dissertation integrates two related but yet-to-be-engaged theoretical discussions: anthropological critiques of the myth of the noble savage who belongs to nature, and political ecology deconstruction of the myth of the modern city that exists outside nature. Research findings indicate that situated urban indigenous experiences constitute an extension of indigenous territories into new areas. In articulating their indigenous identities the Yaquis of Hermosillo incorporate the city into their indigenous homeland, and in turn transform the political <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: In India, ragpickers form <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> {{hierarchy}} of informal sector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid waste management. Assessment of general and gender specific health {{of women is}} conducted in this study in view of dearth of published evidence. Materials and Methods: An interventional study was conducted from October 2003 to April 2005 in Mumbai, at <b>the</b> field office <b>of</b> a nongovernmental organization working for women ragpickers. By the systematic random sampling 168 women ragpickers were selected. Both general and gender-specific health needs of this socially and occupationally marginalized group, including health seeking behavior were explored in this study. Fourteen participants were trained as health volunteers to create awareness in the local community. The data was analyzed by using SPSS version 11. 0 software program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Results: Marriage at young age, multiple pregnancies, low preference toward temporary methods of contraception, high addiction were prevalent in this lower socioeconomic young workforce. Morbidity was statistically significant among ragpickers who collected rags along dumpsite than street side and door to door waste collectors (χ 2 = 27. 8; df = 2; P < 0. 001 significant). A need-based training program helped to improve knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants [z = 12. 7 (P < 0. 05) ].

As the work directed the audience {{to move from one}} site to another in both a real time experience of architecture and its multiple representation including a digital intervention into the Royal Mills’ residents’ website it is vital that <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> location, medium and experience are fully understood. A major focus for the project was <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regeneration, transformation and use of specific buildings that make up <b>the</b> historic fabric <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>The</b> research involved a collaborative process <b>of</b> engagement with <b>the</b> three significant sites for this inquiry.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{study area}} <b>of</b> Deep Bay in the Southern China has been {{recognized}} as ecologically important site. This study presents a wetland change detection analysis incorporating both geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques. Both natural and artificial wetlands are considered as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deep Bay wetland system. For instance, mangrove forests, fish ponds and shrimp ponds (gei wai) are all considered as wetlands in this study. This study {{is to find out}} how much area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wetland system has been lost due to <b>the</b> conversion <b>of</b> land cover types in recent decades. In particular, this study uses supervised classification and change detection analysis on the satellite images which were acquired in three different time periods (1975, 1994, and 2009). It is a quantitative result which was based on <b>the</b> numbers <b>of</b> pixel changed on the images. The result shows that 39. 76 % of fishpond and 20. 47 % of mangrove in terms of pixels have been changed to urban or residential area between 1975 and 2009. The result implies both Shenzhen and Hong Kong side of Deep Bay has significant wetland loss in recent decades. Moreover, the Deep Bay in Hong Kong includes an Aerial Photos area change analysis. This study presents three different sets of land use data which was created according to <b>the</b> manual interpretation <b>of</b> aerial photos in three different time periods (1973, 1986, and 2011). The aerial photos mainly focus on the fishpond and mangrove change in recent decades. The qualitative results show that a lot of locations were no longer mapped as wetlands in recent decades. The quantitative results illustrate the total wetland areas in the Hong Kong side of Deep Bay were continuously decreased from 1973 to 2011 by 19. 06 %. Additionally, the study also presents a change analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nightlight imageries. Previous research found that urban development and <b>the</b> brightness value <b>of</b> nightlight imageries are highly correlated. The study uses two nightlight imageries which were acquired from 1992 and 2009 to examine whether Deep Bay has a rapid increase in urban developments. The result shows that the brightness value has continuously increased during the period with more changes in <b>the</b> western side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study area. Moreover, the average brightness value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study area has increased by 17. 6 %. It can show that there is an increase of urban activities in recent years. Based on the change detection analysis, it can be concluded that urban development such as reclamation is the major threat to the Deep Bay wetland system. Furthermore, there are more changes occurred in the Wetland Conservation Area and Wetland Barrier Area in Hong Kong. Both of them are either close to or around the Ramsar site. The area {{may not be able to}} support further wetland loss in the future. This study can definitely provide some information to the government and policy-makers on strategic planning of land use in Deep Bay.
