5|$|He was {{initially}} appointed {{to command the}} 5th <b>Gendarmerie</b> Detachment in Görz (now the Italian town of Gorizia). On 23 June 1914 {{he was promoted to}} Gendarmerie-Oberleutnant (first lieutenant). In August he was appointed to command the coastal <b>gendarmerie</b> section at Grado and the following month he was transferred to the border guard section based at Tolmein, in modern-day Slovenia. A few days after the outbreak of World War I, Meyszner married Pia Gostischa from Marburg an der Drau, the couple eventually had one daughter and one son. On 19 May 1915, Meyszner was posted as the commander of a <b>gendarmerie</b> company on the Italian Front. Later that year he was appointed as the commander of the 12th Alpine Company. On 1 August 1916, he was promoted to Rittmeister (captain) with effect from 11 August. During 1916–1917, Meyszner was a <b>gendarmerie</b> section commander, and in 1917 he served as an alpine advisor to the 15th Mountain Brigade. In August 1917 he was recalled to <b>gendarmerie</b> duties in Triest. In November 1918 he was transferred to the Styrian <b>gendarmerie</b> command in Graz. He was wounded once, and was also awarded several decorations for his service during the war, including the Order of the Iron Crown 3rd Class, Military Merit Cross 3rd Class, Military Merit Medal with Swords and War Decoration, Karl Troop Cross and Red Cross Decoration 2nd Class.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} erupted on October 17, 1918, with {{an attack}} by 100 rebel cacos on a <b>gendarmerie</b> barracks. The assault was repulsed with significant loss of life, and commanding officer Lieutenant Patrick Kelly earned Haiti's Médaille militaire and a promotion to captain {{for his role in}} the defense of the barracks. A wave of small-scale rebel attacks on isolated <b>gendarmerie</b> outposts followed; over a six-month period in 1919, the <b>gendarmerie</b> reported more than 130 engagements with cacos.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the <b>gendarmerie</b> was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would {{eventually}} evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the <b>Gendarmerie</b> d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the <b>gendarmerie</b> worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E

That year, he had become involved with the German-nationalist sporting association Deutsch-Völkischen Turnvereins and was made a leader in the right-wing paramilitary Steirischen Heimatschutz (Styrian Home Guard). He later used his senior position in the <b>gendarmerie</b> to funnel arms to the Home Guard.|$|E

5|$|On 20 May, the {{recently}} formed Home Guard battalions began to deploy into the Adriatic Command area. On 27 May, 6 officers and 300 gendarmes of the Sarajevo-based 4th <b>Gendarmerie</b> Regiment were deployed into parts of eastern Herzegovina. They established platoon strength posts in Nevesinje, Trebinje, Gacko and Bileća, with their headquarters also in Bileća. The Dubrovnik-based 2nd <b>Gendarmerie</b> Regiment established posts in Stolac and Berkovići. The headquarters of Adriatic Command {{was transferred to}} Mostar in late May, and General Ivan Prpić was appointed as its commander.|$|E

5|$|While {{he agreed}} to relieve Meyszner as HSSPF for Serbia and Montenegro, Himmler did this by {{transferring}} him to Berlin and appointing him as Generalinspekteur der <b>Gendarmerie</b> und Schutzpolizei der Gemeinden (General Inspector of the <b>Gendarmerie</b> and Schutzpolizei in the Reich) {{with the intention of}} establishing a Europe-wide <b>gendarmerie.</b> Nothing is known about Meyszner's activities in this role. At the end of the war, he fell {{into the hands of the}} Western Allies and his high SS rank ensured attention from investigators. He was interrogated by the United States Chief Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality, Robert H. Jackson, in June 1945 and was placed into Yugoslav custody soon after. His involvement in the carrying out of reprisal executions both on his own account and on behalf of the Wehrmacht, and the publication of his name along with lists of those executed, meant that his fate was certain.|$|E
5|$|Dangić was {{released}} from prison in November 1918, at the end of World War I. The following year, he and Božo Ilić organized a series of communist demonstrations in Belgrade, for which they were arrested and imprisoned. Following his release, Dangić {{became a member of the}} League of Farmers, a political party that sought to protect the interests of the Bosnian Serb peasantry, and which the historian Marko Attila Hoare describes as a precursor to the Chetnik movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina during World War II. Dangić also obtained a law degree and spent some time as a district officer in Belgrade, Subotica, Kratovo and Vlasenica. By 1928, he had achieved the rank of cavalry sub-lieutenant. He joined the <b>gendarmerie</b> on 3 January 1928, and worked his way up to the rank of major. Over the course of his <b>gendarmerie</b> service, he served in Skopje, Tuzla, Virovitica, and Zagreb. In 1940, he was appointed to lead the <b>gendarmerie</b> detachment stationed at the Yugoslav royal palace. He was married and had two daughters, born in 1931 and 1937.|$|E

5|$|In January 1942, the Hungarian {{army and}} <b>gendarmerie</b> {{undertook}} a major raid in southern Bačka, {{during which they}} massacred 2,550 Serbs, 743 Jews and 47 other people {{in places such as}} Bečej, Srbobran and Novi Sad, under the pretext that they were searching for Partisans. Other sources place the number of Serbs and Jews massacred in Novi Sad as being much lower, at around 879. Raids were carried out in Šajkaš (Sajkásvidék) over 4–19 January; in Novi Sad (Újvidék) over 21–23 January; and in Bečej (Óbecse) over 25–29 January. Over the period 4–24 January, massacres were carried out by the Hungarian 15th Light Division commanded by Major General József Grassy and units of the Royal <b>Gendarmerie.</b> The operations were ordered by Grassy, Lieutenant General Ferenc Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Colonel László Deák, and Royal <b>Gendarmerie</b> Captain Dr. Márton Zöldi. In addition to Serbs and Jews, members of other ethnicities were also victims: Roma people, a small number of Russian refugees who had fled Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution, and some local Hungarians. In mid-1942, the Yugoslav government-in-exile reported that churches had been looted and destroyed, and that Serbian Orthodox holy days had been prohibited by the Hungarian administration. These reports stated that the a camp in Novi Sad held 13,000 Serb and Jewish men, women and children.|$|E
5|$|On 17 and 18 June, Tonogal and Lieutenant Colonel Aganović, <b>gendarmerie</b> {{commander}} {{for eastern}} Herzegovina, made {{an attempt to}} calm the situation by visiting villages east of the Gacko–Avtovac road to re-establish peace in the area. They received a written message from four villages {{that they did not}} acknowledge the NDH authorities, and wanted the message to be passed on to the Italians. The residents of the villages of Jasenik and Lipnik were willing to talk and return to work, but they asked that the <b>gendarmerie</b> not visit their villages, as this would tempt the Montenegrins to attack. Aganović assessed that while this was probably true, their request was insincere. The <b>gendarmerie</b> commander in Bileća believed that the reason for the rebellion was that the local Serbs were wedded to the idea of Greater Serbia, and did not accept that their villages were part of the NDH. This approach essentially meant that local Serbs wanted the NDH authorities to leave them alone and not impose on their lives. According to the historian Davor Marijan, this was a poor choice that gave the Ustaše an excuse to take radical action.|$|E
50|$|According to {{official}} figures, it was claimed that nearly 2000 PKK members became itirafçı ("confessors") after their arrest.

5|$|Some <b>gendarmerie</b> actions, {{including}} {{the enforcement of}} government press censorship, {{and the use of}} conscripted civilian labor for infrastructure development, have been cited as factors leading to the Second Caco War (1918–20), a rebellion by Haitians against the occupation.|$|E
5|$|The NDH {{authorities}} in Trebinje heard rumours that the Serbs could start an uprising there on 28 June, the feast day of Saint Vitus, and warned NDH {{forces in the}} region to be prepared for a revolt. As a result of these reports, the Poglavnik (leader) of the NDH, Ante Pavelić, issued orders threatening that anyone who spread these rumours would be court-martialled. On the eve of the feast day, both the <b>gendarmerie</b> and Ustaše took several hostages in case the rumours were true. Later, the <b>gendarmerie</b> released their hostages, but the 19 hostages held by the Ustaše were killed. In contrast to the actions of the Ustaše, the Home Guard units in the area tried to calm the situation down.|$|E
