5|$|The Ulstermen {{eventually}} rouse, {{one by one}} at first, {{and finally}} en masse. The final battle begins. Cú Chulainn stays on the sidelines, recuperating from his wounds, until he sees Fergus advancing. He enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who keeps {{his side of the}} bargain and yields to him, pulling his forces off the field. Connacht's other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. At this inopportune moment she gets her period, and although Fergus forms a guard around her, Cú Chulainn breaks through as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy. However, he spares her because he does not think <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> kill women, and guards her retreat back to Connacht as far as Athlone.|$|E
25|$|The {{second part}} is signed by {{those from the}} first signing and in {{addition}} by professors Ulrich Kridweiss of Esslingen, Konrad Vorn of Kampen, Cornelius Pays of Breda and Dietrich of Balveren (Bummel). Signatories attest that: 1) The Masters of Holy Theology written below commend the Inquisitors into Heretical Depravity appointed by {{the authority of the}} Apostolic See in conformity with the Canons, and urge that they think <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> carry out their office zealously.2) The proposition that acts of sorcery can happen with God's permission through sorcerers or sorceresses when the Devil works with them is not contrary to the Catholic Faith, but consonant with the statements of Holy Scripture. Indeed, according to the pronouncements of the Holy Doctors it is necessary to admit that such acts can sometimes happen.3) It is therefore erroneous to preach that acts of sorcery cannot happen, because in this way preachers impede, {{to the extent that they}} can, the pious work of the inquisitors, to the prejudice of the salvation of souls. Nonetheless, secrets that are heard at any time by inquisitors should not be revealed to everyone.4) All princes and Catholics should be urged to think <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> assist such pious vows on the part of the Inquisitors in defense of the Holy Catholic Faith.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, wearing plain {{dress was}} {{an answer to}} a number of Friends' concerns. Expensive styles were used to show social {{inequality}} and make statements about wealth. Only a select few could afford expensive adornments, which could then be used to exacerbate differences between people based on class, where people in fancy clothing would not want to be seen socializing with others dressed tattily. This was part of the inspiration for the Quaker testimony to equality. In addition, the frequent buying of expensive new styles and discarding what had recently been bought, was considered wasteful and self-seeking, where Friends instead aimed to focus on simplicity, and the important things in life. Notably, Friends did not consider <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> judge people on their material possessions, but this could not be achieved in a society which placed an emphasis on keeping up to date with inconsequential but expensive new trends. At the time, this practice of plainness meant Friends were obviously identifiable.|$|E
500|$|Colbert's {{earliest}} mainstream exposure came in {{the prime}} time sketch comedy program The Dana Carvey Show. While only lasting seven episodes in early 1996, it provided Colbert with roles that would help forge his future onscreen persona. This was largely due to its format of delivering sketch performances directly to the camera. Although they did not air, several sketches inspired by The Onion also had Colbert playing a deadpan anchor delivering the news. In an interview with The New York Times regarding The Dana Carvey Show, Colbert noted, [...] "If you {{have an opportunity to}} give <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the audience, there’s a special connection that you make by looking at the camera." ...|$|E

The author regards Ahalya as an independent woman who makes her own decisions, takes risks and is driven by curiosity to experiment with the extraordinary and then accept the curse imposed on her by patriarchal society. It is this undaunted acceptance of the curse that makes the Ramayana praise and venerate her. V. R.

500|$|Following {{this was}} an {{anonymous}} review for the 1796 Analytical Review that stated, [...] "we learn with astonishment, that Joan of Arc, in its first form, in twelve books, was [...] finished in six weeks [...] We thought <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> mention a fact on which the author, by detailing it {{in the beginning of}} his preface, appears to lay some stress; but we wish entirely to forget it in our examination of the poem, and request our readers to do the same. The story, upon which this poem is founded, {{is one of the most}} interesting in the history of France, and is, in several respects, happily adapted to epic representation." [...] The review concluded: [...] "The general result of the impression which the perusal of this poem has made upon our minds is this: that, although the poem has some redundancies, which the chastised taste of maturer years would have struck out; though a manifest incongruity runs through the piece, in ascribing to characters of the fifteenth century the politics and metaphysics of an enlightened philosopher of the eighteenth; and though allegorical personages [...] but ill supply the place of that grand machinery [...] which have obtained the glorious meed of immortality; we, nevertheless, admire, the noble spirit of freedom, which is evidently the poet's inspiring muse".|$|E

Stipe said that he hoped fans realized it [...] "wasn't an easy decision": [...] "All things must end, {{and we wanted to}} do <b>it</b> <b>right,</b> <b>to</b> do it our way." [...] Long-time associate and former Warner Bros. Senior Vice President of Emerging Technology Ethan Kaplan has speculated that shake-ups at the record label influenced the group's decision to disband. The group discussed breaking up for several years, but was encouraged to continue after the lackluster critical and commercial performance of Around the Sun; according to Mills, [...] "We needed to prove, not only to our fans and critics but to ourselves, that we could still make great records." [...] They were also uninterested in the business end of recording as R.E.M. The band members finished their collaboration by assembling the compilation album Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011, which was released in November 2011. The album is the first to collect songs from R.E.M.'s I.R.S. and Warner Bros. tenures, as well as three songs from the group's final studio recordings from post-Collapse into Now sessions. In November, Mills and Stipe did a brief span of promotional appearances in British media, ruling out the option of the group ever reuniting.|$|E
500|$|The Howe {{brothers}} {{had been granted}} authority as peace commissioners by Parliament, with limited powers to pursue a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

[...] In that fruitless meeting, held July 20, Washington pointed out that the limited powers the Howe {{brothers had}} been given were not of much use, as the rebels had done no wrong requiring an amnesty.|$|E

He then examines how Plath blamed her father for her suffering, and identifies him in her poem [...] "Daddy" [...] with Nazism and makes allusions to the holocaust. Dalrymple writes that [...] "Plath felt <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> allude {{to one of the}} worst and most deliberate inflictions of mass-suffering in the whole of human history, merely on the basis that her father, who died when she was young, was German…the metaphorical use of the holocaust measures not the scale of her suffering, but of her self-pity". He asserts that before Plath, self-pity [...] "was regarded as a vice, even a disgusting one, that precluded sympathy", and that [...] "the appropriation of the suffering of others to boost the scale and significance of one's own suffering is now a commonplace." [...] He then analyses a number of figures, including Binjamin Wilkomirski and Margaret Seltzer, who he alleges [...] "make bogus claims to victim status" [...] and whose stories reveal perfectly [...] "the dialectic between sentimentality and brutality". Dalrymple ends the chapter by analysing victimhood {{in the criminal justice system}} and concludes, [...] "For the sentimentalist, of course, there is no such thing as a criminal, only an environment that has let him down".|$|E
500|$|In early {{planning}} stages of Final Fantasy VII, Aerith {{was to be}} one of only three protagonists; herself, Cloud and Barret. During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: [...] "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's maybe too obvious." [...] While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the [...] "perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." [...] He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked [...] "Is <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> set such an example to people?" [...] Kitase concluded: [...] "In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the end of}} World War I, the Australian Government {{began to}} worry about the threat Japan posed to Australia. Japan had {{extended}} its empire [...] to the south, bringing <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> Australia's doorstep. Japan had continued to build up its naval force, and had reached the point where it outgunned the Royal Navy in the Pacific. The RAN and the government believed that the possibility of a Japanese invasion was highly likely. In his report, Admiral Jellicoe believed that the threat of a Japanese invasion of Australia would remain as long as the White Australia Policy remained in place. Due to the perceived threat, and bilateral support in Australia for the White Australia Policy, the Australian Government became a vocal supporter of the continuance of the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Australia was joined in its support for the alliance by New Zealand but was heavily opposed by Canada, which believed that the alliance had hindered the British Empire's relationship with China and the United States. No decision on the alliance was agreed on, and the discussion was shelved pending the outcome of the Washington Naval Treaty. The results of the treaty, which allowed the British to retain naval supremacy in the Pacific Ocean, created a sense of security in Australia. Many Australians saw the Four Powers Pact as replacing the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. This sense of security became known as the Ten Year Rule. This led to defence retrenchments in Australia, following the international trend, and a £500,000 reduction in expenditure. The Governor-General Henry Forster when opening parliament on 22 June 1922 was quoted as saying: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it.
