25|$|On February 18, 1961, Sammartino faced Chick Garibaldi in an {{afternoon}} match at the Sunnyside Gardens in New York. During the match, Sammartino bodyslammed Garibaldi and immediately noticed his opponent's eyes roll up inside his head. By {{the time the}} ref checked on the fallen wrestler, he was dead in the ring. It was later determined that Garibaldi had died from a heart attack. In the movie Legends Never Die, Sammartino stated that it took him many years to <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>that</b> incident.|$|E
500|$|.....it's {{encouraging}} {{to win a}} prize. But the success of Tirra Lirra, plus the prize it won and the two prizes The Impersonators won, made me feel less private and more vulnerable, and I had to <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>that</b> {{in order to go}} on at all. I had never been interviewed before, or I had never been asked to be interviewed, and suddenly I had all these interviews. It was a challenge I found hard to meet. I almost wished I had kept writing under a pseudonym as I had begun… ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{many other}} women jockeys, she views the primary {{challenge}} {{to be the}} difficulty of horse racing itself. [...] She describes races as [...] "every man for himself (sic)." [...] She does not ask for any breaks from male jockeys, and has explained that horse racing is a sport where women simply have {{to be just as}} good as men. [...] She speaks well of other successful women jockeys, and expresses a lot of respect in particular for Julie Krone, to whom she is often compared. But she also said in a 2011 interview, [...] "a lot of young female riders are just girls who love horses, but they just don't have the strength and toughness, and they're not cut out to be jockeys. You've got to deliver the goods to <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>that</b> hump." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{week before}} the final, Liverpool played Portsmouth in the 2005–06 Premier League – it was their last match before the final, and they won 3–1. The win was Liverpool's ninth {{straight}} in the competition and meant they finished the season in third place. One area of concern was the fitness of midfielder Xabi Alonso, who injured his ankle in the match and was a doubt for the final. They were also without striker Robbie Fowler, who was cup-tied after playing for Manchester City earlier in the competition. Captain Steven Gerrard {{was determined not to}} let complacency affect Liverpool; [...] "We have beaten fantastic sides like Manchester United and Chelsea to get to the final, but it is always on your mind that after going on such a successful run you might not <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>that</b> last hurdle." ...|$|E
2500|$|His son Nicholas (December 31, 1970 – April 2, 1994, with Leslie Allen) died of {{a heroin}} {{overdose}} {{at the age of}} 23. After his son's death, Curtis remarked, [...] "You never <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>that.</b> The death of a child. No. Can't talk about it," [...] and that it was [...] "a terrible thing when a father loses his son." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Camerons {{have had}} four children. Their first, Ivan Reginald Ian, {{was born on}} 8 April 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, with a rare {{combination}} of cerebral palsy and a form of severe epilepsy called Ohtahara syndrome, requiring round-the-clock care. Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: [...] "The news hits you like a freight train... You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality. But then you <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>that,</b> because he's wonderful." [...] Ivan was cared for at the specialist NHS Cheyne Day Centre in West London, which closed shortly after he left it. Ivan died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 25 February 2009, aged six.|$|E

2500|$|During the screenwriting process, a {{stronger}} emphasis {{was placed on}} special effects, rather than satire and story. Overall, the tone of the film is in diametric opposition to the comics. Whereas Katz declared, [...] "It's a film about a duck from outer space... It's not supposed to be an existential experience... We're supposed to have fun with this concept, but for some reason reviewers weren't able to <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>that</b> problem." [...] Gerber declared that the comic-book series was an existental joke, stating, [...] "'This is no joke!' There it is. The cosmic giggle. The funniest gag in the universe. That life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view. Anyone who doesn't believe this probably cannot enjoy reading Howard the Duck." [...] However, after shooting was finished, Gerber stated that he felt the film was faithful to both the spirit of the comic book and the characters of Howard and Beverly.|$|E
2500|$|A mid-tempo heartbreak song, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "The Root" [...] have the narrator lamenting a lost lover; [...] "In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". The final two minutes of [...] "The Root" [...] feature an {{emphatic}} refrain of the chorus line. Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson wrote that the chorus [...] "feeds back into itself over and over again, turning from a hook into a mantra into a gospel affirmation". In the promotional EPK for Voodoo, D'Angelo discussed the therapeutic nature of recording [...] "The Root", stating [...] "It was kinda therapeutic for me to do this song. It kinda help me get over, because I'm so pathetic in the song. You know what I mean? That's what 'The Root' is. She got it on me. And I'm just fucked up. It was good for me to <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>that.</b> It was hard for me sometimes to do that song. To record it, because when doing it I would have to put myself in that mode you know".|$|E
