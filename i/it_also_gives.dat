5|$|Following the {{recapture}} 5.cxd5, Black has {{an eccentric}} option in 5...Bd6, the Snake Benoni. But most players prefer 5...d6, which stops White's d-pawn from advancing to d6. Black's {{control over the}} central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, White must {{decide whether or not}} to play 6.e4. Although this move gains space in the centre, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>gives</b> Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White can deny Black this target for the time being by playing 6.Nf3 first.|$|E

5|$|A second full telling (even {{shorter than}} the summary of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era {{collection}} of myths; the account of Orion is based largely on the mythologist and poet Pherecydes of Leros. Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to Side before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that Hera threw her into Hades for rivalling her in beauty. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>gives</b> a different version of Orion's death than the Iliad: Eos, the Dawn, {{fell in love with}} Orion and took him to Delos where Artemis killed him.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{papers in}} the series were treatises on gravitational radiation (one with Sachs, one with Trümper). The work with Sachs studies, among other things, vacuum solutions with special algebraic properties, using the 2-component spinor formalism. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>gives</b> a systematic exposition of the geometric properties of bundles (in mathematical terms: congruences) of light beams. Spacetime geometry can influence the propagation of light, making them converge on or diverge from each other, or deforming the bundle's cross section without changing its area. The paper formalizes these possible changes in the bundle {{in terms of the}} bundle's expansion (convergence/divergence), and twist and shear (cross-section area-conserving deformation), linking those properties to spacetime geometry. One result is the Ehlers-Sachs theorem describing the properties of the shadow produced by a narrow beam of light encountering an opaque object. The tools developed in that work would prove essential for the discovery by Roy Kerr of his Kerr solution, describing a rotating black hole – {{one of the most important}} exact solutions.|$|E
