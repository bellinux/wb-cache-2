5|$|A {{review of}} {{metformin}} overdoses reported to poison control centers {{over a five-year}} period found serious adverse events were rare, though the elderly appeared to be at greater risk. A similar study in which cases were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5,000mg were more likely to involve serious medical outcomes in adults. Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of metformin have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare. In <b>healthy</b> <b>children,</b> unintentional doses of less than 1,700mg are unlikely to cause significant toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 Reed married Elizabeth Greer, the {{daughter}} of Samuel Greer, a County Court judge and former MP for the County of Londonderry {{in the north of}} Ireland. Their first child, a daughter, died in infancy, but three <b>healthy</b> <b>children</b> followed: Charles in 1879, Margaret in 1882 and Talbot in 1886. The connection with Ireland was of great value to Reed, and the family regularly spent annual holidays on the shores of Lough Swilly in County Donegal.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Bryce {{reported}} that, between 1894 and 1908, {{mortality rates}} at some residential schools in western Canada ranged from 30% to 60% {{over five years}} (that is, five years after entry, 30% to 60% of students had died, or 6–12% per annum). These statistics did not become public until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921. In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates {{could have been avoided}} if <b>healthy</b> <b>children</b> had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness. Streptomycin, the first effective treatment, was not introduced until 1943.|$|E

25|$|After {{writing a}} promotional {{pamphlet}} for a milk company in 1932, she wrote two non-published treatises: Optimum Health (1935) and You Can Stay Well (1939). In 1942 Davis wrote a 524-page, forty-one chapter nutrition textbook for Macmillan, Vitality Through Planned Nutrition. But she received public acclaim with her subsequent books {{written for the}} general public: Let's Cook it Right (1947); Let's Have <b>Healthy</b> <b>Children</b> (1951); Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit (1954); and Let's Get Well (1965).

25|$|Hemorrhagic {{complications}} {{are more}} common in the immunocompromised or immunosuppressed populations, although <b>healthy</b> <b>children</b> and adults have been affected. Five major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile purpura, malignant chickenpox with purpura, postinfectious purpura, purpura fulminans, and anaphylactoid purpura. These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile purpura being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome. In contrast, malignant chickenpox with purpura is a grave clinical condition that has a mortality rate of greater than 70%. The cause of these hemorrhagic chickenpox syndromes is not known.|$|E
25|$|Between 1987 and 2000, {{the case}} {{fatality}} rate across the United States was three measles-attributable deaths per 1000 cases, or 0.3%. In underdeveloped nations with {{high rates of}} malnutrition and poor healthcare, fatality rates have been as high as 28%. In immunocompromised persons (e.g., people with AIDS) the fatality rate is approximately 30%. Risk factors for severe measles and its complications include malnutrition, underlying immunodeficiency, pregnancy, and vitamin A deficiency. Even in previously <b>healthy</b> <b>children,</b> measles can cause serious illness requiring hospitalization. One out of every 1,000 measles cases will develop acute encephalitis, which often results in permanent brain damage. One or two out of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications.|$|E

25|$|Scoliosis affects 2–3% of the United States population, {{which is}} {{equivalent}} to about 5 to 9 million cases. A scoliosis spinal column's curve of 10° or less affects 1.5% to 3% of individuals. The age of onset is usually between 10 years and 15 years (can occur at a younger age) in children and adolescents, making up to 85% of those diagnosed. This is seen {{to be due to}} rapid growth spurts occurring at puberty when spinal development is most relenting to genetic and environmental influences. Because female adolescents undergo growth spurts before postural musculoskeletal maturity, scoliosis is more prevalent among females. Although fewer cases are present today using Cobb angle analysis for diagnosis, scoliosis remains a prevailing condition, appearing in otherwise <b>healthy</b> <b>children.</b> Incidence of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) stops after puberty when skeletal maturity is reached, however, further curvature may proceed during late adulthood due to vertebral osteoporosis and weakened musculature.|$|E
25|$|The best-known case of nanism {{in ancient}} Egypt {{is that of}} the high {{official}} Seneb, as a finely-carved statue-group of the dwarf and his family has survived in excellent preservation. Seneb worked during the late 4th Dynasty (c. 26132494 BC) or early 5th Dynasty (c. 24982345 BC), most possibly under king Shepseskaf and his successors. Seneb was married to a normally grown woman named Senet-ites. He had two daughters named Awib-en-Khufu and Semeret-Radjedef and one son named Ankh-ima-Radjedef, all of whom are represented as of normal stature. This shows that it was accepted that dwarfs might have families and <b>healthy</b> <b>children.</b> Note that the two children shown in front of Seneb's seat in the accompanying illustration are in the position where the legs of a 'normal' statue would be represented, thus lessening - though not concealing - his abnormal appearance. Because Seneb's father was normally grown, Seneb's case also proves that not all dwarfs were brought from foreign countries, nanism occasionally occurring - as would be expected from modern experience - within Egyptian families. In other cases, where persons also having short stature are depicted as servants of other dwarfs, it is possible that {{they were part of the}} same family. However, this remains a matter for conjecture, as it was not uncommon during the Old Kingdom period, that artists depicted the same person multiple time in one scene. They did this to show that the main character performed several duties at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Louise's {{father-in-law}} King Frederick William II {{gave the}} couple Charlottenburg Palace, but {{the crown prince}} and his new wife preferred to live at Paretz Palace, just outside Potsdam, where Louise kept herself busy with household affairs. Paretz {{was far from the}} bustle of court, as the couple were most content in the [...] "rural retirement" [...] of a country life. The marriage was happy, and Louise was well-beloved by the king, who called her [...] "the princess of princesses" [...] and gave her a palace in Oranienburg. The crown princess saw it as her duty to support her husband in all his pursuits, and the couple enjoyed singing together and reading from Shakespeare and Goethe. Louise soon became pregnant, disappointingly giving birth to a stillborn girl on 1 October 1794 at the age of eighteen. Nine <b>healthy</b> <b>children</b> would follow in quick succession, though two died in childhood: Crown Prince Frederick William (1795), Prince William (1797), Princess Charlotte (1798), Princess Frederica (1799), Prince Charles (1801), Princess Alexandrine (1803), Prince Ferdinand (1804), Princess Louise (1808), and Prince Albert (1809). The couple also used the Crown Prince's Palace in the capital.|$|E
