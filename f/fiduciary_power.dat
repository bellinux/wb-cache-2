6000|$|Locke was Rousseau's most {{immediate}} inspirer, {{and the latter}} affirmed himself to have treated the same matters exactly on Locke's principles. Rousseau, however, exaggerated Locke's politics as greatly as Condillac exaggerated his metaphysics. There was the important difference that Locke's essay on Civil Government was the justification in theory of a revolution which had already been accomplished in practice, while the Social Contract, tinged as it was by silent reference {{in the mind of}} the writer to Geneva, was yet a speculation in the air. The circumstances under which it was written gave to the propositions of Locke's piece a reserve and moderation which savour of a practical origin and a special case. They have not the wide scope and dogmatic air and literary precision of the corresponding propositions in Rousseau. We find in Locke none of those concise phrases which make fanatics. But the essential doctrine is there. The philosopher of the Revolution of 1688 probably carried its principles further than most of those who helped in the Revolution had any intention to carry them, when he said that [...] "the legislature being only a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>power</b> to act for certain ends, there remains still in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative."[218] It may be questioned how many of the peers of that day would have assented to the proposition that the people--and did Locke mean by the people the electors of the House of Commons, or all males over twenty-one, or all householders paying rates?--could by any expression of their will abolish the legislative power of the upper chamber, or put an end to the legislative and executive powers of the crown. But Locke's statements are direct enough, though he does not use so terse a label for his doctrine as Rousseau affixed to it.|$|E
60|$|Sect. 149. THOUGH in a {{constituted}} commonwealth, standing {{upon its}} own basis, and acting {{according to its}} own nature, that is, acting {{for the preservation of}} the community, there can be but one supreme power, which is the legislative, to which all the rest are and must be subordinate, yet the legislative being only a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>power</b> to act for certain ends, there remains still in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative, when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust reposed in them: for all power given with trust for the attaining an end, being limited by that end, whenever that end is manifestly neglected, or opposed, the trust must necessarily be forfeited, and the power devolve into the hands of those that gave it, who may place it anew where they shall think best for their safety and security. And thus the community perpetually retains a supreme power of saving themselves from the attempts and designs of any body, even of their legislators, whenever they shall be so foolish, or so wicked, as to lay and carry on designs against the liberties and properties of the subject: for no man or society of men, having a power to deliver up their preservation, or consequently the means of it, to the absolute will and arbitrary dominion of another; when ever any one shall go about to bring them into such a slavish condition, they will always have a right to preserve, what they have not a power to part with; and to rid themselves of those, who invade this fundamental, sacred, and unalterable law of self-preservation, for which they entered into society. And thus the community may be said in this respect to be always the supreme power, but not as considered under any form of government, because this power of the people can never take place till the government be dissolved.|$|E

50|$|Foreign banks (branches, {{agencies}} and representative offices)A New York branch is {{an office of}} a foreign bank that is licensed by the Superintendent to conduct a banking business in New York. A branch may exercise the same powers as a state-chartered commercial bank, including accepting deposits, making loans, issuing letters of credit, dealing in foreign exchange, making acceptances and, if authorized, exercising <b>fiduciary</b> <b>powers.</b> There {{are two types of}} foreign branches - insured and uninsured. An insured branch may conduct a retail banking business in New York, making consumer loans and accepting consumer deposits. An uninsured branch may accept deposits only as authorized by the FDIC Rules, with disclosure of their non-insured status. Since FDICIA was passed in 1991, no new insured branches have been allowed. A New York agency has many of the same powers as a branch, except in the case of deposits. An agency may issue large-denomination ($100,000 or over) CDs, may accept deposits from foreign residents and citizens and may maintain credit balances for customers incidental to its banking business.|$|R
50|$|Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson VC {{held that}} rule 64A {{could not be}} {{construed}} as allowing the committee to make increases without management’s consent. However, the company management could not use its discretion to withhold its consent {{in a way that}} undermined good faith, and mutual trust and confidence. The company management was not exercising a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>power,</b> and so it could take its own interests, including financial burdens, into account, but it still had to exercise its power for a proper purpose. A collateral purpose of coercing members to relinquish their accrued rights for the company to benefit from the surplus, was bad faith. His judgment {{on the nature of the}} pension obligations read as follows.|$|E
50|$|The extreme {{argument}} {{on one side}} is that, for validity, what is required is bona fide exercise of the power {{in the interests of}} the company: that once it is found that the directors were not motivated by self-interest—i.e. by a desire to retain their control of the company or their positions on the board—the matter is concluded in their favour and that the court will not inquire into the validity of their reasons for making the issue...It can be accepted, as one would only expect, that the majority of cases in which issues of shares are challenged in the courts are cases in which the vitiating element is the self-interest of the directors, or at least the purpose of the directors to preserve their own control of the management.Further it is correct to say that where the self-interest of the directors is involved, they will not be permitted to assert that their action was bona fide thought to be, or was, in the interest of the company; pleas to this effect have invariably been rejected... just as trustees who buy trust property are not permitted to assert that they paid a good price.But it does not follow from this, as the appellants assert, that the absence of any element of self-interest is enough to make an issue valid. Self-interest is only one, though no doubt the commonest, instance of improper motive: and, before one can say that a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>power</b> has been exercised for the purpose for which it was conferred, a wider investigation may have to be made...It would be wrong for the court to substitute its opinion for that of the management, or indeed to question the correctness of the management’s decision, on such a question, if bona fide arrived at. There is no appeal on merits from management decisions to courts of law: nor will courts of law assume to act as a kind of supervisory board over decisions within the powers of management honestly arrived at.|$|E

40|$|The rule in Re Hastings-Bass is an {{equitable}} {{control on the}} exercise of powers by trustees. It has developed without satisfactory explanation of its doctrinal basis, resulting in uncertainty as to its scope and application. In Pitt v Holt [2011] EWCA Civ 197 the Court of Appeal began to remedy these defects by deciding that the rule is founded on a trustee’s duty properly to consider the exercise of a power. This thesis argues, first, that Pitt is right to understand the Re Hastings-Bass rule as premised on the duties of trustees, {{and not on the}} exercise of a power producing an unintended result. This accords with the reasoning of earlier cases on the rule, and is also consistent with House of Lords authority on <b>fiduciary</b> <b>powers</b> and judicial non-interference in trustees’ decision-making. This duty is not a ‘fiduciary’ duty, or an aspect of the trustee’s duty of care, but is an independent incident of the office of trustee. Secondly, this analysis of the Re Hastings-Bass rule facilitates exposition of its important features: the concept of ‘relevant consideration’ must be carefully circumscribed; the purported exercise of a power in breach of the rule is voidable, not void; the rule does not apply to purely personal powers, or to administrative powers; there are no special rules for pension trusts or the use of the rule to mitigate liability to taxation; trustees can usually avoid a breach of duty by taking professional advice; and in some circumstances, those professional advisers can incur liability to the trust beneficiaries. Finally, the relationship between the Re Hastings-Bass rule and fraud on a power is examined. It is argued that the analogy between the two doctrines is not sound, and that there is reason to doubt aspects of the orthodox account of fraud on a power.

40|$|Banks have {{risks in}} {{providing}} bank loans to the debtor; therefore bank requires collateral to grant loans. The collateral of moving objects {{given by the}} debtor must follow the transfer of ownership on trust to the bank in accordance on Law No. 42 Year 1999 on Fiduciary Guarantee. This intends to obtain legal certainty of guarantees execution, hence {{the execution of the}} collateral can be completed easitly. This study employs a descriptive method, intended to provide the data as complete as possible about the execution process of collaterals and the actions. This will be executed by PT. BPR Armindo Kencana Batu when the collaterals completely destroyed or lost. Source of data were secondary data which were obtained from a second souerce or not from the original source. Secondary data could from the data presented in the formbof tables. Graphs, etc. Data collection were taken from documentation, meanwhile the data were analyzed by using qualitative descriptive method. This study aimed at investigating the execution process of fiduciary guarantee object done by PT. BPR Armindo Kencana Batu. In addition, it also intended to know the way in solving the loans problem and determining the actions of PT. BPR Armindo Kencana Batu in case the collateral was destroyed or lost. The results of this study revealed that the execution of the collateral is the last effort of bank in case the debtor of bank was default. The executions were done by three ways; they were the execution with the sale by the hand, the execution with the sale of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>powers,</b> and lastly the execution with the execulator title. Execution by the execulator title were used if the debtor has less good intention to pay off all of its obligations. The next results on the bank acts when fiduciary guarantee was destroyed or lost/ scorch were by registrating the collateral to the insurance institution since the first item received by the bank. Along with the insurance when the items were lost or destroyed, therefore banks can claim against the insurance institution to get compensation for lost destroyed collateral...|$|R

40|$|Two {{years after}} the Glorious Revolution Locke's "Two Treatises of Government" was published. In the second Treatise, {{starting}} from the assumption that {{in the state of}} nature men are naturally all free, equal and independent, Locke maintains that only by their own consents they make themselves members of political society. According to Locke, the end is to preserve their lives, liberties and estates more securely, and the powers necessary to this end are given up to government. In this way governors have the power to make laws for the common good, and the power to enforce these laws and exact punishment for their infringements, but are always under the obligation to fulfil the end for which political society was established. Thus, in Locke the relation between the people and governors is understood in terms of the idea of trusteeship. Governors have only a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>power</b> to act for the entrusted end, and can never be arbitrary. Further, Locke asserted separation of political powers, supremacy of the legislative over the executive, and {{the right of the people}} to resist when governors act contrary to their trust. These assertions are of great historical importance. Resolutely Locke rejected Hobbesian absolutism, and gave the theoretical basis for the liberal-democratic state. This can not be denied, and there can be also no doubt of his great influence in his own country, America and France. But on the other hand, Locke's thought is not always free from any defects. Limitations and restrictions related to his own historical circumstances are found in his thought. One of these can be clearly seen in his justification of the unequal distribution of property. Therefore I propose to examine Locke's thought, paying our attention to its property theory...|$|E
40|$|Central to most {{forms of}} liberal social and {{political}} philosophy {{is the idea of}} the free and equal, self-governing person. And yet we do not come into the world as autonomous and accountable individuals; at best, this is the outcome of a long process of development and education which (in many societies) now extends throughout {{the first quarter of the}} average life. During this period of childhood, moreover, we are governed, not by ourselves, but by others. This dissertation examines the paradoxical position of children in liberal theory, who (as Locke put it) though not born in a state of freedom and equality, are born to it. In particular, the dissertation's three parts examine three interrelated questions. First, what is the basis of the paternalistic authority that is exercised over children? Second, what is the moral basis of the special rights of parents over particular children? And third, when, if ever, are inequalities of education and opportunity justified, when these emerge from decentralized authority over children in families and local communities? Part I: On what grounds do we deny children the personal freedom we accord to adults? The standard liberal view is that we are "born free as we are born rational" (Locke). That is, we are only born with the potential for freedom and rationality. Others ought to respect our liberty once we have, with age, become sufficiently reasonable to govern ourselves. On this view, a person's age matters only insofar as it is correlated with reason. I, on the contrary, argue that we should recognize age to have independent moral significance. This is because the educational paternalism at the beginning of a life does not impede our ability to carry out our life plans in the same way as would similar interference in the middle of a life. This explains why it is appropriate for parents and educators to aspire to more than fostering the minimal competence necessary for just getting by in life. Part II: What is the moral basis and extent of parental rights? Typically, liberals assume that governmental authority is only justified insofar as it serves the interests of the governed. Is parental authority the same, or is it partly justified by the interests of the "governors" as well (e. g., the interest parents have in passing on their values to another generation) ? While many contemporary philosophers have followed Locke in describing parental authority as a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>power,</b> I suggest that Hegel provides a richer account in two respects. First, because Hegel has a more nuanced account of the differences between natural right, personal morality, and social ethics, he has the resources for a more sophisticated philosophy of moral education than Locke. From this we can derive a more detailed account of parental duties, as well as see why, without the help of schools, individual families are not generally well-suited to educate children for the modern world. Second, Hegel's conceptions of love and of social roles help illuminate the interests that adults have in rearing their children. Part III: When, if ever, are inequalities in the provision of education justified? While parents have traditionally been responsible for providing for their children's education, this role has increasingly been taken on by the state. In Brown v. Board of Education, the U. S. Supreme Court held that public education must be made available "on equal terms" to all. But how is this to be understood? Does it require that the state spend roughly the same amount on educating every child? Or does it require that the state attempt to compensate children who have fewer educational advantages in the home to even out life chances? Or should educational equality be understood in a more modest way: an equal opportunity for a decent or adequate education? I claim that, assuming a rich and multi-faceted conception of adequate outcomes, educational inequalities above the adequacy threshold that emerge from differences in native ability or family background are not necessarily unjust. However, a norm of equal treatment establishes a defeasible presumption of resource equality in the public school system, once the adequacy threshold is met. I allow that inequalities between local communities may be justifiable if communities have chosen to tax themselves at different rates, but not if the school-finance system permits some communities to draw on significantly larger revenue bases than others...|$|E
40|$|There is {{currently}} substantial national momentum in state legislatures to grant personal representatives access to decedents’ e-mail {{as a part}} of a larger grant of access to all digital assets. In this Article, I make the case against such a default rule granting access to decedents’ e-mail. In the past nine years, Yahoo has not softened its position towards those who seek access to a Yahoo user’s e-mail post mortem. However, the other two largest e-mail service providers have more lenient policies on access to decedents’ e-mail. In this Article, I examine the service providers’ perspectives on access to decedents’ e-mail. Commentators are overwhelmingly supportive of access by personal representatives. They typically position Internet service providers, those providers’ terms of service, and secret passwords chosen by the deceased as stumbling blocks to efficient estate administration, the preservation of unique and irreplaceable sentimental and historical data, and the transfer of valuable property into the hands of deserving family members. Beginning with Connecticut in 2005, seven states have enacted statutes granting personal representatives some level of access to decedents’ digital assets, including e-mail. As of October 2013, about a dozen additional states have pending legislation that grants personal representatives access to decedents’ e-mail. Additionally, in January 2012, the Uniform Law Commission created a committee to “study the need for a feasibility of state legislation on <b>fiduciary</b> <b>powers</b> and authority to access digital information. ” The committee is now operating with the mission to draft an act that “will vest fiduciaries with at least the authority to manage and distribute digital assets, copy or delete digital assets, and access digital assets,” and has developed a working draft that grants personal representatives access to password-protected e-mail accounts of the deceased (the Draft Uniform Act). I highlight the problems with, and new issues raised by, the access laws, proposed laws, and the Draft Uniform Act, and explore the problems with the arguments for access to decedents’ e-mail. I then assert that the commentary, statutes, and proposed legislation fail to adequately consider decedents’ intent, or probable intent, which is the bedrock of estate jurisprudence. I argue that storing e-mail in a password-protected account, coupled with nondisclosure of that password by the deceased, is an exercise of a decedent’s right to destroy his or her own property. Further, I maintain that state law and the Draft Uniform Act granting access to decedents’ e-mail inappropriately infringe upon this right. I conclude in Part V with a recommendation for an alternative default rule...|$|R

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} the {{fiduciary}} duty of loyalty is a prophylactic rule that serves to deter and redress harmful opportunism. This idea {{can be traced back}} to the dawn of modern fiduciary law in England and the United States, and it has inspired generations of legal scholars to attempt to explain and justify the duty of loyalty from an economic perspective. Nonetheless, this Article argues that the conventional account of fiduciary loyalty should be abandoned because it does not adequately explain or justify fiduciary law’s core features. The normative foundations of fiduciary loyalty come into sharper focus when viewed through the lens of republican legal theory. Consistent with the republican tradition, the fiduciary duty of loyalty serves primarily to ensure that a <b>fiduciary’s</b> entrusted <b>power</b> does not compromise liberty by exposing her principal and beneficiaries to domination. The republican theory has significant advantages over previous theories of fiduciary law because it better explains and justifies the law’s traditional features, including the uncompromising requirements of fiduciary loyalty and the customary remedies of rescission, constructive trust, and disgorgement. Significantly, the republican theory arrives at a moment when American fiduciary law stands at a crossroads. In recent years, some politicians, judges, and legal scholars have worked to dismantle two central pillars of fiduciary loyalty: the categorical prohibition against unauthorized conflicts of interest and conflicts of duty (the no-conflict rule), and the requirement that fiduciaries relinquish unauthorized profits (the no-profit rule). The republican theory explains why these efforts to scale back the duty of loyalty should be resisted in the interest of safeguarding liberty...|$|R
