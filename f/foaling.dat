Somethingroyal's other stakes winners were First Family, Sir Gaylord and Syrian Sea.|$|E
5|$|Among harem-holding species, {{the adult}} females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more {{promiscuous}} and the males have larger testes for sperm competition. Estrous in female equines lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and a swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread {{and raise their}} tails when {{in the presence of}} a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species, it is roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares will come into estrus again within a few days after <b>foaling,</b> depending on conditions. Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour. Within a few weeks, foals will attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months. Species in arid habitats, like the Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.|$|E
40|$|Background: Little {{information}} {{exists on}} the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in septic <b>foals.</b> Hypothesis: The plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol {{are expected to be}} higher in septic <b>foals</b> as compared to normal <b>foals.</b> The concentrations of hormones in septic <b>foals</b> also are expected to differ further depending upon survival. Animals: Twenty-eight control <b>foals</b> and 46 septic <b>foals,</b> 14 days of age were included in this study. Methods: Blood was collected in EDTA once from 28 normal <b>foals</b> born in the University of Georgia or Cornell University equine research herds and from 46 septic <b>foals</b> within 12 hours after admission to 1 of the 3 tertiary care referral centers involved in the study. Septic <b>foal</b> selection was based on a sepsis score of. 11 or a positive blood culture. The control <b>foals</b> were age matched to the septic <b>foals</b> in the study. ACTH and cortisol concentrations were measured by a chemiluminescent immunoassay system. Results: Cortisol concentrations in control <b>foals</b> did not vary with age.

25|$|The estrous cycle (also spelled oestrous) {{controls}} when a mare is sexually receptive {{toward a}} stallion, {{and helps to}} physically prepare the mare for conception. It generally occurs during {{the spring and summer}} months, although some mares may be sexually receptive into the late fall, and is controlled by the photoperiod (length of the day), the cycle first triggered when the days begin to lengthen. The estrous cycle lasts about 19–22 days, with the average being 21 days. As the days shorten, the mare returns to a period when she is not sexually receptive, known as anestrus. Anestrus - occurring in the majority of, but not all, mares - prevents the mare from conceiving in the winter months, as that would result in her <b>foaling</b> during the harshest part of the year, a time when it would be most difficult for the foal to survive.|$|E

500|$|Harris Farms, where California Chrome was bred, foaled, {{and lived}} {{until the age}} of two, had {{previously}} nurtured champions such as two-time Breeders' Cup Classic winner Tiznow. In 2010 Love the Chase was bred to the Harris Farms stallion Lucky Pulpit. CNN reported that the stud fee for the breeding was $2,000. Steve Coburn said he had a dream three weeks before California Chrome's birth that the foal would be a colt with four white feet and a blaze. California Chrome was relatively large for a newborn horse, weighing , and active, [...] "running circles around Momma" [...] within two hours of birth. Love the Chase suffered a uterine laceration while <b>foaling,</b> and was placed on an IV due to internal bleeding. [...] The mare and foal were stall-bound together for over a month. She was kept on a catheter that administered anti-bleeding medication, and the farm staff checked her two to three times a day.

As a result, California Chrome became very people-focused, a trait that has served him well in race training.|$|E
40|$|Effects of milk {{replacer}} composition and intake {{on the growth}} of orphan <b>foals</b> were evaluated. Twenty <b>foals</b> were assigned to four treatments: 1) mare-nursed, 2) commercial <b>foal</b> {{milk replacer}} at recommended intakes (standard), 3) commercial <b>foal</b> milk replacer at high intakes (high), and 4) acidified replacer at recommended intakes (acidified). <b>Foals</b> fed milk replacer diets were weaned at 12 - 24 hours postpartum and fed milk replacer for 50 days. Mare-nursed <b>foals</b> were weaned between 52 and 56 days of age. <b>Foals</b> fed replacer diets gained 12 % to 28 % less weight than mare-nursed <b>foals</b> up to two weeks of age. However, by four months of age, weights of replacer-fed <b>foals</b> {{were similar to those}} of mare-nursed <b>foals</b> and 32 other mare-nursed <b>foals</b> at the farm weaned between three and four months postparium. <b>Foals</b> drank 10 to 12 L/ 100 kg body weight (BW) in fluid replacer daily over the trial period. During the first week, high intake <b>foals</b> consumed 26 % more replacer (p< 0. 05) than <b>foals</b> fed acidified or standard diets. This higher intake resulted in diarrhea earlier (6 - 11 days vs 11 - 22 days) and for a longer time (6. 3 days vs 2. 5 - 3. 6 days) than in <b>foals</b> fed recommended amounts. Mare-nursed <b>foals</b> developed “foal heat scours” in the second week postpartum. After the first week, <b>foals</b> fed high replacer diet voluntarily consumed the same volume of fluid replacer as <b>foals</b> fed the standard intake. <b>Foals</b> ate less than 1 kg grain mix/ 100 kg BW daily to one month of age, then increased intake to 1. 5 - 2 kg/ 100 kg BW to weaning. Water intake was 20 - 40 % of daily fluid intake and was correlated (r = 0. 85) to dry matter intake. <b>Foals</b> in the high intake group ate less (p< 0. 05) solid feed and drank less water than <b>foals</b> fed the standard and acidified diets. The <b>foal's</b> stomach capacity appears to limit meal size and thus replacer intake. If recommended feeding intervals are used, replacer intakes by <b>foals</b> are less than 15 % BW daily.

50|$|Weaning in horses {{usually takes}} place when the <b>foal</b> is 4 to 5 months old, as {{by this point}} the <b>foal</b> no longer needs {{nutrients}} beyond what the mare offers. Prior to weaning the <b>foal,</b> there is usually a creep feeder set up to allow the <b>foal</b> to begin consuming feed that the mare cannot access. There are two main approaches to weaning <b>foals,</b> abrupt and gradual weaning. Abrupt weaning is when the mare and <b>foal</b> are separated, usually without contact. Gradual weaning consists of the separating the mare and <b>foal,</b> but still with contact, but not enough contact that allows nursing to occur, and then {{after a period of}} time the mare and <b>foal</b> are separated not allowing contact, or, in some cases, sight of each other. <b>Foals</b> that are weaned by the abrupt method have shown to have higher stressful behaviors displayed.

2500|$|Mares due to foal {{are usually}} {{separated}} from other horses, {{both for the}} benefit of the mare and the safety of the soon-to-be-delivered foal. [...] In addition, separation allows the mare to be monitored more closely by humans for any problems that may occur while giving birth. [...] In the northern hemisphere a special <b>foaling</b> stall that is large and clutter free is frequently used, particularly by major breeding farms. [...] Originally, this was due in part to a need for protection from the harsh winter climate present when mares foal early in the year, but even in moderate climates, such as Florida, <b>foaling</b> stalls are still common because they allow closer monitoring of mares. [...] Smaller breeders often use a small pen with a large shed for <b>foaling,</b> or they may remove a wall between two box stalls in a small barn to make a large stall. [...] In the milder climates seen in much of the southern hemisphere, most mares foal outside, often in a paddock built specifically for <b>foaling,</b> especially on the larger stud farms.
