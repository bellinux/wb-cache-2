5|$|As {{elevation}} {{continues to}} increase, only the hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed almost exclusively of balsam fir. Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, can be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place {{at a rate that}} is too slow to replenish them.|$|E
5|$|Parasites of Theodoxus fluviatilis {{include several}} species of trematodes. The snail serves as first {{intermediate}} host to Plagioporus skrjabini and as second intermediate host to Cotylurus cornutus. Asymphylodora demeli is also <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> small snail, as is Notocotylus zduni. This small snail is also parasitized by {{several species of}} ciliates. It is the main host for the ciliate Trichodina baltica; the snails are usually 100% infected in the mantle cavity Another ciliate found in the mantle cavity is a species of Scyphidia. Two other parasitic ciliate species <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> snail are Protospira mazurica, and Hypocomella quatuor. Predators of Theodoxus fluviatilis include the common roach (a freshwater fish), Rutilus rutilus. Theodoxus fluviatilis is also the prey of some birds.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of medieval {{buildings}} remain standing in the town. St Denys' Church and St Botolph's in Quarrington date to the 12th and 13th centuries respectively, while Sleaford's half-timbered vicarage is 15th century. St Denys' Church is noted for its tracery and its stone broach spire {{is one of the}} oldest in England. Cogglesford Mill is the only remaining watermill in town and is a testament to the economic importance of the River Slea from the late-Saxon period onwards. The Bishops of Lincoln used the medieval town as a base, constructing the now-ruined Sleaford Castle, and as a means of extracting produce and wealth through demesne farming and by granting a market and limited freedoms to the town. As a result, the oldest areas are the market place and the four roads which meet there: Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate; many 18th and 19th century buildings are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area.|$|E
5|$|After Team Plasma's defeat, Looker {{arrives in}} Unova and tasks the player with finding the {{remaining}} Sages of Team Plasma, {{so they can}} be brought to justice. The player can also challenge the Elite Four once again, and challenge Alder, ultimately becoming the Unova region's new Pokémon Champion. The player also gains access to the eastern portion of Unova, which contains Pokémon from the previous games in the series, as well as access to an area unique to each game version: the ultra-metropolitan Black City, home to powerful Pokémon trainers; and the White Forest, home to humans and Pokémon living in harmony. Cynthia, a former Champion of the Sinnoh region, is also <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area of the game and can be challenged. A non-player character named after Shigeki Morimoto, a Game Freak programmer, creature designer, {{and the director of the}} HeartGold and SoulSilver games, can also be found and battled in the game.|$|E

5|$|Basin rests {{above the}} Boulder Batholith, the host rock for many {{valuable}} mineral ores <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> part of Montana. After the town became a hub {{of gold and}} silver mining, Basin's population peaked at about 1,500 in {{first decade of the}} 20th century but gradually declined as the mines were depleted. Abandoned mining equipment, closed or barricaded mine portals, and the ruins of a smelter and ore concentrator remain in Basin in the 21stcentury.|$|E
5|$|Settlers cleared {{much of the}} Catlins' coastal {{vegetation}} for farmland, but in {{some areas}} the original coastal plant life survives, primarily around cliff edges {{and some of the}} bays close to the Tautuku Peninsula, these being furthest from the landward edges of the forest. Plant life here includes many native species adapted to the strong salt-laden winds <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> exposed region. The Catlins coastal daisy (Celmisia lindsayii) is unique to the region, and is related to New Zealand's mountain daisies. Tussocks, hebes, and flaxes are common, as are native gentians, though sadly the endangered native sedge pingao can now rarely be found. In years when the southern rātā flowers well, the coastal forest canopy turns bright red. The rātā also thrives in some inland areas.|$|E
5|$|Shafi'i {{accepted}} {{cases in}} which he had to be more flexible with the application of Qisas. Similar to Abu Hanifa and Malik, he developed a tertiary source of legislation. The Shafi'i school adopted istidlal or inference, a process of seeking guidance from the source. Inference allowed the jurists to avoid strict analogy in a case where no clear precedent could be <b>found.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case, public interest was distinguished as a basis for legislation.|$|E

5|$|Snakes {{such as the}} ringneck snake, western yellow-bellied racer, striped whipsnake, and Pacific gopher snake live in the oak savanna region. Birds such as the oak titmouse, ash-throated flycatcher, white-breasted nuthatch, western bluebird, violet-green swallow, acorn woodpecker, black-headed grosbeak, and American kestrel {{have also}} been <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region. The rocks {{are known to be}} the northernmost place blue-gray gnatcatchers inhabit. Gall wasps live in this area, often {{creating}} galls in oak trees by injecting their larva into their leaves and branches.|$|E
5|$|The West Group {{consists}} of 21 structures on Terrace6, {{which was also}} artificially levelled. The structures are arranged around plazas that were left open on the east side. Seven monuments have been <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> group. The West Group is bordered by the rivers Nima on {{the west and the}} San Isidro on the east. A notable find in the West Group was the discovery of some jade masks there. The West Group was occupied from the Late Preclassic through to at least the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} targets was {{left up to}} the midget commanders, with advice that they should {{primarily}} target aircraft carriers or battleships, with cruisers as secondary targets. The midgets were to operate {{to the east of}} the Harbour Bridge, although if no suitable targets were to be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area they were to move under the Bridge and attack a battleship and large cruiser believed to be in the inner harbour. When the second reconnaissance flyover revealed that the expected British battleship——was nowhere to be found, USS Chicago became the priority target.|$|E

5|$|The {{evergreen}} {{forests in}} Wayanad mark the transition zone between {{the northern and}} southern ecologic regions of the Western Ghats. The southern ecologic regions are generally wetter and more species-rich. At lower elevations are the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, with Cullenia the characteristic tree genus, accompanied by teak, dipterocarps, and other trees. The moist forests transition to the drier South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests, which lie in its rain shadow to the east. Above 1,000 meters are the South Western Ghats montane rain forests, also cooler and wetter than the surrounding lowland forests, and dominated by evergreen trees, although some montane grasslands and stunted forests {{can be found at the}} highest elevations. The South Western Ghats montane rain forests are the most species-rich ecologic region in peninsular India; eighty percent of the flowering plant species of the entire Western Ghats range are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> ecologic region.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of Andalusian horses is extended, elevated, cadenced and harmonious, with {{a balance of}} roundness and forward movement. Poor elevation, irregular tempo, and excessive winging (sideways {{movement of}} the legs from the knee down) are discouraged by breed registry standards. Andalusians {{are known for their}} agility and their ability to learn difficult moves quickly, such as advanced collection and turns on the haunches. A 2001 study compared the kinematic characteristics of Andalusian, Arabian and Anglo-Arabian horses while moving at the trot. Andalusians were found to overtrack less (the degree to which the hind foot lands ahead of the front hoof print) but also exhibit greater flexing of both fore and hind joints, movement consistent with the more elevated way of going typically <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> breed. The authors of the study theorized that these characteristics of the breed's trot may contribute to their success as a riding and dressage horse.|$|E
5|$|The three named {{species of}} Gryposaurus differ in {{details of the}} skull and lower jaw.

5|$|There are 29 National Treasures of 14 {{collections}} of waka and two works on waka style, compiled {{from between the}} 8th and the mid-13th century with most from the Heian period. The two works of waka theory are Wakatai jisshu (945) and Korai fūteishō (1197). The collections include the two first imperial waka anthologies: Kokinshū (905, ten treasures) and Gosen Wakashū (951); seven private anthologies: Man'yōshū (after 759, three treasures), Shinsō Hishō (1008), Nyūdō Udaijin-shū (before 1065), Sanjūrokunin Kashū (ca. 1112), Ruijū Koshū (before 1120), Shūi Gusō (1216), Myōe Shōnin Kashū (1248); and five utaawase contents: including one imaginary content (Kasen utaawase), the Konoe edition of the Poetry Match in Ten Scrolls (three treasures), Ruijū utaawase, the Poetry competition in 29 rounds at Hirota Shrine and the Record of Poetry Match in Fifteen Rounds. The designated manuscripts of these works <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> list date from the Heian and Kamakura periods.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} {{amphibians}} {{are found in}} the mounded prairie region, typically around vernal pools. The Pacific tree frog lives in large numbers on the rocks, while tadpoles of the rarer western toad can be seen between March and May. Mammals such as California voles, Heermann's kangaroo rats, raccoons, and long-tailed weasels can also be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region. The western meadowlark and two species of sparrows are the most common types of birds that are seen in the area.

5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
