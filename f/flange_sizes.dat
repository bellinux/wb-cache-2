5000|$|Several vacuum flange {{standards}} exist, and {{the same}} flange types are called by different names by different manufacturers and standards organizations.CF (ConFlat) flanges use a copper gasket and knife-edge flange to achieve an ultrahigh vacuum seal. The term [...] "ConFlat" [...] is a registered trademark of Varian, Inc., so [...] "CF" [...] is commonly used by other flange manufacturers. Each face of the two mating CF flanges has a knife edge, which cuts into the softer metal gasket, providing an extremely leak-tight, metal-to-metal seal. Deformation of the metal gasket fills small defects in the flange, allowing Conflat flanges operate down to 10−13 Torr (10−11 Pa) pressure. The knife edge is recessed in a groove in each flange. In addition to protecting the knife edge, the groove helps hold the gasket in place, which aligns the two flanges and also reduces gasket expansion during bake-out. For stainless-steel conflat flanges, baking temperatures of 450 °C can be achieved; the temperature {{is limited by the}} choice of gasket material. CF flanges are sexless and interchangeable.

Determine {{the effect of the}} rim cutter on cement pressure during cup insertion. 2. Examine the effect of the rim cutter on cement penetration distance. 3. Evaluate the effect of bone grafting of the acetabular notch. 4. Determine the effect of iliac suction during cement pressurisation. 5. Compare the behaviour of bone cement with Play Dough. Materials and Methods: 1. Sawbones hemi pelvis models were fitted with pressure transducers at the rim and apex of the acetabulum. Peak pressure was measured upon insertion of cups with different <b>flange</b> <b>sizes</b> and when the acetabulum was prepared with the rim cutter. 2. Foam cavities were used to measure the depth of cement penetration when the same cups and rim cutter were used. 3. Hemi pelvis models were modified to simulate bone grafting of the acetabular notch. Again, pressure sensors were mounted at the apex and rim of the acetabulum. Intra-acetabular cement pressure was compared with native acetabulae. 4. A back bleeding model of the acetabulum was fitted with a suction catheter. The effect on cement penetration into cancellous bone was measured compared with no suction. 5. Play Dough pressurisation and penetration into hemi pelvises and foam was compared to bone cement. Results: 1. Significant increase in peak apex and rim pressures when flanged cup inserted into an acetabulum prepared with the rim cutter compared with both flanged and unflanged cups alone. 2. Significant increase in cement penetration at the rim of the acetabulum when rim cutter used and flanged cup inserted when compared with flanged and unflanged cups alone. 3. Significant increase in intra-acetabular pressure when cement pressurised in presence of simulated acetabular notch bone grafting compared with normal acetabulae. 4. Significant increase in cement penetration distance when suction used compared with no suction. 5. Significant differences in the flow characteristics between bone cement and Play Dough. Conclusion: The authors recommend preparation of the acetabular rim with the rim cutter and bone grafting of the acetabular notch to improve the depth and uniformity of the cement mantle in cemented primary THA.

5000|$|Since {{the carrier}} ring used in {{constant}} seating stress gaskets take this deflection {{into account when}} creating the carrier ring for a given <b>flange</b> <b>size,</b> pressure class, and material, the carrier ring profile can be adjusted to enable the gasket seating stress to be radially uniform across the entire sealing area. Further, because the sealing elements are fully confined by the flange faces in opposing channels on the carrier ring, any in-service compressive forces acting on the gasket are transmitted through the carrier ring and avoid any further compression of the sealing elements, thus maintaining a 'constant' gasket seating stress while in-service. Thus, the gasket is immune to common gasket failure modes that include creep relaxation, high system vibration, or system thermal cycles.|$|R

Recent research studies focused mainly on the shear behaviour of the most commonly used lipped channel beam and welded hollow flange beam sections with and without web openings. However, no research has been undertaken on the shear behav-iour and strength of rivet fastened RHFCBs with web openings. Hence a detailed experi-mental study involving 30 shear tests was undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of rivet fastened RHFCBs with circular web openings. Simply supported test spec-imens of RHFCB with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 were loaded at mid-span until failure. Comparison of experimental shear capacities with corresponding predictions from the cur-rent Australian cold-formed steel design rules showed that the current design rules are inad-equate for the shear design of rivet fastened RHFCBs with circular web openings. Signifi-cant improvements to web shear buckling occurred due to the presence of rectangular hollow flanges while considerable post-buckling strength is also observed. Such enhancements to the shear behaviour and capacity were achieved with a rivet spacing of 100 mm. Improved design rules are proposed for rivet fastened RHFCBs with circular web openings based on the test results. This paper presents the details of this experimental study and the results...|$|R

40|$|What differentiates a beam from a plate girder? This {{may seem}} to be a trivial question. However, it is a {{necessary}} and important part of plate girder design when applying the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specification. 1 A beam can be a rolled or a welded shape, but it does not have intermediate stiffeners and its web width-thickness ratio hc/tw must not exceed yfF/ 970, where hc is twice the distance from the neutral axis to the compression flange (Fig. 1). Plate girders have stiffeners or hc/tw is greater than yfF/ 970, or both. Making this distinction and the compactness classification early in plate girder design is important when using the LRFD Specification. The significance of these items {{can be seen in the}} LRFD Manual flowcharts (Figs. 2 and 3) for the determination of flexural and shear design strength. With these flowcharts, this discussion will focus on the design of plate girders according to LRFD rules. An explanation of plate girder design in the LRFD Specification will include: flexural design strength, shear design strength, flexure-shear interaction, bearing strength under concentrated loads and stiffener design. Application of the LRFD method will show there is actually little difference between it and Allowable Stress Design (ASD) 8 of plate girders. FLEXURAL STRENGTH The design flexural strength is calculated to provide an adequate section modulus. The first criterion necessary to separate a beam from a plate girder, yfF/ 970, relates to flexural design strength.

The objective of the test series {{is to provide a}} robust method of connection for structural engineering that is both fatigue and slip resistant. Forty-six joints (using 23 specimens) were subjected to either static or combined static/cyclic loading at ambient room temperature. Ten specimens (five batches of two) had bolted connections without injected resin and were included to provide baseline static joint strengths. Sikadur®- 30 and RenGel®-SW 404 were the two cold-curing epoxy based resins used to fabricate the 13 RIBJ specimens. Testing was conducted with double lap-shear joints in accordance with modified guidance from Annex G and Annex K in standard BS EN 1090 - 2 : 2008. The specimen’s geometry was established using this British Standard and an American Society of Civil Engineers pre-standard for pultruded thin-walled structures.

40|$|The {{economic}} use of cold-formed steel members {{means that}} buckling {{and the possible}} loss of effectiveness it produces are important features of design. Cross-sectional instabilities in laterally-restrained cold-formed steel beams include local and distortional buckling. The prediction of the true buckling behaviour of cold-formed steel beams accounting for all governing features such as geometrical imperfections, spread of yielding, postbuckling etc. has been possible {{with the development of}} advanced numerical modelling. In this thesis, the finite element (FE) method (ABAQUS) has been used to develop numerical analyses to study the buckling behaviour of laterally-restrained cold-formed steel lipped Z-section beams. The FE models were verified against a series of four-point bending tests available from previous research, with special references to material and geometrical nonlinearities. Two sets of analyses have been conducted: FE analyses allowing for both local and distortional buckling and ones allowing for local buckling while distortional buckling is restrained using appropriate boundary conditions. For the former, the controlling buckling mode (local, distortional or combined) at different stages of loading (up to, at and beyond maximum load) has been realized. Comparing the results of two sets of analyses, the effect of distortional buckling on performance for different geometric proportions has been studied. The effect of the lip <b>size,</b> <b>flange</b> width, angle of inclination of the edge stiffener (lip), size and position of the intermediate stiffener and material strength as well as the interaction between them on both the ultimate strength and the buckling of cold-formed Z-section beams has been investigated. Limits for optimum design of the section were proposed. Depending on the geometric properties and material strength of the section, transitions between local, distortional and combined local/distortional buckling were observed. The lip/flange interaction including the interaction between the edge stiffener (lip) and the intermediate stiffener was the key governing feature of behaviour. The effect of the linear moment gradient and sharply varying bending moment on both the ultimate strength and the buckling of cold-formed Z sections was investigated. The latter occurred in two-span continuous beams subject to uniformly distributed loading. The results of moment gradient cases were compared with those of pure bending cases. The suitability of the design treatments available in Eurocode 3 (EC 3) for local, combined local/distortional and distortional buckling of cold-formed Z-section beams was assessed. Overall, the EC 3 predictions for cross-sectional bending resistances were unconservative. Shortcomings were identified and some suggestions for improvements were made. This included improvements in plate buckling factors for edge-stiffened compression flanges. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Tightness of flange joints {{for large}} {{polyethylene}} pipes –Part 1 Numerical simulations Leaks occasionally occur in flange joints in plastic pipelines, predominantly large dimension ones. Such pipelines are normally {{of importance for}} e g water supply, and repair is expensive. A better understanding is vital since a clear background is missing for the existing design and mounting recommendations, which also are differing. Analysis of plastic flanges {{is more complicated than}} for metal ones since the material is time dependent, and much softer than the backing rings and bolts. The aim of this work was to be able to assess on one hand if presently standardized flange geometries mean smaller safety margins when the size of the pipe is increased, {{and on the other hand}} if the instructions for mounting have to be improved. First, an analysis was made by manual calculations, without consideration of the time dependent properties of the material, in order to assess the stresses just after tightening of the joint but before pressurizing and start of service time of the pipeline. The manualanalysis is of course misleading for assessment of the compression stresses in the flange surfaces over time, although it seems that such calculations often are used for design. The value of the manual analysis was mainly that it showed that the nominal stresses aresimilar for different sizes, except for the 630 mm pipe where they are significantly higher. Further it was established that pressurizing of the pipe means a moderate influence on the flange stresses and bolt forces, 10 - 15 %, and that the bolt and backing ring are much stiffer than the plastic flange, meaning that it is mainly relaxation that is responsible forunloading of the joint over time. Computer simulations (FEM) were then made of both the tightening and the service phase for a set of geometries, and with a material model including time dependent properties of the plastic parts of the joint using material data from in-house experiments. Although the computer simulations are approximate too, they give a much better impression both of the principal function of the joint and of the magnitude of the stresses over time. It appears that the geometry of the flange joint means that the contact is lost over large parts of the flange surfaces already at pressurizing and that a triangulardistribution of pressure covering a part of the flange surface corresponding to the width of the backing ring is developed over time which should be sufficient to keep the joint tight. The effects of gaskets and profiled, softer, backing rings are clarified, and it is indicated that re-tightening is an efficient way to improve the function of the joint over time. Further, it seems that there is no significant difference in behaviour, as regards flange pressure, between SDR 11 and SDR 17 geometries. So, the FEM investigation has revealed that intuitive thoughts about reasons for inferior functioning of large <b>size</b> <b>flange</b> joints in plastic pipes are not well founded. The most efficient way to improve the joint is to increase the bolt force and to keep it up,by re-tightening or by flexible backing rings. Gaskets, soft ones, may be beneficial for reducing unevenness of the plastic joint surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{conceptual}} design and preliminary engineering calculations {{have been completed}} for a two cassette cryostat. This report summarizes the design. A cryocooler is permanently mounted {{in the center of}} a stainless steel, 0. 75 inch thick top lid. The cryocooler sits upon a spacer which raises the cooling stage elevations to favorably match the cassette heat intercept elevations. The top lid (32. 0 -inch outside diameter) mates to a 24 -inch pipe <b>size</b> <b>flange</b> with o-ring. The 24 -inch pipe size vacuum vessel with end plate has a minimum internal depth of 16 -inch to give adequate clearance for the depth of the cryocooler and multilayer insulation blankets. Support stand legs elevate the container to a convenient height and allow for placement of the AFE power supply underneath. Two cassette slots are located on either side of the cryocooler. The slots are positioned parallel to each other, 10. 5 -inch center to center (6 standard cassette slot widths) so that the standard 8 slot AFE backplane can be used. The slot opening through the lid is approximately 1. 422 -inch x 16. 782 -inch. A 0. 016 -inch thick titanium (Ti- 6 AI- 4 V) envelope with sealing lip is inserted through lid and defines the gas helium boundary that the VLPC cassette resides. The internal dimensions of the titanium envelope are 1. 390 -inch x 16. 75 -inch x 10. 531 -inch deep. When the cassette is inserted the clearances will be 0. 015 -inch on the long side, 0. 063 -inch on the short side, and 0. 032 -inch at the bottom. The cassette gasket seals against the top lip of the titanium envelope. A soft gasket or thin vacuum sealant tape seals the underside of the titanium envelope to the top surface of the lid. A clamping hold down bar may be necessary to make this vacuum seal. Gas helium for the cassette space is supplied through a fitting and port that is added to the cassette bulkhead assembly. This is the only modification necessary the standard D-Zero cassette. Evacuation and backfilling and then stagnant positive pressure are achieved through this one port. After the titanium envelope/pocket and cassette are mounted to the top lid, the lid is raised so that assembly work can be accomplished below. Three pneumatic cylinders mounted to the lid are pressurized (with air or the gas helium source) to raise the lid. Safety linkages are installed to prevent accidental lowering of the lid while work is being performed. Honeycomb sandwich panels are attached to the titanium envelope to support the thin envelope against the pressure differential. A thin thermoplastic mesh placed between the honeycomb panel and titanium envelope helps to insulate the panel so it is not a significant parallel heat path down the wall. There are two panel sets for each cassette. One for the area above the upper intercept and one set for the area below. It is reasonable that a 0. 40 -inch thick panel will suffice. A high conductance thermal link is made between the first stage of the cryocooler and the uppermost intercept location. This is solid OFHC copper part with a short section of flexible copper braid that connects to bars that clamp solidly to the long sides of the cassette envelope. Apiezon 'N' grease is used at assembly to enhance heat transfer at the clamp bar to titanium envelope interface. A second high conductance thermal connection is made between the second stage of the cryocooler and the bottom of the cassette envelope.
