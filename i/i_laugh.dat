[...] An interview with Denis Healey proved {{to be one of}} his most embarrassing moments: [...] "I mistakenly thought that he had become an amiable old buffer who would engage in amusing conversation, and he tore me limb from limb. <b>I</b> <b>laugh</b> about it now, but I didn't feel like laughing about it at the time." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{tributes to}} Stengel upon his death were many. Maury Allen wrote, [...] "He {{is gone and}} I am {{supposed}} to cry, but <b>I</b> <b>laugh.</b> Every time I saw the man, every time I heard his voice, every time his name was mentioned, the creases in my mouth would give way and a smile would come to my face." [...] Richie Ashburn, {{a member of the}} 1962 Mets, stated, [...] "Don't shed any tears for Casey. He wouldn't want you to... He was the happiest man I've ever seen."

500|$|As {{the musical}} prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen {{at play in}} the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle {{reminder}} of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: [...] "I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me". The wary Flosshilde cries: [...] "Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>laugh</b> at my fears, our enemy is in love", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: [...] "Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!" [...] Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him [...] bewailing their loss.|$|E
2500|$|The Lost Hero {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics and fans. Publishers Weekly gave The Lost Hero a favorable review, {{and stated that}} [...] "Riordan's storytelling is as polished as ever, brimming with wit, action, and heart". The novel received a mixed review from Vicky Smith of Kirkus Reviews, who wrote that the [...] "Greek-vs.-Roman tension tantalizes" [...] and that [...] "incidental details that bring the gods into the story often shine." [...] However, she also noted that there are [...] "far too many pages of stretched-out action, telling not showing and awkward dialogue" [...] and believed that only the die-hard fans would enjoy the book. She said that [...] "unless Riordan tightens things up considerably by number five, they may find themselves hoping {{that it does not}} end with a third Great Prophecy". The Seattle Times Karen Macpherson called the Greek and Roman mix [...] "fascinating" [...] and also said that the [...] "characters are interesting and well-developed, and the richly complex story has Riordan's trademark wry humor and nearly nonstop action". Kidsreads, on the other hand, gave a mixed review, stating [...] "I always learn something new whenever I read these books, and it certainly helps that <b>I</b> <b>laugh</b> along the way. You’re {{not going to want to}} miss this one!" [...] but also comments on the confusing plot line, commenting that [...] "This time, they cross over to Roman mythology, and the sometimes-blurred lines between the two cultures are examined in closer detail." [...] The book also received a positive review from The Epoch Times, which said [...] "If anyone was afraid that Riordan couldn’t top his Percy Jackson series—they can quit worrying. This new series, even though in the same genre as the Percy Jackson group, has fresh ideas, more mystery and magic and keeps the reader engrossed from start to finish." ...|$|E
