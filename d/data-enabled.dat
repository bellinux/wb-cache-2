40|$|In {{order to}} cope with the {{relentless}} data tsunami in 5 G wireless networks, current approaches such as acquiring new spectrum, deploying more base stations (BSs) and increasing nodes in mobile packet core networks are becoming ineffective in terms of scalability, cost and flexibility. In this regard, context-aware 5 G networks with edge/cloud computing and exploitation of big data analytics can yield significant gains to mobile operators. In this article, proactive content caching in 5 G wireless networks is investigated in which a big <b>data-enabled</b> architecture is proposed. In this practical architecture, vast amount of data is harnessed for content popularity estimation and strategic contents are cached at the BSs to achieve higher users' satisfaction and backhaul offloading. To validate the proposed solution, we consider a real-world case study where several hours of mobile data traffic is collected from a major telecom operator in Turkey and a big <b>data-enabled</b> analysis is carried out leveraging tools from machine learning. Based on the available information and storage capacity, numerical studies show that several gains are achieved both in terms of users' satisfaction and backhaul offloading. For example, in the case of 16 BSs with 30 % of content ratings and 13 Gbyte of storage size (78 % of total library size), proactive caching yields 100 % of users' satisfaction and offloads 98 % of the backhaul.

Experimental results show that the hybrid system outperforms each of the models that compose it.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{advances}} in traffic monitoring systems have made real-time traffic velocity data ubiquitously accessible for drivers. This paper develops a traffic <b>data-enabled</b> predictive energy management framework for a power-split plug-in {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (PHEV). Compared with conventional model predictive control (MPC), an additional supervisory state of charge (SOC) planning level is constructed based on real-time traffic data. A power balance-based PHEV model is developed for this upper level to rapidly generate battery SOC trajectories that utilized as final state constraints in the MPC level. This PHEV energy management framework is evaluated under three different scenarios: (i) without traffic flow information, (ii) with static traffic flow information, and (iii) with dynamic traffic flow information. Numerical results using real-world traffic data illustrate that the proposed strategy successfully incorporates dynamic traffic flow data into the PHEV energy management algorithm to achieve enhanced fuel economy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Tensor {{factorization}} {{has proven}} useful {{in a wide}} range of applications, from sensor array processing to com-munications, speech and audio signal processing, and machine learning. With few recent exceptions, all tensor factorization algorithms were originally developed for centralized, in-memory computation on a single machine; and the few that break away from this mold do not easily incorporate practically important constraints, such as non-negativity. A new constrained tensor factorization framework is proposed in this paper, building upon the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMoM). It is shown that this simplifies computations, bypassing the need to solve constrained optimization problems in each iteration; and it naturally leads to distributed algorithms suitable for parallel implementation. This opens the door for many emerging big <b>data-enabled</b> applications. The methodology is exemplified using non-negativity as a baseline constraint, but the proposed frame-work can incorporate many other types of constraints. Numerical experiments are encouraging, indicating that ADMoM-based non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) has high potential as an alternative to state-of-the-art approaches.
