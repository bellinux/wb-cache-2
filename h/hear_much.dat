25|$|They go on {{to discuss}} what {{is good or bad}} in writing. Socrates tells a brief legend, {{critically}} commenting on the gift of writing from the Egyptian god Theuth to King Thamus, who was to disperse Theuth's gifts to the people of Egypt. After Theuth remarks on his discovery of writing as a remedy for the memory, Thamus responds that its true effects are likely to be the opposite; it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, he says, with the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will <b>hear</b> <b>much</b> without being properly taught, and will appear wise but not be so, making them difficult to get along with.|$|E
500|$|Criticism {{centered}} {{on the fact that}} the documentary focuses more on Yoshiki than the band as a whole. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter said that while the film does cover the deaths of two X Japan members and the [...] "brainwashing" [...] of Toshi, it spends more time following the drummer at [...] press and preparations for Madison Square Garden. Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! made similar comments and noted typos in the English subtitles. Hughes gave the film an 8 out of 10 and observed that these were small complaints against an otherwise [...] "outstanding rock documentary." [...] The movie was given ratings of 3 stars out of 5 by reviews in The Guardian, the New York Daily News and Time Out London with views range from the film being: [...] "A watchable and interesting – if a tad worshipful", [...] "an accessible ride, if not a particularly unique one", and that, [...] "Kijak’s willingness to indulge the band’s rampant self-mythologising can get tiresome". The Village Voice was more critical saying it was, [...] "a maddeningly vague primer. ... All director Stephen Kijak's frustrated attempts at getting into Yoshiki's head leave little time for viewers to <b>hear</b> <b>much</b> of what X Japan's music actually sounds like." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Inn's {{inhabitants}} {{pass the}} time with movies supplied by the Company. [...] In one chapter, we get a long and reverent description of them watching D.W. Griffith's Intolerance, with Einar as Chorus describing every scene. Since Imarte was actually alive in Babylon, one of the movie's famous settings, we <b>hear</b> <b>much</b> about what life was really like.|$|E

2500|$|Humans {{and cats}} {{have a similar}} range of hearing on {{the low end of}} the scale, but cats can <b>hear</b> <b>much</b> higher-pitched sounds, up to 64 kHz, which is 1.6 octaves above the range of a human, and even 1 octave above the range of a dog. When {{listening}} for something, a cat's ears will swivel in that direction; a cat's ear flaps (pinnae) can independently point backwards as well as forwards and sideways to pinpoint the source of the sound. Cats can judge within [...] the location of a sound being made [...] away—this can be useful for locating their prey.|$|E
2500|$|McGraw figures {{prominently}} in an Orioles-spiked-umpires recollection in Fred Lieb's 1950 The Baseball Story, which quotes 1890s umpire John Heydler, later a National League president, as saying: [...] "We <b>hear</b> <b>much</b> of the glories and durability {{of the old}} Orioles, but the truth about this team seldom has been told. [...] They were mean, vicious, ready at any time to maim a rival player or an umpire, if it helped their cause. [...] The things they would say to an umpire were unbelievably vile, and they broke the spirits of some fine men. [...] I’ve seen umpires bathe their feet by the hour after McGraw and others spiked them through their shoes. [...] The club never was a constructive force in the game. [...] The worst of it was they got by with much of their browbeating and hooliganism. [...] Other clubs patterned after them, and I feel the lot of the umpire never was worse than in the years when the Orioles were flying high." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of public {{reading of the}} Torah by Ezra the Scribe after {{the return of the}} Judean exiles is described in Nehemiah [...] Prior to Ezra, the mitzvah of Torah reading was based on the Biblical commandment of Hakhel (Deuteronomy [...] ), by which once every 7 years the entire people was to be gathered, [...] "men, women and children," [...] and <b>hear</b> <b>much</b> of Deuteronomy, the final volume of the Pentateuch, read to them (see the closing chapters of the Talmudic Tractate Sotah). Traditionally, the mitzvah of gathering the people and reading them the Torah under Hakhel was to be performed by the King. Under Ezra, Torah reading became more frequent and the congregation themselves substituted for the King's role. Ezra is traditionally credited with initiating the modern custom of reading thrice weekly in the synagogue. This reading is an obligation incumbent on the congregation, not an individual, and did not replace the Hakhel reading by the king. The reading of the Law in the synagogue can be traced to at least about the 2nd century BCE, when the grandson of Sirach refers to it in his preface as an Egyptian practice.|$|E

30|$|One <b>hears</b> <b>much</b> {{about the}} notion of jobless growth – specifically, the claim {{that in many cases}} {{economic}} growth takes place, yet employment does not increase. This hypothesis is not borne out by the data. Actually, the truth is quite the opposite.|$|R

5000|$|In South Africa [...] "provisional liquidation" [...] {{has a very}} {{different}} meaning. When a creditor or other person applies to the court for the liquidation of a business, then the order is first made a provisional basis, and then subsequent confirmed (or not) at a full <b>hearing,</b> <b>much</b> like a decree nisi and a decree absolut in other jurisdictions.|$|R

50|$|Voice Clarifying Amplifiers {{operate in}} a similar way to hearing aids. They are placed in the outer ear, are flesh colored, and amplify {{surrounding}} noise to make <b>hearing</b> <b>much</b> easier for those with impairments. Using micro-technology, these amplifiers use a separate pouch with a rotary style volume control knob. Because these are meant for everyday use they can be used for television purposes, though do not use an infrared wavelength to collect sound.|$|R
60|$|I {{had already}} made the {{acquaintance}} {{of some of the}} people, high and low, and on that evening, <b>hearing</b> <b>much</b> hilarious talk in the parlour, I went in to join the company, and found fifteen or twenty persons present.
