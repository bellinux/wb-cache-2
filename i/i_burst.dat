Prior to the second Test, Jardine again approached Allen and said that Larwood and Voce wanted him to bowl short, and believed that he only refused because he wanted to maintain his popularity. Allen wrote home: [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>burst</b> and said a good deal about swollen-headed, gutless, uneducated miners." [...] Allen threatened not to play, and to go home to relate the events of the tour to the press. Jardine did not pursue the matter. Others in the team also opposed Bodyline. The Nawab of Pataudi refused to field in the [...] "leg trap"—the ring of fielders positioned on the leg side to catch deflections from short deliveries—during the first Test. Allen had no compunction fielding there; at short leg he held five catches from Larwood's bowling in the series. Upon his return to England, Allen continued to oppose Bodyline tactics, making his opinion known to senior figures in the MCC, and leading a debate among county representatives which resulted in legislation to ban the tactic after the 1934 season.|$|E

40|$|We present {{examples}} of the both types of bursts and show their similarities and differences. Then for chains of type <b>I</b> <b>bursts</b> a similar model as for drifting pulsation structures (DPSs) is proposed. We show that similarly as in the DPS, the chains of type <b>I</b> <b>bursts</b> can be generated by the fragmented magnetic reconnection associated with plasmoids interactions. To support this new model of chains of type <b>I</b> <b>bursts,</b> we present an effect of merging of two plasmoids to one larger plasmoid on the radio spectrum of DPS. This process can also explain the "wavy" appearance of some chains of type <b>I</b> <b>bursts.</b> Then we show that the chains of type <b>I</b> <b>bursts</b> with the "wavy" appearance {{can be used for}} estimation of the magnetic field strength in their sources. We think that differences of chains of type <b>I</b> <b>bursts</b> and DPSs are mainly owing to different regimes of the magnetic field reconnection. While in the case of chains of type <b>I</b> <b>bursts</b> the magnetic reconnection and plasmoid interactions are in the quasi-separatrix layer of the active region in more or less quasi-saturated regime, in the case of DPSs, observed in the impulsive phase of eruptive flares, the magnetic reconnection and plasmoids interactions are in the current sheet formed under the flare magnetic rope, which moves upwards and forces this magnetic reconnection.

500|$|To {{accommodate}} all {{of these}} goals, Mountbatten insisted that Rangoon be taken by May. Slim had initially planned to take the city in a pincer movement, with XXXIII Corps advancing towards the city down the east bank of the Irrawaddy river via Hlegu, and IV Corps taking a shorter route along the Sittang River valley to the east. Slim believed that the Japanese had insufficient forces to block both thrusts, {{and one of the}} corps would therefore be able to capture Rangoon. However, Mountbatten was unsure that a purely overland advance would be successful, and that a joint airborne-amphibious assault would therefore be the better option. Slim and others, such as Slim's superior, General Oliver Leese (commander of Allied Land Forces, South East Asia), initially opposed such an operation, fearing that it would divert vital resources from Fourteenth Army. By the time of the meeting at Monywa, however, Slim had come around to Mountbatten's way of thinking, fearing that a purely overland advance would meet fierce Japanese resistance, as it had at Meiktila, and be delayed {{at the end of an}} overextended supply line. As such, a combined airborne and amphibious assault would be ideal as Fourteenth Army neared Rangoon, Slim arguing that it would be [...] "a hammering at the back door while <b>I</b> <b>burst</b> in at the front."

2500|$|By 1940, the Japanisation of Manchuria {{had become}} extreme, and an altar to the Shinto goddess Amaterasu {{was built on}} the grounds of Puyi's palace. The origins of the altar are unclear, with the postwar Japanese {{claiming}} that Puyi aimed for a closer connection to the Japanese Emperor as a means of resisting the political machinations of the Manchukuo elites, while Puyi in his Chinese Communist-published autobiography claims that he was forced to submit to this by the Japanese. During his visit to Japan in 1940 for Kigensetsu, which was marked with especially lavish celebrations that year to mark the supposed 2,600thanniversary of the founding of the Empire of Japan by the mythical Emperor Jimmu on 11February 660BC, Puyi during his meeting with the Showa Emperor read out a statement given to him by General Yoshioka asking for permission to worship the Shinto gods and to establish Shintoism as the state religion of Manchukuo. The Showa Emperor replied [...] "I must comply with your wishes" [...] and gave him three relics, namely a bronze mirror, a sword and a piece of jade (reproductions of the Imperial Regalia of Japan) to take home with him {{to be the center of}} Shinto worship in Manchukuo. Puyi later wrote [...] "I thought Beijing antique shops were full of such objects. Were these a great god? Were those my ancestors? <b>I</b> <b>burst</b> into tears on the drive back." [...] Since in the Japanese state religion of Shintoism the Japanese Emperor was worshiped as a living god, worshiping at the Shinto shrine in the Salt Tax Palace also meant worshiping the Showa Emperor as a god, which starkly underlined Puyi's subordination to the Showa Emperor. In any case, Puyi's wartime duties came to include sitting through Chinese-language Shinto prayers. Hirohito was surprised when he heard of this, asking why a Temple of Heaven had not been built instead. After his second visit to Japan, Puyi announced in a press statement that Japan and Manchukuo were [...] "unified in virtue and heart", praised the Shinto Sun Goddess Amaterasu for her [...] "divine intervention" [...] in 1931 that supposedly made Manchukuo possible, and hailed the Showa Emperor as a living god as the House of Yamato were all alleged to be the direct descendants of Amterasu.

2500|$|Chosen by Empress Dowager Cixi on her deathbed, Puyi became emperor {{at the age}} of 2years and 10months in December1908 {{after the}} Guangxu Emperor died on 14November. Titled the Xuantong Emperor (Wade-Giles: Hsuan-tung Emperor), Puyi's {{introduction}} to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him. On the evening of 13November 1908, without any advance notice, a procession of eunuchs and guardsmen led by the palace chamberlain left the Forbidden City for the Northern Mansion to inform Prince Chun that they were taking away his three-year-old son Puyi to be the new emperor. The toddler Puyi screamed and resisted as the officials ordered the eunuch attendants to pick him up. Puyi's parents said nothing when they learned that they were losing their son. As Puyi cried, screaming {{that he did not want}} to leave his parents, he was forced into a palanquin that took him back to the Forbidden City. Puyi's wet nurse Wang Wen-Chao was the only person from the Northern Mansion allowed to go with him, and she calmed the very distraught Puyi down by allowing him to suckle one of her breasts; this was the only reason why she was taken along as only she could calm Puyi down. Upon arriving at the Forbidden City, Puyi was taken to see the Dowager Empress Cixi. Puyi later wrote: I still have a dim recollection of this meeting, the shock of which left a deep impression on my memory. I remember suddenly finding myself surrounded by strangers, while before me was hung a drab curtain through which I could see an emaciated and terrifying hideous face. This was Cixi. It is said that <b>I</b> <b>burst</b> out into loud howls at the sight and started to tremble uncontrollably.

[...] "Take him away to play." [...] His father, Prince Chun, became Prince Regent (摄政王). During Puyi's coronation in the Hall of Supreme Harmony on 2December 1908, the young emperor was carried onto the Dragon Throne by his father. Puyi was so frightened by the scene before him and the deafening sounds of ceremonial drums and music that he started crying. His father could do nothing except to quietly comfort him: [...] "Don't cry, it'll be over soon." ...|$|E

This result allows us to constrain the combination of the number of binary sources with low accretion rates and the properties of X-ray bursts from such sources, in particular, the peak luminosity during bursts and the frequency of their occurrence.

The flare emission is well described by black-body radiation with peak temperature of 2. 4 keV. The total energy release from the event is 10 ^{ 42 } erg (for an assumed distance of 7 kpc). The flare has all the characteristics of thermo-nuclear X-ray <b>bursts</b> (so-called type <b>I</b> X-ray <b>bursts),</b> except for its very long duration and therefore large energy release (factor of 1500 - 4000 longer and 250 - 425 more energy than normal type <b>I</b> X-ray <b>bursts</b> from this source). The flare is preceded by a short and weak X-ray burst, possibly of type I. Days to weeks before the flare, type <b>I</b> X-ray <b>bursts</b> were seen {{at a rate of}} ~ 3 per day. However, after the flare type <b>I</b> X-ray <b>bursting</b> ceased for at least a month, suggesting that the superburst affected the type <b>I</b> <b>bursting</b> behaviour.
