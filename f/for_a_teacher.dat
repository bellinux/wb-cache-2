They had one child, a daughter, Nadia Zulficar. In 1954, Hamama chose Omar Sharif to co-star with her in a film. In this film, she uncharacteristically agreed to a romantic scene involving a kiss.

The Glenore school was finished in 1862, and it was accompanied by a [...] farm whose rent was to pay <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> and building upkeep. A new church, for the Church of England, was built just outside Hagley. St Mary's Church of Hagley and Quamby was completed and opened in 1862. The first church continued in use as a school until 1865. In the prior year construction had begun on a public school, a two-room building with an adjacent 8-room teacher's residence; the school opened in 1865. Hagley was gazetted as a town in April 1866. By that time it had a number of stores, a blacksmith, a boot maker, a saddler, a wheelwright, two churches, two schools, two hotels, a resident seamstress and a midwife. By the late 1870s the town had gained, in addition to houses, a police station, gaol, engineering works, one steam mill run by the Noake Family and another at nearby Quamby. A rail line opened, from Launceston to Westbury, in 1871, though its station was [...] from Hagley. In the 1880s a siding was added at Hoggs Lane, and a passenger platform at the siding in 1910.

40|$|In {{order to}} counter {{what appears to}} be <b>a</b> problem <b>for</b> many OECD countries, namely the growing {{shortage}} of teachers, it will be crucial to retain pre-service teachers and keep them committed to teaching. Their motivation <b>for</b> becoming <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> is believed to be relevant in this respect. This study investigated the importance ascribed by 136 Dutch pre-service teachers to multiple motives, using the Factors Influencing Teaching Choice (FIT-Choice) theory as a basis. It then investigated how these motives are related to the effort these pre-service teachers plan to invest in their profession, their planned involvement in the profession and their current commitment to the profession. Finally, the results were used to distinguish adaptive motives <b>for</b> becoming <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> (motives that are positively related to effort, involvement and commitment) and maladaptive motives <b>for</b> becoming <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> (motives that are negatively related to these constructs). The most important motive identified <b>for</b> becoming <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> was the pre-service teachers' belief in their teaching abilities. The least important motive was their perception of teaching as a fallback career...|$|R

Affective commitment was predicted by the motivations of teaching ability, working with children, prior teaching and learning experiences, and time for family, as well as satisfaction with the choice of teaching and perceived task demand. Lastly, preservice teachers at the end of their teacher education considered social influences and teaching ability to be more important motivations <b>for</b> becoming <b>a</b> <b>teacher...</b>|$|R
