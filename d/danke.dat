2500|$|Earthstar's {{second album}} for Sky, Atomkraft? Nein, <b>Danke!</b> (literally [...] "Nuclear power? [...] No, thank you!"), was an {{environmental}} tone poem. [...] The album {{was recorded in}} 1979 and 1980 and was released on February 1, 1981. [...] The Planet Mellotron Web site describes it as [...] "more laid back" [...] than French Skyline and [...] "...an ideal opportunity to hear the rarest tape-replay instrument," [...] the Birotron.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} in Berlin Thaer had an {{encounter}} with Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, {{the head of the}} German General Staff, who was of course several ranks senior to Thaer's. [...] The incident sheds light on the social nuances of honour and military etiquette that were a feature of the imperial Prussian office corps at the time. [...] In 1910 von Thaer returned from an absence of several months during which he had been on holiday in Russia and reported back {{to the head of the}} chief of staff, General von Moltke. [...] Von Moltke invited his candid opinion on the state of relations between Germany and Russia. [...] It seems likely that von Moltke misunderstood his junior officer's reply. [...] He understood von Thaer to have advocated a Preventive war against Russia. [...] There was much concern in Germany at this time that the military power balance with Russia was shifting in Russia's favour, and there were many who thought that since military confrontation was inevitable, the outcome would be more likely to favour the German empire if war came sooner rather than later. [...] Von Moltke was firmly opposed to the [...] "preventive war" [...] idea, however. [...] Thaer, in his report of his conversation with von Moltke, insists that he too was similarly opposed to any [...] "preventive war" [...] proposals. [...] But that seems not to have been what von Moltke thought he had heard. [...] In any case, von Molkte concluded the interview frostily with the formal phrase, [...] "Ich <b>danke</b> Ihnen, Herr Hauptmann" [...] ("I thank you, Mr Officer"). [...] Thaer saw this choice of words as an insult. [...] The customary formulation at the time (even if strictly speaking [...] "incorrect") would have been [...] "Ich <b>danke</b> Ihnen, Thaer", using the name of a brother officer despite the difference in their actual ranks. [...] Thaer waited for 24 hours and then submitted a complaint. [...] Von Moltke apologised and clarified the matter to him. [...] There is no obvious evidence that Thaer's subsequent military career was damaged by the incident.|$|E
