Subsequently, {{the first phase of the}} Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) was initiated and included activities such as the Challenge initiative to conduct screening assessments on the highest priority chemicals, including a few metal-containing substances.

This approach also allows for consideration of incidental releases of a given metal. Because ecological concerns were identified during the Challenge for cobalt, an early metal-moiety assessment is being undertaken in the second phase of the CMP for this metal.

40|$|The NEOs are {{representative}} of the population of asteroids and dead comets thought to be similar to the ancient planetesimal swarms that accreted to form the planets. The chemical investigation of NEOs having primitive characteristics is thus essential in the understanding the planet formation and evolution. They carry records of the solar system 2 ̆ 7 s birth/early phases and the geological evolution of small bodies in the inter-planetary regions. Moreover, collisions of NEOs with Earth represent a serious hazard to life. For all these reasons the exploration and characterization of these objects are particularly interesting and urgent. NEOs are interesting and highly accessible targets for scientific research and robotic exploration. Within this framework, a mission including an orbiter and a lander to the primitive double object (1996 FG 3) is under study, in collaboration with different European countries (France, Italy, Germany and United Kingdom) and related Space Agencies. The principal objective is to characterize the chemical-physical surface properties by in-situ analysis and to define its internal structure by radar tomographer. This type of mission, studied to fit within limited resources and cost, appears clearly to have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of primitive materials and to provide us the information needed to develop strategies to protect the Earth from impactors.

40|$|The Delphi {{methodology}} {{was used}} to explore Internet infidelity. 78 Clinical Members of the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy were asked to share cases of Internet infidelity from their practice. An inductive analysis was conducted on these responses to derive themes across the reported cases of Internet infidelity. Three representative vignettes were then created. The goal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phases</b> {{of the study was}} to generate a list of critical issues, interventions and gender differences for each of the three vignettes from 20 experts in the fields of extramarital affairs and/or sex addiction. In the seventh and final phase of the study, these same expert panelists were asked to rank items generated from the previous phase on a seven-point Likert scale. They were also asked to share any qualitative feedback they had for each of their responses. ^ Results indicated that expert panelists believed that Internet infidelity cases are not different from other cases of marital infidelity. Experts also agreed that establishing trust, attending to the feelings of the noninvolved spouse, and using the infidelity as an opportunity to strengthen the marriage, were important areas for intervention. Agreement and consensus by the panelists on each of the other critical issues, interventions and gender differences was largely the exception rather than rule. Explanations were offered and defended to explain this phenomenon. Directions for future research and implications for training and practice of MFTs are discussed as well. ...|$|E

40|$|The article {{concentrates}} on the specificity of philosophical cognition. Referring to Mieczysław A. Krąpiec’s study, the author proves {{that the process of}} thinking is not to be necessarily identified with the process of cognition, as in fact the former is merely a secondary phase of the latter. When identified with thinking, the philosophical cognition would undermine the very sense of cognition, which means the understanding of reality. When based on thinking alone, philosophy does not grasp real things, but operates with abstracts of being and being’s representations (concepts). As for the correctness of philosophical thinking the laws of logic, with ensuring non-contradictory operations, are sufficient enough. However, any knowledge that aspires to be philosophical has to start from really existing beings. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phases</b> of cognition, such beings are grasped more and more particularly and precisely—starting from their transcendental properties and principles, then their structure and categorial properties, and finally their individual characteristics and actions. The very first act of cognition is directed to real beings, which are immediately grasped in respect of their existence and real essence. The second act of cognition deals with signs. The precedence of being in human cognition makes the philosophy charged not with a task of thinking about the world, but with the task of knowing and understanding it within possible and verifiable limits. Therefore, according to Krąpiec, the very first philosophical discipline is metaphysics, which has real beings as its object. Thus, philosophical cognition should preserve its objective character, as {{this is the only way}} to guarantee its realism...|$|E
30|$|Due to the {{broadcast}} characteristic of the wireless environment, the secrecy of data transmissions is very important. Physical layer security is proposed to solve the security problem in which the secrecy principle {{is based on the}} exploitation of the physical characteristics of the wireless channel [6 – 24]. In [6], Wyner showed that the important data is secure if the quality of the main channel is larger than that of the wiretap channel. Physical layer security has been investigated in the Gaussian channel [7], {{the broadcast}} channel [8], and the wireless fading channels [9] and has been extended to the relay-eavesdropper channel [10], the parallel relay-eavesdropper channel [11], and the multi-access channel [12, 13, 15]. The achievable secrecy rate (ASR) is the metric used to measure the amount of secure data that is successfully received at the intended user [17]. In [17, 19], global channel state information (CSI) is available in which Dong et al. regarded a practical assumption that the eavesdropper nodes are active and their CSIs are monitored by the center network [17]. Kim et al. assumed that the source and relay nodes can detect the CSI based on frequent response messages of the eavesdropper nodes. These messages will be used to inform the source node that the eavesdropper nodes want to be served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phases</b> [20]. Exploitation of relays has been proposed to overcome the fading environment as well as to enhance secrecy capacity [10, 11, 17 – 24]. Optimal relay selection methods [18, 23] and weight optimization methods of the cooperative relays [17, 19] have been studied to maximize the ASR and satisfy a total transmit power constraint. In [21 – 24], a utilization of jamming signals has been investigated in which friendly wireless nodes or relays operate as jammers to create artificial interference to reduce the quality of the eavesdropping channel. The authors assumed that the jamming signals are known at both the destination nodes and the relays; hence, the quality of the desired channel cannot be affected by the interference signals. A special case in which the cooperative relay does not behave as a trusted node is proposed [25].|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} Phase 1 of {{a support}} and evaluation {{project for the}} AIHW National best practice guidelines for collecting Indigenous status in health data sets (the Guidelines). The project, conducted between July 2011 and December 2012, helped to implement the Guidelines in selected areas, to document implementation activities, to collect baseline information, and to identify barriers to and facilitators for implementation. The processes for, and status of, Guidelines implementation varied across data sets and health sectors in scope for this project. In the hospitals sector (which supplies data for the National Hospital Morbidity Database and National Perinatal Data Collection), Indigenous status data are generally of high quality and additional support for Guidelines implementation is not currently required. The drug treatment services sector (which supplies data for the Alcohol and Other Drugs Treatment Services National Minimum Data Set) includes a mix of government and non- government service providers. Some jurisdictions have distributed the Guidelines and undertaken activities in the sector to improve data, but there is scope for more work on implementation in the sector. The mental health services sector (which supplies data for the National Residential and Community Care databases) has undergone reforms with implications for data collection. Future support for Guidelines implementation will be considered as these changes are embedded. The National Diabetes Register has limited coverage of diabetes in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, and Guidelines implementation is therefore not a priority at this stage. Cancer registries require upstream work in the general practice sector and pathology messaging to improve identification; the project will provide support in these sectors where possible. The general practice sector is notable as identification is needed for service delivery {{as well as for}} data improvements. Targeted support to the general practice sector was provided in Phase 1 of the project and will continue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phases</b> of the project. Further implementation of the Guidelines could be facilitated by: recognising non-jurisdiction stakeholders as essential partners in Guidelines implementation, as the capacity of jurisdictions to implement the Guidelines varies across health sectorssupporting jurisdiction implementation processes; for example, by strengthening reporting mechanisms through more detailed description of Guidelines implementation activities to better monitor progress and by identifying areas in need of greater supportproviding targeted support in selected areas to assist in the systematic implementation of the Guidelinesfostering national coordination in the general practice sector...|$|E
