In Ex parte Karstendick (1876), the Court held that a federal court had no statutory authority to sentence a defendant to hard labor at a state prison outside of its territorial <b>jurisdiction.</b> <b>In</b> <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> Jackson (1877), the Court considered several constitutional issues, including the Postal Power, {{the application of the}} First Amendment to mail-order gambling, and the application of the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement to the mail. In Ex parte Lothrop (1886), the Court found that the Arizona territorial courts were properly constituted.

50|$|The Supreme Court {{never had}} an {{opportunity}} to exercise the authority to hear appeals from habeas petitions in the circuit courts. In Ex parte McCardle (1867), the first such case, the Court denied a motion to dismiss, finding that it had such jurisdiction. William H. McCardle had been arrested by a military commission for violating the Military Reconstruction Act by publishing anti-Reconstruction editorials in the Vicksburg Times. Before the Court could reach the merits, Congress repealed said <b>jurisdiction.</b> <b>In</b> <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> McCardle (1869), the Court held that the repeal was a valid exercise of Congress's Exceptions Clause power.|$|E

50|$|Interest <b>in</b> <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> McCardle was revived in {{the early}} 2000s when Congress {{repealed}} the statute that was {{being used by the}} detainees in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to petition for habeas corpus.

Rumsfeld, for example.|$|R
25|$|Thus, {{in several}} cases, the Court found the alleged error too insubstantial to {{consider}} via original habeas. <b>In</b> <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> Parks (1876), the Court held {{that it had}} no original habeas jurisdiction to free a defendant convicted in a United States district court, even though no appeal was possible from the district court to the circuit court, and even though the petitioner alleged that the district court had been entirely without jurisdiction to try the offense charged. Similarly, <b>in</b> <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> Rowland (1881), the Court held {{that it had no}} original habeas jurisdiction to examine a contempt of court conviction arising from the disregard of a writ of mandamus. And, <b>in</b> <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> Bigelow (1885), the Court held that there could be no review of a double jeopardy determination of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. <b>In</b> <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> Harding (1887), the Court held that the composition of a grand jury (i.e. whether an alien sat) could not be so reviewed.|$|R

2500|$|Under the {{categorical}} approach {{advocated by}} <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> Coughlan, for a substantive legitimate expectation {{to be protected}} it had to fit into either category (a) or (c). However, classifying substantive legitimate expectations into distinct categories is difficult in cases where there are overlaps, leading Lord Justice Laws to suggest <b>in</b> <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> Begbie that the categories mentioned <b>in</b> <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> Coughlan are not [...] "hermetically sealed". In an obiter dictum in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005), Lord Justice Laws set out a more structured form of merits-based review. He expanded the categorical approach <b>in</b> <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> Coughlan into a continuum based on proportionality, suggesting {{that in order for}} a public body's decision to resile from a legitimate expectation to be lawful, it must be [...] "a proportionate response to a legitimate aim pursued by the public body in the public interest".|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> Tom Tong (1883), the Court held that—under 1872 {{amendments}} to the certification procedure, which went into effect during the Chase Court era—because habeas corpus was a civil proceeding, questions arising in habeas cases could not be certified to the Supreme Court until a final judgment had been entered. <b>In</b> <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> Milligan (1866), after the repeal of those amendments, the Court held that habeas petitions in the circuit courts could {{be a source of}} certified questions to the Supreme Court.|$|R

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> Wilson (1885) and United States v.

United States (1886), the Court held that an authorized sentence {{of two years}} imprisonment (even without hard labor) was sufficiently infamous to require a grand jury. <b>In</b> <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> Bain (1887) and Parkinson v.

2500|$|An {{instance}} of {{the application of the}} anxious scrutiny level of review is the 1995 case of R. v.
