50|$|White-box {{testing is}} a method of testing the {{application}} {{at the level of}} the source code. These test cases are derived through the use of the design techniques mentioned above: control <b>flow</b> <b>testing,</b> data <b>flow</b> <b>testing,</b> branch testing, path testing, statement coverage and decision coverage as well as modified condition/decision coverage. White-box testing is the use of these techniques as guidelines to create an error free environment by examining any fragile code. These White-box testing techniques are the building blocks of white-box testing, whose essence is the careful testing of the application at the source code level to prevent any hidden errors later on. These different techniques exercise every visible path of the source code to minimize errors and create an error-free environment. The whole point of white-box testing is the ability to know which line of the code is being executed and being able to identify what the correct output should be.|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} the ML <b>Flow</b> <b>test</b> as an additional, serological, tool for the classification of new leprosy patients. In Brazil, Nepal and Nigeria, 2632 leprosy patients were classified by three : (1) as multibacillary (MB) or paucibacillary (PB) according to the number of skin lesions (WHO classification), (2) by slit skin smear examination, and (3) by serology using the ML <b>Flow</b> <b>test</b> detecting IgM antibodies to Mycobacterium leprae-specific phenolic glycolipid-I. The proportion of MB leprosy patients was 39. 5, 35. 6 and 19. 4 % in Brazil, Nepal and Nigeria, respectively. The highest seropositivity in patients was observed in Nigeria (62. 9 %), followed by Brazil (50. 8 %) and Nepal (35. 6 %). ML <b>Flow</b> <b>test</b> results and smears were negative in 69. 1 and 82. 7 % of PB patients, while smears were positive in 58. 6 % of MB patients in Brazil and 28. 3 % in Nepal. In MB patients, both smears and ML <b>Flow</b> <b>tests</b> were negative in 15. 6 % in Brazil and 38. 3 %, in Nepal.

40|$|Cross-borehole <b>flow</b> <b>tests</b> {{provided}} {{insights into}} hydraulic connections in fractured and dipping mudstone and sandstone that {{were consistent with}} the lithostratigraphic and structural framework of a VOC-contaminated bedrock research site in west-central New Jersey. Two cross-borehole <b>flow</b> <b>tests</b> were completed. Each test involved measurement and analysis of transient flow in a newly installed deep corehole with a long open interval during short-term pumping and recovery in an adjacent shallow well with a short open interval. The cross-borehole <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> in the mudstone identified a hydraulic connection through a dipping fractured bed between the pumped interval in the well and a flow zone at an intermediate depth in the corehole. The presence of a hydraulic connection between the pumped well and the corehole was not obvious because the water-level response in the corehole was dominated by a shallow zone of high transmissivity, which was hydraulically isolated from the pumped interval. In the sandstone, the cross-borehole <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> identified a hydraulic connection along dipping fractured beds as well as a connection to a deep high-angle fracture that cuts across bedding.

40|$|Data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> is a {{particular}} form of testing that identifies data flow relations as test objectives. Data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> has recently attracted new interest {{in the context of}} testing object oriented systems, since data flow information is well suited to capture relations among the object states, and can thus provide useful information for testing method interactions. Unfortunately, classic data <b>flow</b> <b>testing,</b> which is based on static analysis of the source code, fails to identify many important data flow relations due to the dynamic nature of object oriented systems. This thesis presents Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing,</b> a technique which rethinks data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> to suit the testing of modern object oriented software. Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> stems from empirical evidence that we collect on the limits of classic data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> techniques. We investigate such limits by means of Dynamic Data Flow Analysis, a dynamic implementation of data flow analysis that computes sound data flow information on program traces. We compare data flow information collected with static analysis of the code with information observed dynamically on execution traces, and empirically observe that the data flow information computed with classic analysis of the source code misses a significant part of information that corresponds to relevant behaviors that shall be tested. In view of these results, we propose Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing.</b> The technique promotes the synergies between dynamic analysis, static reasoning and test case generation for automatically extending a test suite with test cases that execute the complex state based interactions between objects. Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> computes precise data flow information of the program with Dynamic Data Flow Analysis, processes the dynamic information to infer new test objectives, which Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> uses to generate new test cases. The test cases generated by Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> exercise relevant behaviors that are otherwise missed by both the original test suite and test suites that satisfy classic data flow criteria...|$|E
