This paper investigates the relative valuation performance of various value drivers when valuing the equity of South African companies listed on the JSE Securities Exchange for the period 2001 - 2010. The empirical results revealed, among other findings, that earnings-based value drivers offered the highest <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> accuracy, while cash flowand sales-based value drivers offered the lowest <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> accuracy.

40|$|Given a set {{of items}} and a {{collection}} of players, each with a nonnegative monotone valuation set function over the items, the welfare maximization problem requires that every item be allocated to exactly one player, and one wishes to maximize the sum of values obtained by the players, as computed by applying the respective valuation function to the bundle of items allocated to the player. This problem in its full generality is NP-hard, and moreover, at least as hard to approximate as set packing. Better approximation guarantees are known for restricted classes <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> functions. In this work we introduce a new parameter, the supermodular <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> a <b>valuation</b> function, which is a measure for {{the extent to which the}} function exhibits supermodular behavior.

Three consumers’ clusters were identified according to their reactions to the “organic and fair trade” label - the first cluster represents the people insensitive to the label’s presence, and contained nearly one half of the sample; for a second cluster, the “organic and fair trade” labels’ influence on the improving image of the products was positive and important; finally, for the third cluster, the valuation of the “organic and fair trade” label was determined by the product’s taste. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} model that links a firm’s {{decision}} {{to go public with}} its subsequent takeover strategy. A private bidder does not know a firm’s true valuation, which affects its gain from a potential takeover. Consequently, a private bidder pursues a suboptimal restructur-ing policy. An alternative route is to complete an initial public offering (IPO) first. An IPO reduces valuation uncertainty, leading to a more efficient acquisition strategy, therefore enhancing firm value. We calibrate the model using data on IPOs and mergers and acqui-sitions (M&As). The resulting comparative statics generate several novel qualitative and quantitative predictions, which complement the predictions of other theories linking IPOs and M&As. For example, the time it takes a newly public firm to attempt an acquisition of another firm is expected to increase in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> uncertainty prior to the firm’s IPO and in the cost of going public, and it is expected to decrease in the valuation surprise realized {{at the time of the}} IPO.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the legal liability of valuers to mortgage lenders for professional negligence, {{in cases where}} the property market has fallen subsequent to the date of the mortgage loan. The question of whether the valuer should be responsible for the lender’s additional losses attributable to the fall in the property market has been considered by the highest courts in both the UK and Australia. In South Australia Asset Management Corporation v York Montague Ltd (1996) (also referred to as BBL), the English House of Lords laid down a principle that was intended to limit the valuer’s liability in this respect. However, that principle was apparently rejected by the High Court of Australia in Kenny & Good Pty Ltd v MGICA (1992) Ltd (1999). This paper critically analyses the cases, decided in both the UK and Australia, in which this problem has been addressed. It considers the weaknesses of the South Australia/BBL principle as demonstrated in subsequent cases concerning contributory negligence, limitation of actions and the award of interest on damages. It examines the methods of assessing damages in this context that have been put forward and demonstrates how each of these proposed methods reacts to variables in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> error, the loan-to-value ratio adopted by the lender and the fall in the property market. The paper concludes that the South Australia/BBL principle is flawed, and suggests an alternative approach which may be acceptable to courts in both the UK and Australia.

40|$|Some {{consider}} valuers to be magicians inventing values <b>of</b> properties. <b>Valuation</b> {{is generally}} {{said to be}} “an art rather than a science”. Because of the imperfection of the property market, value is always imprecise and subject to a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty and <b>valuation.</b> Not withstanding all these, it is argued in this paper that, the art <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> {{is a process of}} an assessment and not an invention. Before a valuer comes in, there already exist a value determined by market variables and players. All that a valuer does is to gather, synthesise, analyse existing data and trends to estimate the possible market price. The traditional methods of assessing value were reviewed to substantiate the assertion that valuation is an assessment rather than an invention. A significant part of risk management within the banking sector is property valuation when it comes to lending. Value estimates are heavily relied on by clients. The “accuracy ” of value and comprehensiveness <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> reports are crucial tools in investment decision making.

40|$|Geographical Indications (GIs) for {{products}} (Basmati rice, Champagne sparkling wine, Antigua coffee, etc.) were regulated {{at the international}} level in 1995 (WTO TRIPS Agreement, Part II, Section 3). This paper proposes a model on the welfare effects of the socalled “claw-back” of GIs; i. e. the protection in a country (Home) of a GI of another country (Foreign), when the said GI had previously acquired generic status at Home (cf. : protection of Feta in the EU or of Champagne in Chile). The setting includes two countries (Home and Foreign); three varieties (Foreign GI-original goods, Home GI-variety goods and generics) and a continuum of heterogeneous consumers. Two regimes are analyzed: protection / no protection; in two scenarios for Foreign firms: perfect / oligopolistic competition. Only the equilibrium at Home is analyzed. Although a loss in global welfare is always expected when fewer varieties are available in a market, results suggest that industrialized Home countries, with sophisticated consumers and higher relative costs tend to lose less from protecting Foreign GIs than developing Home countries, where the opposite is true. With oligopolistic competition, GI firms become from differentiated from their closest competitor after protection (now generics), further stressing the competitive distortion; consumers with a low willingness to pay for origin and a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> for the GI-variety are the biggest losers. Regarding firms, however, contrary to the conventional wisdom, oligopolistic competition by Foreign firms leads to less stringent conditions for Home GI-varieties to compete, and does not affect generics. In effect, if after protection Home GI-varieties can successfully differentiate themselves from Foreign GI-original goods without the (unlawful) use of the GI label (either through the development of their own GI or through proper branding) and stay competitive, the scenario of oligopolistic competition from Foreign firms is more favorable to their development than the scenario of perfect competition. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{estimate}} the equity premium, {{it is helpful}} to use finance theory: not the old-fashioned theory that efficient markets imply a constant equity premium, but theory that restricts the time-series behavior <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> ratios, and that links the cross-section of stock prices {{to the level of the}} equity premium. Under plausible conditions, valuation ratios such as the dividend-price ratio should not have trends or explosive behavior. This fact can be used to strengthen the evidence for predictability in stock returns. Steady-state valuation models are also useful predictors of stock returns given the high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> persistence in <b>valuation</b> ratios and the difficulty of estimating free parameters in regression models for stock returns. A steady-state approach suggests that the world geometric average equity premium was almost 4 % at the end of March 2007, implying a world arithmetic average equity premium somewhat above 5 %. Both valuation ratios and the cross-section of stock prices imply that the equity premium fell considerably in the late 20 th Century, but has risen modestly in the early years of the 21 st Century. ...|$|R

40|$|External {{circumstances}} and internal bodily states often change and require organisms to flexibly adapt valuation processes {{to select the}} optimal action in a given context. Here, we investigate the neurobiology <b>of</b> context-dependent <b>valuation</b> in 22 human subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects made binary choices between visual stimuli with three attributes (shape, color, and pattern) that were associated with monetary values. Context changes required subjects to deviate from the default shape valuation and to integrate a second attribute in order {{to comply with the}} goal to maximize rewards. Critically, this binary choice task did not involve any conflict between opposing monetary, temporal, or social preferences. We tested the hypothesis that interactions between regions of dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; vmPFC) implicated in self-control choices would also underlie the more general function <b>of</b> context-dependent <b>valuation.</b> Consistent with this idea, we found that the degree to which stimulus attributes were reflected in vmPFC activity varied as a function of context. In addition, activity in dlPFC increased when context changes required a reweighting of stimulus attribute values. Moreover, the strength of the functional connectivity between dlPFC and vmPFC was associated with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> context-specific attribute <b>valuation</b> in vmPFC at the time of choice.

40|$|Asset {{securitisation}} {{represents an}} alternative risk management and refinancing method, which allows issues to convert classifiable cash flows from a diversified portfolio of pre-existing assets and receivables (liquidity transformation and asset diversification process) of varying maturity and quality (integration and differentiation process) into negotiable capital market paper, so-called "asset-backed securities" (ABS). Over {{the recent past}} ambivalence {{in the definition of}} capital adequacy for credit risk has particularly facilitated the development of loan securitisation as a refined "regulatory arbitrage tool". However, as impending regulatory change shifts the prime objective of securitisation to the efficient management of economic capital, procedural and substantive aspects of asset securitisation warrant closer inspection. The dissertation presents a comprehensive examination of the risk modelling, asset selection, optimal security design and competitive market pricing of asset-backed securities. We first provide an overview of the main characteristics of asset securitisation and explain its attendant benefits and drawbacks, especially as they pertain to the refinancing of illiquid asset exposures, such as SME-related payment obligations. Subsequently, we explain the gradual evolution of the regulatory treatment of asset securitisation adopted by the Basle Committee on banking Supervision {{in the wake of a}} general revision of the 1988 Basle Accord, which finally led to the adoption of the so-called Basle Securitisation Framework in 2004. We then present a single-factor, loss-based asset pricing model, which estimates the risk-neutral investment return of subordinated debt securities ("tranches") as leveraged contingent claims on a securitised reference portfolio of pooled credit exposures. We challenge common wisdom of robust statistics for the estimation of portfolio credit risk by adopting extreme value analysis, mainly because the leveraged exposure of securitised debt on fundamental asset value changes requires a better parametric specification of extreme quantiles to gauge unexpected loss. Based on the loss sharing between issuers and investors in a common security design, we examine how securitised asset exposure translates into investment risk of asset-backed securities. As a longitudinal extension to this valuation model, we also investigate the price dynamics of securitised debt. A multi-factor GARCH process is applied as an econometric specification of the heteroskedasticity of secondary market spreads of selected types of ABS transactions for valuation and forecasting purposes. In light <b>of</b> the substantial <b>valuation</b> uncertainty in securitisation markets, we conclude with a simple one-shot auction model, in which issuers maximise net payoffs from securitised debt under "winner's curse"-type underpricing as agency cost of adverse selection. In particular, we study how uninformed investment demand at varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> uncertainty affects the utility of endogenous price discovery by informed investors. Overall our synthesis of empirical and theoretical approaches yields instructive findings about important yet unexplored issues concerning the economic rationale of asset securitisation...|$|R
