5|$|Outside {{of string}} theory, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is used to}} understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists use to describe elementary particles. For example, gauge theories are a class of highly symmetric physical theories appearing in the standard model of particle physics {{and other parts of}} theoretical physics. Some gauge theories which {{are not part of the}} standard model, but which are nevertheless important for theoretical reasons, arise from strings propagating on a nearly singular background. For such theories, mirror symmetry is a useful computational tool. Indeed, mirror symmetry can be used to perform calculations in an important gauge theory in four spacetime <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> was studied by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten and is also familiar in mathematics in the context of Donaldson invariants. There is also a generalization of mirror symmetry called 3D mirror symmetry which relates pairs of quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions.|$|E

In the fi rst section of the study we develop three quantitative dimensions of diversity: the Total <b>Dimension</b> <b>that</b> measures horizontal and vertical representations, the Role-model <b>Dimension</b> <b>that</b> measures representation at the top level of the organisation, and the Services <b>Dimension</b> <b>that</b> measures the organisation’s ‘diversity sensitivity’. These three dimensions or measures were developed and critically discussed before being tested on Malmö city’s administration, i. e. the central offi ce and the health and social service supply...|$|R

25|$|All the {{properties}} of complex numbers {{can be derived from}} bivectors, but two are of particular interest. First as with complex numbers products of bivectors and so the even subalgebra are commutative. This is only true in two dimensions, so properties of the bivector in two <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> depend on commutativity do not usually generalise to higher dimensions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a component modeling space as {{a context for}} supporting component-based software development and accumulating component-related knowledge. The modeling space is structured in three dimensions: A representation <b>dimension</b> <b>that</b> ranges from the languages of problem domains to computer processor languages; a composition <b>dimension</b> <b>that</b> supports a repeating pattern of the wholepart, or system-component, hierarchy; and a generalization <b>dimension</b> <b>that</b> supports reuse of models and components. Also integrated into the modeling space are an interaction model of components and connectors, an approach to component specification, and a provision for relating models via mappings. Each of these elements is characterized as applying in a uniform way throughout the modeling space. ...|$|R

25|$|The Hausdorff {{dimension}} {{is useful for}} studying structurally complicated sets, especially fractals. The Hausdorff {{dimension is}} defined for all metric spaces and, unlike the dimensions considered above, can also have non-integer real values. The box dimension or Minkowski dimension is {{a variant of the}} same idea. In general, there exist more definitions of fractal <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> work for highly irregular sets and attain non-integer positive real values. Fractals have been found useful to describe many natural objects and phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Currently, negative-index {{metamaterials}} {{are being}} developed to manipulate electromagnetic radiation in new ways. For example, optical and electromagnetic properties of natural materials are often altered through chemistry. With metamaterials, optical and electromagnetic properties can be engineered by changing the geometry of its unit cells. The unit cells are materials that are ordered in geometric arrangements with <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> are fractions of the wavelength of the radiated electromagnetic wave. Each artificial unit responds to the radiation from the source. The collective result is the material's response to the electromagnetic wave that is broader than normal.|$|E

25|$|The {{thickness}} of the ammolite layer {{is also an important}} factor: after polishing, the ammolite is only 0.1–0.3millimeters thick. The rarest and most valuable are thick enough to stand alone, with only a thin portion of its original matrix (not exceeding 1.5mm); but the vast majority require some sort of supportive backing. Other treatments are also commonly undertaken; all other factors being equal, the less treatment an ammolite gem has received, the more valuable it is. Calibrated stones—that is, stones fashioned into standard <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> will fit most jewelry settings—may also command a higher price.|$|E
25|$|This {{series of}} {{evaluations}} is providing {{a mechanism to}} characterize in more precise terms exactly {{what is necessary to}} compute in meaning. As such, the evaluations provide an emergent mechanism to identify the problems and solutions for computations with meaning. These exercises have evolved to articulate more of the <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> are involved in our use of language. They began with apparently simple attempts to identify word senses computationally. They have evolved to investigate the interrelationships among the elements in a sentence (e.g., semantic role labeling), relations between sentences (e.g., coreference), and the nature of what we are saying (semantic relations and sentiment analysis).|$|E
25|$|The project allowed Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis {{to explore}} {{some aspects of}} the {{original}} films that they otherwise {{had not been able to}} in the past, such as the history of the Librarian ghost, and pursue some of the ideas left out of the original script, including the appearance of Ivo Shandor as Gozer, who was intended to appear in the finale of the film as the ghost of a man in a business suit. Other concepts used in the game, such as the alternate <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> open up during the latter half of the game, are based on the original Ghostbusters 3 concept Hellbent which was in development hell during the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Edwin Abbott Abbott, {{who worked}} for a period as a {{schoolmaster}} at Birmingham's King Edward's School, {{was the author of}} a wide range of writings dominated by his highly imaginative theological works. He is best known, however, for the classic early science fiction work , which combined a satirical treatment of contemporary social class structures and gender roles, a deep expression of his own religious principles, and a speculative exploration of geometrical <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> anticipates Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Louisa Baldwin wrote poetry, two collections of children's stories and four novels for adults; but is most highly regarded for her gothic ghost stories, which were originally published in literary magazines but were collected together and published as The Shadow on the Blind by John Lane in 1895.|$|E
25|$|Some {{approaches}} {{go further}} and propose continuously-varying <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> are not grouped into spectra or categories; each individual simply has {{a profile of}} scores across different dimensions. DSM-5 planning committees are currently seeking to establish a research basis for a hybrid dimensional classification of personality disorders. However, the problem with entirely dimensional classifications is {{they are said to}} be of limited practical value in clinical practice where yes/no decisions often need to be made, for example whether a person requires treatment, and moreover the rest of medicine is firmly committed to categories, which are assumed to reflect discrete disease entities. While the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual has an emphasis on dimensionality and the context of mental problems, it has been structured largely as an adjunct to the categories of the DSM.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, in the Banach–Tarski paradox {{the number of}} pieces is finite and the allowed equivalences are Euclidean congruences, which {{preserve}} the volumes. Yet, somehow, they end up doubling {{the volume of the}} ball! While this is certainly surprising, some of the pieces used in the paradoxical decomposition are non-measurable sets, so the notion of volume (more precisely, Lebesgue measure) is not defined for them, and the partitioning cannot be accomplished in a practical way. In fact, the Banach–Tarski paradox demonstrates {{that it is impossible to}} find a finitely-additive measure (or a Banach measure) defined on all subsets of a Euclidean space of three (and greater) <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> is invariant with respect to Euclidean motions and takes the value one on a unit cube. In his later work, Tarski showed that, conversely, non-existence of paradoxical decompositions of this type implies the existence of a finitely-additive invariant measure.|$|E

25|$|The contact graph of an {{arbitrary}} finite packing of unit balls is the graph whose vertices {{correspond to the}} packing elements and whose two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding two packing elements touch each other. The cardinality of the edge set of the contact graph gives the number of touching pairs, the number of 3-cycles in the contact graph gives the number of touching triplets, {{and the number of}} tetrahedrons in the contact graph gives the number of touching quadruples (in general for a contact graph associated with a sphere packing in n <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> the cardinality of the set of n-simplices in the contact graph gives the number of touching (n+1)-tuples in the sphere packing). In the case of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, non-trivial upper bounds on the number of touching pairs, triplets, and quadruples were proved by Karoly Bezdek and Samuel Reid at the University of Calgary.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} many {{improvements}} {{have been made}} in printing machines and many additions made to their already wonderful capacities. Chief amongst these are those embodied in the Intermittent and the Duplex machines. In the former any or all of the rollers may be moved out of contact with the cylinder at will, and at certain intervals. Such machines are used in the printing of shawls and sarries for the Indian market. Such goods require a wide border right across their width at varying distances sometimes every three yards, sometimes every nine yards and it is to effect this, with rollers of ordinary <b>dimensions,</b> <b>that</b> intermittent machines are used. The body of the sarrie will be printed, say for six yards with eight rollers; these then drop away from the cloth and others, which have up to then been out of action, immediately fall into contact and print a border or crossbar, say one yard wide, across the piece; they then recede from the cloth and the first eight again return and print another six yards, and so on continually.|$|E
25|$|Surveying is {{the process}} by which a {{surveyor}} measures certain <b>dimensions</b> <b>that</b> occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface {{in the form of a}} map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as geographic information systems. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, tramway tracks, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as harbors, before construction.|$|E
