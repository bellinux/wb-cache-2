30|$|Under energy constraints, the {{comparisons}} of average busy period, average idle period, average overhead, average energy level, average preemption, and average <b>battery</b> <b>switch</b> mode are in Figs.  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively. As we can see from these figures, our algorithm has the least preemption too. The {{reason is that the}} ASAP algorithm judges preemption after every execution time unit and our algorithm runs tasks concentratedly. When the energy is not enough, our algorithm concentrates all available relaxed time to harvest energy, which reduces the preemptions caused by lacking energy. Our algorithm reduces the <b>battery</b> <b>switch</b> mode, uses the relaxed time to harvest energy, and then maximizes the busy period and idle period. So, our algorithm provides higher energy level and decreases the energy constraints of the system. The overheads of all the above algorithms tend to be identical. Our algorithm keeps the battery being on charge or discharge mode all the time and has less <b>battery</b> <b>switch</b> mode than the ASAP algorithm.|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{deployment}} of electric vehicles (EV) has been recognised as a key element for establishing sustainable transport systems within countries. Research {{studies have been conducted}} to tackle challenges regarding the commercial introduction of EV. However, the current plug-in EV infrastructure poses operational limitations, causing users refusing to change from fossil-fuelled vehicles to EV. To eliminate the limitations of long charging time and huge infrastructure costs of the current EV models, an intelligent battery information management system (IBIS) is designed for supporting <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> logistics operations. The system shows the potential value of the <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> management and the minimization of the supply chain cost. A case study in launching the proposed model in Hong Kong is conducted. The result provides a practical solution to balance the level of battery charging efficiency in the battery management hub, service rate of <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> stations, and the inventory cost of holding batteries.

We conduct extensive computational experiments using both real world road network data and artificially generated road networks of various sizes and provide signifi- cant insights {{about the effects of}} driver preferences and the availability of <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> stations on the PHEV economics.

40|$|Abstract. The cycle {{performance}} and the capacity fading model of 18650 Li-ion batteries {{and the possibility of}} dual-battery switching technology applied in marine buoys were studied. The recycling capacity fading data of 18650 li-ion batteries were gained and the data were fit by Matlab cttool toolbox. A fitting curve more in line with the scatters was gained. The number of cycles was calculated when the battery capacity remaining 80 %. Then the normal working time and the working time using <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> theory of a buoy were calculated under that specific number of cycles. The results show that the 18650 li-ion battery capacity fading model adheres more to the power function model than linear function model.
