25|$|With the {{economic}} development from the 1960s, {{the value of the}} 500-won notes fell, resulting in a greater use of cashier's checks with higher fixed <b>denominations</b> as means <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> as well as an increased use of counterfeited ones. In 1970, the 100-won notes were replaced by coins, with the same happening to the 50-won notes in 1972.|$|R
40|$|Many economies, {{during the}} early stages of {{monetary}} development, experienced what appear to be sporadic relative shortfalls <b>of</b> small <b>denomination</b> means <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> These episodes have been broadly documented in the literature under the label of “shortages of small change. ” Sargent and Velde (2002), for example, review in great detail the evidence for Europe. Hanson (1979) provides an interesting survey of the evidence for the British colonies in North America. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present evidence of similar events occurring in the early monetary history of Argentina. The provision of small change in modern economies has become almost a nonissue. 1 In fiat money systems, the monetary authority controls the aggregate supply of monetary balances (<b>of</b> all <b>denominations)</b> and stands ready to exchange at par any denomination for an equivalent amount <b>of</b> any other <b>denomination.</b> It is, then, demand that determines the relative amounts <b>of</b> the different <b>denominations</b> that circulate in the economy. There are, of course, costs of providing the demanded amounts. Low-denomination coins tend to be relatively more costly to produce (at least, per unit of value). Yet, in general, governments in modern societies have considered these costs worthwhile...|$|R
50|$|Denomination is {{a proper}} {{description}} of a currency amount, usually for coins or banknotes. Denominations may also be used with other means <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> like gift cards. For example, five euros is the <b>denomination</b> <b>of</b> a five euro note.|$|R
50|$|When {{currency}} is stable, money can serve all four functions. When it is not, or when complex and volatile forms of financial capital are involved, some {{may wish to}} identify a single standard <b>of</b> deferred <b>payment</b> to avoid strategic behavior. Otherwise, for example, a debtor might try to select a standard <b>of</b> deferred <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> debt that is forecast to drop in value so the real value <b>of</b> his <b>payment</b> to the lender will be lower. The lender can avoid this by selecting a <b>denomination</b> <b>of</b> debt that is forecast to maintain its value.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, the {{emission}} {{was limited to}} $150,000,000 total face value between the new Legal Tender Notes and the existing Demand Notes. The Act also intended for the new notes {{to be used to}} replace the Demand Notes as soon as practical. The Demand Notes had been issued in <b>denominations</b> <b>of</b> $5, $10, and $20, and these were replaced by United States Notes nearly identical in appearance on the obverse. In addition, notes of entirely new design were introduced in <b>denominations</b> <b>of</b> $50, $100, $500 and $1000. The Demand Notes' printed promise <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> [...] "On Demand" [...] was removed and the statement [...] "This Note is a Legal Tender" [...] was added.|$|R
5000|$|Schedule 2 of the Government of Alderney Law {{provides}} that the States of Alderney may, by Ordinance, prescribe [...] "the legal currency and <b>denominations</b> <b>of</b> the legal currency, so however that that currency, and those denominations {{shall be the}} same in Alderney as in the United Kingdom; and prescribing those notes and coins the tender {{of which is a}} legal tender <b>of</b> the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> money".|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{designation}} {{of a particular}} form of money as legal tender means “that the designated money is valid payment for all debts {{unless there is a}} specific agreement to the contrary.” In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> (where the obligation to pay may arise {{at the same time as}} the offer <b>of</b> <b>payment).</b> For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest <b>denomination</b> <b>of</b> banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. Under the law, United States money as identified above is a valid and legal offer <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> for antecedent debts when tendered to a creditor. By contrast, federal statutes do not require that someone who is not a pre-existing creditor must accept currency or coins as payment for goods or services. Private businesses may formulate their own policies on whether to accept cash unless state law requires otherwise.|$|R

500|$|Mint Director James Pollock {{had been}} opposed to {{striking}} coins containing nickel but {{in view of}} the initial success of the copper-nickel three-cent piece, he became an advocate of striking five-cent pieces in the same metal.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a demographic {{model of the}} currency population by examining the birth and death rates <b>of</b> specific <b>denominations</b> <b>of</b> currency. This framework permits empirical estimation of the average lifetime of notes in circulation and hence the currency velocity (turnovers per year) <b>of</b> each <b>denomination.</b> The velocity <b>of</b> currency times the stock of currency produces estimates of the annual volume <b>of</b> cash <b>payments.</b> Since the volume <b>of</b> check <b>payments</b> (debits to checkable accounts) is regularly recorded, our estimates <b>of</b> cash <b>payments</b> {{can be used to}} estimate the total volume of transactions (MV) from the <b>payment</b> side <b>of</b> Fisher’s equation of exchange. The paper goes on to examine the “currency enigma” from the perspective of both “missing currency” and “missing payments”. The estimated volume <b>of</b> cash <b>payments</b> is so high when compared to personal consumption expenditures, that one is led to the conclusion that a large fraction of the US currency supply is held abroad, {{and that there is a}} sizable underground (unreported and perhaps unrecorded) economy in the United States. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article {{analyses}} {{the competition}} between cash and payment cards {{against the backdrop of}} the dual role of central banks- as issuers of cash and as institutions with a mandate to foster the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> systems in general. It is argued that this dual role results in a number of policy dilemmas, namely concerning pricing, traceability of banknotes and the choice <b>of</b> <b>denominations</b> <b>of</b> coins and banknotes. On a general level, the article argues that central banks should place greater emphasis on improving the efficiency <b>of</b> retail <b>payments</b> and less on protecting their self-interest. More concretely, the article repeats the suggestion- originally put forward in VAN HOVE & VUCHELEN (1996) - that the ECB should place the upper limit of its banknote series at EUR 50 instead of EUR 500. It is also argued that policy makers should explicitly foster the use of cost-based pricing and in particular create a legal environment that makes it possible for commercial banks to start using it...|$|R
