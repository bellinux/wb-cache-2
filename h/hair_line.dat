25|$|With orchid {{crossing}} {{coming to}} an end, Mead devoted more and more attention of the breeding of amaryllis (hippeastrum), being greatly helped by Nehrling, who had a fine collection and allowed Mead to take what he wanted {{in the way of}} pollen for his experiments. Specimens with just a <b>hair</b> <b>line</b> color around each petal were intercrossed to produce nearly white varieties with a narrow border around each petal. His hybrid red and white striped ‘Mead-strain’ amaryllis also became the bulb of choice for many American southern gardens in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Most hysterectomies in the United States {{are done}} via {{laparotomy}} (abdominal incision, {{not to be}} confused with laparoscopy). A transverse (Pfannenstiel) incision is made through the abdominal wall, usually above the pubic bone, as close to the upper <b>hair</b> <b>line</b> of the individual's lower pelvis as possible, similar to the incision made for a caesarean section. This technique allows physicians the greatest access to the reproductive structures and is normally done for removal of the entire reproductive complex. The recovery time for an open hysterectomy is 4–6 weeks and sometimes longer due to the need to cut through the abdominal wall. Historically, the biggest problem with this technique was infections, but infection rates are well-controlled and not a major concern in modern medical practice. An open hysterectomy provides the most effective way to explore the abdominal cavity and perform complicated surgeries. Before the refinement of the vaginal and laparoscopic vaginal techniques it was also the only possibility to achieve subtotal hysterectomy, meanwhile vaginal route is the preferable technique in most circumstances.|$|E

Parts of the images are framed, blocked out, or painted over, dividing and isolating the figures from each other. Set against a 1939 Chinese recording, “Parting at Yang Kwan,” Two Eastern <b>Hair</b> <b>Lines</b> is full of longing. It reflects on the unbridgeable distance between people and the difficulties of communication. As Woloshen writes in his description, “Sometimes the rifts between us are as wide as rivers, and sometimes as small as hair lines.” ...|$|R

25|$|Vancouver {{opened the}} season in San Jose. Jason Garrison, {{a member of the}} top power play unit, scored a goal to give the Canucks the lead. Vancouver {{eventually}} lost 4–1. Having Garrison play with the top unit was seen as a change in philosophy from the previous season. He was originally brought in to help with the Cauncks inconsistent power play, however he was played sparingly with the top unit and the team finished 22nd of 30 in the League for power play percentage. During the game, Alexandre Burrows blocked a slap shot on a penalty kill, and suffered a <b>hair</b> <b>line</b> fracture to his foot, forcing him to miss 12 games. The Canucks earned Tortorella his first win as head coach with a 6–2 victory over Edmonton in the second game of the season. Läck made his NHL debut in the third game against the Calgary Flames. Tortorella altered his lines to get the team going, including splitting up Henrik and Daniel Sedin, something rarely done by Vigneault. The Canucks eventually won the game 5–4 in overtime on a Santorelli goal. Despite giving up four goals, Läck earned praise for his performance.|$|E

50|$|If {{the skin}} defect does not exceed 3 cm in diameter, {{it can be}} closed primarily. If this is not {{possible}} without tension, the surrounding loose connective tissue can be undermined to attain more mobility. Different kinds of transpositions to close the defect with adjacent skin are possible: V-Y, Z, pinwheel flaps, advancement flaps, Orticochea flaps and rotation flaps. All these transpositions generate tension of the skin and may distort <b>hair</b> <b>lines.</b> A combination of the Orticochea and rotation flaps {{is illustrated by the}} pictures about the forehead defect.Another option is secondary healing, but this is aesthetically inferior to primary closure in hair bearing areas because of the resulting alopecia. If the scalp cannot be closed primarily and local reconstruction with hair bearing skin is needed because of <b>hair</b> <b>lines,</b> tissue expansion of hair bearing skin may be possible. The expansion process is uncomfortable on the short term, but long-term results are good.|$|R

The leaf bud has no gap at the base.|$|R
60|$|But, {{while the}} same in essence, angling has been {{improved}} by human ingenuity. The Waltonian angler, and still more his English predecessors, dealt much in the home-made. The Treatise {{of the fifteenth century}} bids you make your 'Rodde' of a fair staff even of a six foot long or more, as ye list, of hazel, willow, or 'aspe' (ash?), and 'beke hym in an ovyn when ye bake, and let him cool and dry a four weeks or more.' The pith is taken out of him with a hot iron, and a yard of white hazel is similarly treated, also a fair shoot of blackthorn or crabtree for a top. The butt is bound with hoops of iron, the top is accommodated with a noose, a <b>hair</b> <b>line</b> is looped in the noose, and the angler is equipped. Splicing is not used, but the joints have holes to receive each other, and with this instrument 'ye may walk, and there is no man shall wit whereabout ye go.' Recipes are given for colouring and plaiting hair lines, and directions for forging hooks. 'The smallest quarell needles' are used for the tiniest hooks.|$|E
60|$|At {{the instant}} Sandel arose, King was at him, {{but the two}} blows he {{delivered}} were muffled on the stalled arms. The next moment Sandel was in the clinch and holding on desperately while the referee strove to drag the two men apart. King helped to force himself free. He knew the rapidity with which Youth recovered, {{and he knew that}} Sandel was his if he could prevent that recovery. One stiff punch would do it. Sandel was his, indubitably his. He had out-generalled him, out-fought him, out-pointed him. Sandel reeled out of the clinch, balanced on the <b>hair</b> <b>line</b> between defeat or survival. One good blow would topple him over and down and out. And Tom King, in a flash of bitterness, remembered the piece of steak and wished that he had it then behind that necessary punch he must deliver. He nerved himself for the blow, but it was not heavy enough nor swift enough. Sandel swayed, but did not fall, staggering back to the ropes and holding on. King staggered after him, and, with a pang like that of dissolution, delivered another blow. But his body had deserted him. All that was left of him was a fighting intelligence that was dimmed and clouded from exhaustion. The blow that was aimed for the jaw struck no higher than the shoulder. He had willed the blow higher, but the tired muscles {{had not been able to}} obey. And, from the impact of the blow, Tom King himself reeled back and nearly fell. Once again he strove. This time his punch missed altogether, and, from absolute weakness, he fell against Sandel and clinched, holding on to him to save himself from sinking to the floor.|$|E
