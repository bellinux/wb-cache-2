25|$|The photons of a {{light beam}} have a {{characteristic}} energy proportional to {{the frequency of the}} light. In the photoemission process, if an electron within some material absorbs the energy of one photon and acquires more energy than the work function (the <b>electron</b> <b>binding</b> <b>energy)</b> of the material, it is ejected. If the photon energy is too low, the electron is unable to escape the material. Since an increase in the intensity of low-frequency light will only increase the number of low-energy photons sent over a given interval of time, this change in intensity will not create any single photon with enough energy to dislodge an electron. Thus, the energy of the emitted electrons does not depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but only on the energy (equivalently frequency) of the individual photons. It is an interaction between the incident photon and the outermost electrons.|$|E

40|$|Following {{the work}} of L. C. Allen, this work begins by {{relating}} the central chem. concept of electronegativity with the av. binding energy of electrons in a system. The av. <b>electron</b> <b>binding</b> <b>energy,</b> ̅χ, is in principle accessible from expt., through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estd. theor. ̅χ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines {{a new kind of}} energy decompn. scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the av. <b>electron</b> <b>binding</b> <b>energy,</b> the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H 2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of av. <b>electron</b> <b>binding</b> <b>energy,</b> multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chem. event.
