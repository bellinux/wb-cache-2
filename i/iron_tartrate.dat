40|$|Abstract. Several {{applications}} of <b>iron</b> <b>tartrate</b> and manganese tartrate compounds {{are reported in}} the literature. In the present investigation, we have grown pure and mixed iron (II) –manganese levo-tartrate crystals by single diffusion gel growth technique. Crystals with spherulitic morphology were harvested. The colourati n of the crystals changed from black to pinkish brown upon increasing the content of manganese in the crystals. The crystals were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, powder XRD, TGA, VSM and dielectric study. Crystal structures of different mixed crystals were studied. From TGA {{it was observed that}} on heating the hydr ed crystals became anhydrous and then converted into oxides. Paramagnetic nature of the crystals was revealed from VSM study. The vari tion of the dielectric constant with frequency was studied. The results are di-cussed...|$|E
40|$|Low {{concentrations}} of sodium phosphate {{are added to}} the boiler water of electric power stations as a means of controlling pH. Hideout is the phenomenon by which sodium phosphate is observed to be retained in the boiler during conditions of high temperature and pressure, only to be released back into the water upon cooling. All-volatile amine treatment is an alternative boiler water pH control method, without the same adverse effects, but it is not known if problems will arise from a changeover from congruent phosphate control to all-volatile treatment. The objective of this research was (i) to develop improved synthetic methods for the known hideout reaction products, maricite, NaFeᴵᴵPO₄, and sodium iron hydroxyl phosphate (SIHP), Na₃Feᴵᴵᴵ (PO₄) ₂•(Na₄/₃H₂/₃O), (ii) identify any ammonium-iron-phosphate reaction products that may form during the changeover, and (iii) measure the solubility of the hideout reaction product sodium-nickel-hydroxyl-phosphate (SNHP), Na₂Ni(OH) PO₄, so that a thermodynamic database can be derived. [...] The syntheses of the solid reaction products were carried out in 45 mL Parr 4744 Teflon-lined stainless steel reaction vessels which allowed in situ filtration of the products fi-om solution by inversion of the vessel, allowing the remaining solution to drain through a stainless steel mesh. Maricite was synthesized using previous established methods, whereas new methods for synthesizing SIHP from thermal decomposition of iron(III) nitrilotriacetic acid, and chelates, iron oxalate and <b>iron</b> <b>tartrate,</b> have been developed. A new hydrothermal synthesis for (NH₄) FeᴵᴵFeᴵᴵᴵ (PO₄) ₂ has been developed by thermally decomposing the chelate, <b>iron</b> <b>tartrate.</b> An additional ammonium reaction product, (NH₄) Feᴵᴵ(PO₄) •H₂O, was synthesized from the iron nitrilotriacetic acid complex. This provided a new synthetic route for this compound and proved that it formed under boiler conditions. The crystal structure of (NH₄) FeᴵᴵPO₄) •H₂O was also confirmed. The major sodium-nickel-phosphate reaction product Na₂Ni(OH) PO₄, was synthesized by two separate methods, fi-om nickel oxide and from the thermal decomposition of the nickel nitrilotriacetic acid complex. [...] Solubility studies of Na₂Ni(OH) PO₄, SNHP, were carried out in a modified 450 mL Parr 4562 stirred zirconium reaction vessel, according to the following reaction: [...] NiO(s) + 2 Na⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻ (aq) ⇋ Na₂Ni(OH) PO₄(s) [...] Kinetic experiments were conducted at 250 °C to ensure equilibrium had been reached and solubility data were collected over the temperature range 235 - 280 °C at a sodium/phosphate mole ratio of 2. 5 that had an initial phosphate concentration of 1. 5 mol•kg⁻¹. The MULTEQ chemical equilibrium program was used to calculate the composition {{concentrations of}} relevant species at each temperature studied, and experimental equilibrium constants were calculated from the activity coefficient model used in MULTEQ. The results were used to create a thermodynamic model for SNHP, consistent with the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers model for the standard partial molar properties of aqueous phosphate species. [...] In conclusion, the maricite synthesis reported by Quinlan (1996) was reproducible and SIHP was synthesized from similar conditions as the maricite synthesis and using the analogous chelate decomposition reaction. Ammonium-iron-phosphate reaction products can form under boiler conditions; those identified in this study were (NH₄) FeᴵᴵFeᴵᴵᴵ (PO₄) ₂ and (NH₄) Feᴵᴵ(PO₄) •H₂O. The major sodium-nickel-phosphate reaction product synthesized was Na₂Ni(OH) PO₄ and the data from this study and that previously reported for this reaction product, were used to create a thermodynamic model for this system, consistent with the database for sodium-iron hideout reactions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mechanical}} treatment on the phase transformation and sintering of nano-sized g-Fe 2 O 3 powder were studied. g-Fe 2 O 3 powder {{was obtained by}} calcining <b>iron</b> <b>tartrates</b> at 300 C. The mechanical treatment increased the contact areas in theg-Fe 2 O 3 powder, which acted as nucleation sites for the g!a-Fe 2 O 3 phase transformation, and resulted in lowering the transforma-tion temperature. The greater surface area and fine equiaxed particle of the milled powder thus obtained were due to the vermicular microstructure development being inhibited. Consequently, the samples with mechanical treatment after sintering developed a uniform fine-grained microstructure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIron {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common nutritional disorder worldwide with substantial impact on health and economy. Current treatments predominantly rely on soluble iron which adversely affects the gastrointestinal tract. We have developed organic acid-modified Fe(III) oxo-hydroxide nanomaterials, here termed nano Fe(III), as alternative safe iron delivery agents. Nano Fe(III) absorption in humans correlated with serum iron increase (P < 0. 0001) and direct in vitro cellular uptake (P = 0. 001), but not with gastric solubility. The most promising preparation (iron hydroxide adipate tartrate: IHAT) showed ~ 80 % relative bioavailability to Fe(II) sulfate in humans and, in a rodent model, IHAT was equivalent to Fe(II) sulfate at repleting haemoglobin. Furthermore, IHAT did not accumulate in the intestinal mucosa and, unlike Fe(II) sulfate, promoted a beneficial microbiota. In cellular models, IHAT was 14 -fold less toxic than Fe(II) sulfate/ascorbate. Nano Fe(III) manifests minimal acute intestinal toxicity in cellular and murine models and shows efficacy at treating iron deficiency anaemia. From the Clinical EditorThis paper reports the development of novel nano-Fe(III) formulations, with the goal of achieving a magnitude less intestinal toxicity and excellent bioavailability in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia. Out of the tested preparations, <b>iron</b> hydroxide adipate <b>tartrate</b> met the above criteria, and may become an important tool in addressing this common condition...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental study}} {{has been carried out}} to investigate the zincate immersion deposition process for 99. 99 %, 6061, and 356 -T 6 aluminum samples. In particular, the effect of <b>iron</b> and <b>tartrate</b> in the immersion bath, the aluminum surface preparation, and the relationship of the first immersion step to the second immersion step were investigated by chemical, electrochemical (polarization and rest potentials), and surface analytical scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) techniques. Eh-pH diagrams were constructed to determine the most stable zinc, iron, and aluminum species in solution. These diagrams predict that ferrous and ferric ions, as well as aluminum should form stable complexes with tartrate at the typical immersion deposition conditions (Eh - 0. 9 to - 1. 0 and pH 14 to 15). Experimentally, tartrate was found to enhance the dissolution rate of aluminum in highly caustic solutions. The addition of ferric chloride to the immersion bath produced coatings that were more crystalline, and also decreased the amount of hydrogen gas evolved in the second immersion step. The deposition of zinc and iron during the second immersion step was considerably less than that during the first immersion step. The second immersion coating became more adherent as the initial surface roughness decreased, and as grain size was increased the second immersion coating became thicker. For increasing grain size the micrographs for the first and second immersion coatings showed that the coatings became more localized. The second immersion coating thickness and morphology were also dependent upon several first immersion variables, such as bath temperature, immersion time and bath composition. Increased dissolution rates of aluminum in the first immersion produced thinner coatings with a finer crystallite growth. Increased bath temperature and increased first immersion time enhanced the dissolution rate of aluminum. The zinc coating slowed the dissolution rate of aluminum. When zinc was absent from the first immersion bath, the aluminum dissolution was much faster and resulted in thinner coatings upon subsequent second immersion. The molar ratio of zinc deposited to aluminum dissolved was a constant value of 1. 1 for both first and second immersions; the molar ratio was also constant for the different aluminum substrates examined in this investigation...|$|R
