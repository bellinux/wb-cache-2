40|$|In {{the context}} of Kolmogorov’s {{algorithmic}} approach to the foundations of probability, Martin-Löf defined {{the concept of an}} individual random sequence using the concept of a constructive measure 1 set. Alternate characterizations use constructive martingales and measures of impossibility. We prove a direct conversion of a constructive martingale into a measure of impossibility and vice versa, such that their success sets, for a suitably defined class of computable probability measures, are equal. The direct conversion is then generalized to give a new characterization of constructive dimensions, in particular, <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> Hausdorff dimension and <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> packing dimension, and their generalizations, <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> scaled dimension and <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> scaled strong dimension. ...|$|R

40|$|Is <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> trust {{really a}} trust? To answer this simple question, it is {{essential}} to understand the current meaning of <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> term. There are many different meanings applicable to this term. Different jurisdictions (and different cases within the same jurisdiction) emphasize different aspects of the term. Outside of the USA, where a purely remedial approach is taken to <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> trust and so it is not envisaged as a trust, then the question remains; is it a trust? In a very recent article Swadling has answered this question in the negative. However, his very important and well considered argument is not totally convincing. On balance, <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> trust, even <b>the</b> Australian remedial <b>constructive</b> trust, remains a trust. David Wrigh...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The n-ary {{first and}} second {{recursion}} theorems formalize two distinct, yet similar, notions of self-reference. Roughly, the n-ary first recursion theorem says that, for any n algorithmic tasks (of an appropriate type), there exist n partial computable functions that use their own graphs in the manner prescribed by those tasks; the n-ary second recursion theorem says that, for any n algorithmic tasks (of an appropriate type), there exist n programs that use their own source code in the manner prescribed by those tasks. Results include <b>the</b> following. <b>The</b> <b>constructive</b> 1 -ary form of the first recursion theorem is independent of either 1 -ary form of the second recursion theorem. <b>The</b> <b>constructive</b> 1 -ary form of the first recursion theorem does not imply <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> 2 -ary form; however, <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> 2 -ary form does imply <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> n-ary form, for each n ≥ 1. For each n ≥ 1, the not-necessarily-constructive n-ary form of the second recursion theorem does not imply the (n + 1) -ary form. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis is to analyse the {{influence}} of <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> vote of no confidence on the governments stability in post-communist countries. The thesis is divided into six chapters. The first three chapters deal on general basis with the importance of government stability for the functioning of a political regime, the principles of rationalized parliamentarism and the specific features of <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> vote of no confidence. The two following chapters focus on the political systems of Germany, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. Emphasis is put {{on the process of}} a constitutional text adoption, the different legal standards of <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> vote of no confidence and the moments in political development when this constitutional element played an important role. The government constitutional law bill, the adoption of which would mean to implement <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> vote of no confidence into the constitutional and political system of the Czech Republic, is not omitted either. The final chapter analyses, on the basis of four adopted expert studies, the real impact of <b>the</b> <b>constructive</b> vote of no confidence and the resulting differences among the selected post-communist countries, some of which have embodied this institution into their constitutional system and some have not...|$|R
