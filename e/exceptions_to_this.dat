5|$|Azhdarchids are now {{well-known}} {{as being}} terrestrial predators akin to ground hornbills or some storks, eating any prey item they could swallow whole. Two major <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> are Hatzegopteryx, {{which was a}} robustly built raptorial predator of relatively large prey, including medium-sized dinosaurs; and Alanqa, {{which may have been}} a specialist molluscivore.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} rock {{constituents}} of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> and their total amount in any rock is usually {{much less than}} 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.|$|E
5|$|All birds lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay {{camouflage}}d eggs. There are many <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that {{are victims of}} brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.|$|E

5|$|As another active seismic experiment, the jettisoned LM ascent stages on Apollo 12 {{and later}} {{missions}} were deliberately crashed on the Moon at known locations. The only <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> were the Apollo 13 LM which burned {{up in the}} Earth's atmosphere, and Apollo 16, where a loss of attitude control after jettison prevented making a targeted impact.|$|E
5|$|The contest usually {{features}} two presenters, {{one man and}} {{one woman}} (though the 2006, 2014, and 2015 contests were <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this),</b> who regularly appear on stage and with the contestants in the green room. The presenters are also responsible for repeating the results immediately after the spokesperson of each broadcaster to confirm which country the points are being given to.the spokespersons are giving the points in the arena stage.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the basic}} {{plan of the}} Western Chalukya style {{originated}} from the older dravida style, many of its features were unique and peculiar to it. One of these distinguishing features of the Western Chalukyan architectural style was an articulation that can still be found throughout modern Karnataka. The only <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> motif {{can be found in}} the area around Kalyani, where the temples exhibit a nagara (North Indian) articulation which has its own unique character.|$|E

5|$|Although both Futurama and The Simpsons {{were created}} by Matt Groening, overt {{references}} to the latter are mostly avoided in Futurama. One of the few <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> rule is the appearance of Blinky, a three-eyed orange fish seen on The Simpsons, as Fry is going through the tube. A running gag of the series is Bender's fondness for Olde Fortran malt liquor, named after Olde English 800 malt liquor and the programming language Fortran. The drink was first introduced in this episode and became so {{closely associated with the}} character that he was featured with a bottle in both the Rocket USA wind-up toy and the action figure released by Moore Action Collectibles.|$|E
5|$|Although most proteasomal {{substrates}} must be ubiquitinated {{before being}} degraded, {{there are some}} <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> general rule, especially when the proteasome plays a normal role in the post-translational processing of the protein. The proteasomal activation of NF-κB by processing p105 into p50 via internal proteolysis is one major example. Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to intrinsically unstructured regions, are degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. The most well-known example of a ubiquitin-independent proteasome substrate is the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Ubiquitin-independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported, although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Finally, structurally abnormal, misfolded, or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin-independent and 19S-independent degradation under conditions of cellular stress.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show {{a high level}} of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.|$|E

5|$|Each team is {{assigned}} one pick per round with the order based generally {{on the reverse}} order of finish in the previous season with {{the team with the}} worst record receiving the first draft slot. <b>Exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> are the Super Bowl participants from the previous season — the champion Baltimore Ravens were assigned the final draft slot and the runner-up New York Giants assigned the 30th slot in each round. The draft was broadcast on ESPN and ESPN2. Due to previous trades, the Dallas Cowboys and Tennessee Titans did not have selections in the first round. More than half of the players selected in the draft's first round (17 of 31) would eventually be elected to at least one Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|It has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n = 34, which is unusual for the genus Drosera {{and closer to the}} diploid {{chromosome number}} of the Venus flytrap (Dionaeamuscipula), another member of the Droseraceae. Variable chromosome counts for Dionaea from multiple studies include 2n = 30, 32, and 33. Of the Drosera species with known chromosome counts, most are a multiple of x = 10. Based on an extensive review of karyotype studies, the botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested that the base chromosome number for the genus could be 2n = 20, a number that many Drosera species share including the widespread D.rotundifolia. <b>Exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> base number include the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian Drosera, which have chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 6 to 64.|$|E
5|$|Most {{albatrosses}} {{range in}} the Southern Hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa and South America. The <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> are the four North Pacific albatrosses, of which three occur exclusively in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California and Alaska; and one, the waved albatross, breeds in the Galápagos Islands and feeds {{off the coast of}} South America. The need for wind to enable gliding is the reason albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher latitudes: being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely difficult. The exception, the waved albatross, is able to live in the equatorial waters around the Galápagos Islands because of the cool waters of the Humboldt Current and the resulting winds.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} {{legislation}} that has been interpreted <b>to</b> be an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> doctrine is , which authorizes federal courts to grant writs of habeas corpus, even after a state court has denied it.

5|$|Seven {{nonmetals}} {{exist as}} diatomic molecules in their standard states: hydrogen (H2); nitrogen (N2); oxygen (O2); fluorine (F2); chlorine (Cl2); bromine (Br2); and iodine (I2). They are generally highly insulating, highly electronegative, non-reflective gases, noting that bromine, a liquid, and iodine, a solid, are both volatile at room temperature. <b>Exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> generalised description {{occur at the}} boundaries of the category: hydrogen has a comparatively low electronegativity due to its unique atomic structure; iodine, in crystalline form, is semi-lustrous, and a semiconductor in the direction of its layers, both of these attributes being consistent with incipient metallic character.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders' mentality {{to imitate}} the customs from their Western European homelands meant that {{there were very few}} {{innovations}} developed from the culture of the crusader states. Three notable <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> rule are the military orders, warfare and fortifications. The Hospitallers (Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem) were founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade but added a martial element to its ongoing medical functions to become a much larger military order. In this way the knighthood entered the previously monastic and ecclestical sphere.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{woodpeckers}} {{varies from}} drab to conspicuous. The colours of many species {{are based on}} olive and brown and some are pied, suggesting a need for camouflage; others are boldly patterned in black, white and red, and many have a crest or tufted feathers on the crown. Woodpeckers tend to be sexually dimorphic, but differences between the sexes are generally small; <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> are Williamson's sapsucker and the orange-backed woodpecker, which differ markedly. The plumage is moulted fully once a year apart from the wrynecks, which have an additional partial moult before breeding.|$|E

5|$|There {{are some}} <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> general rule. Gallium and {{germanium}} have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively {{because of the}} d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity. The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, particularly when compared to thallium and bismuth, {{appears to be an}} artifact of data selection (and data availability)—methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.|$|E
5|$|This growing {{coalition}} {{expanded the}} potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers. The result was more alliance-seeking, {{on the part}} of both the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership (and protection) within that confederacy. While there were <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> (such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War), it was not until after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire, at least in certain locations. This shift mainly took place in parts of the west, such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|The agency's leader, NASA's administrator, is {{nominated}} by the President of the United States {{subject to approval}} of the US Senate, and reports {{to him or her}} and serves as senior space science advisor. Though space exploration is ostensibly non-partisan, the appointee usually is associated with the President's political party (Democratic or Republican), and a new administrator is usually chosen when the Presidency changes parties. The only <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> have been: James C. Fletcher, appointed by Republican Richard Nixon but stayed through May 1977 into the term of Democrat Jimmy Carter; Daniel Goldin, appointed by Republican George H. W. Bush and stayed through the administration of Democrat Bill Clinton; and Robert M. Lightfoot, Jr., associate administrator under Democrat Barack Obama kept on as acting administrator by Republican Donald Trump. Though the agency is independent, the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President.|$|E
