When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>position.</b> Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House.

5|$|After World War II ended, del Valle {{was ordered}} back to Headquarters Marine Corps, {{where he was}} named Inspector General, a {{position}} which he held until he retired on January 1, 1948. On February 19, 1946 New Mexico Senator Dennis Chavez and del Valle held a meeting with President Harry S. Truman in the White House, in which Chavez recommended del Valle <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of governor of Puerto Rico. From 1898 to 1942, the governors of the island were officials appointed by the President of the United States. Local Puerto Rican politicians, such as Luis Muñoz Marín, opposed the naming of del Valle in favor of Jesús T. Piñero; to which del Valle eventually asked President Truman to withdraw his name among those considered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>position.</b> The first civilian and native Puerto Rican appointed governor of Puerto Rico thus became Piñero in 1946. If Congress had not approved legislation in 1947 allowing Puerto Ricans to elect their own Governor, del Valle may have been appointed to the governorship.|$|E
