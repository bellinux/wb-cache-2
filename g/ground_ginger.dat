25|$|Dishes {{that were}} {{intended}} to be eaten as well as entertain {{can be traced back}} at least to the early Roman Empire. In his Satyricon, the Roman writer Petronius describes a dish consisting of a rabbit dressed to look like the mythical horse Pegasus. The function of the entremet was to mark the end of a course, met (a serving of several dishes), of which there could be several at a banquet. It punctuated each stage of a banquet, prepared the diners for the next serving and functioned as a conversation piece. The earliest recipe for an entremet can be found in an edition of Le Viandier, a medieval recipe collection from the early 14th century. It described a comparatively simple dish: boiled and fried chicken liver with chopped giblet, <b>ground</b> <b>ginger,</b> cinnamon, cloves, wine, verjuice, beef bouillon and egg yolks, served with cinnamon on top, and was supposed to be of a bright yellow color. An even simpler dish, like millet boiled in milk and seasoned with saffron, was also considered to be an entremet.|$|E

60|$|I {{refilled}} the stove, and, after reckless {{expenditure of}} Mr. Cashell's coal, drove some warmth into the shop. I explored {{many of the}} glass- knobbed drawers that lined the walls, tasted some disconcerting drugs, and, by {{the aid of a}} few cardamoms, <b>ground</b> <b>ginger,</b> chloric-ether, and dilute alcohol, manufactured a new and wildish drink, of which I bore a glassful to young Mr. Cashell, busy in the back office. He laughed shortly when I told him that Mr. Shaynor had stepped out--but a frail coil of wire held all his attention, and he had no word for me bewildered among the batteries and rods. The noise of the sea on the beach began to make itself heard as the traffic in the street ceased. Then briefly, but very lucidly, he gave me the names and uses of the mechanism that crowded the tables and the floor.|$|E

60|$|Amid {{the richer}} classes there was rude profusion, great joints ever on the sideboard, huge pies, beasts {{of the field}} and beasts of the chase, with ale and rough French or Rhenish wines to wash them down. But the very rich had {{attained}} to a high pitch of luxury in their food, and cookery was a science in which the ornamentation of the dish was almost as important as the dressing of the food. It was gilded, it was silvered, it was painted, it was surrounded with flame. From the boar and the peacock down to such strange food as the porpoise and the hedgehog, every dish had its own setting and its own sauce, very strange and very complex, with flavorings of dates, currants, cloves, vinegar, sugar and honey, of cinnamon, <b>ground</b> <b>ginger,</b> sandalwood, saffron, brawn and pines. It was the Norman tradition to eat in moderation, but to have a great profusion of the best and of the most delicate from which to choose. From them came this complex cookery, so unlike the rude and often gluttonous simplicity of the old Teutonic stock.|$|E

500|$|Cookery writer Laura Kelley {{notes that}} the 1774 edition {{was one of the}} first books in English to include a recipe for curry: [...] "To make a currey the Indian way." [...] The recipe calls for two small {{chickens}} to be fried in butter; for <b>ground</b> turmeric, <b>ginger</b> and pepper to be added and the dish to be stewed; and for cream and lemon juice to be added just before serving. Kelley comments that [...] "The dish is very good, but not quite a modern curry. As you can see from the title of my interpreted recipe, the modern dish most like it is an eastern (Kolkata) butter chicken. However, the Hannah Glasse curry recipe lacks a full complement of spices and the varying amounts of tomato sauce now so often used in the dish." ...|$|R

50|$|The cooking {{technique}} flourished {{because of}} its role in preserving meat in a tropical climate.

This spice mixture is called pemasak in Minangkabau. The spices, garlic, shallot, ginger, and galangal used in rendang have antimicrobial properties and serve as natural organic preservatives.

50|$|The wok {{is lowered}} {{from the stove}} on to a small wooden block to hold it. Once there, the mixing process which is the main feature of making Htamanè begins. Typically, three people (almost always stout men) are {{involved}} in the mixing process. Two men each with giant wooden spatulas resembling rowing paddles begin to mix the glutinous dough while a third coordinates the two spatulas, often by holding on to it near the pot. Towards the end of the mixing process, toasted sesame seeds, peanut, fried <b>ginger,</b> <b>ground</b> nut oil and fried coconut shavings are added to the wok. These ingredients become evenly mixed with the dough paste. Once a batch of Htamanè has been prepared, more fried coconut shavings, peanuts and sesame seeds are added as garnishes.|$|R
