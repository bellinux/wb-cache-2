30|$|As WAMS are {{now being}} {{deployed}} in quite a few power systems, PMU is playing an ever increasingly vital role in transient stability awareness [5]. A number of researches {{have been carried out}} to evaluate the transient stability by using PMU data. PMU trajectories based indicators are considered as the efficient estimators to understand dynamic features of power systems, especially during severe disturbances. For example, Alvarez et al proposed seven trajectory based indices which are suitable for fuzzy inference on real-time dynamic vulnerability [6]. A phasor data–based energy <b>function</b> <b>indicator</b> was developed in [7] aiming at monitoring the dynamic status of power transfer paths. A real-time transient stability assessment (TSA) method based on centre-of-inertia estimation from PMU records was reported in [8]. From voltage stability aspect, a coupled single-port model was applied to establish WAMS based assessment indicator [9]. Furthermore, Makarov et al. [10] presented a review on PMU-based TSA, offering a clear roadmap for further development.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} a {{brief review of}} twenty proposals for tourism regionalization of either a part of or the whole of Poland (or attempts to delimit the most attractive areas in terms of leisure), formulated between 1938 and 2012. It also analyses selected definitions of tourism regions and discusses the indicators which are proposed for the delimitation of tourism regions. Moreover, the paper attempts to indicate areas with the highest levels of tourism, in part modelled on Maria Mileska (1908 - 1988). It includes academic (precise) criteria for the designation of tourism regions. Some researchers ’ comment that Mileska’s work is (partially) outmoded not so much from the methods employed as in the number of tourism regions and the areas covered. This should be regarded as understandable given that this regionalization was formulated {{at the beginning of the}} 1960 s. Another important issue raised is the most recent tourism regionalization of Poland as prepared by Durydiwka.

40|$|This study {{clarified}} {{whether and}} when the blood-brain barrier in experimental brain metastases is impaired by using hydrosoluble sodium fluorescein (MW 376) as a blood-brain barrier <b>function</b> <b>indicator.</b> Cells from eight human tumor lines (four melanomas, two breast carcinomas, one colon carcinoma, and one renal carcinoma) were inoculated into the internal carotid artery of nude mice. Brain metastases {{at different stages of}} development were sampled and the permeability of the blood-brain barrier around the metastases determined. Histologic examination showed two patterns of tumor growth. In the first, tumor cells formed isolated, well-defined nodules in the parenchyma of the brain. In lesions smaller than 0. 2 mm 2, the blood-brain barrier was intact. In the second, small diffuse nests of tumor cells were distributed throughout the brain parenchyma. The blood-brain barrier was intact until the small tumor cell colonies coalesced to form large tumor masses. These results suggest that the permeability of the blood-brain barrier varies among different experimental brain metastases and that its function is related to the growth pattern and size of the lesions...|$|E

Subjects and methods. The volume of supervision has made 40 patients with arterial hypertension grade II hypertension, moderate — high risk. Patients of the first group received the combined therapy lisinopril — 20 mg and hydrochlortiazid — 12. 5 mg (iruzid — “Belupo”, Croatia), patients of the second group — therapy trandolapril and verapamil (tarka — “Ebbot”, Germany) — 2 and 180 mg accordingly. Results. The combined therapy trandolapril and verapamil renders more expressed antihypertension effect, than lisinopril and hydrochlortiazid. Appointment of the combined therapy promoted normalization morphofunctional heart indicators: in group of tarka ejection fraction (EF) has authentically increased by 4. 34 % (р = 0, 02), the thickness to a {{back wall of the}} left ventricle has decreased for 5. 8 % (р = 0, 03)  in group of iruzid.

40|$|This {{prospective}} study evaluated whether baseline cholesterol efflux {{is associated with}} future development of type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) in cardiovascular patients. We measured cholesterol efflux in all CORDIOPREV study (NCT 00924937) participants free of T 2 DM at baseline (n = 462) and assessed its relationship with T 2 DM incidence during a 4. 5 years of follow-up. Cholesterol efflux was quantified by incubation of cholesterol-loaded THP- 1 cells with the participants' apoB-depleted plasma. Disposition index was estimated as beta-cell <b>function</b> <b>indicator.</b> During follow-up 106 individuals progressed to T 2 DM. The cholesterol efflux/apoA- 1 ratio was inversely associated with T 2 DM development independently of traditional risk factors (model- 1, OR: 0. 647, 95 %CI: 0. 495 - 0. 846), and after additional adjustment for glycaemic parameters (model- 2, OR: 0. 670, 95 %CI: 0. 511 - 0. 878). When cumulative incidence of diabetes was analysed by quartiles of cholesterol efflux/apoA-I, incidence of T 2 DM was reduced by 54 % in subjects {{who were in the}} higher cholesterol efflux/apoA-I quartile compared to subjects in the lowest quartile (p = 0. 018 and p = 0. 042 for model- 1 and 2). Moreover, participants who were in the higher cholesterol efflux/apoA-I presented significantly higher disposition index (β = 0. 056, SE = 0. 026; p = 0. 035). In conclusion, HDL-cholesterol efflux normalised to apoA-I was inversely associated with T 2 DM development in cardiovascular patients. This association was independent of several T 2 DM risk factors, and may be related to a preserved beta-cell function. © 2017 The Author(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a {{sensitive}} biomarker {{for the detection}} of asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Since β-thalassemia major patients suffer from early diastolic dysfunction due to iron deposition of chronic blood transfusion, we tried to evaluate the correlation between the serum NT-proBNP level and the severity of LV diastolic dysfunction determined by echocardiography in these patients. Methods: Fifty β-thalassemia major patients with normal LV systolic function were studied by tissue Doppler echocardiography, and blood samples were taken {{at the same time to}} measure the serum NT-proBNP level. Using flow velocity through the mitral valve on the tissue velocity of the mitral annulus in early ventricular filling (E/E') as an LV diastolic <b>function</b> <b>indicator,</b> the patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1) no diastolic dysfunction (E/E' 15). Other variables assessed included sex, age, method of chelator therapy, and mean hemoglobin and ferritin levels for the past 2 years. Results: According to the echocardiographic findings of all the 50 patients (29 male and 21 female) with an age range of 11 - 35 years (mean = 17. 98 y), 46 % were classified in group 1, 54 % in group 2, and none in group 3. The NT-proBNP level was 1070 ± 566 ng/mL in group 1 and 974 ± 515 ng/mL in group 2. The t-test showed no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 in the NT-proBNP level (p value = 0. 536). Conclusions: Due to specific conditions in thalassemia major patients, the correlation between the serum NT-proBNP level and the severity of diastolic dysfunction seems to be not meaningful. </p...|$|E

With this limited participation of five countries, WGSFD 2013 failed to produce meaningful quantitative indices for DCF indicators 5, 6 and 7 under ToR a. Under ToR a, WGSFD 2013 developed a workflow and delivered necessary specifications of DCF indicators 5, 6, and 7 (for indicators see Commission Decision 949 / 2008 /EC). With regards to DCF indicator 6, WGSFD recommends to not apply the routines implemented in VMStools software package version 0. 64 and following versions for which the <b>function</b> <b>indicator</b> refers to its coding at version 0. 64. The proposed calculation of DCF indicator 6 is easily coded in either R or SAS and mapping examples are given. With regards to DCF indicator 7, WGSFD suggests to relate this indicator to habitat areas to indicate the amount of space untrawled on habitat level rather than for entire regions. In light of the OSPAR request regarding the mapping of fishing activities in all OSPAR regions, WGSFD extended its meeting for 2014 by 1 additional day to cover the expected workload. WGSFD intends to invite participants from Norway, Iceland, Faroe Islands and Greenland to share VMS and logbook data according to the adopted workflow to meet this request.
