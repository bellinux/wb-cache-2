40|$|An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) {{based on}} the Quick Propagation (QP) {{algorithm}} was {{used in conjunction with}} an experimental design to optimize the lipase-catalyzed reaction conditions for the preparation of a triethanolamine (TEA) -based <b>esterquat</b> cationic surfactant. Using the best performing ANN, the optimum conditions predicted were an enzyme amount of 4. 77 w/w%, reaction time of 24 h, reaction temperature of 61. 9 °C, substrate (oleic acid: triethanolamine) molar ratio of 1 : 1 mole and agitation speed of 480 r. p. m. The relative deviation percentage under these conditions was less than 4 %. The optimized method was successfully applied to the synthesis of the TEA-based <b>esterquat</b> cationic surfactant at a 2, 000 mL scale. This method represents a more flexible and convenient means for optimizing enzymatic reaction using ANN than has been previously reported by conventional methods...|$|E
40|$|Three ester-containing {{cationic}} gemini surfactants, {{two with}} decanoyl chains and either a three-carbon or a six-carbon spacer unit {{and one with}} dodecanoyl chains and a three-carbon spacer, were synthesized and evaluated. A corresponding monomeric cationic ester surfactant was used for comparison. This type of amphiphile, a so-called <b>esterquat,</b> is known to undergo rapid hydrolysis above the critical micelle concentration because of micellar catalysis. The <b>esterquat</b> geminis of this work {{were found to be}} much more susceptible to hydrolysis than the <b>esterquat</b> monomer. This difference is believed to be caused by anchimeric assistance by the second cationic headgroup in the gemini amphiphiles. However, there is no correlation between the rate of chemical hydrolysis and the rate of biodegradation. The monomeric <b>esterquat,</b> which is the most stable in the chemical hydrolysis experiments, was the only surfactant that passed the test for “readily biodegradable”. We also observed a considerable difference in the hydrolysis rate within the small series of gemini surfactants. The amphiphile with two decanoyl chains and a three-carbon spacer, N,N′-bis(2 -(decanoyloxy) ethyl) -N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl- 1, 3 -propanediammonium dibromide, had the fastest rate of hydrolysis. This surfactant also exhibited a considerably lower degree of micelle ionization than the other surfactants, which is believed to be due to the closer proximity of the charged groups on the micelle surface. A small distance between headgroups will give more pronounced neighboring group participation, accounting for the increased rate of hydrolysis. An interesting property of the surfactant that is the most susceptible to hydrolysis is that it gives rise to an extremly stable foam. We propose that the foam stability {{is a result of the}} partial hydrolysis of the surfactant generating sodium decanoate, an anionic surfactant, that forms a mixed film with the starting cationic gemini surfactant. It is known that mixed monolayers in which there is a strong attractive interaction between surfactant headgroups can lead to stable foams...|$|E
40|$|A new {{generation}} of liquid fabric softener tends to find the structural features and protect environment. These challenges need to utilize renewable natural feedstocks of vegetable oils, like kaffir lime etc. Treated kaffir lime leaves were extracted using integrated ultrasound-assisted extraction hydrodistillation (UAE-HD) at diverse frequencies and raw material to water ratio. <b>Esterquat</b> 2 HT- 75 agent was agitated with the removed kaffir lime oil containing citronellol,etc. as essential oil (KAFLO) at various process parameters in a bath stirrer flask. The highest kaffir lime leaves-liquid fabric softener (KALFASOF) yield (83 %) was found by the <b>esterquat</b> concentration of 2 M, treatment time of 45 min. and temperature of 100 o C. The characteristics of the formed KALFASOF test shown cationic content (10 %- 20 %), pH (4. 9 - 6. 4), interaction with hard water (Layer), emulsification with oil (D) and viscosity (116 cps— 357. 5 cps). The synthesized KALFASOF using separated plant oil by UAE-HD fulfilled the standards, {{and it can be}} a promising perspective for ecological friendly treatment carrying isolated components of sustainable materials...|$|E
40|$|This study {{involved}} maximizing {{the conversion of}} palm-based methyl palmitate to esteramine, an intermediate for <b>esterquats</b> via transesterification with triethanolamine, aided by Ca-Al as a heterogeneous catalyst in a 500 -ml reaction unit. The effect of process parameters on the conversion was investigated. The optimum process parameters, consisting of a mole ratio of 1. 8 : 1 (methyl palmitate:triethanolamine), 170 °C, 10 mbar, 0. 5 % catalyst and a duration of 2 h, produced more than 90 % conversion. Transesterification employing Ca-Al is more environmentally friendly than the conventional approach using sodium methoxide, simplifies the downstream separation process and the reusability of the catalyst was successfully tested in three subsequent cycles...|$|R
40|$|The {{aggregation}} {{behavior of}} ester-containing cationic gemini surfactants, dodecyl <b>esterquat</b> and dodecyl betainate geminis was investigated using tensiometry, conductometry, viscometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS), {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) and optical microscopy techniques in the absence and presence of NaBr electrolyte. The effect of chemical structure (i. e. the presence of ester bond in alkyl chain and the spacer length) on physicochemical properties and morphology of the surfactants was studied. The {{results showed that the}} ester-containing gemini surfactants formed spherical aggregates at dilute concentration (1. 1 %wt). At higher concentration (∼ 3. 7 %wt) the morphology is different depending on the position of ester bond in alkyl chain and the spacer length. Dodecyl betainate gemini with short spacer (s = 2) formed gel {{as a result of the}} formation of worm-like micelles in the aqueous solution. Dodecyl betainate gemini (s = 3) formed large vesicles enclosing smaller ones and dodecyl <b>esterquat</b> gemini (s = 3) formed both short cylindrical and spherical micelles. The salt addition induced the growth of micelles and in the case of dodecyl betainate (s = 2) gemini changed the morphology from worm-like micelles to lamellar phase...|$|E

In this study, simultaneous removal of Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) and Reactive Orange 16 (RO 16) via MEMF using palm based <b>esterquat</b> (PBE) as cleavable surfactant was investigated. The effect of surfactant concentration, operating pressure, and initial pH on the permeate flux, dyes and surfactant removal were discussed {{to assess the}} efficiency of MEMF process.

Fabrics will be softened with the conventional <b>esterquat</b> and with aminosilicone products having different molecular weights and mixtures of both. The anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate and non-ionic surfactant ethoxylated fatty alcohol were used. Both separately and in different proportions during the deposition trials were used.

40|$|Textile {{industry}} {{has grown to}} become one of the important industries in Malaysia. Reactive dyes are extensively used in textile industry since these dyes are being recognized as the best dyes used for dyeing cotton and cellulosic fiber. However, reactive dyes have low fixation rate and therefore facing the highest loss in dyeing process. Most of these dyes have complex structures that resist degradation in conventional wastewater treatment process. Due to these factors, it is an urgent need to find a way to preserve the environment while keeping the economic growing. In this study, the removal of C. I Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) and C. I Reactive Orange 16 using plant based <b>esterquat</b> surfactant (PBE and VBE) via micellar-enhanced microfiltration (MEMF) was investigated. FTIR confirms the existence of functional group and interaction occurred between dyes and <b>esterquat</b> surfactant. The Critical Micelle Concentration of PBE and VBE surfactant obtained was at range of 93 to 97 mg/L and 152 to 159 mg/L via conductivity method and UV-Vis spectrophotometric method. It is verified that the developed simplified method for analysis of surfactant concentration is in a good agreement with the existing colourimetric method. The micelles was formed in vesicle arrangement with particle diameter at size range from 140 to 1500 nm. The MEMF process was performed by using hydrophilic mixed cellulose esters microfiltration membrane (MCE) with pore size of 0. 45 |im. Results obtained in MEMF study using PBE and VBE surfactant shows almost complete decolourization of RB 5 and R 016 and confirms the existence of competitive binding interaction between RB 5 and R 016. The best operating condition obtained for MEMF was achieved at surfactant concentration of 2 CMC, pressure of 150 kPa, stirring speed of 200 rpm and initial pH of 5. 5 (unadjusted pH). Treatment of actual wastewater for source 1 via combined coagulation/flocculation process and MEMF process shows final treated wastewater achieved more than 80 % removal of colour, COD, suspended solid(SS) and turbidity using PBE surfactant, however for VBE surfactant only the colour and COD achieved more than 80 %. It is proved that MEMF using biodegradable plant based <b>esterquat</b> has a great potential to become a new green technology for removing reactive dyes from textile wastewater. The overall percentage error for resistances and permeate flux obtained in Resistance in series (RS) model is within ± 20 %), indicating that all the experimental data were close to RS model data. Therefore this study proved that Resistance-in-series (RS) model is useful in predicting and quantifying the flux decline and resistance occurred in MEMF process...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project concerns investigations of ester-containing cationic gemini surfactants (<b>esterquat</b> and betaine ester types). These dimeric surfactants are {{compared with their}} monomeric counterparts. Series of both stable and ester-containing cationic gemini and monomeric surfactants were synthesized and their physical-chemical properties were investigated. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) values of the ester-containing gemini surfactants were generally 10 - 20 times smaller {{than those of the}} corresponding monomers. The alkyl chain length was decisive of the CMC while the length and the nature of spacer did not affect the CMC much. The low CMC of the gemini surfactants resulted in very high efficiency in covering surfaces in adsorption experiments, in stabilizing emulsions and foams, and in solubilizing hydrophobic dyes. The micellar aggregation number of the surfactants was determined with steady state and with time-resolved fluorescence quenching. Based on calculations of diffusion coefficients obtained from NMR measurements, a growth of the micelles with increasing surfactant concentration was observed for some of the gemini surfactants and a structure of interdigitated micelles was proposed for all the geminis. Studies of the chemical hydrolysis showed that the betaine ester type surfactants were much more susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis than the <b>esterquat</b> type surfactants. It was also found that the ester-containing geminis hydrolyzed more readily than the ester-containing monomeric surfactants, which was attributed to an anchimeric assistance by the second quaternary ammonium head group. In contrast to the results from the chemical hydrolysis the monomeric ester-containing surfactants biodegraded faster than the corresponding gemini surfactants. The low rate of biodegradation of the ester-containing geminis was found to be due to the dicationic species formed on hydrolysis of the two ester bonds being very resistant to further biodegradation...|$|E

40|$|<b>Esterquat</b> {{cationic}} surfactant {{was considered}} as {{a new type of}} biodegradable material utilized as a textile softening agent. In this work, cationic lauric ester quaternary ammonium salt (N-(2 -hydroxyl- 3 -lauryloyloxypropyl) dimethyldodecylammonium chloride (HDAC)) was obtained via reaction between lauric acid and N-(2, 3 -epoxypropyl) dodecyldimethyl ammonium chloride (DCSA) synthesized from dodecyl dimethylammonium (DTA) and epichlorohydrin (EPIC). The optimum synthesis conditions for DCSA were found as mixing the same amount of DTA and EPIC in acetone at 25 ℃ for 24 h. The crude DCSA was subsequently re-crystallized, prior to the reaction with lauric acid at the same amount for 8 h at 60 ℃. Pure HDAC was consequently prepared after refrigeration. The critical micelle concentration and surface tension of the quatester surfactant HDAC were determined respectively. The structure of HDAC was measured using infrared spectroscopy. The softening property of HDAC was also present compared to the pristine cotton fabric. 3 page(s...|$|E
