These entailed: a set of <b>item</b> <b>definitions</b> piloted for high comprehension; adequate statistical control for confounding influences by scene content and user experience; a substantially sized, highly varied image database; and the employment of statistical instruments to formally test for nonlinear relationships. An ordinal mixed effects model provides convergent evidence for our hypothesis that each of predictors in the preference matrix is independently predictive of scene aesthetics. In addition, we find support for an interaction between the constructs of Coherence and Complexity and show that levels of both natural and built character, as well as familiarity, are uniquely predictive of scene attractiveness. The present findings underline the role of the preference matrix as a potential tool in informing evidence-based design...|$|E

In {{this study}} we {{describe}} {{the development of a}} short, easy-to-use questionnaire to measure postoperative recovery and evaluate its content validity and intra-patient reliability.    The questionnaire is designed to evaluate the progress of postoperative recovery and the long-term follow-up of possible effects of interventions during recovery. Method. The study involved four steps. 1) A conceptualisation and <b>item</b> <b>definitions</b> were based on a theoretical framework and a description of patients´ postoperative recovery from the perspective of patients, registered nurses and surgeons. 2) Content validity of items was tested through expert judgements. 3) A test run of the questionnaire was performed to confirm its feasibility and workload requirement. 4) The stability of the questionnaire was evaluated through intra-patient reliability assessment. Results. As a result of the operationalisation process of the concept postoperative recovery, five dimensions (physical symptoms, physical functions, psychological, social, activity) and 19 items were identified. Each item was formulated as a statement in the questionnaire. Content validity was judged to be high. After the pre-test of the questionnaire a revision with refinements in the layout was made. The vast majority of items showed a high level of intra-patient reliability. Conclusion.

40|$|Background: Anxiety {{disorders}} {{are some of}} the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, have early onset, are chronic and can cause functional impairment. It is, therefore, crucial to establish an accurate diagnosis for treatment and research purposes. Objective: To test the validity and reliability of the W. H. O. Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychia-try (SCAN Thai Version) : Anxiety Disorders Section. Material and Method: The linguistic clarity of the psychiatric schedules for Thais was tested by psychiatrists from the country’s four regions. The psychiatrists were competent in the use of the schedules and their under-lying objectives. Then between October 2004 and August 2005, Reliability of SCAN: anxiety disorder section was tested among 30 participants, including patients with anxiety disorders and normal volunteers. Results: Based on reactions from Thais and consultations from competent psychiatrists, content validity was established. The duration of interviews for anxiety disorders section averaged 45. 1 min (SD = 13. 5). The reliability determined by Cohen’s kappa coefficient for the 83 items that related to anxiety disorders in the SCAN were in Section 3, 4, 5. This overall inter-rater reliability was 0. 79 (SD = 0. 22), which were in substan-tial level of agreement. The overall intra-rater reliability was rated by the same psychiatrist 2 weeks apart. The result was 0. 84 (SD = 0. 21), which was near perfect agreement.

It is not, however, always possible to collect {{quality of life}} data by self-report even with adaptations for people with cognitive or communication impairments. A new proxy-report version of the Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit (ASCOT) measure of social care-related quality of life was developed to address the issues of wider inclusion of people with cognitive or communication difficulties who may otherwise be systematically excluded. The development of the proxy-report ASCOT questionnaire was informed by literature review and earlier work that identified the key issues and challenges associated with proxy-reported outcomes. Methods: To evaluate the acceptability and content validity of the ASCOT-Proxy, qualitative cognitive interviews were conducted with unpaid carers or care workers of people with cognitive or communication impairments. The proxy respondents were invited to ‘think aloud’ while completing the questionnaire. Follow-up probes were asked to elicit further detail of the respondent’s comprehension of the format, layout and content of each item and also how they weighed up the options to formulate a response. Results: A total of 25 unpaid carers and care workers participated in three iterative rounds of cognitive interviews. The findings indicate that the items were well-understood and the concepts were consistent with the <b>item</b> <b>definitions</b> for the standard self-completion version of ASCOT with minor modifications to the draft ASCOT-Proxy. The ASCOT-Proxy allows respondents to rate the proxy-proxy and proxy-patient perspectives, which improved the acceptability of proxy report. Conclusions: A new proxy-report version of ASCOT was developed with evidence of its qualitative content validity and acceptability. The ASCOT-Proxy is ready for empirical testing of its suitability for data collection as a self-completion and/or interview questionnaire, and also evaluation of its psychometric properties...|$|E
40|$|Histopathology is {{potentially}} an important outcome measure in UC. Multiple histological disease activity (HA) indices, including the Geboes score (GS) and modified Riley score (MRS), have been developed; however, the operating properties of these instruments are not clearly defined. We assessed the reproducibility of existing measures of HA. Five experienced pathologists with GI pathology fellowship training and expertise in IBD evaluated, on three separate occasions {{at least two}} weeks apart, 49 UC colon biopsies and scored the GS, MRS and a global rating of histological severity using a 100  mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The reproducibility of each grading system and for individual instrument items was quantified by estimates of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) based on two-way random effects models. Uncertainty of estimates was quantified by 95 % two-sided CIs obtained using the non-parametric cluster bootstrap method. Biopsies responsible for the greatest disagreement based on the ICC estimates were identified. A consensus process was used to determine the most common sources of measurement disagreement. Recommendations for minimising disagreement were subsequently generated. Intrarater ICCs (95 % CIs) for the total GS, MRS and VAS scores were 0. 82 (0. 73 to 0. 88), 0. 71 (0. 63 to 0. 80) and 0. 79 (0. 72 to 0. 85), respectively. Corresponding inter-rater ICCs were substantially lower: 0. 56 (0. 39 to 0. 67), 0. 48 (0. 35 to 0. 66) and 0. 61 (0. 47 to 0. 72). Correlation between the GS and VAS was 0. 62 and between the MRS and VAS was 0. 61. Although 'substantial' to 'almost perfect' ICCs for intrarater agreement were found in the assessment of HA in UC, ICCs for inter-rater agreement were considerably lower. According to the consensus process results, standardisation of <b>item</b> <b>definitions</b> and modification of the existing indices is required to create an optimal UC histological instrumen...|$|E

40|$|With the {{upcoming}} introduction of ISO DIS 26262 the awareness for safety in automotive systems has relumed. The standard describes a safety process {{starting with the}} <b>Item</b> <b>Definition</b> and with a Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (H+R). Hazards and their related risks affect all manufacturers in the same way. Hence, a common understanding and appraisal of Hazards should be established in a systematic way. Therefore, comparability, and consistency among H+Rs of different persons, different groups or even different companies should be established. Furthermore, {{the consistency of the}} <b>Item</b> <b>Definition,</b> the H+R, and following safety engineering activities has to be assured. The challenge is that H+Rs are solely based on creativity techniques, which produce an informal representation of information (usually an Excel sheet). This makes it hard to impossible to systematically analyse, compare, and reuse H+R results or to ensure the consistency in a holistic safety engineering process without a significant effort. Numerous methods, and techniques for formalisations und structuring of processes and artefacts in safety critical development exist, but most of those deal with challenges arising once a hazard is defined and one is interested in its origin, or its mitigation strategy. The research and practical approaches to support the prerequisite for all the other techniques, the hazard analysis and risk assessment, is still weak. Therefore, SAHARA's goal is to close this gap by providing a more formal and semantically enriched approach for defining hazards and assessing their risks. The condensed information necessary form ISO DIS 26262 point of view is (1) the situation analysis (2) hazard identification and analysis, and (3) a classification of the contributing factors exposure, severity, and controllability, which results in an ASIL assignment for each hazard. SAHARA yields the benefit of producing machine processable artefacts, and therefore enables comparability, consistency, reusability for increasing the confidence, quality, and efficiency of H+Rs...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesCase {{volume in}} cardiac surgery {{has been a}} concern since the term “the {{occasional}} open heart surgeon” was used more than 40 years ago, indicating one who performs cardiac surgery infrequently. MethodsRisk-adjusted operative mortality (in-hospital or 30 -day mortality) for isolated coronary artery bypass grafting procedures reported to the California CABG Outcomes Reporting Program for 2003 – 2004 was determined by surgeon and by hospital. Standard Society of Thoracic Surgeons <b>item</b> <b>definitions</b> were used. A total of 49, 421 coronary artery bypass grafting (40, 377 isolated) procedures were performed by 302 surgeons at 121 hospitals. Low-volume surgeons (n = 117) were defined as performing a total of less than 1 coronary artery bypass grafting (isolated or nonisolated) procedure per week at all hospitals (mean ± standard deviation, 22 ± 15 /y). High-volume surgeons (n = 185) performed a total of 1 or more cases per week (mean ± standard deviation, 120 ± 62 /y). Logistic regression and hierarchic analysis were used to compare volume cohorts. ResultsThe overall risk-adjusted mortality rate was 3. 62 % for low-volume and 3. 02 % for high-volume surgeons. Analysis by surgeon per hospital produced 610 surgeon–hospital pairs. The lowest risk-adjusted mortality rates were found among surgeons performing more than 1 procedure per week at a single hospital (2. 70 %). When high-volume surgeons performed less than 1 procedure per week at a hospital, their mortality rates {{were similar to those}} of low-volume surgeons (3. 39 %– 4. 11 %). High-volume surgeons performing procedures at multiple sites had higher mortality than high-volume surgeons working at a single institution. ConclusionA high-volume surgeon becomes an “occasional open heart surgeon” when working at multiple hospitals and performing a small volume of procedures at some of them. This study suggests that volume is not as important as processes of care in determining outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting procedures and that system factors might be more important to outcomes than surgeon experience...|$|E

Methods: To illustrate the impact of using only USDA Standard Reference- 24 to perform nutrient analyses of the BSQ, we populated two nutritional databases. The first database included only BSQ foods whose nutrient profiles were available from USDA SR- 24. The second database included nutrient profiles obtained from USDA SR- 24 augmented with data from other databases, food manufacturers, and scientific publications. Nutritional analyses of the BSQ were performed separately for each database, and mean estimates for energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate were compared. We also compared the nutritional databases by selecting a single food to define the nutrient profile of each line item, and subsequently by selecting multiple foods to define line items. Results: Comparing BSQ nutritional analysis using only information from USDA-SR 24 vs. analysis using this information augmented with other sources revealed minor differences (approximately 0 - 1 %) for mean energy and macronutrients in 13 of 19 line items. However, deviations up to 100 % with respect to macronutrient composition were observed for other line items including fruit drinks, flavored waters, and frozen desserts. Nutritional analysis using single vs. multiple foods to define line items was similar, although significant deviations (up to 100 % were observed for various line items such as candies, cookies, and fruits. Significance: If USDA SR- 24 is the sole source of food composition data, the accuracy of nutritional assessments could be compromised, potentially leading to underestimating effects of sweetened beverages and snack foods on nutritional status and energy balance. Understanding how food composition data and line <b>item</b> <b>definitions</b> impact the performance of FFQs may improve the accuracy of dietary assessment tools, and advance understanding {{of the effects of}} foods on nutritional status...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The use of 4 D {{simulations}} {{within the}} construction field is growing, however, its application when carrying out true collaborative planning {{has not yet}} been fully realised. It is postulated that 4 D models are currently utilised as a planning review tool, rather than integral to the initial construction planning process and do not fully support multidisciplinary collaborative construction planning by the various teams involved. Targeting this problem, a novel approach of interactive definition through a distributed environment is proposed, thus allowing interactive collaboration to create the construction plan and the subsequent 4 D simulation directly from the unique 3 D model. Based on a review of current approaches, a detailed comparison of current 4 D creation methods and recent research initiatives, the interactive definition method is proposed and developed. This approach supports the planning process by providing a unique 3 D model input, which can be manipulated using effective user-system interaction leading to comprehensive simulation <b>item</b> <b>definition.</b> The provision of this capability through a local and wide area network provides a collaborative planning workflow thus supporting collaboration and social interaction.

Our objective was to develop a common autoin flammatory disease damage index (ADDI) for familial Mediterranean fever, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, tumour necrosis factor receptor- associated periodic fever syndrome and mevalonate kinase de ficiency. Methods We developed the ADDI by consensus building. The top 40 enrollers of patients in the Eurofever Registry and 9 experts from the Americas participated in multiple rounds of online surveys to select <b>items</b> and <b>definitions.</b> Further, 22 (parents of) patients rated damage items and suggested new items. A consensus meeting was held to refine the <b>items</b> and <b>definitions,</b> which were then formally weighted in a scoring system derived using decision-making software, known as 1000 minds. Results More than 80 % of the experts and patients completed the online surveys. The preliminary ADDI contains 18 items, categorised in the following eight organ systems: reproductive, renal/amyloidosis, developmental, serosal, neurological, ears, ocular and musculoskeletal damage. The categories renal/amyloidosis and neurological damage were assigned the highest number of points, serosal damage the lowest number of points. The involvement of (parents of) patients resulted in the inclusion of, for example, chronic musculoskeletal pain.

As this was retrospective and explorative in nature, the study was performed in two stages, the initial stage where the researcher examined critically routinely collected data that is needed to support a cancer registry as well as assessed data on cancer that were obtained from Al Mafraq Hospital records. The final stage took place in Al Ain Medical District where detailed study of the existing practice with respect to cancer registration were undertaken in respond to a request form Ministry of Health, data on cancer were obtained from health care services and cancer registry records. Other information was obtained from key officials and health professionals in the district using qualitative methods. The initial stage showed that this was the first study of this kind in the United Arab Emirates and that cancer data production and recording is a complex intervention, where health and health related professionals and patients are involved. It also revealed that the key professionals were supportive to the study and showed positive attitude. The initial study indicated that there was deficiency in the data collected routinely as well as there was no cancer registry in Al-Mafraq Hospital. Furthermore, the data collected from medical record witnessed deficiency in their completeness and quality. Lack of education and training related to cancer data handling were observed during the fieldwork. The assessment of the population data sources indicated that there was no single data source that might provide a comprehensive and accurate data regarding Al Ain population.
