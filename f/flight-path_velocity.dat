40|$|Simple {{approximate}} {{solutions are}} derived for {{the relationships between}} the rotor thrust and <b>flight-path</b> <b>velocity</b> components and the rotor blade angle, torque, and in-plane forces. These approximate solu-tions, based upon the assumption of a triangular distribution of blade circulation and a parabolic variation of blade-element profile drag with lift, are sufficiently accurate for preliminary calculations and the determination of the equilibrium angle of attack and lateral tilt of the tip-path plane. A set of more exact blade-element equations is then derived giving the relations between the thrust and <b>flight-path</b> <b>velocity</b> components and the equilibrium blade angles, torque, and in-plane forces and moments. Neither the blade-element nor the approximate solutions are dependent upon the usual approximations that the inflow angle and blade angle of the blade elements are small angles. Thus the present equations should be useful for convertaplane as well as helicopter calculations...|$|E

40|$|National Laboratory of Space Intelligent Control at the Beijing Institute of Control Engineering [XDHT 2011238 A]This paper {{focuses on}} the {{tracking}} problem for airbreathing hypersonic vehicles, and proposes a new control method {{on the basis of}} not canceling, but using, aeropropulsive, as well as elevator-to-lift, couplings to design controllers without strategically avoiding or reducing the nonminimum-phase characteristic. The controllers and the external reference trajectories are simultaneously obtained by solving a system of linear algebraic equations. The altitude error is shown to be asymptotically stable. The <b>velocity,</b> <b>flight-path</b> angle, angle-of-attack, and pitch-rate errors all exponentially converge to zero with the proposed tracking controllers. The suppression of the flexible dynamics is achieved by integrating the new control method with H-infinity control. To enhance the robustness of the controllers with respect to the uncertainties of the aerodynamic parameters, a nonlinear disturbance observer is proposed to estimate the variations of the aerodynamic parameters for airbreathing hypersonic vehicles during cruise flight...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a reconfigurable Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) controller for the Boeing 747 - 100 / 200 longitudinal axis in the Up-and-Away flight regime. The control objectives are to obtain decoupled <b>flight-path</b> angle and <b>velocity</b> command tracking and achieve good disturbance rejection characteristics during normal operation and in the presence of an elevator fault. The LPV controller is synthesized using a quasi-LPV model of the aircraft longitudinal axis based on Jacobian Linearizations. The controller schedules on three parameters: flight altitude and velocity, which are available as measurements, and a fault identification signal generated by a fault detection and isolation (FDI) algorithm. During normal flight operations, the LPV controller uses the elevators and thrust for ight maneuvers. The stabilizer is only used to trim the aircraft. Three elevator fault scenarios are contemplated - loss-in-effectiveness, lock and float. The proposed control strategy uses the stabilizer (normally used for trim purposes only) as the alternative longitudinal control surface. Simulation results with elevator hydraulic failures in a real accident scenario show that the reconfigurable controller stabilizes the faulted system with a pre-designed reduction in the tracking responsiveness. The reconfigured LPV controller also exhibits good disturbance rejection properties...|$|R
