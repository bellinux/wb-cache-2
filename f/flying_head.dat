25|$|Check hook : A check hook is {{employed}} to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part {{consists of a}} regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking {{it has been said}} that there is no such thing as a check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past. Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport. Floyd Mayweather, Jr. employed the use of a check hook against Ricky Hatton, which sent Hatton <b>flying</b> <b>head</b> first into the corner post and being knocked down.|$|E
2500|$|The HDD's {{spindle system}} relies on air density inside the disk {{enclosure}} {{to support the}} heads at their proper flying height while the disk rotates. HDDs require a certain range of air densities in order to operate properly. The connection to the external environment and density occurs through a small hole in the enclosure (about 0.5mm in breadth), usually with a filter on the inside (the breather filter). If the air density is too low, then {{there is not enough}} lift for the <b>flying</b> <b>head,</b> so the head gets too close to the disk, and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss. Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high-altitude operation, above about [...] Modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment. Breather holes can be seen on all disk drives – they usually have a sticker next to them, warning the user not to cover the holes. The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too, being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters. This air passes through an internal recirculation (or [...] "recirc") filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture, any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure, and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation. Very high humidity present for extended periods of time can corrode the heads and platters.|$|E

50|$|The <b>flying</b> erase <b>head</b> is {{so-called}} {{because an}} erase head {{is mounted on}} the video head drum and rotates around {{in the same manner}} as the video heads. In the record mode, the erase head is active and erases the video precisely down to the recorded video fields. The <b>flying</b> erase <b>head</b> runs over the tape and the video heads record the signal virtually instantly after the <b>flying</b> erase <b>head</b> has passed.|$|R
6000|$|When {{this was}} finished, both {{proceeded}} {{to the front}} door, which Raeburn cautiously opened to observe the street. This was apparently clear of passengers; for he suddenly seized Harry by the nape of the neck, and holding his face downward {{so that he could}} see nothing but the roadway and the doorsteps of the houses, pushed him violently before him down one street and up another for the space of perhaps a minute and a half. Harry had counted three corners before the bully relaxed his grasp, and crying, [...] "Now be off with you!" [...] sent the lad <b>flying</b> <b>head</b> foremost with a well-directed and athletic kick.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course you}} know a cannon down there would be quite light. Even in shallow water, where men go down with a diving-dress, they grow so light {{that they have to}} hang weights about their necks, and have their boots loaded with twenty pounds of lead--as I know to my sorrow. And with all this, and the helmet, which is heavy enough of itself to any one up here in the thin air, they are carried about like gossamers, and have to take every kind of care not to be upset and stood upon their heads. I went down once in the dress, and speak from experience. But if we could get down for a moment near where the fishes are, we should be in a tight place. Suppose the water not to crush us (which it would), we should pitch about in every kind of direction; every step we took would carry us as far as if we had seven-league boots; and we should keep <b>flying</b> <b>head</b> over heels, and top over bottom, like the liveliest clowns in the world.|$|E
60|$|The greater, then, was my {{surprise}} to discover {{his office in}} shabby surroundings, quite away from the business quarter, amongst a lot of hovels. Guided by a black board with white lettering, I climbed a narrow wooden staircase and entered {{a room with a}} bare floor of planks littered with bits of brown paper and wisps of packing straw. A great number of what looked like wine-cases were piled up against one of the walls. A lanky, inky, light-yellow, mulatto youth, miserably long-necked and generally recalling a sick chicken, got off a three-legged stool behind a cheap deal desk and faced me as if gone dumb with fright. I had some difficulty in persuading him to take in my name, though I could not get from him the nature of his objection. He did it at last with an almost agonised reluctance which ceased to be mysterious to me when I heard him being sworn at menacingly with savage, suppressed growls, then audibly cuffed and finally kicked out without any concealment whatever; because he came back <b>flying</b> <b>head</b> foremost through the door with a stifled shriek.|$|E

60|$|Hassan rose and, to do him credit, came {{on like a}} man, head down. His great skull caught Stephen, who was {{the lighter}} of the two, {{in the chest and}} knocked him over, but before the Arab could follow up the advantage, he was on his feet again. Then ensued a really glorious mill. Hassan fought with head and fists and feet, Stephen with fists alone. Dodging his opponent's rushes, he gave it to him as he passed, and soon his coolness and silence began to tell. Once he was knocked over by a hooked one under the jaw, but in the next round he sent the Arab {{literally}} <b>flying</b> <b>head</b> over heels. Oh! how those Zulus cheered, and I, too, danced with delight. Up Hassan came again, spitting out several teeth and, adopting new tactics, grabbed Stephen round the middle. To and fro they swung, the Arab trying to kick the Englishman with his knees and to bite him also, till the pain reminded him of the absence of his front teeth. Once he nearly got him down--nearly, but not quite, for the collar by which he had gripped him (his object was to strangle) burst and, at that juncture, Hassan's turban fell over his face, blinding him for a moment.|$|E
60|$|Now poor Heywood did {{not know}} that the animal he had made up his mind to kill was a tough old bull; neither did he know that a bull is bad to eat, and {{dangerous}} to follow; and, worse than all, he {{did not know}} that when a bull holds his tail stiff and straight up in the air, it is a sign that he is in a tremendous rage, and that the wisest thing a man can do is to let him alone. Heywood, in fact, knew nothing, so he rushed blindly on his fate. At first the bull did not raise his tail, but, as the rider drew near, he turned his enormous shaggy head a little to one side, and looked at him {{out of the corner of}} his wicked little eye. When Heywood came within a few yards and, in attempting to take aim, fired off his gun by accident straight into the face of the sun, the tail went up and the bull began to growl. The ferocious aspect of the creature alarmed the artist, but he had made up his mind to kill it, so he attempted to re-load, as Pemberton had done. He succeeded, and, as he was about to turn his attention again to the bull, he observed one of the men belonging to the fort making towards him. This man saw and knew the artist's danger, and meant to warn him, but his horse unfortunately put one of its feet into a hole, and sent him <b>flying</b> <b>head</b> over heels through the air. Heywood was now so close to the bull that he had to prepare for another shot.|$|E

50|$|A {{feature of}} the 655 drives was 12 read / write heads per surface. This reduced track to track {{movement}} and thus access times. However, this meant that there were 12 times more heads per drive, further increasing the likelihood of <b>head</b> crashes. These <b>flying</b> <b>heads</b> were moved using a 16 position magnetic actuator. The actuator used four different magnets to create the 16 positions. The magnetic actuators were later replaced with hydraulic actuators and later yet the hydraulic actuators were replaced with voice coil actuators. Later NCR used disk units from other manufacturers, who had significantly reduced head crashes.|$|R

She was sitting before the fire roasting acorns which, as they became cooked, she took from the fire and ate. Terrified by the power of the woman, who he thought was eating live coals, the <b>Flying</b> <b>Head</b> left and bothered them no more. An alternate version of this part of the legend says that, rather than seeing a woman eating acorns and thinking she was eating live coals, the <b>Flying</b> <b>Head</b> stole live coals from her and tried to eat them, thinking they were acorns. The results of course disastrous, the <b>Flying</b> <b>Head</b> flees in agony, never to be seen again.|$|E

50|$|According to folklore, the <b>Flying</b> <b>Head</b> {{drove the}} {{original}} native inhabitants {{who lived in}} the area of the state of New York near the source of the Hudson River, in the Adirondack Mountains away from their hunting grounds before the Europeans came. In the early nineteenth century a Mohawk guide in the town of Lake Pleasant, New York, who called himself Capt. Gill, claimed it was Lake Sacandaga where the legend took place. The tribe had their village on a hill that is now located behind the Hamilton County buildings. The name of the previous inhabitants has been lost to history, and the legend of The <b>Flying</b> <b>Head</b> ensured that every neighboring tribe steered clear for many years. The <b>Flying</b> <b>Head</b> legend survives, but the name of the tribe who invented it is gone. The hill where the unknown tribe's village was located, is considered cursed. Three different hotels were built on the sacred site and all three had a short life span and burned to the ground mysteriously. Capt. Gill lived in a wigwam at the outlet of the lake, Lake Pleasant. He had a wife named Molly, and Molly had a daughter named Molly Jr., whom Capt. Gill didn't claim as his own.|$|E
