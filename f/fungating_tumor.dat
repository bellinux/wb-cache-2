40|$|Background: Several {{variables}} {{have been}} reported as being prognostic {{with regard to the}} outcomes of soft-tissue sarcomas. Although the tumors are subjectively ominous, no prior study has been performed to evaluate the treatment or prognosis of fungating soft-tissue sarcomas. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all soft-tissue sarcomas treated at our institution between 1989 and 2004 that had been followed for a minimum of two years or until the death of the patient. Our study group consisted of twenty-four patients with a primary high-grade <b>fungating</b> <b>tumor,</b> and our control group consisted of 146 consecutive patients with a primary high-grade non-fungating tumor. The study cohorts were compared with regard to disease presentation, treatment, and oncologic outcomes. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} tumor size, tumor depth, or histopathologic diagnoses between the cohorts, although the patients with a <b>fungating</b> <b>tumor</b> tended to be older (mean, sixty-five years compared with fifty-five years in the control group; p = 0. 004) and have shorter postoperative follow-up (mean, thirty-eight months compared with sixty-five months in the control group; p = 0. 03). The proportion of patients presenting with metastases was significantly greater in the group with a <b>fungating</b> <b>tumor</b> (33 % compared with 9 % in the control group; p = 0. 003). Significantly more patients with a <b>fungating</b> <b>tumor</b> underwent amputation (35 % compared with 12 % in the control group; p = 0. 01), while a greater proportion of control patients received radiation therapy (68 % compared with 39 % in th...|$|E

40|$|Cotyledonoid {{leiomyoma}} is a {{very rare}} tumor among the ever expanding repertoire of growth variants described in benign uterine leiomyoma. We report a case of cotyledonoid leiomyoma in a 39 -year-old (unmarried) women presented with lump in abdomen. On laparotomy, a large multinodular, tan colored, exophytic, <b>fungating</b> <b>tumor</b> mass adherent to the posterolateral aspect of fundus of the uterus and extending to broad ligament and pelvic cavity was seen. Microscopic examination revealed nodules of smooth muscle cells arranged in fascicles with perinodular hydropic change diagnosed as cotyledonoid leiomyoma.

40|$|The {{unpleasant}} {{smell of}} infected <b>fungating</b> <b>tumors</b> and benign cutaneous ulcers is a distressing clinical problem, {{known to be}} associated with anaerobic infection. Topical metronidazole 0. 8 % gel has been shown to decrease smell from <b>fungating</b> malodorous <b>tumors.</b> This study was conducted to assess prospectively the subjective and bacteriological response to 0. 75 % metronidazole gel to decrease smell from these lesions and to assess whether bacterial contamination of the tubes of gel occurs during use. Forty-seven patients with benign or malignant cutaneous lesions associated with a foul smell were assessed for smell, pain, appearance, and bacteriological profile before entry and at 7 and 14 days. Forty-one (95 %) of the 43 patients assessed at 14 days reported decreased smell. Anaerobic infection was initially found in 25 (53 %) of patients and was eliminated in 21 (84 %) of these. At review after 7 days, patients reported less pain from the lesions. Discharge and associated cellulitis were also observed to decrease significantly...|$|R
40|$|The Tikhoffâ€“Linberg {{procedure}} and its modifications are limb-sparing surgical options for selected patients with bone and soft-tissue tumors {{in and around}} the shoulder girdle. Today, approximately 95 % of patients with tumors of the shoulder girdle can be treated by a limb-sparing procedure. Forequarter amputations are rarely performed, except in cases of tumors that are infected or <b>fungating,</b> <b>tumors</b> that invade the adjacent neurovascular bundle or chest wall, and failed attempts at limb-sparing resections. Function of the forearm, wrist, and hand should be nearly normal following a limb-sparing shoulder girdle resection. A stable shoulder and elbow flexion and extension are achieved without the need for an orthosis. This chapter describes in detail the specific tumor site and its influence on the surgical management, indications and contraindications of resection, surgical staging and classification, endoprosthetic reconstruction and design features, functional considerations, and rehabilitation. Specific techniques of resection and reconstruction of the proximal humerus and scapula are presented in Chapters 33 and 34. Malawer Chapter 09 21 / 02 / 2001 15 : 24 Page 17...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cystosarcoma phyllodes, a rare but {{impressive}} tumor of the breast, {{was first}} described and named by Muller (1838). Although this tumor occasionally distends overlying skin {{to such an}} extent that pressure of it produces discoloration, ulceration, fixation or retrac-tion of the skin, the tumor does not usually adhere to and invade the skin. We found only five reported cases of cystosarcoma phyllodes showing fungating growth through the overlying skin (Lee et al., 1931) since 1827. The following case represents a huge fungating growth of benign cystosarcoma phyllodes without necrosis through the overlying skin. CASE REPORT The patient, a 35 -year-old female, was admitted to the Rift Valley Provincial Hospital, Nakuru, Kenya, on February 7, 1974. She complained of swelling of the right breast of 7 month's duration. She had noticed a non tender swelling in the right breast which rapidly increased in size to a huge fungating growth through the overlying skin. She had six children. The last one was 5 years old. She had nursed them allwithout difficulty. There was no past history of breast disease. Examination revealed a large <b>fungating</b> <b>tumor</b> occupying almost entire region of the right breast. It measured 15 x 10 cm in size. On palpation, the fungating portion of the tumor was well delineated in the surrounding skin and also softer than that of ordinar...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) and MMP- 7 {{have been}} implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. This study aimed to {{investigate}} the expressions of MMP- 2 and- 7 in colorectal cancer and to evaluate their values as prognostic markers. Methods: Immunohistochemical staining for MMP- 2 and- 7 was done in 144 resected colorectal cancer specimens. Clinicopathological data and survival results were compared {{with regard to the}} expression results. Results: The expression rates of MMP- 2 in tumor cells in the tumor center and the tumor border were 16. 7 % and 38. 9 %, respectively. That of MMP- 2 in stromal cells was 27. 8 %. MMP- 7 immunoreactivities of tumor cells in the tumor center and the tumor border were 6. 9 % and 23. 6 %. The expressions of MMP- 2 and MMP- 7 were correlated. MMP- 2 expression in stromal cells was more increased in the distal part of the colorectum: 8. 8 % in right colon cancer, 29. 5 % in left colon cancer and 36. 4 % in rectal cancer. MMP- 2 expression of tumor cells in the tumor border was correlated with T-stage. MMP- 7 expression of tumor cells in the tumor border was increased in case of infiltrative cancer compared with <b>fungating</b> <b>tumor.</b> The expression patterns of MMP- 2 and- 7 were not correlated with other clinicopathological factors, including tumor markers, node metastasis, distant metastasis, lymphatic invasion, tumor differentiation, and recurrence. No significant associations between the overall and disease-free survival rates and the MMP- 2 and- 7 expression patterns were noted...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Most of gastric {{adenocarcinoma}} can {{be simply}} diagnosed by microscopic examination of biopsy specimen. Rarely the structural and cellular atypia of tumor cells is too insignificant to discriminate from benign foveolar epithelium. Case presentation A 67 -year-old male {{presented with a}} gastric mass incidentally found on the abdominal computed tomography (CT) for routine medical examination. Gastric endoscopic examination revealed a huge fungating mass at the cardia and mucosal biopsy was performed. Microscopically the biopsy specimen showed proliferation of bland looking foveolar epithelia in the inflammatory background and diagnosed as foveolar epithelial hyperplasia. Because the clinical and endoscopic features of this patient were strongly suggestive of malignancy, the patient underwent radical total gastrectomy. The resected stomach revealed a huge <b>fungating</b> <b>tumor</b> at the cardia. The cut surface of the tumor was whitish gelatinous. Microscopically the tumor was sharply demarcated from surrounding mucosa and composed of very well formed glandular structures without significant cellular atypia, which invaded into the whole layer of the gastric wall. Tumor glands were occasionally complicated or dilated, and glandular lumina were filled with abundant mucin. Immunohistochemically the tumor cells revealed no overexpression of p 53 protein but high Ki- 67 labeling index. The tumor cells and intraluminal mucin were diffusely expressed MUC 1 and MUC 5 AC and only focally expressed MUC 2. On abdominal CT taken after 12 months demonstrated peritoneal carcinomatosis and multiple metastatic foci in the lung. Conclusion The clinicopathologic profiles of gastric extremely well differentiated adenocarcinoma of gastric phenotype include cardiac location, fungating gross type, very similar histology to foveolar epithelial hyperplasia, foveolar mucin phenotype, lack of p 53 overexpressoin and high proliferative index. </p...|$|E
5000|$|Because of its visibility, {{breast cancer}} was {{the form of}} cancer most often {{described}} in ancient documents. [...] Because autopsies were rare, cancers of the internal organs were essentially invisible to ancient medicine. Breast cancer, however, could be felt through the skin, and in its advanced state often developed into <b>fungating</b> lesions: the <b>tumor</b> would become necrotic (die from the inside, causing the tumor to appear to break up) and ulcerate through the skin, weeping fetid, dark fluid.|$|R
40|$|Local {{recurrence}} of rectal cancer develops in the posterior bony pelvis as an isolated event {{in about half}} of the patients with recurrence. Although radiation can palliate sacral root pain, the disease is usually progressive and is rarely amenable to conventional resection. We have adapted a surgical technique usually used for primary sacral tumors, which permits a complete en bloc excision of recurrent rectal cancer in most instances. This approach consists of a laparotomy with pelvic dissection and mobilization of structures to be resected. The patient is repositioned prone and the posterior pelvis (sacrum and side walls) is then resected with preservation of appropriate nerve roots of the posterior pelvis and the sciatic nerve. Reconstruction is done with muscle and skin flaps. We have done 21 such procedures, of which, 11 were for pelvic {{recurrence of}} rectal adenocarcinoma. Seven patients had resections for cure and four had palliative resections of <b>fungating</b> or infected <b>tumors.</b> All but one patient was postabdominal perineal resection and nine patients had been irradiated (3000 - 9000 rads). Two patients had received up to 9000 rads in separate courses (external beam in one and interstitial radiation in the other). The posterior extent of resection was S 1 - 2 to 5 in six patients; S 3 to 5 in three patients, and S 4 - 5 in two patients. Anterior exenteration was performed in three patients and three patients had additional resection of other organs. In the curative resection group, three patients are living free of disease at six, ten, and 52 months, and one patient was NED at 60 months, but has again had tumor recurrance and is living with disease at 65 months. One patient died of disease at 13 months and one patient died of a pulmonary embolus following resection for ureteral obstruction at five months. One postoperative death occurred from a cerebrovascular accident at 52 days. In the palliative resection group, three patients survived with relief of local tumor symptoms four, eight, and 12 months. One patient who had received a total of 9000 rads developed flap necrosis, small bowel fistula and died 60 days after resection. Although this is a small series, it suggests that abdominal sacral resection of locally advanced pelvic cancer is feasible and may provide good palliation in most and possible cure in some patients who develop recurrence after primary resection of adenocarcinoma of the rectum...|$|R
40|$|Pelvic {{recurrence}} is {{an ominous}} event after curative resection of rectal cancer and is rarely amenable to re-resection by conventional methods. A method to permit a composite resection of these using the abdominal sacral {{approach has been}} described previously. This report updates that experience with resection of pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer in 28 patients. Of these, 24 were done with curative intent, and four were done for palliation (mainly for infected or <b>fungating</b> <b>tumor).</b> All patients had extensive preoperative evaluation by clinical and radiologic tests, and most patients had a long free interval period of approximately 18 months, after their primary resection. Although 47 patients had exploratory surgery, only 29 had local disease amenable to resection and four had palliative resections. About half the patients had had an abdominoperineal resection, half had had an anterior resection, and one third had had previous efforts to resect the recurrence. All but one patient had been irradiated with 3000 - 11, 000 cGy. All but two patients (of the 24 curative efforts) required a formal abdominosacral resection (through S 1 - 2 in 12, S 2 - 3 in 9, and S 4 - 5 in 1). Over half the patients also required a bladder resection. There were three operative deaths (12 %); one patient had a cardiac death immediately after operation and two were septic deaths at 35 and 60 days. The survivors generally had relief of sacral root pain and good motor function; most of those previously employed could return to work. The actuarial 5 -year survival rate is 25 % and median survival is 36 months. Long-term survival over 48 months was recorded in five of 21 surgical survivors (23. 8 %). Survival in a historic comparative group of 30 patients treated for local recurrence only (mainly by radiation) was 15 months median, and at 5 years the survival rate was 3 % (p less than 0. 001). In conclusion, selected patients with pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer may be retrieved by and returned to functional life with the composite abdominosacral resection...|$|E
