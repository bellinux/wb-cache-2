40|$|Higher {{education}} in the United Kingdom (UK) is under increasing pressure to manage the workload of its academic staff {{in a way that}} maximises the outputs from teaching and research. The emergence of this {{can be traced back to}} 1989 through government legislation that introduced neo-liberal managerialism into the sector mirroring the laissez-faire approach to the economy that was prevalent. This paper examines the literature surrounding workload management and staff performance in the sector to try to establish whether the two have been conceptually linked. A <b>desk-based</b> narrative literature <b>review</b> was executed in order to scrutinise the literature and attempt to answer the main question; what does ‘performance’ mean in relation to an academic role and how is this related to an academic’s workload within the post- 92 higher education 1 sector? The results of the review show that the literature is dichotomous both in terms of the two areas being discrete and also in the conceptual stance taken by writers in each area. Whilst there are inferred links between workload management and performance, these have not been explored. The paper concludes by outlining what further research is needed on the linkages between workload management and staff performance specifically, using socially-critical methodology...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Scotland {{has seen}} an {{increased}} number of wind energy developments {{as a result of}} the Scottish Government’s strategy to achieve its renewable energy target by 2020. This has meant that there has been a rise in the number of local communities and opposition groups who condemn this transformation of Scotland’s landscapes, primarily due to communities feeling excluded from the design of developments in their locality, and their perception that financial benefits are being accrued only by commercial developers. Acknowledging these challenges, policy and guidance documents are currently failing to encourage commercial developers to deliver more inclusive and equitable community engagement, community benefits, and community ownership schemes. The dissertation therefore explores ‘process’ and ‘outcome’ as fundamental dimensions within commercially-owned community wind energy projects that seek to benefit and involve local communities. The research project utilised a case study of a commercial wind farm in Fife, Scotland in order to highlight an example of current practice within wind farm developments. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with the developer and a range of community members surrounding the wind farm, as identified through a stakeholder analysis. The interview findings were combined with the results of a <b>desk-based</b> case study <b>review</b> of other wind energy developments in order to corroborate or invalidate the findings. The results highlighted a number of significant implications for future policy and guidance for commercial wind farm developers. It was found that developers should endeavour to incentivise, enable and offer the appropriate opportunities for meaningful community engagement, in order to provide an outcome which is suitable to the local context, and which conveys the wants and needs of the relevant communities...|$|R
40|$|As part {{of efforts}} to improve social work provision, INGO EveryChild {{commissioned}} Dr Andrew Bilson, Professor of Social Work at the University of Central Lancashire, UK, to complete a literature review {{on the role of}} social workers in responding to children without parental care. The literature review, published in January 2012, explores the differing approaches and functions of social work around the world, and identifies gaps and challenges in current provision. It argues that, in order to better support social services, it is first important to determine which approach should be taken in a given setting. It also argues that governments and social work service providers must carefully consider the priority functions that social workers should fulfil in order to be most effective, and the kinds of training and support that these professionals need. Following on from this literature review, Family for Every Child, together with Dr Andrew Bilson, has been working to develop a tool which aims to: build on strengths in the social work system identify feasible improvements develop a vision for high-quality social work build a movement towards implementation. The tool uses an Appreciative Inquiry (AI), action-based research approach which aims to identify and build on strengths in existing social work systems. The tool is designed for use by NGOs, UN agencies or governments in order to strengthen social services provision at national or sub-national levels. Brazilian member of Family for Every Child, Terra dos homens-ABTH,is the first to test the tool, with the support of Dr Andrew Bilson. The tool was used in Brazil from March to May 2012.

40|$|Computational Thinking is {{regarded}} as a gift from Computer Science to other discipline areas, a digital literacy skill and a cornerstone of the computing programme of study has been delivered as part of the National Curriculum in English Schools since September 2014 [1]. Since Wing’s [2] seminal article sets outs with a clear and concise call to embed Computational Thinking in all subject areas, the impact of, and influence of, Computational Thinking can be seen worldwide. This is evident in the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of computing, the engagement and interaction with big data in a range of disciplines and the development of the computer science curriculum in countries globally. However, there is continuing discussion and debate [3] regarding the need for a robust distinct definition of the term “Computational Thinking”, as at present there is no collective consensus definition for this term. In this paper, the authors seek to contribute to this ongoing dialogue by presenting the findings of a <b>desk-based</b> academic literature <b>review</b> relating to computational thinking which utilised both Influential Literature Analysis [4] and Citation Analysis [5] to identify relevant key texts. These key texts were then analysed to identify the most frequent occurring items (i. e. terms, descriptions and meanings) and coded using appropriate synonyms. This review does not use Wing’s article [2] as its epicentre but identifies the historical roots which have developed and shaped computational thinking. Criteria are proposed for the objectives of a definition of computational thinking, in accordance with the findings presented in the literature review. The criteria were then used as a theoretical framework together with the identified criteria as the vocabulary to propose a definition for computational thinking. The proposed definition was then evaluated against definitions proposed by other computer science educational researchers [6, 7, 3] to determine its effectiveness. The authors look back to identify the historical roots of computational thinking, and look to the future in which educators use a consensus definition of computational thinking...|$|R

Research and review of GBV in higher education contexts have largely tended to reflect experiences within English Universities, or cover the UK as a whole. Of the 62 HEIs which contributed to the recent UUK taskforce consultation, for example, only five were from Scotland, three from Wales and one from Northern Ireland. 12 GBV, however, is a policy area {{with a degree of}} variation across the UK, and the evolution of distinct policy approaches and positions may impact on how Universities approach this complex issue. Intervention, prevention, policy and practice must be contextualised within national, devolved contexts. A Scotland focused review is therefore not only required to highlight specific activity in Scottish Universities, but also because Scotland has a distinct political position and national conceptualisation of VAWG and GBV. Although similarities with UK wide approaches are evident, the ‘distinctiveness’ of Scotland’s policy position derives from its gendered analysis and definition of violence and abuse, emphasising the inter-relationship between ‘gendered power relations and inequalities. ...|$|E

Investigation is required to understand climate change-related risks for all components of human systems, including cultural heritage. Accordingly, this paper aims to present a new risk assessment index for cultural heritage, referred to as the Cultural Heritage Risk Index (CHRI). The paper applies a <b>desk-based</b> <b>review</b> of the existing literature on climate change-related risks for cultural heritage and of multi-level policy and planning documents of cultural heritage management in Australia.

CHRI is applied to a unique asset of cultural heritage in Newcastle (Australia), the Burwood Beach Wastewater Treatment Works (BBWTW). The paper shows that this asset has a moderate risk related to climate change, and that some interventions can be applied to decrease its vulnerability. The use of a new index such as CHRI allows creating a baseline for the exploration of the relations between climate change-related risks and cultural heritage. It can be an effective part of tools assessing climate change-related risk on cultural heritage in Australia and might aid in prioritising specific interventions...|$|E

We present the results of the Techno-Economic Study of Biomass to Power with CO 2 capture (TESBiC) project, that entailed <b>desk-based</b> <b>review</b> and analysis, process engineering, optimisation as well as primary data collection from some of the leading pilot demonstration plants. From the perspective of being able to deploy Biopower CCS by 2050, twenty-eight Biopower CCS technology combinations involving combustion or gasification of biomass (either dedicated or co-fired with coal) together with pre-, oxy- or post-combustion CO 2 capture were identified and assessed. In addition to the capital and operating costs, techno-economic characteristics such as electrical efficiencies (LHV% basis), Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE), costs of CO 2 captured and CO 2 avoided were modelled over time assuming technology improvements from today to 2050. Many of the Biopower CCS technologies gave relatively similar techno-economic results when analysed at the same scale, with the plant scale (MWe) observed to be the principal driver of CAPEX (£/MWe) and the cofiring % (i. e. the weighted feedstock cost) a key driver of LCOE.

The recent focus has been on ways to reduce the fighting, paving the way for transition talks. Two major processes have been underway to find a solution to the Syrian conflict: the ‘Geneva process’ under the auspices of the UN, and the ‘Astana process’ led by Russia, Iran and Turkey. The latter differs from the former in that it involves armed groups and seeks to find a way to end the fighting before then working on a political settlement. Progress was made at the latest round of Astana talks in May, with endorsement of four ceasefire zones in the country which would allow the return of displaced civilians and provision of humanitarian aid to those areas...|$|E
40|$|Non-pumped hydroelectricity-based {{energy storage}} in New Zealand has only limited {{potential}} to expand to meet projected growth in electricity demand. Seasonal variations of hydro inflows have {{also led to}} several 'dry-year' events {{over the last decade}} and dedicated fast-start 'peaker' capacity may also be required to support wind power as it approaches a 20 % generation share. In this research, the New Zealand electricity industry has been surveyed in regard to the feasibility of reducing CO 2 -e emissions through the introduction of pumped hydroelectricity and utility-scale batteries by 2025. A <b>desk-based</b> <b>review</b> of the economic costs of these technologies has also been performed and their drivers and barriers critically assessed. Most respondents to the survey projected that peak power demand will continue to increase and this will result in new-build centralised (~ 150 MW) thermal reserve power sources. In New Zealand, the costs of pumped hydro and batteries are seen to be prohibitive to their introduction, even though they are almost universally assumed to be technically capable of providing renewables support and peak power adequacy. The perception of the poor economic viability of pumped hydro may, in part, be due to the relatively high capital cost estimate associated with the Manorburn-Onslow proposal (~NZ$ 3 billion). This research has shown, however, that smaller, 'more-internationally-representative' pumped hydro schemes, if available in NZ with low associated environmental impact, are cost-competitive with thermal peakers, especially diesel peakers. Conversely, utility-scale batteries have very high storage costs per kWh and {{are most likely to be}} used only for very high value applications where there is a strong technical advantage, such as the six-second fast instantaneous reserve...|$|E
