We used discursive analytic principles to analyze portrayals of men's communication about depression in news articles over a 5 -year period.

Such depictions might challenge stigma associated with talking about mental health concerns. However, some articles problematically <b>positioned</b> <b>depressed</b> men as individually responsible for defying stigma and achieving recovery. We suggest that portraying depression as something that impacts a plurality of men is one way that media messages might dispel stigma.

When a full-face mask is used, excess gas will be vented through the exhaust valve and around the mask skirt, usually allowing the diver to continue to breathe without difficulty during the freeflow.

40|$|A {{depressed}} scapular alignment {{could lead}} to prolonged and repetitive stress or compression of the brachial plexus, resulting in sensitization of neural tissue. However, no study has investigated {{the influence of a}}lignment of the scapulae on sensitization of upper limb neural tissue in otherwise asymptomatic people. In this case-control study, we investigate the influence of a depressed scapular alignment on mechanosensitivity of the upper limb peripheral nervous system as well as pressure pain thresholds (PPT). Asymptomatic individuals with neutral vertical scapular alignment (n = 25) or depressed scapular alignment (n = 25) participated. We measured the upper limb neurodynamic test (ULNT 1), including assessment of symptom response and elbow range of motion (ROM), and PPT measured over upper limb peripheral nerve trunks, the upper trapezius muscle and overlying cervical zygapophyseal joints. Subjects with a depressed scapular reported significantly greater pain intensity (t = 5. 7, p < 0. 0001) and reduced elbow extension ROM (t = − 2. 7, p < 0. 01) during the ULNT 1 compared to those with a normal scapular orientation. Regardless of the location tested, the group presenting with a depressed scapular had significantly lower PPT compared to those with a normal scapular orientation (PPT averaged across all sites: normal orientation: 3. 3 ± 0. 6 kg/cm 2, depressed scapular: 2. 1 ± 0. 5 kg/cm 2, p < 0. 00001). Despite being asymptomatic, people with a depressed scapular have greater neck and upper limb neural tissue mechanosensitivity when compared to people with a normal scapular orientation.

40|$|The "Youth Prcblem": Age or Generational Crcdinq? This paper {{attempts}} {{to distinguish between}} two alternative views {{of the labor market}} problems faced by young workers in a number of industrialized countries in the 1970 s and early 1980 s.

5000|$|Before the Industrial Revolutions in Europe {{whiteness}} {{may have}} been associated with social status. Aristocrats may have had less exposure to the sun and therefore a pale complexion {{may have been}} associated with status and wealth. This may be the origin of [...] "blue blood" [...] as a description of royalty, the skin being so lightly pigmented that the blueness of the veins could be clearly seen. The change in the meaning of white that occurred in the colonies (see above) to distinguish Europeans from non-Europeans did not apply to 'home' countries (England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales). Whiteness therefore retained a meaning associated with social status. During the 19th century, when the British Empire was at its peak, many of the bourgeoisie and aristocracy developed extremely chauvinistic attitudes to those of lower social rank. Edward Lhuyd discovered that Welsh, Gaelic, Cornish and Breton {{are all part of the}} same language family, which he called [...] "Celtic", and were distinct from the Germanic English; this can be seen in context with 19th-century romantic nationalism. On the other hand, the discovery of Anglo-Saxon remains also led to a belief that the English were descended from a distinct Germanic lineage that was fundamentally (and racially) different from that of the Celts. Early British anthropologists such as John Beddoe and Robert Knox emphasised this distinction, and it was common to find texts that claimed that Welsh, Irish and Scottish people are the descendants of the indigenous more [...] "primitive" [...] inhabitants of the islands, while the English are the descendants of a more advanced and recent [...] "Germanic" [...] migration. Beddoe especially postulated that the Welsh and Irish people are closer to the Cro-Magnon, whom he also considered Africanoid, and it was common to find references to the [...] of the skin of peoples from the west of the islands, by comparison to the more pale skinned and blond English residing in the east. For example, Thomas Huxley's [...] "On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind" [...] (1870) described Irish, Scots and Welsh peoples as a mixture of [...] "melanochroi" [...] (melano—dark colored), and [...] "xanthochroi", while the English were [...] "xanthochroi" [...] (xanthro—yellow). Just as race reified whiteness in the colonies, so capitalism without social welfare reified whiteness with regards to social class in 19th-century Britain and Ireland; this social distinction of whiteness became, over time, associated with racial difference. For example, George Sims in How the poor live (1883) wrote of [...] "...a dark continent that is within easy reach of the General Post Office... the wild races who inhabit it will, I trust, gain public sympathy as easily as other savage tribes" [...] and Count Gobineau in The Inequality of Human Races wrote the following: Every social order is founded upon three social classes, each of which represents a racial variety: the nobility, a more or less accurate reflection of the conquering race; the bourgeoisie composed of mixed stock coming close to the chief race; and the common people who live in servitude or at least in a very <b>depressed</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this report {{is to show that}} altered {{position}} of the scapula can provide altered response due to isometric testing of extension of the wrist in persons with lateral epicondyalgia, without changing the position of the elbow. The scapula was assessed in three different positions; neutral, depression and elevation. Design: Case report Material: Pain-free grip force, measured with a dynamometer (Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer, Irvington, New York), and pain, using a numerical pain scale, in isometric testing of extension of the wrist. This was investigated with the scapula in neutral, <b>depressed</b> and elevated <b>position.</b> Potential reactions in the nervous system were measured by a neurodynamic test, palpation of peripheral nerves and neurological testing ("bed side"). Results: Reduced pains in isometric extension of the wrist were findings during the whole treatment period with depressed scapula. Pain in active flexion of the elbow was also decreased with depressed scapula. Gradually improvement in grip force, and gradually decreased pain in isometric extension of the wrist, were followed by increased range of motion due to neurodynamic testing, ULNT 2 b (n. radialis). Exercising with pain worsened the symptoms, however severe mental stress led to no change. Discussion: The patient responded well to lateral glides of the forearm (Mobilization with Movement, Mulligan), but also to mobilization of the radial nerve. The mechanism behind the lateral glides is still unknown, however this management is considered to influence the central nervous system. The results of this report indicate that the subjects pain was mechanical driven. The results also assumed that the degree of peripheral and central sensitization were insignificant. Based on this the lesion was interpreted to be local. The local pain was influenced by changing the position of the scapula, which was considered as the radial nerve was affected. This may also explain why the subject had an effect of getting the radial nerve mobilized. This report points out that the position of the scapula may be important for the reliability of isometric testing of extension of the wrist. The report also questions whether the lateral glides may have a local effect or not. The results of the isometric testing implemented in this case report cannot be generalized. The intertester reliability has to be verified, and further research is needed, before this is interesting. Showing to be appropriate, this test may be a useful tool in the diagnostic process in epicondyalgia...|$|R

On the basis of a multicountry empirical analysis of patterns ofcohort size, earnings, unemployment, and the distribution of young workers across industries, we have four main sets of findings to report. First, the baby-boom was not uniformly experienced across OECD economies - in terms of either its timing or magnitude. While some countries, such as Canada, the U. S., and Belgium had large increases in the youth share ofthe population from 1965 to 1980, others, notably Japan and Switzerland, had large decreases. Second, our empirical results indicate that large cohort size tends to {{have a negative effect on}} the "expected relative earnings" of the cohort, where expected relative earnings is defined as the product of the earnings and the employment-to-labor force ratio of a young cohort relative to the same product for an older cohort. There is, moreover, a marked trade-off betweenthe relative earnings effect and the relative employment effect with large cohort sizes reducing relative earnings in some countries and reducing reiative employment in others. Third, at least for the U. S., the relatively low wages and high unemployment of the "unlucky cohorts" tend to converge to the patterns that would have resulted had the cohorts been more "normal" in size, with the convergence occurring within a decade or so. Fourth, our results show that baby-boom cohorts were absorbed inthe U. S. and other OECD economies quite evenly across a wide range of industries. This finding contradicts the popular belief that large youth cohorts were absorbed primarily through expansion of those industries that have been traditionally youth-intensive. ...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the next}} two decades, {{depression}} is predicted to become {{the leading cause of}} disease burden in developed countries, and the second leading cause of disease burden globally. There is a relatively large body of research on women’s experiences of depression, but research on men’s depression, and their experiences with depression, has been fragmented. The aim of this dissertation is to contribute to the understanding of depression in men through the triangulation of three diverse sources of data that deal with men’s experiences of depression. These data sources are: existing published research studies, media portrayals, and in-depth interviews with men. Applying a systematic review methodology, the first study explores current knowledge about the factors associated with depressive symptoms in men. These factors include social and demographic factors, occupational factors, health behavioural factors, and psychological or cognitive factors. I discuss the relevance of these findings in relation to diathesis-stress models of depression, and to theories of pathoplasticity which describe an individual’s vulnerability to potential stressors. In the second study, I extend the theory that ‘softer’ masculinities are becoming increasingly valued in modern society, through an investigation of how <b>depressed</b> men are <b>positioned</b> by particular discourses in news media articles. I explore news media portrayals of men’s communication about their depression in relation to theories of stigma and masculinity. The findings of this study highlight the role media can play in reproducing or challenging such stigma. The third and final study addresses the limited research on men’s subjectivities of distress. I add to the body of knowledge about men’s discourses of depression by exploring how men draw on medical understandings of depression and how they talk about the broader social contexts of their experiences. The focus {{of this study is to}} explore the understandings of depression experienced by a group of Australian men with high depressive symptoms. This study utlises a thematic analytic framework to provide an overview of men’s subjectivities of depression. The findings of this study provide more depth to knowledge of men’s understandings of depression. This dissertation has several theoretical contributions and implications for clinical practice, public health services, and policy makers. The findings provide health practitioners and the public health sector with comprehensive knowledge about the relevant factors associated with men’s depression. This dissertation also presents an overview of factors discussed by a group of men with depression. This provides an understanding of how men make sense of their condition. The research findings highlight how discourses of men’s depression can work to dispel or reproduce stigma around men’s mental health concerns. These findings are particularly relevant to policy makers for their debate and development of the gender equality in mental health outcomes. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Women and Marriage in Toulouse at the Time of the Cathars. J. H. Mundy. Owing {{to their}} {{relatively}} <b>depressed</b> <b>position,</b> women are often {{said to have}} been especially drawn to Catharism. Initial investigation of materials from the town of Toulouse seems not to support this view. Although Catharism gave women a somewhat greater religions role than did Catholicism, they were not placed as high as they were among the Waldensians, yet that belief had little place in the community. Furthermore women were not unusually discriminated against there, and hence had no more reason than the members of their sex elsewhere in Europe to favor divergent thought, yet Toulouse was a center of Catharism. These propositions and questions derive from an examination of the position of married women and the relation of persons of that sex to parental and marital property. Save for concubinage, the sexual relationships between men and women are not explored here. Mundy John H. Le mariage et les femmes à Toulouse au temps des cathares. In: Annales.
