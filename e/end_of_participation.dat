From this standpoint, the trial can be defined as both a promise of life and of new possibilities embodied in what is often described as new family ties. How are such ties formed and what does it mean when these ties are broken at the end of patient participation? Discussing the failure of family ties commented upon by patients and dealt by physician researcher is a way to look at ethics from below...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: One {{out of five}} {{participants}} of further training programs in Germany drops out of the program. Studies on the employment effects of these measures usually consider {{the start of a}} program as the treatment and do not deal with the question if the program has been completed. By contrast, this paper focuses on the distinction between dropping out and completing a program. The first aim is to learn about the occurrence of dropouts- how often and when do people drop out and what makes a dropout more likely. Dropouts can be identified in the German Integrated Biographies Sample after having corrected measurement error in the registered <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation.</b> The second aim is to study the employment prospects of dropouts. A dynamic random effects probit model is used to estimate how the employment probability of dropouts compares to the employment probability of those who complete the program and how this changes over time (relative to the planned end of the measure) controlling for various characteristics of the individual and the program as well as for calendar time...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionSelf-management {{education}} programs seek to help patients {{realize that they}} are their own principal caregivers and that health care professionals are consultants who support them in this role. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a diabetes self-management education program implemented as part of a district-wide approach in South Auckland, New Zealand, which has some of the highest prevalence rates for diabetes and is one of the most ethnically diverse and deprived regions of New Zealand. MethodsSelf-management attitudes and behaviors were monitored with the use of questionnaires before and after program implementation. Clinical outcomes such as hemoglobin A 1 c, body mass index, and blood pressure were also tracked before the program began and 3 months after the program ended. Participant focus groups and facilitator interviews were conducted to explore perceptions of the program. ResultsParticipants showed improvement in attitudes toward their own ability to manage their diabetes; in diet, physical activity, and foot care; and in hemoglobin A 1 c levels 3 months after the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation.</b> Participants also reduced their sense of isolation when dealing with their diabetes. However, catering to the needs of a multiethnic community is extremely resource-intensive because of the need to provide adequate language and cultural interpretation. ConclusionSelf-management education can work in multiethnic, high-needs communities in New Zealand. Programs must ensure they enable the appropriate mechanisms and have appropriate resources to support the community’s needs...|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{upper limb}} {{amputation}} and brachial plexus injuries have {{high rates of}} prosthesis rejection. Study purpose is to describe experiences of subjects with transhumeral amputation and brachial plexus injury, who were fit with, and trained to use, a DEKA Arm. This was a mixed-methods study utilizing qualitative (e. g. interview, survey) and quantitative data (e. g. self-report and performance measures). Subject 1, a current prosthesis user, had a shoulder arthrodesis. Subject 2, not a prosthesis user, had a subluxed shoulder. Both were trained in laboratory and participated in a trial of home use. Descriptive analyses of processes and outcomes were conducted. Subject 1 was fitted with the transhumeral configuration (HC) DEKA Arm using a compression release stabilized socket. He had 12 hours of prosthetic training and participated in all home study activities. Subject 1 had improved dexterity and prosthetic satisfaction with the DEKA Arm and reported {{better quality of life}} (QOL) at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation.</b> Subject 2 was fit with the shoulder configuration (SC) DEKA Arm using a modified X-frame socket. He had 30 hours of training and participated in 3 weeks of home activities. He reported less functional disability at the end of training as compared to baseline, but encountered personal problems and exacerbation of PTSD symptoms and withdrew from home use portion at 3 weeks. Both subjects reported functional benefits from use, and expressed a desire to receive a DEKA Arm in the future. This paper reported on two different strategies for prosthetic fitting and their outcomes. The advantages and limitations of each approach were discussed. Use of both the HC and SC DEKA Arm for patients with TH amputation and brachial plexus injury was reported. Lessons learned may be instructive to clinicians considering prosthetic choices for future cases...|$|E

40|$|Extracurricular university-based Business Plan Competitions [BPCs] {{assume a}} popular status in {{universities}} globally (Florin et al, 2007; Pittaway et al, 2011; Russell et al, 2008). Such competitions are assumed an entrepreneurial learning tool {{for those who}} participate, allowing the development of necessary entrepreneurial competencies (Hegarty, 2006; Russell et al, 2008). This principally attributable to their experiential nature and the opportunities afforded to the participant to engage in entrepreneurial activity within the competition context (McGowan and Cooper, 2008). However we lack appreciation of how learning motivates BPC participation from a participant perspective, notably the particular learning objectives which participants may have before participating and whether these are achieved through their participation. To explore this, the current qualitative paper draws insight from the participants of a regional university based BPC in the North-East of England. Participants were interviewed at the start and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation.</b> Such an approach allowed the researcher to depict not only the learning objectives which may have guided their participation, but also capture whether these objectives were achieved through the competition experience. It was found that participants entered the competition perceiving {{there to be a}} competency ‘gap’ between the current statuses of their venture and where they wanted and were expected by others to be. The competition participation experience thus enlisted as a means of lessening this gap and gaining the competencies needed to take themselves and their venture forward. Competitors largely felt they had achieved their learning objectives and also appreciated that the competition had allowed the identification of further gaps in their competency base which would need to be addressed. These findings suggest a need to start dialogues with participants about what their learning objectives are so as to devise a means of supporting attainment of these through the competition...|$|E
30|$|However, data {{on further}} {{training}} while in paid employment were collected without exact time specifications {{for the beginning}} and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation.</b> Thus, the exact timing, order, and duration of the employees’ participation in further training courses during a job episode are unknown. To solve this problem of missing time references, a random time reference {{for the beginning of}} a further training course in an employment episode is estimated (see also: Schömann et al. 1997). However, almost two-thirds of employed participants have attended more than two courses, meaning the actual activities are underestimated. On the aggregate level, the participation rate for the time period between 1970 and 2008 would in this case be under 10 %. That is clearly under the level of up to 50 % reported in other studies (Becker 2018; BMBF 2015; Becker and Schömann 2015; Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung 2014; Hubert and Wolf 2007; Schömann and Leschke 2004). For this reason, the following strategy was chosen: first, the year in which professional development activities were taken up for the first time is estimated for all participants of further training for the time interval of an occupational episode. Second, for the remainder of a specific employment relationship, it is then assumed that a previous participation in further training reflects the permanence of human capital acquisition through courses. A sequence of courses counts therefore as one educational episode since the majority of further training courses are attended consecutively and build upon one another (Büchel and Pannenberg 2004 : 77). 6 This {{solution to the problem of}} missing time references leads to significantly more consistent findings compared to the assumption of singular participation in employment episodes (see also: Böhnke 1997). The results also coincide with the findings of previous analyses with retrospective event history data, such as the German Life History Study (Becker 2018 : 326 – 328; Becker and Schömann 1996, 2015; Becker 1991, 1993).|$|E
