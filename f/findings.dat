In this {{longitudinal}} study with 117 cancer patients (73 men, 44 women) in hospitals in Berlin, we addressed three questions. (1) Do patients report benefit <b>finding</b> after surgery?

Patients were interviewed and completed a questionnaire in the week before cancer surgery.

The consequence <b>finding</b> problem is a generalization of the refutation <b>finding</b> problem. The SOL-resolution is a Model-Elimination-like calculus with Skip operation, {{and is one of}} the most significant calculi for consequence <b>finding.</b> The concept "completeness" of consequence-finding calculi differs from the one of refutation <b>finding</b> calculi, hence the pruning methods that are complete for refutation <b>finding</b> tasks may not be complete for consequence <b>finding</b> problems. In this paper, we first reformulate SOL-resolution within connection tableaux and properly strengthen one of structural conditions, the regularity for skipped literals, which reduces a great amount of the redundancies in the search space. Next we investigate various types of pruning methods, such as order-preserving reduction, lemma matching, merge, unit subsumption, etc, and show the completeness theorems of each pruning method for consequence <b>finding.</b> Finally we show Skip operation itself has a significantly important future as a new local failure pruning method in consequence <b>finding...</b>|$|R
