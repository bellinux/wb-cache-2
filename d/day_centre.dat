Results: The centres catered for a group with long-standing mental health problems, mostly under {{community}} mental health team care. A surprising number were suffering from physical ill health. They attended the centres primarily for social reasons or to participate in creative groups such as music and art. Very few were concurrently attending day hospitals. Clinical Implications: Further work is essential to understand the distinction between NHS day hospitals and Social Services <b>day</b> <b>centres</b> in terms of utilisation and client group.

25|$|Trinity Methodist Church is in Woodland Place. The present church, built 1901 in a Gothic style, has {{the only}} spire {{left in the}} town and was {{designed}} by Henry Budgen. The congregation had met since 1890 in a corrugated iron building on the site known as 'Playter's Church' built in the 1880s. In 1896 a schoolroom had been built alongside the iron church. Trinity was damaged several times by bombing during World War II, and its stained glass windows were removed for safe keeping to the Coed Ely Coal Pit, Gilfach Goch. In 1970 a <b>day</b> <b>centre</b> for the elderly was established and in 1986 a radical remodelling of the original school accommodation provided meeting rooms, a thriving youth club, kitchens and toilets.|$|E
25|$|By 1975 it {{was being}} used by the Social Work Department of Strathclyde Regional Council as an {{occupational}} <b>day</b> <b>centre.</b> In 1982 a decision was taken to sell it on the open market. This proved controversial—the residents of Pollokshields protested due to its connection to the heritage of the town and the historical significance to the area. Further protests ensued so a charitable trust was formed to ensure that the building would continue to be publicly owned. The Trust acquired the building for £1 in 1986. Only in 1991 was the title transferred with the condition that the derelict lodge house be restored within five years. Historic Scotland supported the heritage campaign as well as other organisations such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, Glasgow City Council, the Glasgow Development Agency and the local community and so the lodge house and the ground floor of the Hall were completely refurbished and reopened around 1997. The lower ground floor has since attracted further funding and what was once little more than cellar space has been converted to a contemporary conference room, which can be directly accessed from the outside.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{exploration}} of a dilemma that {{is central to the}} place of <b>day</b> <b>centres</b> in tackling single homelessness and raises issues for social work more generally. On the one hand, <b>day</b> <b>centres</b> provide vital services to a vulnerable group in a safe, non-threatening and non-judgemental setting; on the other hand, in doing so, they are believed to impede opportunities for personal change. The paper draws on findings from a research study which compared and contrasted the priorities of single homeless people with multiple support needs with the priorities of support services, exploring the role of encounters between service users and agencies in either overcoming or reinforcing multiple exclusion homelessness. This paper focuses on evidence about the use of <b>day</b> <b>centres.</b> It seeks to draw on theological insights to explore <b>day</b> <b>centres</b> as ‘places of sanctuary’ whose largely unconditional accessibility enables them to serve as both a last refuge for the victims of multiple rejection and a safe place to confront the past. This paper will take the debate about conditionality in welfare provision beyond the field of homelessness to address one of the oldest dilemmas of social work: how to facilitate change while respecting people's free agency...|$|R

500|$|The Grade II*-listed former St Stephen's Church on Montpelier Place {{closed in}} 1939 {{and is now}} used as a <b>day</b> <b>centre</b> for {{homeless}} people. George Cheesman designed the plain stuccoed Classical façade, with Doric pilasters and an octagonal lantern, in 1851. [...] Behind it lies the opulent former ballroom of the Castle Inn, built by John Crunden in 1776 and later transported to Montpelier Place. Arthur Blomfield made additions to the church in 1889.

[...] In that year the house, its grounds and the adjacent Tivoli House (built to the immediate north of Tower House in 1903, and latterly a Brighton Borough Council residential home) were acquired by developers Cussins Green Homes. [...] They demolished Tivoli House and built modern blocks of flats (Robinia Lodge and Tower Gate) and a terrace of houses on the site and in the grounds. [...] Tower House itself was retained, though, and was converted into ten flats and a daycare centre.

40|$|I have interviewed <b>day</b> care <b>centre</b> {{managers}} {{about their}} views of staff quality. My aim is to investigate how managers perceive the impact staff has {{on the quality of}} work with children and parents in <b>day</b> care <b>centres.</b> I have conducted focus group interviews with <b>day</b> care <b>centre</b> managers in two municipalities. I use the concept ‘staff quality’ in order to delimit my study and focus on how managers think of staff quality in different dimensions of day care. I have been inspired by Hans-Georg Gadamer in terms of dialogue, the to and fro movement of questions, and the hermeneutical circle of conditions for understanding. This means that I have used my own knowledge and experience as well. My research questions are: - How do <b>day</b> care <b>centre</b> managers understand the term staff quality in <b>day</b> care <b>centre?</b> - How do <b>day</b> care <b>centre</b> managers organize, control, and manage staff quality in their daily work? - What are the hinders to develop high staff quality? <b>Day</b> care <b>centre</b> managers are responsible for day care quality. I therefore wish to track their thoughts and experiences in order to get their views {{about the quality of the}} staff and their role as managers. My findings show that the <b>day</b> care <b>centre</b> manager say that they are primarily concerned with the children. Their understanding of staff quality is primarily related to the staff's ability to interact with children, which in my opinion is not surprising. Furthermore, the interviews show that managers use many tools and methods with the aim to improve staff quality. My findings also show that managers report that they spend more and more time on office work and that they have too little time for management of the educational process. The most prominent finding is that managers have complex leadership roles. It also seems to be difficult to differentiate staff quality from general quality in <b>day</b> care <b>centres.</b> The <b>day</b> care <b>centre</b> managers are constantly in some kind of movement between the different tasks and duties: a to and fro movement is indicative of their management style.
