40|$|This paper {{presents}} a document analysis system which {{is capable of}} extracting the semantics of specific text portions of structured documents. The main component {{of the system is}} the knowledge representation scheme- called hsco, Frame Representation of Structured Documents. It allows the definition of knowledge about document components as well as knowledge about analysis algorithms in a uniform, simple, but powerful representation formalism. The specific inference algorithm of Fresco is presented which combines the two different knowledge sources- the document model and the algorithmic model. The flexibility of the representation formalism Fresco and the properties of the inference algorithm are shown in two different applications, in interpreting amount <b>fields</b> on <b>cheques</b> and in analysing business letters. ...|$|R

[...] Afterwards, Thompson tried unsuccessfully to get Seattle police and the FBI to investigate Holkins and Krahulik for orchestrating [...] "criminal harassment" [...] of him through articles on their site. Other webcomics have regularly incorporated references to Thompson, alluding to this incident as well as others.|$|R
40|$|Cheques {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{accepted}} forms of payment for settling transactions. Money transactions through cheque collections are pertinent to banking and are an integral activity of any bank. It is not an optional service and hence such services by no means are a gratis. Moreover, the cost involved in collections of such cheques (local or outstation) is borne by the customers in some form or other. It was recognized as early as in the 1970 s that cheque collection policy for the banks in India is a matter of concern. Though a micro issue with respect to the whole gamut of banking, this has its macro implications keeping in mind the mass of bank account holders in India. In this paper, we study the cheque collection policy of the country for both pre and post deregulation scenario. Also, based on a multidimensional scaling technique, categorisation of 31 banks with respect to various parameters of their present cheque collection policies has been made. Although not an exhaustive study, the minimal statistics gathered and analysed leads one to believe that the existing institutional mechanism for setting up cheque collection policies is not adequate. The spirit with which RBI deregulated the cheque collection process has not got translated into the policies made by banks. It is seen that forces of competition, as a deterrent, is inadequate to improve quality service in the <b>field</b> of <b>cheque</b> collections and that the banks and the regulator have a responsibility to act proactively in the interest of the depositors. 1...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{is growing}} day-by-day {{in the current}} world scenario. Organizations are excited and worried {{at the same time}} to use cloud computing features as it will require for them to move their data on public cloud. Resource utilization is the main advantage of cloud computing which results in storing data of multiple clients in one place. Private cloud is preferred by the companies but it does not provide all the advantages of cloud computing. Cloud providers are working hard to secure their infrastructure and the stored data in cloud. To secure data, encryption is the most preferred solution. But the problem with traditional cryptographic methods is that they take huge amount of computation power and time in processing the encrypted data. Visual Cryptography is a cryptographic method which takes less amount of time to encrypt or decrypt data and can be applied in the field of cloud to improve its security parameters. It can also be used in the financial <b>field</b> such as <b>Cheque</b> Truncation System to transfer the images securely...|$|R
40|$|Automatic Cheque Processing {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{researched}} areas in document analysis and biometric. Various methodologies have been proposed in this area for Automatic Cheque Processing and forgerydetection. An account holder gives cheques to another person as account payee or self-cheque. It is been observed that a number of forgery cases have been registered as cheque forgery, where some person has forged the signature of another person and provided a self-cheque to himself. In this paper we propose a mechanism forrecognition of <b>cheque</b> <b>fields,</b> like name, amount and also verify the signature and it’s authenticity. We propose a unique two stage model of Automatic Cheque processing with detecting skilled forgery in the signature by combining two feature types namely Sum graph and HMM and classify them with knowledge based classifier and probability neural network. We proposed a unique technique of using HMM as feature rather than a classified as being widely proposed by most of the authors in signature recognition. Results show a higher falserejection than false acceptance rate. Character segmentation accuracy is found to be 95 %, character recognition efficiency 83 %, Digit recognition efficiency is 91 %. and system detects forgeries with an accuracy of 80 % and can detect the signatures with 91 % accuracy...|$|R
