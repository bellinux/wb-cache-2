40|$|During last century, {{worldwide}} environment degradation {{gets more}} and more serious, and achieving <b>environmental</b> sustainable <b>development</b> is desirable. As many environmental issues are directly or indirectly energy related, energy sustainable development {{is one of the}} most important prerequisites for <b>environmental</b> sustainable <b>development.</b> Renewable energy technologies and energy conservation are two solutions for energy sustainable development. At present, energy-saving technology is a feasible and an effective way to achieve energy and <b>environmental</b> sustainable <b>development,</b> although renewable energy may be final solution to environmental issues. Building cooling, heating, and power (BCHP) technology, which usually use natural gas as primary energy, has high efficiency of energy utilization due to the utilization of distributed power generation and heat recovery, and thus is a promising energy conservation technology. BCHP can reduce pollutants emission and thus protects the environment besides improving IAQ and increasing reliability of building energy supply. As the largest developing country, China is just in the process of adjusting energy structure and improving energy efficiency. Because of its significant role in energy and <b>environmental</b> sustainable <b>development,</b> developing BCHP in China will help the country in optimizing energy proportion, increasing energy efficiency, and protecting environment. Therefore, BCHP technology will have broad prospects in China and it will promote the country's energy and <b>environmental</b> sustainable <b>development.</b> Energy and <b>environmental</b> sustainable <b>development</b> <b>Environmental</b> impact Renewable energy Energy conservation BCHP China...|$|R

25|$|The living {{conditions}} in Mokattam Village, {{and the other}} Zabbaleen settlements, are poor. According to Assad, in the 1970s, “the streets were so stacked with heaps of assorted refuse {{that some of them}} could not be located. The air was heavily polluted by the smoke generated from fires that were either lit deliberately to dispose of unwanted waste, or resulted from the spontaneous combustion of organic residues.” There have been frequent fires in Mokattam, two of which were particularly severe and devastated the settlement in the 1970s. In its early years, the Mokattam Settlement lacked basic services; there were no health centers, pharmacies, or schools. Basic amenities such as piped water, sewage networks, and electricity were also missing. During the beginning decades of the Mokattam settlement, the community suffered from “high mortality and morbidity rates (especially among children), poor environmental conditions, and low income.” In 1983, the average household income per month was estimated at LE 70(approximately US$11.50 in January 2005) within the lowest 10th percentile of national urban income levels, with an average large household size of 8 persons. However, the {{living conditions}} of the Mokattam settlement improved after the Mokattam settlement received significant funding from the World Bank, in its upgrading program known as the Zabbaleen <b>Environmental</b> <b>Development</b> Program (ZEDP) in 1981 and from other international donors.|$|E
