5|$|I {{shall never}} write an Opera more. As <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> wish to invent an {{arbitrary}} title for my works, I will call them Dramas...|$|E
5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|I do not, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt your Lordships do not, {{have any}} wish {{to expand the}} role of the {{judiciary}} at the expense of any other organ of the State or to seek to frustrate the properly expressed wish of Parliament as contained in legislation. The attribution in certain quarters of such a wish to the judiciary is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts are bound to apply.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Rather say already pleased,' said John. 'I have {{scarcely}} seen her. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> care to see her. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{eyes for}} HER, this morning.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{right to}} ask any more questions. I left no message nor any name, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> excuse for saying I would call again.|$|R
60|$|Add to this, that if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{ventured to}} disoblige this gentleman, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{friend in the}} world to <b>have</b> {{recourse}} to; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> prospect--no, not of a bit of bread; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> nothing before me but to fall back into the same misery that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been in before.|$|R
5|$|Liu was {{the first}} person of Chinese {{nationality}} to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the first to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China. Liu was the third person to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize while in prison or detention after Germany's Carl von Ossietzky (1935) and Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi (1991). As the laureate was absent, Liu's place on the podium was unoccupied; Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann read <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>No</b> Enemies, an essay that Liu had written for his trial in December 2009, in place of the acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5000|$|Fifteen {{years ago}} I slept in my car, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> finances, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> education, and <b>I</b> just said one day, if I could hook {{myself to the}} proper vehicle {{to get a break}} in life and make some money, I would help other people.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a sudden}} silence. I was still left in the darkness; feeling nothing, hearing nothing. Even the {{consciousness}} that I was lying on my bed deserted me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea that <b>I</b> was in the bedroom; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> knowledge of where I was.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{less than}} five several morning dresses besides these, so that I need never be seen twice in the same dress; to these he added several parcels of fine linen and of lace, so much that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> room to ask for more, or, indeed, for so much.|$|R
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> more fire.|$|E
25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed S.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that {{is nothing}} {{compared}} with his entire want of gentility. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea {{that he could be}} so very clownish, so totally without air. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> imagined him, <b>I</b> confess, a degree or two nearer gentility." ...|$|R
50|$|Sledge Hammer: Oh yes, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{groceries}} at all.|$|R
6000|$|The long scar turned deeper purple than ever. 'Only {{so far as}} that I {{said there}} still be rights <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> power to resign,' said Berenger. 'And {{then he began to}} prove to me---what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> mind to hear' (and his voice trembled) '---all that I know but too well.' ...|$|R
25|$|African Americans... {{were the}} only Americans who were enslaved for two centuries, but we were far from the only Americans {{suffering}} discrimination then and now.... Sexual disposition parallels race. I was born this way. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> choice. I wouldn't change it if I could. Sexuality is unchangeable.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{difficulty}} {{accepting the}} appellants' contention that {{whether or not}} sexual orientation is based on biological or physiological factors, which may {{be a matter of}} some controversy, it is a deeply personal characteristic that is either unchangeable or changeable only at unacceptable personal costs, and so falls within the ambit of s. 15 protection as being analogous to the enumerated grounds.|$|E
25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether I {{could make the}} film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and I said I could not. You will not believe this, but the day the film was released, I saw the same judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> complaints.|$|E
60|$|I was {{not pleased}} with this part at all, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> mind {{to let him go}} neither, and yet <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> mind to give him such hold of me as he would have had; and thus I was in a kind of suspense, irresolute, and {{doubtful}} what course to take.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{answer to}} that. I could say <b>no</b> more than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> said already.|$|R
60|$|I muttered, grumpily, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{particular}} {{respect for}} Falk.|$|R
25|$|This case tho' {{depending}} upon a practice not common {{in this country}} {{is by no means a}} difficult one. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but I should not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.|$|E
25|$|I {{wrote in}} {{detail about the}} Holocaust and said I {{did not want to}} discuss numbers. I quoted an {{argument}} between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned. One wrote there were 12million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> desire to argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust was a terrible thing and nobody can claim I denied it.|$|E
25|$|When I am in my painting, I'm {{not aware}} of what I'm doing. It is only after a sort of 'get acquainted' period that I see what I have been about. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> fear of making changes, {{destroying}} the image, etc., because the painting has {{a life of its}} own. I try to let it come through. It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.|$|E
60|$|Once more, I stammered with {{difficulty}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> objection.|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gazed on too many {{wonders of the}} human in my wild and varied years to be {{affected}} to foolish acts by this particular wonder. I was all serenity. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> word to say. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> judgment to pass. I knew that things were occurring beyond my comprehension, and that they must occur.|$|R
60|$|ANNIE. [Flattered] Yes, sir. 'E said <b>I</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>no</b> {{strength}} of mind.|$|R
25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. I thought {{this was the best}} way to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. We never got the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> excuses to offer.|$|E
25|$|I {{have spent}} 70 {{years of study}} and travel in order to equip myself with {{information}} that would enable me to speak and write with authority on the course of world affairs. The authority I have sought is not in any sense political. It is the authority that results from collecting and classifying information on a scientific level and interpreting facts as I have found them. Since I do not speak with political authority <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> means of communicating my conclusions except by putting them in print myself and distributing them in the most advantageous way that is available to a private citizen.|$|E
25|$|Finally, on 1 December, {{the crisis}} ended when Bjelke-Petersen {{announced}} his retirement from politics. He declared: The policies of the National Party are no longer those on which I went to the people. Therefore <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> wish to lead the Government any longer. It was my intention to take this matter {{to the floor of}} State Parliament. However, I now have no further interest in leading the National Party any further.Three months later, Bjelke-Petersen called on voters at the federal by-election in Groom to support the Liberal candidate instead of the National contestant. Bjelke-Petersen said the Nationals had lost their way and turned their backs on traditional conservative policies.|$|E

60|$|What {{followed}} {{happened in}} an instant. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> power to interfere.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{bought me}} a Farfisa organ and I started playing that. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea {{of what to do}} with it, so I started to steal my own guitar licks. I would get these reviews saying what a unique style <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> The reality was that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea what <b>I</b> was doing. Of course, {{eventually}} I did learn to play it.|$|R
