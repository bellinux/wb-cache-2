5000|$|Chlorine dioxide is a {{water soluble}} {{chemical}} compound used as predominantly used in bleach. Bleaching agents make the flour appear whiter, {{as well as}} oxidize the surfaces of the flour grains {{to help with the}} development of gluten. Chlorine Dioxide can also be used as a dough conditioner which can help make the dough firm and decrease mixing time.  Using Chlorine Dioxide in baking can improve the texture, size and surface smoothness of bakery goods.(L-cysteine hydrochloride is a non-essential amino acid formed by the body and is used in the baking industry as a dough conditioner. This chemical compound breaks the bonds of gluten to lower the viscosity, which enhances the <b>dough</b> <b>rising</b> <b>process</b> during baking. This additive also helps to keep the doughs shape by preventing shrinkage during freezing. L-cysteine is a non-essential amino acid that the human body can obtain by converting the essential amino acid methionine.  It is commonly sold as a dough conditioner in the form of L-cysteine hydrochloride. In bread, flour and whole wheat flour, 90 p.p.m. of L-cysteine hydrochloride is allowed for using in Canada.  In unstandardized bakery products, Good Manufacturing Practice is followed.  In baking, L-cysteine hydrochloride acts by disrupting the gluten disulfide bonds, which reduces the viscosity of the dough and therefore makes it easier to work the dough and helps the dough to rise while giving it more elasticity.  In addition, L-cysteine keeps dough shape and prevents shrinkage during dough freezing.|$|E
40|$|Besides the {{ingredient}} composition, another {{important thing in}} the process of making dough is proofing, ie. <b>dough</b> <b>rising</b> <b>process</b> prior to roasting process. Proofing process requires a stable temperature to ensure that the dough is well rising. The purpose of this research is to make a proofing machine that uses DHT 11 as a temperature sensor. P roportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is implemented to guarantee that the machine remains at the temperature of 35 0 Celcius, in which the fermentation process would success. PID control has been implemented in fluorescent lamp which been set its dim light to generate heat until it reach a predetermined set point value. The temperature was monitored using LCD and set to remain stable with the help of fan. The proofing process will last for 15 minutes which ended by the sound of the buzzer. The testing result shows that the value of,, will reach set point value within 120 seconds. </div...|$|E
40|$|In the low {{class of}} small scale wheat flour based industries, price {{attribute}} played {{the most important}} role in choosing wheat flour, followed by <b>dough</b> <b>rising,</b> accessibility, <b>dough</b> elasticity, flavour and colour. The medium class wheat flour based industries had different considerations - price, <b>dough</b> elasticity, <b>dough</b> <b>rising,</b> flavour, accessibility and colour. The price attribute had still the first consideration in choosing wheat flour in the high class of small scale industries and than followed by accessibility, <b>dough</b> elasticity, <b>dough</b> <b>rising,</b> flavour and colour. This research also showed, that the most preferred wheat flour brand by small scale industries base in wheat flour were Cakra Kembang (50 %), Segitiga Biru (43 %), Beruang Biru (2, 8 %), Kunci Biru (1, 4 %), Melati (1, 4 %) and Raflesia (1, 4 %) ...|$|R

50|$|Nevertheless, it is {{possible}} to make a high-rising, light loaf of 100% whole-wheat bread, as long as one increases the water content of the dough (the bran and germ in whole wheat absorb more water than plain white flour), kneads the dough {{for a longer period of}} time to develop the gluten adequately, and allows for a longer rise before shaping the dough. Some bakers let the <b>dough</b> <b>rise</b> twice before shaping. The addition of fats, such as butter or oil, and milk products (fresh milk, powdered milk, buttermilk, yogurt, etc.) can also greatly assist the <b>dough</b> in <b>rising.</b>|$|R
50|$|Malt powder {{comes in}} two forms: diastatic and nondiastatic. Diastatic malt {{contains}} enzymes that break down starch into sugar; {{this is the}} form bakers add to bread dough to help the <b>dough</b> <b>rise</b> and create a certain crust. Nondiastatic malt has no active enzymes and is used primarily for flavor, mostly in beverages. It sometimes contains sugar, coloring agents, and other additives.|$|R
50|$|The Copernicus Science Centre also organizes Family Workshops, where {{children}} (5-8 years old) {{together with their}} parents or carers can carry out experiments to help them better understand everyday phenomena (e.g. where does the current in electrical outlets come from, how does a TV set work or why does yeast make <b>dough</b> <b>rise).</b> The children can easily repeat the experiments themselves at home.|$|R
50|$|A bear claw is a sweet, yeast-raised pastry, {{similar to}} a Danish, {{originating}} in the United States during the mid-1920s. A bear claw is usually filled with almond paste, and sometimes raisins, and often shaped in a semicircle with slices along the curved edge, or rectangular with partial slices along one side. As the <b>dough</b> <b>rises,</b> the sections separate, evoking {{the shape of a}} bear's toes.|$|R
50|$|It has a {{reputation}} for being difficult to prepare, so in many households, superstitions and special customs are attached to the baking process. When making vánočka, it is said that one must think of everyone dear to you. Another custom is to avoid touching silver or metal to the vánočka. Finally, the person who is making the vánočka should jump up and down while the <b>dough</b> <b>rises.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the <b>dough</b> <b>rises,</b> it is torn {{into small}} balls, spread into flat rounds and fried in oil. In some recipes, yeast, bread soda, milk or yogurt might be used. A recipe from Silistra {{involves}} yogurt and bread soda, {{one from a}} village near Stara Zagora uses yeast and yogurt, and a recipe from Aytos suggests yeast and milk. It is recommended that the shaping of mekitsi before their frying be done with wet hands.|$|R
5000|$|Azodicarbonamide {{is used as}} a {{bleaching}} agent in flour and helps the <b>dough</b> <b>rise</b> through its conditioning properties.There is however public concern over the use of azodicarbonamide being used in yoga mats and other plastic foams, as it has been associated with respiratory problems. [...] A Canadian expert argues that respiratory problems associated with azodicarbonamide are associated with workers in industrial plants who inhale the chemical, which is the reason some countries have banned this additive.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth step}} is the baking process. Also known as “pastry lift” or “dough lift,” the dough expands as water is {{converted}} to steam, thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer. As a result, the croissant <b>dough</b> <b>rises</b> up to yield its characteristic flaky texture. Depending {{on the type of}} oven used and specific size of the croissant, the baking time can range from 10-20 minutes and the oven temperature can be set anywhere from 165 °C to 205 °C.|$|R
50|$|In bread baking, {{kneading}} can {{be substituted}} by allowing a relatively wet, low-yeast <b>dough</b> to <b>rise</b> for more than twelve hours; this method {{is referred to as}} no-knead bread.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{forms of}} yeast Fleischmann’s make are: cubes or [...] "cakes" [...] of {{compressed}} fresh yeast wrapped in foil, an original form of packaged yeast that {{is soft and}} perishable; packets of Active Dry Yeast, a shelf stable granular yeast invented by Fleischmann during WWII; packets of RapidRise yeast intended to reduce <b>dough</b> <b>rising</b> time {{by as much as}} fifty percent by bypassing the first rise; bread machine yeast, an instant yeast sold in a glass jar; and pizza crust yeast, an instant yeast packaged with dough relaxers intended {{to reduce the amount of}} time needed to make a fresh pizza crust.|$|R

50|$|Soda bread farl is a soft, {{thick and}} fluffy bread. It was first baked in the 1800s in Ireland, and local people used baking soda {{to cause the}} <b>dough</b> to <b>rise.</b> It's {{typically}} served with an Ulster fry.|$|R
50|$|Gabby then advises Woody {{that his}} hotel likes to tuck their guests in at night. In reality, Gabby puts Woody {{in a baking}} pan, and places dough on top of him. Woody catches on to this plan, and replaces the {{standard}} <b>dough</b> with Quick <b>Rise</b> Baking Powder. Unaware, Gabby bakes the pie, sending the <b>rising</b> <b>dough</b> high above his home, eventually splattering all over southern Florida.|$|R
5000|$|Flour {{treatment}} agents (also called improving agents, bread improvers, dough conditioners and dough improvers) are {{food additives}} combined with flour to improve baking functionality. Flour treatment agents {{are used to}} increase the speed of <b>dough</b> <b>rising</b> and to improve the strength and workability of the dough. While they are an important component of modern factory baking, some small-scale bakers reject them in favour of longer fermentation periods that produce greater depth of flavour.There are wide ranges of these conditioners used in factory baking, which fall into four main categories: bleaching agents, oxidizing and reducing agents, enzymes, and emulsifiers. These agents are often sold as mixtures in a soy flour base, as only small amounts are required.|$|R
50|$|Leavening agents cause <b>dough</b> to <b>rise</b> by {{producing}} carbon dioxide. Baker's yeast produces carbon dioxide by fermentation of sugars within the dough, while chemical leaveners such as {{baking powder and}} baking soda release carbon dioxide when heated or if exposed to acids.|$|R
5000|$|Ethanol {{fermentation}} causes bread <b>dough</b> to <b>rise.</b> Yeast organisms consume sugars in {{the dough}} and produce ethanol {{and carbon dioxide}} as waste products. The carbon dioxide forms bubbles in the dough, expanding it a foam. Less than 2% ethanol remains after baking.|$|R
50|$|A dough proofer is {{a warming}} chamber used in baking that {{encourages}} fermentation of dough by yeast through warm temperatures and controlled humidity. It is also called a proofing box, proofing oven or proofing cabinet. The warm temperatures increase {{the activity of}} the yeast, resulting in increased carbon dioxide production and a higher, faster <b>rise.</b> <b>Dough</b> is typically allowed to rise in the proofer before baking, but can also be used for the first rise, or bulk fermentation. Desired proofer temperatures can range from around 70F / 21C up to about 115F / 46C (cooler temperatures are achieved in a dough retarder, see below). Commercial bakers typically use large, temperature- and humidity-controlled proofers, whereas home bakers employ a variety of methods to create a warm, humid environment for <b>dough</b> <b>rising.</b> Examples include a home oven with a bowl of water and the pilot light on, a box with a bowl of hot water in it (the water is replaced periodically to maintain warmth), or a counter top proofer (an electric appliance) designed for home use.|$|R
40|$|The rapid carrier {{capture and}} {{relaxation}} processes in InAs/GaAs quantum dots were studied at 77 K {{by using a}} simple degenerate pump-probe technique. A <b>rising</b> <b>process</b> was observed in the transient reflectivity, following the initial fast relaxation associated with GaAs bulk matrix, and this <b>rising</b> <b>process</b> was assigned {{to be related to}} the carrier capture from the GaAs barriers to InAs layers. The assignment was modeled using Kramers-Kronig relation. By analyzing the <b>rising</b> <b>process</b> observed in the transient reflectivity, the carrier capture time constants were obtained. The measured capture times decrease with the increase of carrier concentration...|$|R
50|$|Brioche à tête or parisienne {{is perhaps}} the most classically {{recognized}} form: it is formed and baked in a fluted round, flared tin; a large ball of dough is placed on the bottom and topped with a smaller ball of dough to form the head (tête). Brioche Nanterre is a loaf of brioche made in a standard loaf pan. Instead of shaping two pieces of dough and baking them together, two rows of small pieces of dough are placed in the pan. Loaves are then proofed (allowed to rise) in the pan, fusing the pieces together. During the baking process the balls of <b>dough</b> <b>rise</b> further and form an attractive pattern.Brioche can also be made in a pan without being rolled into balls to make an ordinary loaf.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, two enterprising Milanese bakers began to produce panettone in large {{quantities}} {{in the rest of}} Italy. In 1919, Angelo Motta started producing his eponymous brand of cakes. It was also Motta who revolutionised the traditional panettone by giving it its tall domed shape by making the <b>dough</b> <b>rise</b> three times, for almost 20 hours, before cooking, giving it its now-familiar light texture. The recipe was adapted shortly after by another baker, Gioacchino Alemagna, around 1925, who also gave his name to a popular brand that still exists today. The stiff competition between the two that then ensued led to industrial production of the cake. Nestlé took over the brands together in the late 1990s, but Bauli, an Italian bakery company based in Verona, has acquired Motta and Alemagna from Nestlé.|$|R
5000|$|In the Indian {{state of}} Kerala, toddy {{is used in}} {{leavening}} (as a substitute for yeast) a local form of hopper called the [...] "Vellayappam". Toddy is mixed with rice dough and left over night to aid in fermentation and expansion of the dough causing the <b>dough</b> to <b>rise</b> overnight, making the bread soft when prepared.|$|R
5000|$|Secondly, and {{probably}} most importantly, {{it is the}} first known printed American call for the use of a chemical leavening agent that was the precursor to modern baking powder, used to cause <b>dough</b> to <b>rise</b> in baking. At that time, it was known as potash, pearl ash, pearlash, or alkali. Contrast this method with others, such as using yeast.|$|R
50|$|Fermentation {{typically}} {{begins when}} viable baker's yeast or a starter culture {{is added to}} flour and water. Enzymes in the flour and yeast create sugars, which are consumed by the yeast, who in turn produce carbon dioxide and alcohol. Specifically, the grain enzyme diastase begins to convert starch in the grain to maltose. The baker's yeast enzyme maltase converts maltose into glucose, invertase converts any added sucrose to glucose and fructose, and zymase converts glucose and fructose to carbon dioxide gas which makes the <b>dough</b> <b>rise,</b> and alcohol which gives the baked bread flavor. Sourdough starters also produce lactic and acetic acids, further contributing to flavor. When the yeast cells die, they release high quantities of a protease which snip protein strands, and in large dieoffs result in soft, sticky dough, less baked volume and a coarse crumb, but in smaller dieoffs, increase dough extensibility and baked volume.|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of various}} {{xylanase}} treatments applied {{at different stages}} of bread making process on dough rheological characteristics and bread quality attributes were investigated. Different doses (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 IU) of purified enzyme were applied at two stages (tempering and mixing). In milling and dough making processes, both types of flour (subjected to enzyme treatment during tempering and flour mixing) exhibited decreasing trend in water absorption, dough development time, dough stability, softening of dough, dough mixing time, viscosity peak, set back, and increasing tendency in peak height and pasting temperature. Treatments during tempering resulted in more significant effects as compared to applications during flour mixing. The <b>dough</b> <b>rising</b> during proofing resulted in enhancement from 137 ± 3. 21 % (control) to maximum value (192. 33 ± 2. 90 %), when 600 IU of xylanases were applied to 1 kg of wheat grains during tempering. The bread sensory attributes also exhibited significant improvement in response to various doses of purified enzymes...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the carrier capture and relaxation processes in InAs/GaAs quantum dots can be detected by a simple degenerate pump-probe technique.
