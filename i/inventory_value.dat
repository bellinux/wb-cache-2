The BlackBerry PlayBook was officially released to U.S. and Canadian consumers on April 19, 2011. The PlayBook was criticized for being rushed to market in an incomplete state and sold poorly. Following the shipments of 900,000 tablets during its first three quarters on market, slow sales and inventory pileups prompted the company to reduce prices and to write down the <b>inventory</b> <b>value</b> by $485 million.|$|E

Which method an accountant selects can {{have a significant effect}} on net income and book value and, in turn, on taxation. Using LIFO accounting for inventory, a company generally reports lower net income and lower book value, due to the effects of inflation. This generally results in lower taxation. Due to LIFO's potential to skew <b>inventory</b> <b>value,</b> UK GAAP and IAS have effectively banned LIFO inventory accounting. LIFO accounting is permitted in the United States subject to section 472 of the Internal Revenue Code.|$|E
2500|$|Marx himself famously {{stated in}} chapter 9 of Capital, Volume III {{that he had}} {{previously}} assumed that, to the purchasing capitalist, {{the value of a}} commodity bought was equal to its cost-price. In reality, he argued, this cost-price is itself a market price based on a production price (a cost-price + a profit) of the supplying capitalist producer: the input purchasing price of one capitalist is the output selling price of another capitalist. So the acquisition cost-price of inputs itself corresponded to both a value and a surplus value, and the market prices of inputs might diverge from the labor-value of inputs. [...] Hence, said Marx, if the cost-price of a newly produced output is assumed to be equal to the labor-value of the inputs used up in producing it, [...] "it is always possible to go wrong" [...] in the calculation of the output production price (because input acquisition prices and input labor-values could diverge, given that inputs could be bought above or below their value, and given that their <b>inventory</b> <b>value</b> could change during the production process).|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the relationship between Integrated Cost Management Systems (ICMS) and Operational Decision-Making (ODM). ICMS is a framework that emphasizes the relationship between information flows and decision-making at various levels of the organization by seeking to identify those essential data elements that must be shared between individuals, team, departments, processes and entities for effective coordinated decision-making and action to occur. The operationalized definition of the ICMS theoretical construct {{in this study is}} encapsulated in the concepts of Traditional (full) absorption costing (TAC), Throughput Accounting (TA), and Activity-Based Costing (ABC). While, Operational Decision Making (ODM) was operationalized via the factory floor measures of work –in-process <b>inventory</b> <b>values,</b> finished goods <b>inventory</b> <b>values,</b> cycle time and number of jobs in the shop. The result found that there is a positive and significant relationship between ICMS and ODM.

50|$|Under certain circumstances, {{valuation}} of inventory based on cost is impractical.

This method allows declines in <b>inventory</b> <b>value</b> to be offset against income of the period. When goods are damaged or obsolete, and can only be sold for below purchase prices, they should be recorded at net realizable value.

40|$|We study {{trade between}} an {{informed}} seller and an uninformed buyer who have existing inventories of assets {{similar to those}} being traded. We show that these inventories may lead to prices that increase even absent changes in fundamentals (a “run-up”), but may also make trade impossible (a “freeze”) and hamper information dissemination. Competition may amplify the run-up by inducing buyers to enter loss-making trades at high prices to prevent a competitor from purchasing {{at a lower price}} and releasing bad news about <b>inventory</b> <b>values.</b> <b>Inventories</b> also prevent seller competition from delivering the Bertrand outcome, in which prices match sellers’valuations.

In contrast to the traditional [...] "binge and purge" [...] inventory cycle in which companies over-purchase product to prepare for possible demand spikes and then discards extra product, inventory optimization seeks to more efficiently match supply to expected customer demand.
