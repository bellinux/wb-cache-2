40|$|Abelson {{murine leukemia}} virus induces {{oligoclonal}} pre-B lymphoma in mice. The expression of the v-abl oncogene in target cells {{does not appear to}} be sufficient for tumor induction in several mouse strains, and additional genetic events are thought to be required. We postulated that the helper Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} might induce these events, and its potential role as an insertional mutagen was assessed by the search of a common <b>helper</b> <b>provirus</b> integration site in Abelson murine leukemia virus lymphomas. Molecular cloning of cellular sequences adjacent to Moloney proviruses enabled us to identify a cellular region, designated Ahi- 1, which was found occupied by the helper proviruses in 16 % of Abelson pre-B-cell lymphomas. All proviruses for which the precise integration site within Ahi- 1 could be mapped were found to be in the same orientation. Ahi- 1 has been mapped to mouse chromosome 10 and represents a new common proviral integration site. These data suggest that the helper virus contributes to the induction of secondary genetic events which may be important for the development of Abelson murine leukemia virus-induced pre-B-cell lymphoma...|$|E
40|$|The ras {{genes of}} BALB and Harvey sarcoma viruses contain point {{mutations}} in codon 12 or codons 12 and 59, relative to proto-ras from normal animal and human cells. By {{in vitro recombination}} between cloned rat proto-ras and cloned BALB and Harvey sarcoma proviruses, we constructed recombinant proviruses with normal proto-ras-coding regions. These recombinant proviruses transformed mouse 3 T 3 cells upon transfection. However, when the transforming efficiencies of proviral DNAs were compared after transfection with <b>helper</b> <b>provirus,</b> recombinant proviruses were 2 to 30 times less efficient than the corresponding wild-type proviruses. Recombinant sarcoma viruses isolated from cells transformed by cloned proviral DNA contained the expected normal ras-coding region. They transformed rat embryo cells and induced erythroblastosis and sarcomas in newborn mice as efficiently as wild-type viruses did. We conclude that conversion of normal proto-ras genes to viral ras genes depends on truncation of normal proto-ras regulatory elements and substitution by retroviral (long terminal repeat) promoters and that the transforming function of long terminal repeat-ras genes is enhanced by point mutations...|$|E
40|$|Two {{chimeric}} helper proviruses {{were derived}} from the provirus of the ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus by replacing the 5 'long terminal repeat and adjacent proviral sequences with the mouse metallothionein I promoter. One of these chimeric proviruses was designed to express the gag-pol genes of the virus, whereas the other was designed to express only the env gene. When transfected into NIH 3 T 3 cells, these helper proviruses failed to generate competent virus but did express Zn 2 +-inducible trans-acting viral functions needed to assemble infectious vectors. One helper cell line (clone 32) supported vector assembly at levels comparable to those supported by the Psi- 2 and PA 317 cell lines transfected with the same vector. Defective proviruses which carry the neomycin phosphotransferase gene and which lack overlapping sequence homology with the 5 ' end of the chimeric helper proviruses could be transfected into the helper cell line without generation of replication-competent virus. Mass cultures of transfected helper cells produced titers of about 10 (4) G 418 r CFU/ml, whereas individual clones produced titers between 0 and 2. 6 X 10 (4) CFU/ml. In contrast, defective proviruses which share homologous overlapping viral sequences with the 5 ' end of the chimeric helper proviruses readily generated infectious virus when transfected into the helper cell line. The deletion of multiple cis-acting functions from the <b>helper</b> <b>provirus</b> and elimination of sequence homology overlapping at the 5 ' ends of helper and vector proviruses both contribute to the increased genetic stability of this system...|$|E
40|$|Abelson {{murine leukemia}} virus (A-MuLV) can induce pre-B- or T-cell lymphomas (thymomas) in mice {{depending}} on the route and time of injection. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the choice of the helper virus used to rescue A-MuLV greatly influences its ability to induce pre-B-cell lymphomas. In this study, we investigated the role of the helper virus in A-MuLV-induced thymomas. A-MuLV rescued with the helper Moloney MuLV, BALB/c endogenous N-tropic MuLV, and two chimeric MuLVs derived from these two parents were injected intrathymically in young adult NIH Swiss mice. All four A-MuLV pseudotypes were found to be equally efficient in the induction of thymomas, whereas drastic differences were observed in their pre-B-cell lymphomagenic potential. Thymoma induction by A-MuLV was independent of the replication potential of the helper virus in the thymus, and no helper proviral sequences could be detected in the majority of thymomas induced by A-MuLV rescued with parental BALB/c endogenous or chimeric MuLVs. In the thymomas in which <b>helper</b> <b>proviruses</b> were present, none of them were found integrated in the Ahi- 1 region, a common proviral integration site found in A-MuLV-induced pre-B-cell lymphomas (Y. Poirer, C. Kozak, and P. Jolicoeur, J. Virol. 62 : 3985 - 3992, 1988). In addition, helper-free stocks of A-MuLV were found to be as lymphomagneic as other pseudotypes in inducing thymomas after intrathymic inoculation, in contrast to their inability to induce pre-B-cell lymphomas when injected intraperitoneally in newborn mice. Restriction enzyme analysis revealed one to three A-MuLV proviruses in each thymoma, indicating the oligoclonality of these tumors. Analysis of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor loci confirmed that the major population of cells of these primary thymomas belongs to the T-cell lineage. Together, these results indicate that the helper virus has no effect in the induction of A-MuLV-induced T-cell lymphomas, in contrast to its important role in the induction of A-MuLV-induced pre-B-cell lymphomas. Our data also revealed distinct biological requirements for transformation of these two target cells by v-abl...|$|R
40|$|A {{naturally}} occurring feline thymic lymphosarcoma (T 17) provided the unique observation of a T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain gene (v-tcr) transduced by a retrovirus. The primary tumor contained three classes of {{feline leukemia virus}} (FeLV) provirus, which have now been characterized in more detail as (i) v-tcr-containing recombinant proviruses, (ii) v-myc-containing recombinant proviruses, and (iii) apparently full-length <b>helper</b> FeLV <b>proviruses.</b> The two transductions {{appear to have been}} independent events, with distinct recombinational junctions and no sequence overlap in the host-derived inserts. The T 17 tumor cell line releases large numbers of FeLV particles of low infectivity; all three genomes are encapsidated, but passage of FeLV-T 17 on feline fibroblast and lymphoma cells led to selective loss of the recombinant viruses. The oncogenic potential of the T 17 virus complex was, therefore, tested by infection of neonatal cats with virus harvested directly from the primary T 17 tumor cell line. A single inoculation of FeLV-T 17 caused persistent low-grade infection culminating in thymic lymphosarcoma and acute thymic atrophy, which was accelerated by coinfection with the weakly pathogenic FeLV subgroup A (FeLV-A) /Glasgow- 1 helper. Molecularly cloned FeLV-tcr virus (T- 31) rescued for replication by a weakly pathogenic FeLV-A/Glasgow- 1 helper virus was similarly tested in vivo and induced thymic atrophy and thymic lymphosarcomas. Most FeLV-T 17 -induced tumors manifested either v-myc or an activated c-myc allele and had undergone rearrangement of endogenous T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain genes, supporting the proposition that the oncogenic effects of c-myc linked to the FeLV long terminal repeat are targeted to a specific window in T-cell differentiation. However, neither the FeLV-T 17 -induced tumors nor the T- 31 + FeLV-A-induced tumors contained clonally represented v-tcr sequences. Only one of the FeLV-T 17 -induced tumors contained detectable v-tcr proviruses, at a low copy number. While v-tcr does not have a readily transmissible oncogenic function, a more restricted role is not excluded, perhaps involving antigenic peptide-major histocompatibility complex recognition by the T-cell receptor complex. Such a function could be obscured by the genetic diversity of the outbred domestic cat host...|$|R
40|$|The Ahi- 1 locus was {{initially}} {{identified as a}} common <b>helper</b> <b>provirus</b> integration site in Abelson pre-B-cell lymphomas and shown to be {{closely linked to the}} c-myb proto-oncogene. Since no significant alteration of c-myb expression was found in Abelson murine leukemia virus-induced pre-B-lymphomas harboring a provirus inserted within the Ahi- 1 locus, this suggested that it harbors another gene whose dysregulation is involved in tumor formation. Here we report the identification of a novel gene (Ahi- 1) targeted by these provirus insertional mutations and the cloning of its cDNA. The Ahi- 1 proviral insertions were found at the 3 â€² end of the gene, in an inverse transcriptional orientation, with most of them located around and downstream of the last exon, whereas another insertion was within intron 22. In addition, another previously identified provirus insertion site, Mis- 2, was found to map within the 16 th intron of the Ahi- 1 gene. The Ahi- 1 cDNA encodes a 1, 047 -amino-acid protein. The predicted Ahi- 1 protein is a modular protein that contains one SH 3 motif and seven WD 40 repeats. The Ahi- 1 gene is conserved in mammals and encodes two major RNA species of 5 and 4. 2 kb and several other shorter splicing variants. The Ahi- 1 gene is expressed in mouse embryos and in several organs of the mouse and rat, notably at high levels in the brain and testes. In tumor cells harboring insertional mutations in Ahi- 1, truncated Ahi- 1 /viral fused transcripts were identified, including some splicing variants with deletion of the SH 3 domain. Therefore, Ahi- 1 is a novel gene targeted by provirus insertion and encoding a protein that exhibits several features of a signaling molecule. Thus, Ahi- 1 may {{play an important role in}} signal transduction in normal cells and may be involved in tumor development, possibly in cooperation with other oncogenes (such as v-abl and c-myc) or with a tumor suppressor gene (Nf 1), since Ahi- 1 insertion sites were identified in tumors harboring v-abl defective retroviruses or a c-myc transgene or in tumors exhibiting deletion of Nf 1...|$|E
40|$|Ahi- 1 was {{initially}} {{identified as a}} common <b>helper</b> <b>provirus</b> integration site on mouse chromosome 10 in 16 % of Abelson pre-B-cell lymphomas and shown to be closely linked to Myb proto-oncogene. By using long-range restriction mapping, we have mapped the Ahi- 1 locus approximately 35 kbp downstream of the Myb gene. To test whether provirus integration in the Ahi- 1 region enhances the expression of Myb by cis-acting mechanism, we have also examined Myb gene expression in A-MuLV-induced pre-B-lymphomas. Our data have revealed {{that there is no}} clear evidence for such activation in the tumors we have tested, indicating that provirus insertion in the Ahi- 1 region may activate a novel gene, apparently involved in tumor formation. In addition, another provirus integration site which was identified in 14 % of immature T-cell thymomas induced by Mo-MuLV infection of MMTV${{ rm D} over C}$-Myc transgenic mice has recently been mapped within the Ahi- 1 region. We have used exon amplification to identify genes that may cooperate with v-Ab 1 or c-Myc in B- and T-cell transformation. We have indeed identified a novel Ahi- 1 gene which encodes two major RNA species of 2 kbp and 5 kbp. The Ahi- 1 gene is expressed in several organs of the mouse and rat and is highly expressed in brain and testis. One cluster of the proviruses was found to integrate 3 $ sp prime$ of noncoding region of the Ahi- 1 in an inverse transcriptional orientation. The Ahi- 1 is highly conserved in evolution and encodes a 297 amino acid protein. The predicted Ahi- 1 protein contains a SH 3 domain and four potential SH 3 -binding sites, which function to mediate specific protein-protein interactions during signaling. The human homologue of the Ahi- 1 gene has been cloned and mapped to chromosome 6 q 23 - 24, and located approximately 330 kbp downstream of the Myb gene. The Ahi- 1 is a novel gene which may play important roles in the signal transduction and tumor development. Mis- 2 and Mis- 4 loci were identified as two new common provirus integration sites in Moloney MuLV-induced thymomas. Mis- 2 has been mapped on mouse chromosome 10 and located 160 and 40 kbp downstream of Myb and Ahi- 1 genes. The Mis- 4 locus has been located on chromosome 15 at about 60 and 30 kbp downstream of Myc and Mlvi- 4 genes. Myc RNA levels are elevated in tumors harboring a Mis- 4 rearrangement compared with some of those with no Mis- 4 rearrangement, indicating that provirus integration affected Myc expression by long-distance activation. Both loci may contain novel genes involved in tumor formation...|$|E
