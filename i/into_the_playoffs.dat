5|$|The current {{head coach}} for the Chargers is Anthony Lynn, who {{replaced}} Mike McCoy after he was fired {{at the end of}} the 2016 season. In 2007, Norv Turner had led the team to a win in the playoffs for the first time since Bobby Ross in 1992. Turner was fired on December 31, 2012, after six seasons in charge of the franchise. Marty Schottenheimer, the head coach before Turner, led the team <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> in 2004 and 2006, but they were unsuccessful both times. Six coaches—Gillman, Don Coryell, Ross, Schottenheimer, Turner and McCoy—have led the Chargers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs.</b>|$|E

Of those seven, Lopez is the only one inducted as a manager.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the Avalanche {{were forced}} to lose many of their key players {{in order to stay}} below the salary cap. Even with the loss of {{teammates}} Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote, Sakic still helped the Avalanche get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs,</b> where they eventually lost to the Anaheim Ducks in the conference semi-finals. In June 2006, Sakic signed a one-year, $5.75 million deal to keep him with the Avalanche for the 2006–07 season. Upon the retirement of Steve Yzerman a month later, on July 3, 2006, Sakic became the League leader for most NHL career points scored among active players.|$|E
5|$|He {{was named}} to the second all-star team and was named a finalist for the Norris Trophy as the league's top defenceman. His coach, Terry Murray, praised Doughty for his {{improvement}} during the season. Doughty helped lead the Kings <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> {{for the first time since}} 2002, though they lost their first round series to the Vancouver Canucks. He played all six games of the series despite suffering a wrist injury in the first game that forced him to decline an invitation to play for Canada at the 2010 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships.|$|E

5|$|In {{their regular}} season finale, the Ravens took on their {{division}} rivals, the Cleveland Browns, needing a win and a Chargers loss to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs.</b> Trailing 10-6 {{in the final}} quarter, Smith caught a deep pass from Flacco, and on the very next play, a 16-yard touchdown to give Baltimore the lead. Smith finished the game with four receptions for 83 yards, including two decisive fourth quarter plays. Baltimore won and San Diego lost.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the 1946 {{championship}} game, Bell {{was notified}} that Merle Hapes and Frank Filchock of the New York Giants had been implicated in a bribing scandal. Filchock was sanctioned by Bell to play in the game but Hapes was suspended. At the next NFL owners' meeting, Bell was worried the repercussions from this event would lead to his firing. However, he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to five years at $30,000 per year. Reinvigorated with renewed support, he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs.</b>|$|E
5|$|He was {{inducted}} into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975. Russell, who had a difficult relationship with the media, did not attend either event. After retiring as a player, Russell had stints as head coach of the Seattle SuperSonics (1973 to 1977) and Sacramento Kings (1987 to 1988). His time as a non-player coach was lackluster; although he led the struggling SuperSonics <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> {{for the first time in}} franchise history, Russell's defensive, team-oriented Celtics mindset did not mesh well with the team, and he left in 1977 with a 162–166 record. Russell's stint with the Kings was considerably shorter, his last assignment ending when the Kings went 17–41 to begin the 1987–88 season.|$|E

5|$|Kiprusoff's play {{remained}} strong {{upon his}} return, {{as he was}} counted on to lead the Flames to {{the playoffs for the}} first time in eight years. A 1–0 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes clinched a berth in the 2004 playoffs for the Flames, an achievement which earned Kiprusoff a standing ovation from the Calgary fans. He finished the regular season with a modern NHL record-low GAA of 1.69. His stellar play continued <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs,</b> as he won 15 games, five of them via shutout, leading the Flames to within one victory of a Stanley Cup championship. He was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy, awarded to the best goaltender in the League, and was given a one-year, $2.95 million contract for 2004–05 by an arbitrator, an increase in salary of nearly four times his previous contract.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to improve}} his team's fortunes, Fletcher made several moves over the {{following}} seasons to rework the Flames roster. His goaltending tandem of Bouchard and Myre had begun to feud with each other by the 1977–78 season as both sought more playing time. Fletcher responded by naming Bouchard his number one goaltender and trading Myre to the St. Louis Blues for three players. They made it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> again but were the only team to fall to a team with fewer points than them, the Detroit Red Wings, in a best-of-three series, 2 games to 0. In March 1979, Fletcher completed an eight player trade that sent franchise-leading scorer Tom Lysiak and four players to the Chicago Black Hawks for three players, led by defenseman Phil Russell. Fletcher hoped that the addition of Russell would help his team achieve playoff success.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche {{chose not}} to re-sign Fleury, and he joined the New York Rangers on a three-year {{contract}} worth $21million that included a club option for a fourth year at $7million. He touched off a wave of anger on signing with the Rangers when he claimed he was unappreciated in Calgary, comments he later stated were directed at the Flames' owners and not the team's fans, who he said always supported him. Fleury's first year in Manhattan was a disappointment. He scored only 15goals in 1999–2000, struggling {{under the pressure of}} trying to lead the Rangers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> and adapting to life in New York. After the season, he voluntarily entered a league-operated program that treats substance abuse and emotional problems, though he denied that either had any effect on his play.|$|E

5|$|In October 1998, Arena left DC United {{to coach}} the U.S. men's {{national}} team. Arena's departure {{marked the beginning of}} a downturn in the team's fortunes. While the club again won the MLS Cup in 1999 under coach Thomas Rongen, lackluster results in 2000 and 2001 led to Rongen's departure and his replacement by Ray Hudson in 2002. The team did not, however, fare much better under Hudson, and Piotr Nowak replaced him {{before the start of the}} 2004 season. The club's first season under Nowak was marred by injuries in the early going, and some players were known to have complained about Nowak's methods. Nevertheless, a strong finish, assisted in large measure by the late-season acquisition of Argentine midfielder Christian Gómez, who helped to propel United <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> as the second seed. There they advanced past the New England Revolution on penalty kicks in what has been called one of the best games in MLS history. United then defeated the Kansas City Wizards to win their fourth MLS Cup. United's attendance record at RFK Stadium is 54,282, in a match against the Tampa Bay Mutiny in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In {{only his}} second NHL season, Kennedy {{finished}} the 1944–45 regular season leading {{the team in}} goals and points with 29 goals and 25 assists. In the last {{game of the season}} against the New York Rangers, Kennedy's line-mates fed him pass after pass attempting to get him to 30 goals. The Maple Leafs finished in third place and faceed the Montreal Canadiens in the opening round of the playoffs. The Montreal Canadiens of 1944–45 were a record-breaking, powerhouse hockey team. Going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> the coach of Montreal, Dick Irvin, declared them as the greatest team to have ever played in the NHL. The Montreal club had the top three point leaders in the league, placed 5 of the 6 positions on the First All-Star team, Maurice Richard had scored his famous 50 goals in 50 games, Montreal had finished 28 points ahead of Toronto and scored almost a goal-per-game more. As of 2009, Montreal's regular season winning percentage for 1944–45 is the fifth highest in NHL history and the year previously they had achieved the second highest in history and won the Stanley Cup. The Leafs were given little chance of winning the series.|$|E
5|$|Martin's first {{event of}} the 2011–12 World Curling Tour was the Point Optical Curling Classic, where he {{finished}} as a runner-up to Mike McEwen. He then won his first {{event of the}} season, the Westcoast Curling Classic, against McEwen. He next participated in the Cactus Pheasant Classic as the defending champion, but lost to Randy Ferbey in the semifinals. At the World Cup of Curling, Martin finished the round robin with a 4–1 win-loss record, but missed {{a chance to win}} another Grand Slam title after he was edged past by John Epping, 3–4. He failed to make it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> at his next event, the Sun Life Classic. He and his team then competed in the Canada Cup of Curling, securing close wins over Glenn Howard and Jeff Stoughton in the round robin and finishing the round robin undefeated. He then played Howard in the final, and managed to defeat him with a score of 7–4, winning his record 4th Canada Cup title as skip. He and his team also earned berths into the 2012 Canada Cup, Continental Cup, and, most importantly, the 2013 Olympic Trials.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 2001–02 season, {{the club}} {{announced}} that captain Saku Koivu {{had been diagnosed}} with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and would miss the entire season. Koivu managed to return with three games left in the regular season, and along with goaltender Jose Theodore, who would win the Hart Trophy that year, led the Canadiens <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> {{for the first time in}} four seasons. The eighth-seeded Canadiens upset the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs, and Koivu led the team in playoff scoring with 10points in 12games. In recognition of his tenacity in returning from cancer treatment, the league voted Koivu as the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy winner for dedication and perseverance. However, in the second round of the playoffs, the team was defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in six games. The Canadiens finished fourth in the Northeast Division in the 2002-03 season, missing the playoffs by six points. After the Habs finished with a record of 18–19–5–4 in the first 48 games of the 2002–03 season, the team replaced Therrien with Claude Julien.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 16 head coaches so far for the Islanders franchise. The team's first head coach was Phil Goyette, who coached {{the team for}} part of the 1972–73 season. Al Arbour is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached (1,500) and the most regular-season game wins (740); he is also the franchise's all-time leader for the most playoff games coached (198), and the most playoff-game wins (119). Goyette, Earl Ingarfield, Bill Stewart, Scott Gordon and Jack Capuano are the only coaches who spent their entire careers with the Islanders and have not been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame.

5|$|There {{have been}} 19 {{managers}} {{in the history of}} the Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. The Mariners franchise was formed in 1977 as a member of the American League. Darrell Johnson was hired as the first Mariners manager, serving for just over three seasons before being replaced during the 1980 season. In terms of tenure, Lou Piniella has managed more games and seasons than any other coach in their franchise history. He managed the Mariners to four playoff berths (1995, 1997, 2000 and 2001), led the team to the American League Championship Series in 1995, 2000 and 2001, and won the Manager of the Year award in 1995 and 2001. Piniella is the only manager in Mariners history to lead a team <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs,</b> with one of those times after a 116-win season, tying the record for most wins in a season. None of the previous managers had made it to the playoffs before. Piniella, however, managed the team in 34 playoff games, winning 15, and losing 19. Dick Williams is the only Mariners manager to have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
