The other plastic/rubber parts are return tubes from valves such as the brake control or height corrector valves, also catching seeping fluid around the suspension push-rods. Height corrector, brake master valve and steering valve spools, and hydraulic pump pistons have extremely small clearances (1-3 micrometres) with their cylinders, permitting only a very low leakage rate. The metal and alloy parts of the system rarely fail even after excessively high mileages but the rubber components (especially those exposed to the air) can harden and leak, typical failure points for the system.|$|E

In this paper we discuss in detail the interface pinning (IP) method for calculation of the Gibbs free energy difference between a solid and a liquid. This is done in a single equilibrium simulation by applying a harmonic field that biases the system towards two-phase configurations. The Gibbs free energy difference between the phases is determined from the average force that the applied field exerts on the system. As a test system we study the Lennard-Jones model. It is shown that the coexistence line can be computed efficiently to a high precision when the IP method is combined with the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots. Statistical and systematic errors are investigated. Advantages and drawbacks of the IP method are discussed.

A reproducible mass gain at slightly lower temperature suggests the equilibrium temperature to be at 1110710 K under 1 bar of nitrogen. A CALPHAD type thermodynamic analysis of all available phase equilibrium and thermodynamic data is performed. This includes {{the determination of the}} absolute entropy of GaN, 3074 J/molK, based on a Debye-and Einstein-analysis of the experimental data on the heat capacity. An explicit equation for the fugacity–pressure relation of nitrogen, f(P), is developed, which is useful for the conversion of complex phase diagram calculation output. This is crucial because f can be several orders of magnitude higher than P for the high pressures encountered during GaN decomposition.

Following that, {{it was decided to}} conduct three different types of tests considering two possible accident scenarios. Simulation of loss of external pressure was the {{target of the}} Test 1.

40|$|Improvements in {{material}} technology allow gas turbines {{to be run}} at ever increasing temperatures and speeds. As a consequence, blades in the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>part</b> of the turbine are subject to an extremely high level of oxidative attack. These blades are cast from specialized alloys in ceramic moulds which employ internal ceramic cores. One {{way in which the}} blades can be made more resistant to corrosion is by the inclusion of low levels of reactive metal elements such as yttrium and lanthanum in the blade alloy. During casting these reactive elements are easily lost from the alloy by reaction with both the core and shell of the mould. This study tests several candidate core formulations for their ability to retain reactive element levels in the alloy after casting, and also explores the mechanisms of reactive element depletion. Through scanning electron microscope studies, a layer of reaction products from the oxidation of the reactive elements was found at the metal-ceramic interface after a simulated casting procedure. The thickness of this layer was found to correlate with the free energy of formation of the ceramic used, in that using a thermodynamically less stable ceramic {{led to the formation of}} a thicker layer and thus greater depletion of reactive elements. Electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed this result by finding lower levels of reactive elements in metal samples heated with less stable ceramics.

Abnormal events which could cause such a situation to arise include an inadvertent isolation of all main steam lines, loss of condenser vacuum, pressure regulator failures, loss of feedwater, and the loss of offsite power. Each of these transients is analyzed in Chapter 15 of the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR). For each of these events, the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>part</b> of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) provides a backup function to the RCIC system. This review of the RCIC is performed to assure conformance with the requirements of General Design Criteria 4, 5, 29, 33, 34 and 54. The RCIC system consists of a steam-driven turbine-pump unit and associated valves and piping capable of delivering makeup water to the reactor vessel and supplying steam to and removing condensate from the RCIC steam turbine where applicable. Fluid removed from the reactor vessel following a shutdown from power operation is normally made up by the feedwater system, supplemented by inleakage from the control rod drive system. If the feedwater system is inoperable, the RCIC turbine-pump unit starts automatically or is started by the operator from the control room.

Infrared spectral parameters, such as the frequencies, intensities, bandshapes and band splittings have been used to detect structural and dynamical changes upon incorporation of cholesterol into the DPPC bilayer. Analysis of these spectral parameters yields information on conformer population, reorientational fluctuations, interchain interaction, hydrogen bonding, interdigitation packing, and phase transformations of the DPPC/cholesterol mixtures. We present FTIR data of aqueous DPPC dispersions at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mol% cholesterol in the pressure range from 0. 001 to 20 kbar at two temperatures, 25 °C and 55 °C. In addition, comprehensive temperature dependent measurements in the range from 20 °C to 80 °C were performed at ambient pressure. Analysis of the CH 2 symmetric and antisymmetric stretching modes yields information of the effect of cholesterol concentration on the phase transition phenomena occurring in the lipid bilayer. Observation of the correlation field splittings of the CH 2 bending and rocking modes monitors structural changes and dynamical properties of the lipid mixtures. Cholesterol induces more orientational disorder of the lipid molecules in terms of an increase of the reorientational fluctuations of the molecules and twisting/torsion motions of the acyl chains in the gel phase even at elevated pressures. It therefore appears that one important role of cholesterol is to make the membrane insensitive to changes in external environment, such as high hydrostatic pressure. Increase of pressure leads to a decrease in half width of the C O band contour of pure DPPC and of DPPC/cholesterol mixtures, especially for cholesterol concentrations equal and higher than 30 mol%, which might be due to a marked increase in free carbonyl groups. At <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>part</b> of the bound water from the interfacial zone of the membrane is withdrawn.
