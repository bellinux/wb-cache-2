500|$|According to guitarist Marty Friedman, it {{took the}} band a year to prepare the record [...] "from note one to mixing". A lot of the {{material}} was written during the tour {{and some of it}} afterwards. As Friedman said, the songs came together naturally because the band wasn't rushed to get a record out. The album was produced by Dann Huff, who had his producing debut with Megadeth. The band chose to work with Huff because they were not satisfied with Max Norman, the producer of their previous record. Mustaine explained why he decided to quit the collaboration with Norman: [...] "Max came up with this bullshit formula that every song had to be 120 beats per minute to get on the radio. When people make drastic decisions to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> and it backfires, it usually ends up, in one way or another, costing them their jobs." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{her first}} episode, it is {{revealed}} that Lauren {{is a member}} of William McKinley High's wrestling team. TV Squad has said that [...] "Lauren can deliver a zinger with the bite of Sue Sylvester and the humor of our beloved Brittany Pierce." [...] Seth Abramovitch of TV.com expressed his dissatisfaction with her attitude: [...] "Zizes isn't just a heavy, supremely confident girl. She's also extremely violent. She’s on the wrestling team, speaks regularly of injuring Puck, and, in one hallway smackdown against the jealous Santana Lopez, proved she was {{a lot more than just}} bark. And you did catch that part about Zizes wanting to be famous for famous' sake, right? That she was willing to give herself up to Puck purely in pursuit of a reality show and fragrance line? There’s a word for people who <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in the real world: It's 'asshole'." [...] He went on to add: [...] "Zizes has been hailed by feminists groups (well, by Bust Magazine) as a new kind of plus-sized heroine—an obese female role model who for once doesn't hate herself. On the contrary, she thinks she's the bee's knees. When 'Puck serenaded her with Queen's [...] "Fat-Bottomed Girls," [...] she rebuffed him, saying, 'I look like America looks, and just like America, I need more than just a song to get my juices flowing'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The intense but varied Metal Circus EP/mini-album was {{released}} in 1983. Hüsker Dü's more melodic take on hardcore struck a chord with college students, and various tracks from Metal Circus, particularly Hart's [...] "Diane," [...] were put into rotation by dozens of campus radio stations across the U.S. In addition, on Metal Circus the band showed more invention, skill, and melody than it did {{over the course of}} their previous full album, Everything Falls Apart. Songs such as [...] "Real World," [...] with lyrics like, [...] "You want to change the world, by breaking rules and laws; people don't <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in the real world at all," [...] helped to illustrate that the band was capable of writing songs with a deeper, more personal meaning. This represented a shift from the perceived punk ethos of the time. While some punk rock musicians and fans embraced an anarchist ideology, Hüsker Dü was experimenting with a more holistic integration of musical styles and genres, as well as a different attitude than their punk rock counterparts.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expect it}} was," [...] he agreed. [...] "Mrs. Austin <b>does</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I imagine she persuaded Wolf {{to send me}} on board Mossamedes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed?" [...] said Jane coldly, {{crumbling}} a bit {{of bread}} between her fingers. Her face was expressionless and her voice ditto; but I had heard her criticize nervous people who <b>did</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> at table.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want Kit {{to leave}} the Mossamedes; I think it better {{for him to do}} so," [...] she rejoined. [...] "It's {{possible}} my sister did get him the post. Jacinta <b>does</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> but sometimes her plans do not work as she hoped." ...|$|R
60|$|Harris said I {{encouraged}} him. I didn’t encourage him. A dog {{like that}} don’t want any encouragement. It’s the natural, original sin that is born in him {{that makes him}} <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{this day}} last week I knew no more that I could <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> than you did. It came quite sudden. It's {{something}} odd about my will, I suppose, and that's as far as I can see." ...|$|E
60|$|Clifford Baxter {{came into}} the sitting-room where Patty was darning {{stockings}} and reading a book at the same time. Patty could <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> The stockings were well darned too, and Patty understood and remembered what she read.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were always}} <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Once you held {{me over the}} pond and {{threatened}} to drop me into the water--in the winter! Just before Christmas. It was a particularly mean <b>thing</b> to <b>do,</b> because I couldn't even kick your shins for fear you would let me fall. Luckily Uncle Chris came up and made you stop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At Chamonix, {{about a year}} ago. When I met Mr. Stannard my {{luck was}} good. I'd got into the wrong lot; they used me and laughed. Well, your father showed me where I was going and sent the others off. Perhaps {{you know how he}} <b>does</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> He's urban, but very firm. Anyhow, the others went and I've had {{numerous}} grounds to trust Mr. Stannard since." ...|$|R
60|$|LOUIS [indignantly] Well, {{of all the}} mean--[words fail him]! I'd {{let myself}} be shot sooner than <b>do</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I {{consider}} youve stolen that drawing.|$|R
60|$|I {{was in such}} a {{state of}} mind that I went on like a man in a dream. If it had ha' been a dream I should ha' pushed 'er under an omnibus, but you can't <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in real life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe it's magic," [...] said Tip, positively, [...] "and {{that someone}} is playing a trick upon us. I've known old Mombi <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before. Probably it's {{nothing more than an}} illusion, and there are no {{sunflowers}} here at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, chuck it!" [...] Furley intervened. [...] "The {{intelligence}} {{department in}} charge of this bit of coast doesn't <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> What you want to remember, Julian, is to keep your mouth shut. I shall have a chap over to see me this afternoon, and I shall make a report to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How brutal of the friend!" [...] {{the girl}} observed. [...] "He might have {{let him down}} gently. You wouldn't <b>do</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> would you, Mr. Pratt?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no {{knowing how}} {{that might have}} been. I never {{calculated}} those chances. When a man wants to <b>do</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> he generally <b>does</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|FALDER. When I found I'd <b>done</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> to <b>do</b> it {{for nothing}} seemed so dreadful. I {{might just as}} well have chucked myself into the river.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon. I {{do not agree}} with you," [...] replied Col. Zane. [...] "It does concern others. You cannot <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in this little place where every one knows all about you and expect it to pass unnoticed. Martin's wife saw you cut Clarke and you know what a gossip she is. Already every one is talking about you and Clarke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Sir Mallaby," [...] said Billie, casting an adoring {{glance at}} the juggler, [...] "you needn't be afraid that Bream will drop it. He isn't clumsy! He is {{wonderful}} at that sort of thing, simply wonderful! I think it's so splendid," [...] said Billie, [...] "when men can <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I'm always trying to get Bream {{to do some of}} his tricks for people, but he's so modest, he won't." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. J. I said to Jackman: [...] "Mr. Hillcrist'll {{stand up}} for us, I know. He's a gentleman," [...] I said. [...] "This man," [...] I said, [...] "don't care for the neighbourhood, or the people; he don't care for {{anything}} {{so long as he}} makes his money, and has his importance. You can't expect it, I suppose," [...] I said; [Bitterly] [...] "havin' got rich so sudden." [...] The gentry don't <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I am," [...] replied Peter. He {{knew that}} {{not one of the}} meadow and forest people who were always trying to catch him would <b>do</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "If I could <b>do</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> I'd die happy!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} impetuously, as {{a feeling of}} despair came over her {{at the thought of}} her own poor attempts.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I SAID,' cried Edwards, 'that man's {{imagination}} {{was more}} specialised for sex than the whole being of woman. What woman would <b>do</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> Women <b>do</b> but submit {{to it or}} take advantage of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I engaged {{these rooms}} by letter without asking any questions. It {{might have been}} an abominable hole," [...] I {{explained}} to her. [...] "I always <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I don't like to be bothered. This is no great proof of sagacity--is it? Sagacious people I believe like to exercise that faculty. I have heard that they can't even help showing it in the veriest trifles. It must be very delightful. But I know nothing of it. I think that I have no sagacity--no practical sagacity." ...|$|E
6000|$|He leant forward very gravely towards Chitterlow. [...] "Look 'ere, Chit'low," [...] he said, [...] "you haven't no {{business}} putting my name into play. You mustn't <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> You'd lose me my crib, right away." [...] And {{they had a}} little argument--so far as Kipps could remember. Chitterlow entered upon a general explanation of how he got his names. These, he had {{for the most part}} got out of a newspaper that was still, he believed, [...] "lying about." [...] He even made to look for it, and while he was doing so Kipps went on with the argument, addressing himself more particularly to the photograph of the girl in tights. He said that at first her costume had not commended her to him, but now he perceived she had an extremely sensible face. He told her she would like Buggins if she met him; he could see she was just that sort. She would admit, all sensible people would admit, that using names in plays was wrong. You could, for example, have the law of him.|$|E
60|$|Heavens, how we {{all looked}} up to him! We were but young savages, and had a savage's respect for power. There was Tom Carndale of Appleby, who could write alcaics as well as mere pentameters and hexameters, yet nobody would give a snap for Tom; and there was Willie Earnshaw, who had every date, from the killing of Abel, {{on the tip of}} his tongue, so that the masters {{themselves}} would turn to him if they were in doubt, yet he was but a narrow-chested lad, over long for his breadth; and what did his dates help him when Jack Simons of the lower third chivied him down the passage with the buckle end of a strap? But you didn't <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> with Jim Horscroft. What tales we used to whisper about his strength! How he put his fist through the oak-panel of the game-room door; how, when Long Merridew was carrying the ball, he caught up Merridew, ball and all, and ran swiftly past every opponent to the goal. It did not seem fit to us that such a one as he should trouble his head about spondees and dactyls, or care to know who signed the Magna Charta. When he said in open class that King Alfred was the man, we little boys all felt that very likely it was so, and that perhaps Jim knew more about it than the man who wrote the book.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{unless he}} and Maud elope like Reggie Byng and Alice. Wasn't that exciting? Who {{would ever have}} {{suspected}} Reggie had the dash to <b>do</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> Lord Marshmoreton's new secretary is very pretty, don't you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I {{must have}} had a pretty long nap," [...] Joe said, as if to make an apology for his indolence. [...] "I don't believe I ever <b>did</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before. Hasn't aunt Dorcas called us yet?" ...|$|R
60|$|COKESON. [Confidentially to the jury, {{and as if}} {{a little}} {{surprised}} at being asked] He was a nice, pleasant-spoken young man. I'd no fault to find with him--quite the contrary. It was a great surprise to me when he <b>did</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
5000|$|...It says: The Gameshow {{contains}} copyrighted material, so you cannot, you know, {{copy and}} paste or <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> The responsibility of what they write belong to the authors... now... what the hell will we do? ...|$|E
50|$|When you do {{that with}} footballers like he said about Leeds, and when you <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> about a man like Stuart Pearce. I've kept really quiet but I'll tell you something, he went down in my estimations when he said that. We have not resorted to that. You can tell him now, we're still {{fighting}} for this title and he's {{got to go to}} Middlesbrough and get something. And I'll tell you, honestly, I will love it if we beat them. Love it. But it really has got to me. I've voiced it live, not in front of the press or anywhere. I'm not even going to the press conference. But the battle is still on and Man United have not won this yet.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Autograph {{magazine}} named Ferrell {{the worst}} celebrity autographer. Its editor stated: [...] "What's so frustrating about Will Ferrell being the worst autograph signer {{this past year}} is {{that he used to}} be so nice to fans and collectors and a great signer. What makes him so bad is that he'll taunt people asking for his autograph." [...] In response, Ferrell stated: [...] "I don't know how I got on the list. I sign a lot of autographs." [...] He has, however, admitted to taunting autograph-seekers: [...] "I do. I really do. I'm like, 'How badly do you want this autograph?' 'Are you sure?' 'You say you're my biggest fan, really, prove it.' I'll <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> They have to earn it." ...|$|E
60|$|They set off, and Jim {{was glad}} to use such help as the other could give. He was getting dull and began to doubt if he could reach the shack, but {{although}} both would freeze if they stopped, Pete would not leave him. It was not a thing to argue about. Pete was a white man and in the North the white man's code is stern. One here and there might have a yellow streak, but as a rule such a man soon left the wilds. Anyhow, Pete {{was going to see}} him through. Both would make the shack, or both would be buried in the snow. It was not a matter of generous sentiment; one <b>did</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no," [...] {{the detective}} said, slowly; [...] "but that's not {{always to be}} taken as a sign, because you see if any one <b>did</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> out of revenge, they would {{naturally}} take away anything that lay handy, so as to make it look as if it was done for theft." ...|$|R
60|$|Mary Isabel did {{not look}} at the Hamilton house. She kept her head resolutely turned away as she went down the shore lane with its wild sweet {{loneliness}} of salt-withered grasses and piping sea-winds. Only when she turned the corner of the fir-wood, which shut her out from view of the houses, did she look timidly over the line-fence. Dr. Hamilton was standing there, where the fence ran out to the sandy shingle, smoking his little black pipe, which he took out and put away when Mary Isabel came around the firs. Men <b>did</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> instinctively in Mary Isabel's company. There was something so delicately virginal about her, in spite of her forty years, that they gave her the reverence they would have paid to a very young, pure girl.|$|R
