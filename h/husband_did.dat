The couple were married in 1944 in a Texaco Station in Andalusia, Alabama, by a justice of the peace.

During the journey to the racecourse, Lycett Green asked Edward Somerset his advice, telling the peer that several members of the party were convinced of Gordon-Cumming's guilt.

Michael Nikolaevich was a kind, calm, rather dull man {{who would have been}} completely happy to devote himself only to the artillery and his family, and he did not shine with exceptional intellect. On the other hand, Olga Fyodorovna was lively, sharp-tongued, witty society-lady, very fond of malicious tales and gossips – according to some of her contemporaries, gossip was her main raison d'être, or purpose for existing.|$|E

Marie's paternal aunt, the Dowager German Empress, wrote to her daughter, the Crown Princess of Greece, that [...] "Missy of Roumania is more to be pitied than you.
