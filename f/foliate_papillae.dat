25|$|Recent {{research}} {{reveals a}} potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor. CD36 was targeted {{as a possible}} lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifically, long-chain fatty acids), {{and it has been}} localized to taste bud cells (specifically, the circumvallate and <b>foliate</b> <b>papillae).</b> There is a debate over whether we can truly taste fats, and supporters of our ability to taste free fatty acids (FFAs) have based the argument on a few main points: there is an evolutionary advantage to oral fat detection; a potential fat receptor has been located on taste bud cells; fatty acids evoke specific responses that activate gustatory neurons, similar to other currently accepted tastes; and, there is a physiological response to the presence of oral fat. Although CD36 has been studied primarily in mice, research examining human subjects' ability to taste fats found that those with high levels of CD36 expression were more sensitive to tasting fat than were those with low levels of CD36 expression; this study points to a clear association between CD36 receptor quantity and the ability to taste fat.|$|E

However, {{it is not}} known which type of non-NMDA glutamate receptors is involved. We used a cobalt staining technique combined with pharmacological tests for kainate or a-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors and/or immunohistochemistry against subunits of GluRs to examine the presence of non-NMDA receptors in rat foliate tastebud cells. Cobalt uptake into taste cells was elicited by treating taste buds with glutamate, kainate or SYM 2081, a kainate receptor agonist. Treating taste buds with AMPA or fluorowillardiine did not stimulate significant cobalt uptake. Moreover, 6 -cyano- 7 -nitro-quinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione significantly reduced cobalt staining elicited by glutamate or kainate receptor agonists, but SYM 2206, an AMPA receptor antagonist, did not. Immunohistochemistry against subunits of GluRs reveals GluR 6 and KA 1 -like immunoreactivity. Moreover, most glutamate-induced cobalt-stained cells showed GluR 6 and KA 1 -like immunoreactivity.

A significant impairment of axonal transport and a substantial decline in summated IXth nerve taste responses occurred within 2 - 3 h a after colchicine was applied to the IXth nerve trunk between the tongue and the petrosal ganglion.

40|$|In {{response}} to taste stimulation, taste buds release ATP, which activates ionotropic ATP receptors (P 2 X 2 /P 2 X 3) on taste nerves {{as well as}} metabotropic (P 2 Y) purinergic receptors on taste bud cells. The action of the extracellular ATP is terminated by ectonucleotidases, ultimately generating adenosine, which itself can activate one or more G-protein coupled adenosine receptors: A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B, and A 3. Here we investigated the expression of adenosine receptors in mouse taste buds at both the nucleotide and protein expression levels. Of the adenosine receptors, only A 2 B receptor (A 2 BR) is expressed specifically in taste epithelia. Further, A 2 BR is expressed abundantly only in a subset of taste bud cells of posterior (circumvallate, foliate), but not anterior (fungiform, palate) taste fields in mice.

In {{order to gain}} insight into the {{molecular}} mechanisms that allow taste cells to respond to changes in their osmotic environment, we have used primarily immunocytochemical and molecular approaches to look for evidence {{of the presence of}} aquaporin-like water channels in taste cells. Labeling of isolated taste buds from the fungiform, <b>foliate,</b> and vallate <b>papillae</b> in rat tongue with antibodies against several of the aquaporins (AQPs) revealed the presence of AQP 1, AQP 2, and AQP 5 in taste cells from these areas. AQP 3 antibodies failed to label isolated taste buds from any of the papillae. There was an apparent difference in the regional localization of AQP labeling within the taste bud. Antibodies against AQP 1 and AQP 2 labeled predominantly the baso-lateral membrane, whereas the AQP 5 label was clearly evident on both the apical and basolateral membranes of cells within the taste bud. Double labeling revealed that AQP 1 and AQP 2 labeled many, but not all, of the same taste cells. Similar double-labeling experiments with anti-AQP 2 and anti-AQP 5 clearly showed that AQP 5 was expressed on or near the apical membranes whereas AQP 2 was absent from this area. The presence of these 3 types of AQPs in taste buds but not in non–taste bud-containing epithelia was confirmed using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Experiments using patch clamp re-cording showed that the AQP inhibitor, tetraethylammonium, significantly reduced hypoosmotic-induced currents in rat taste cells.

By use {{of a combination of}} whole-cell and nystatin-perforated patchclamp recording, cells within the taste bud that exhibited voltage-dependent currents, reflective of taste receptor cells (TRCs), were subsequently tested for amiloride sensitivity. TRCs were held at- 70 mV, and steady-state current and input resistance were monitored during superfusion of Na+-free saline and salines containing amiloride (0. 1 wM to 1 mM). Greater than 90 % of all TRCs from each of the papillae responded to Na + replacement with a decrease in current and an increase in input resistance, reflective of a reduction in electrogenic Na + movement into the cell. ASSCs were found in two thirds of fungiform and in one third of foliate TRCs, whereas none of the circumvallate TRCs was amiloride sensitive. These findings indicate that the mechanism for Na + influx differs among taste bud types. All amiloride-sensitive currents had apparent inhibition constants in the submicromolar range.

Previous studies revealed that in rodent taste cells, the channel shares electrophysiological and pharmacological properties with the epithelial Na+ channel, ENaC. Using subunit-specific antibodies directed against alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of rat ENaC (rENaC), we observed cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for all three subunits in nearly all taste cells of fungiform papillae, and in about half of the taste cells in <b>foliate</b> and vallate <b>papillae.</b> The intensity of labeling in cells of vallate papillae was significantly lower than that of fungiform papillae, especially for beta and gamma subunits. Dual localization experiments showed that immunoreactivity for the taste cell-specific G protein, gustducin, occurs in a subset ofrENaC positive taste cells. Aldosterone is known to increase the amiloride sensitivity of the NaCl taste response. In our study, increases in blood aldosterone levels enhanced the intensity of apical immunoreactivity for beta and gamma rENaC in taste cells of all papillae. In addition, whole cell recordings from isolated taste cells showed that in fungiform papillae, aldosterone increased the number of amiloride-sensitive taste cells and enhanced the current amplitude. In vallate taste cells, which are normally unresponsive to amiloride, aldosterone treatment induced an amiloride sensitive current in about half of the cells. Immunoreactivity for rENaC subunits also was present in nonsensory epithelial cells, especially in the anterior portion of the tongue. In addition, immunoreactivity for all subunits, but especially beta and gamma, was associated with some nerve fibers innervating taste papillae.

''Sustained'' glutamate responses were observed {{in the majority of}} taste cells (51 of 55) and consisted of an outward current (reduction of the maintained inward current). Sustained glutamate responses were voltage dependent, were decreased by membrane depolarization, and were accompanied by a reduction in membrane conductance, An analysis of the reversal potential of sustained responses in different ionic conditions and the effect of ion substitutions suggested that the currents were carried by cations. The data suggest that sustained responses are mediated by the closure of nonselective cation channels. Ocher taste cells (4 of 55) responded to glutamate with a transient inward current-so-called ''transient'' responses. Transient glutamate responses were voltage dependent and Na+ dependent, and appeared to be generated by nonspecific cation channels activated by glutamate. L(+) - 2 amino-di-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP 4), a specific agonist of a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR 4) recently identified in rat taste cells and believed to be involved in taste transduction, mimicked the sustained glutamate responses. These findings indicate that glutamate, at concentrations at or slightly above threshold for taste in rats, produces two different membrane currents. The properties of these two responses suggest that there may be two different sets of nonspecific cation channels in taste cells, one closed by glutamate (sustained response) and the other opened (transient response). Our findings on the effect of L-AP 4 suggest that the sustained response is the membrane mechanism mediating, at least in part, taste transduction for glutamate...|$|R

Although the temporal sequence of gustatory papilla development is known for several species, factors that regulate initiation, growth, and maintenance of the papillae are not understood. We tested the hypothesis that sensory innervation {{is required for the}} initial formation and early morphogenesis of fungiform papillae in a patterned array. An organ culture of the embryonic rat tongue was developed to provide an in vitro system for studying mechanisms involved in fungiform papilla morphogenesis in patterns on the anterior tongue. Tongues were dissected from embryos at 13 days of gestation (E 13), a time when the tongue has not yet fully formed and gustatory papillae have not yet appeared, and at 14 days of gestation (E 14), when the tongue is well formed and papillae make their initial morphological appearance. Dissected tongues were maintained at the gas/liquid interface in standard organ culture dishes, fed with DMEM/F 12 plus 2 % B- 27 supplement and 1 % fetal bovine serum. After 1, 2, 3, or 6 days in culture, tongues were processed for scanning electron or light microscopy, or immunocytochemistry. Tongues cultured from E 13 or E 14 underwent extensive morphogenesis and growth in vitro. Furthermore, fungiform papillae developed on these tongues on a culture day equivalent to E 15 in vivo; that is, after 2 days for cultures begun at E 13 and 1 day for those begun at E 14. Because E 15 is the characteristic time for gustatory papilla formation in the intact embryo, results demonstrate that the cultured tongues retain important temporal information related to papilla development. In addition, fungiform papillae formed in the tongue cultures in the stereotypic pattern of rows. The papillae were large structures with epithelial and mesenchymal cell integrity, and an intact epithelial basement membrane was indicated with laminin immunoreactivity. The cultures demonstrate that gustatory papilla morphogenesis can progress {{in the absence of an}} intact sensory innervation. To exclude a potential developmental role for autonomic ganglion cells that are located in the posterior rat tongue, cultures consisting of only the anterior half of E 14 tongues were established. Fungiform papilla development progressed in half tongues in a manner directly comparable to whole tongue cultures. Therefore, robust, reproducible development of fungiform papillae in patterns is supported in rat tongue cultures from E 13 or E 14, without inclusion of intact sensory or major, posterior tongue autonomic ganglia. This is direct evidence that papillae will form and develop further in vitro without sensory ganglion support.

However, due to the unique characteristics of lingual lipase, including a pH optimum 4.5-5.4 and its ability to catalyze reactions without bile salts, the lipolytic activity continues through to the stomach. Enzyme release is signaled by autonomic nervous system after ingestion, at which time the serous glands under the circumvallate and foliate lingual papillae {{on the surface of the}} tongue secrete lingual lipase to the grooves of the circumvallate and <b>foliate</b> <b>papillae.</b> The hydrolysis of the dietary fats is essential for fat absorption by the small intestine, as long chain triacyglycerides cannot be absorbed, and as much as 30% of fat is hydrolyzed within 1 to 20 minutes of ingestion by lingual lipase alone.|$|E
