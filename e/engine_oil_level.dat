40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to develop an <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> {{monitoring}} system that will replace the current dipstick method during vehicle testing for Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, Inc. (MBRDNA). Currently, MBRDNA test drivers check the <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> twice a day after two eight hour shifts each day. To measure the oil level, the driver parks on a level surface, waits five minutes for the oil to cool, and then manually checks the oil level with the dipstick. The goal of this project {{is to have a}} reliable, physical, working prototype that MBRDNA can use for vehicle testing by spring. MBRDNA wants a prototype built {{by the end of this}} year that is capable of reading oil level without the need of a test driver to measure the oil. It is very easy for a driver to get distracted and forget to check the oil at precisely 5 minutes after the engine has been shut off. This leads to inconsistent results. Drivers are also susceptible to reading the dipstick incorrectly due to the small amount of increments on the end of the dip stick that must be read. Occasionally dipsticks will even break because they are not designed to with stand fatigue loading cycles that are seen during this testing. This leads to an expensive engine tear down to recover broken parts out of the crankcase. The prototype will consist of the following features: a SICK fiber optic cable connected to a SICK optic sensor, a clamp, a microcontroller, a digital display and a data acquisition. This project is being continued from the previous senior project group from 2011 / 2012 academic year...|$|E
50|$|The long {{procession}} of red sports cars suddenly turned into confusion, when Behra {{ran out of}} brakes and needed two stops to make adjustments, meanwhile Gendebien’s Ferrari was leaking oil and stopped for a refill, letting Robert Manzon have a go. He did not go far before the <b>engine’s</b> <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> dropped and stopped with a bang. Both Collins and Hill went off the road due to the resultant oil patch, while Portago was sideways {{on for a long}} while, during which Flockhart managed to avoid him by a small margin. Hill motored on through the corn field until he found {{his way back to the}} track, while Collins lost more time trying get back on the track, the same way he entered the field. This resulted in Fangio taking the lead, with Hill now in second, Portago third and Collins fourth. The leading Maserati was now in fifth with Harry Schell in the Villoresi car, and Behra struggling back in sixth. Flockhart retired with a blown engine when a rod broke, and Maserati decided to add Moss to the Villoresi/Schell car to try to improve on the fifth position. However, the pit stop did not go well, for fuel and oil was put in, while the rear wheels were changed. But everyone got in everyone’s way, fuel was slopped over the pit lane, one mechanic tripped over the jack, and amidst the pools of oil, petrol and water. Moss eventually got away. Then Behra decided he was tired of driving without brakes, came in for Villoresi to take over. With gallons of petrol all over the car and the ground, suddenly there was a boomph and the whole lot was on fire. The prompt action of the fire brigade, who were ever at the ready, the whole pits might have gone up in flames. After a few tense moments, the Maserati lay under a heavy covering of foam, as was most of the pit crew. The explosion split the fuel tank, as the Maserati was wheeled away into retirement.|$|R
