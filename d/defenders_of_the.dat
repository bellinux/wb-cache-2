On top of it was placed a life-size bronze statue of Christ with open arms. On Armistice Day, November 11, 1951, the monument was dedicated to the <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|Dutthagamani's army {{attacked}} {{all four}} {{gates of the}} city simultaneously. He led the main assault on the southern gate with Nandimithra, Suranimala and the elephant Kandula, while {{the attacks on the}} northern and western gates were led by Bharana, Khanjadeva, Phussadeva and Labhiyavasabha. The eastern gate was attacked by Mahasona, Gothaimbara, Theraputthabhaya and Velusumana. The <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern gates were routed by Velusumana after a cavalry attack, and Elara's forces withdrew into the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1591 the bloodily {{suppressed}} Kosiński Uprising {{was led by}} Krzysztof Kosiński. New fighting {{took place}} already in 1594, when the Nalyvaiko Uprising engulfed large portions of Ukraine and Belarus. Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski defeated the Cossack units in 1596 and Severyn Nalyvaiko was executed. A temporary pacification of relations followed in the early 17th century, when the many wars fought by the Commonwealth necessitated greater involvement by registered Cossacks. But the Union of Brest resulted in new tensions, as the Cossacks had become dedicated adherents and <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Orthodoxy.|$|E

5|$|Kami, Perempoean (Perfected Spelling: Kami, Perempuan; Indonesian for We, the Women) is a 1943 stage play in one act by Armijn Pane. The six-character drama {{revolves}} around {{a conflict between}} two couples, with the women considering the men cowards for not wanting to join the <b>Defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Homeland and the men afraid of how the women will react to them having secretly joined. Despite warnings from the women's mother and father, the men prepare to leave for their training, with their partner's blessings.|$|E
5|$|The German {{breakthrough}} at Sedan, {{which had}} been thought impassable, meant that <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> K-W Line risked being outflanked, and had to withdraw on 16 May. The German invasion triggered a panic amongst Belgian civilians {{in the path of}} the advancing German army. By 11 May, the roads leading westwards, away from the fighting, were blocked by refugees, hampering the eastward advance of French and British forces. It is estimated that around two million civilians fled their homes during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|At first, the revolutionaries {{used the}} {{constitutional}} machinery {{of the old}} confederal republic. They resumed where they had left off after the purge in 1787 of Patriot regents, taking over {{the offices of the}} Orangist regents that were now purged in their turn. Though the political make-up of the States-General changed appreciably because of this change in personnel, it retained a number of <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old particularist interests. The first order of business of the revolutionaries therefore was to strive for the reform of the confederal state, with its discrimination of the Generality Lands, and of particular minorities (Catholics, Jews), {{in the direction of a}} unitary state, in which the minorities would be emancipated, and the old entrenched interests superseded by a more democratic political order. As a first step the representatives of Brabant were admitted to the States-General.|$|E

5|$|Basil II's {{first attempt}} to {{overwhelm}} the <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable {{to pass through the}} valley, which was defended by 15,000–20,000 Bulgarians. Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and surround the Bulgarians, while he continued the assaults on the wall. Xiphias led his troops along a steep path that led him into the Bulgarians' rear. On July 29, Xiphias attacked the guards, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarian soldiers abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was able to break through the front line and destroy the wall.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing {{there is not}} such a mirror in creating a European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.|$|E
5|$|In 1778, Curtis {{returned}} to Britain in Eagle, {{but refused to}} carry out an order to sail the ship to the Far East, a refusal which earned the enmity of Lord Sandwich. In December {{of the same year}} he was married to Jane Sarah Brady. As punishment for his disobedience Curtis was unemployed for the next two years, before he secured the new frigate HMS Brilliant for service in the Mediterranean in 1780. Ordered to Gibraltar, Brilliant was attacked by a superior Spanish squadron close to the fortress and was forced to escape to British-held Menorca. Curtis's first lieutenant Colin Campbell complained extensively about his captain's refusal to leave port while enemy shipping passed by the harbour, but Curtis was waiting for a 25-ship relief convoy which he met and safely convoyed into Gibraltar, bringing supplies to the <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Siege of Gibraltar then in progress.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Farnese {{entrusted}} to Count Hannibal d'Altemps {{the capture of}} Weert and continued his advance upon the Dutch Army. D'Altemps encircled Weert with 6,000 men and breached its walls with a two-cannon battery. The <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle surrendered at discretion but, on Farnese orders, were hanged on the windows, which the Count willingly did because his steward had lost an eye during the siege. Farnese, instead of following the Dutch Army to its quarters, lodged in Turnhout with his troops and his court to forage. Before moving to Antwerp he dealt with John Casimir's German Army. Spanish troops attacked and defeated part of the German reiters near Eindhoven on 10 February. Moreover, while John Casimir himself was in England dealing with Elizabeth I, Farnese agreed with his lieutenant, Maurice of Saxe-Lauenburg, {{the withdrawal of the}} Calvinist Army, which the Spaniards allowed to leave the Netherlands freely. Once this matter was finished, Farnese advanced upon Borgerhout.|$|E
5|$|JNA and Croatian sources {{disagree}} on events immediately following {{arrival of the}} JNA in Dalj. While the JNA claimed it requested a cessation of the fire only to be refused by the <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police station, Croatian sources claim the JNA demanded the unconditional surrender of {{the police and the}} ZNG, and were refused by the Croatian force. Both versions agree that the combat resumed until approximately 10a.m., when three tank main gun rounds, fired by the JNA, hit the police station. While the JNA reported there were no Croatian policemen or ZNG troops captured alive, contradicting its own report stating that the Croatian force located outside the police station accepted cessation of hostilities, the Croatian sources claim that those who surrendered were killed after their capture. Overall, 39 were killed in the fighting for the police station in Dalj—20 policemen, 15 ZNG troops and four civil defencemen.|$|E
5|$|Like {{her sister}} ships, Köln {{served as a}} {{training}} ship for naval cadets in the 1930s, and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War during {{the latter part of}} the decade. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she conducted several operations in the North Sea, but did not encounter any British warships. She participated in the attack on Bergen during Operation Weserübung in April 1940, and she was the only member of her class to survive the operation. In 1942, she was modified to carry a Flettner Fl 282 helicopter experimentally. Later in 1942, she returned to Norway, but did not see significant action. She remained there until early 1945, when she returned to Germany; in March, she was sunk by American bombers in Wilhelmshaven. She remained on an even keel, with her gun turrets above water; this allowed her to provide gunfire support to <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city until the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E

5|$|On 14 May the Germans had {{occupied}} {{almost all of}} North Brabant. SS-Standarte Deutschland, quickly advancing to the Western Scheldt, reached the Bath Position. This cut off the retreat of 27e Groupe de Reconnaissance de Division d'Infanterie, which was subsequently destroyed defending Bergen-op-Zoom. The morale of the <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bath Position, already shaken by stories from Dutch troops fleeing to the west, was severely undermined by the news that Winkelman had surrendered; many concluded that it was useless for Zealand to continue resisting as the last remaining province. A first preparatory artillery bombardment on the position in the evening of 14 May caused the commanding officers to desert their troops, who then also fled.|$|E
5|$|Sometime around 1285, Braose {{confirmed}} {{grants of}} land by his ancestors {{to the religious}} house of Sele Priory. In 1286 Braose was in the king's service, for unspecified duties overseas. It is possible that these included accompanying the king, Edward I, to Paris where Edward performed homage to the new French king, Philip IV, for Edward's French lands. Braose {{played a significant role}} in King Edward's Welsh wars. In the winter of 1287–8 he commanded the force blockading Emlyn castle. His men also provided the escort for the transport of a huge siege engine from Dryslwyn to Emlyn. The arrival of the engine, with 480 great stones as ammunition, persuaded the <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle to surrender peaceably.|$|E
5|$|The 99 {{surviving}} <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Norfolks {{were eventually}} ordered by their commander Major Lisle Ryder, {{the brother of}} Robert Edward Dudley Ryder, to surrender and they left the cowshed {{that they had been}} defending under a white flag. Due to the boundary between the two British regiments being the road, Ryder's men surrendered not to the company they had been fighting, but rather to SS-Hauptsturmführer Fritz Knöchlein's unit, which had been fighting the Royal Scots. Graves found near Le Paradis in 2007 suggest that around 20men of the Royal Scots who surrendered to an SS unit may also have been killed in a separate massacre.|$|E

5|$|The Finnish plan in {{the south}} in Karelia was to advance as swiftly as {{possible}} to Lake Ladoga, cutting the Soviet forces in half. Then the Finnish territories east of Lake Ladoga were to be recaptured before the advance along the Karelian Isthmus, including the recapture of Vyborg, commenced. The Finnish attack was launched on 10 July. The Army of Karelia held a numerical advantage versus the Soviet <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 7th Army and 23rd Army, so it could advance swiftly. The important road junction at Loimola was captured on 14 July. By 16 July, the first Finnish units reached Lake Ladoga at Koirinoja, achieving the goal of splitting the Soviet forces. During the rest of July, the Army of Karelia advanced further southeast into Karelia, coming to a halt at the former Finnish-Soviet border at Mansila.|$|E
5|$|The French <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island were {{weakened}} {{by years of}} isolation caused by the British blockade. Although the available French troops numbered between 3,000 and 4,000, there was an epidemic {{on the island and}} a significant proportion of the garrison, principally formed by the 66e Régiment, were unfit for duty. Apart from the capital, the rest of the island's defences were manned by a militia formed from local inhabitants, among whom morale was low and desertion rates high. Military and food stores of all kinds were in short supply and the governor, General Jean Augustin Ernouf was unable to maintain garrisons around the island's extensive perimeter.|$|E
5|$|The French <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, despite {{initially}} {{resisting the}} attack, {{were unable to}} prevent the seizure of the port's defensive fortifications. The British force later withdrew {{under pressure from the}} main garrison of the island, burning warehouses containing over £500,000 worth of silk captured from British merchant ships. Ultimately the French were unable to effectively oppose the invasion, the island's governor General Des Bruslys retreating to Saint-Denis rather than engage the British and later committing suicide. The transportation of forces from the recently captured island of Rodrigues, the co-ordination of land and naval forces and the failure of the French defenders to co-ordinate an effective response were all features of the subsequent invasion and capture of Île Bonaparte in July 1810.|$|E
