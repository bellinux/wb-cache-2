25|$|Wilson’s diary {{records that}} on 24 March he (5pm) telephoned Lloyd George {{to ask him}} to come to London, {{received}} a telephone call from Foch (“asking what I thought of situation & we are of one mind that someone must catch a hold or we shall be beaten. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come over and see him”), then had a meeting with Lloyd George at Downing Street where they discussed “the entirely inadequate measures taken by Haig and Petain” before receiving an evening message from Haig asking him to come over. There is no evidence to confirm Haig's later claim that, on returning from a midnight meeting with Petain at 3am on 25 March, he telegraphed to Wilson and Milner to come over to France and ensure the appointment of “Foch or some other determined general who would fight” as Allied Generalissimo. Wilson reached GHQ at Montreuil at 11.30am on 25 March, having left London by special train at 6.50am then crossed to France on a destroyer. He chided Haig for having, together with Petain, blocked the plan for an Allied reserve, although in fact Petain sent a dozen divisions and it is unclear that a committee would actually have acted any faster. Travers argued that the true reason for Wilson’s visit to France was to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, but this view is not accepted by other scholars.|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, he {{describes}} how one {{was an old}} friend who was keen to have children but feared she {{was running out of}} time. [...] "We had never been involved romantically but I knew her well enough to know she would be a wonderful mother and so <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to be the father of her children." [...] A daughter was born in 1990, and another in 1992. Then another friend said she'd like to have children: [...] "And we agreed to have a baby." [...] Their son was born within weeks of his daughter in 1992.|$|E
500|$|A bird-beaked {{member of}} the Green Lantern Corps who teaches Hal Jordan how to use his cosmic powers. Rush stated he was not {{initially}} familiar with Green Lantern but {{was drawn to the}} part after seeing the concept art explaining, [...] "When I got the offer for it I said, ‘Haven’t they made that film?’ They said, ‘No, it’s a completely computer-generated character.’ I saw the artwork and <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> love to be that guy. Because I had voiced an owl in [...] and I’d voiced a pelican in Finding Nemo and I thought I could really improve on that now by being half-bird, half-fish, part lizard. You don’t get to do that in a live-action film." [...] Rush compared the role to previous roles where he played a mentoring figure, [...] "You could say that I’ve mentored Queen Elizabeth I as [...] Walsingham, and [...] Trotsky has mentored Frida Kahlo and now Tomar Re is going to mentor Hal Jordan, and I was sort of mentoring King George VI in The King's Speech. But I can’t imagine Tomar Re setting up an office on Harley Street in London. They’re all very different people to me, but {{there is a kind of}} theme I suppose".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Thank'ee, miss,' {{returned}} Kit, 'it's {{comfortable to}} hear you say that. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> never <b>would</b> believe that it was your doing.' 'That was right!' said the child eagerly.|$|R
2500|$|On October 3, 2005, Bush {{nominated}} Miers {{to serve}} as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, saying, [...] "Harriet Miers will be the type of judge <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> nominate: a good conservative judge." [...] Miers' nomination was criticized by people of various political views for {{the fact that she had}} never served as a judge at any level, her perceived lack of intellectual rigor, her close personal ties to Bush, and her lack of a clear record on issues likely to be encountered as a Supreme Court Justice. Many notable conservatives vigorously criticized her nomination, and numerous conservative groups normally considered part of Bush's political base planned to mount an organized opposition campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards Spinks said: [...] "I came {{to fight}} like <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> I {{just tried to}} do what I knew I had to do, and that was fight. Not that I stood toe to toe with him, but I tried to take the shot and I came up short." [...] Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he {{abandoned}} his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect. Spinks later conceded that [...] "fear was knocking at my door big time." [...] Tyson said [...] "The first punch I threw, he wobbled a bit. I knew right there I had him," [...] adding [...] "my trainer told me before the fight that he bet both our purses that I would knock {{him out in the}} first round. So I went out and knocked him out in the first round. And later I found out he was fooling." [...] Tyson dedicated the win to Jimmy Jacobs, who had died in March.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the post-war}} period progressed, Abe's stance as an {{intellectual}} pacifist led to him joining the Japanese Communist Party, with whom he worked to organize laborers in poor parts of Tokyo. Soon after his reception of the Akutagawa Prize in 1951, Abe began to feel {{the constraints of the}} Communist Party's rules and regulations alongside doubts about what meaningful artistic works could be created under the title of [...] "socialist realism." [...] By 1956, Abe began writing in solidarity with the Polish rebels and their freedom movement, drawing the ire of the Japanese Communist Party. The Party's criticism reaffirmed his stance: [...] "The Communist Party put pressure on me to change the content of the article and apologize. But I refused. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never change my opinion on the matter. This was my first break with the Party." [...] The next year, Abe traveled to Eastern Europe for the Twentieth Convention of the Soviet Communist Party. Here, Abe saw little of interest, but the arts gave him some solace. He visited Kafka's house in Prague, read Rilke and Karel Čapek, reflected on his idol Lu Xun, and was moved by a Mayakovsky play in Brno.|$|E

6000|$|... "So I thought," [...] Lady Deringham agreed; [...] "but Dr. Whitlett's {{explanation}} seems perfectly feasible, does it not? <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> consult you. You {{will come}} in and see him?" ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. [...] It wasn't really baseball." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} the words of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous; but the wicked and him who loves {{violence}} His soul hates," [...] bear on God's instruction in [...] "Take the Levites." [...] The Midrash taught {{that the words}} of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous," [...] imply that God never raises a person to high rank before first testing and trying that person. If the person stands the trial, God raises the person to high rank. The Midrash found this {{to have been the}} case with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, and so also with the tribe of Levi. The Midrash taught that the Levites devoted their lives to the sanctification of God's Name. When the Israelites were in Egypt, the Israelites rejected the Torah and circumcision, as implied by Ezekiel's rebuke of them in [...] "Thus says the Lord God: 'In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt'"; and afterwards, [...] says, [...] "They rebelled against Me, and would not hearken to Me [...] [...] [...] then <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> pour out My fury upon them." [...] So God brought darkness upon the Egyptians for three days, and during that time God slew all the wicked Israelites, as [...] reports, [...] "I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against Me." [...] The Levites, however, were all righteous and practiced the Torah; as [...] says, [...] "For they have observed Your word, and keep Your covenant." [...] The Midrash taught that [...] "covenant" [...] referred to circumcision, as [...] says, [...] "This is My covenant [...] [...] [...] every male among you shall be circumcised." [...] And the Midrash taught that when the Israelites made the Golden Calf, the Levites did not participate, as [...] says: [...] "Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp [...] [...] [...] and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him." [...] When Moses told them in [...] "Put every man his sword upon his thigh," [...] they did so and respected no persons. Moses accordingly blessed them in [...] saying, [...] "Who said of his father, and of his mother: 'I have not seen him.'" [...] When God thus saw that the Levites were all righteous, and that they stood the test, as [...] says, [...] "Whom You did prove at Massah," [...] God decided, as reported in [...] "The Levites shall be mine." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I thought {{ten days}} {{would be as}} long as you would care to have me here, and as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be back by the first, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather not change my plans." ...|$|R

60|$|The servant evidently {{expected}} me to say Yes. He was disappointed; my curiosity was roused; <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> see the insolent stranger.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{as stupid}} as an owlet and as {{stubborn}} as Solomon's mule," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>WOULD</b> say it. [...] "He's just a common fellow, {{and yet he}} thinks he's good enough for my beauty." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{laughed and}} <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be their debtor {{to the extent}} of one, which was duly produced.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, no, it {{must not}} be so. I was wrong {{to say that you}} were bloody-minded. I cannot tell why <b>I</b> <b>said</b> so. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not for worlds have you altered in anything;--except," [...] she said, [...] "in your love for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I shouldn't," [...] he answered, [...] "but I couldn't help it. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{keep clear}} of you, and if I have met you by {{accident}} {{it is not}} my fault. Come, let me have a look at that child." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{tell her}} I didn't reproach you and {{never thought of}} such a thing. And <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> break open my letter and say so.|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> and left, and Jim was {{to hide in}} {{the woods}} when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again.|$|E
