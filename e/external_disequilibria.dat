50|$|Structuralist {{economics}} is {{an approach to}} economics that {{emphasizes the importance of}} taking into account structural features (typically) when undertaking economic analysis. The approach originated with the work of the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA or CEPAL) and is primarily associated with its director Ra√∫l Prebisch and Brazilian economist Celso Furtado. Prebisch began with arguments that economic inequality and distorted development was an inherent structual feature of the global system exchange. As such, early structuralist models emphasised both internal and <b>external</b> <b>disequilibria</b> arising from the productive structure and its interactions with the dependent relationship developing countries had with the developed world. Prebisch himself helped provide the rationale for the idea of Import substitution industrialization, {{in the wake of the}} Great Depression and World War II. The alleged declining terms of trade of the developing countries, the Singer-Prebisch hypothesis, played a key role in this.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographyIntroduction The {{integration}} {{of the world economy}} gathered momentum in the mid- 1980 s and continued during the 1990 s, through increased trade and financial flows around the world, and the establishment and strengthening of linkages related to the production and distribution of goods and services. Trade flows around the world received a boost from the successful conclusions of the negotiations of the Uruguay Round of trade talks, the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the beginning, in 1995, of the implementation of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Other factors reinforcing the growth of trade around the world included the widespread trade liberalization programmes implemented in many countries and the numerous, more comprehensive, and generally more outward-oriented, trade agreements instituted {{in many parts of the}} world. Unilateral trade liberalization programmes implemented at the national level also reinforced the trend towards a more open global trading system. During the 1990 s the volume of world trade increased substantially compared with the previous decade. World trade increased overall by 53. 6 per cent, from an average of 4. 4 per cent for the period 1980 - 89, to an average of 6. 76 per cent for the period 1990 - 97. Although the exports of goods are still dominant in total exports, services have made substantial progress since 1980 and represented more than 20 per cent of world exports in the 1990 s (1). Increased financial flows were the result of widespread liberalization of the current and capital accounts of many countries, successful macroeconomic reforms (including financial sector reforms), and the creation of an environment generally more welcoming to international capital flows. Exchange rate policy reforms, which led generally to more flexible exchange rate systems and the abolition, in many countries, of exchange controls also contributed to the worldwide increase in financial flows. Technology and technological innovation were key factors influencing the increasing {{integration of}} the world economy. They have brought about substantial reductions in the costs of transportation, communications and computing, thus facilitating the integration of national markets in goods, capital and services. In addition, technological innovations have increased the tradeability of services, a growing sector of international trade. The reinforcement of the trend towards a more integrated world economy presents opportunities and challenges to both developing and advanced countries. Better access to larger markets, increased access to finance and investment opportunities, positive externalities from technological spillovers and more competition, are likely to result in efficiency gains in the world economy, but will also continue to require adjustment to constantly changing economic realities. An inevitable result of an increasingly integrated world economy is the more rapid transmission of both favourable and unfavourable economic shocks. This increasing globalisation of the world economy has brought about fears in both developed and developing countries. For developing countries, the general concern is that their firms would not be able to compete with the far more efficient firms of developed countries. On the other hand, loss of market share to firms from the low-wage developing countries is a major preoccupation of businesses in the developed countries. These fears have strengthened over recent years, in the face of increasing income disparities within and among countries, and increasing levels of poverty and marginalisation in many parts of the world. In the Caribbean, major economic and social reforms were undertaken in the 1980 s, which continued in the 1990 s. These include macroeconomic reforms to consolidate the stability of the economies and correct the <b>external</b> and internal <b>disequilibria,</b> which had developed during the latter part of the 1970 s and in the early 1980 s. Trade reforms were embarked upon which sought to open regional economies further and capitalise upon the opportunities available in the increasingly liberalised world economy. The 1990 s also saw the acceleration of activities to establish the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy (SME) (which now includes Suriname and Haiti), as well as CARICOm's widening of its trade and economic relations with the Dominican Republic and other countries in the Western Hemisphere. During the 1980 s and 1990 s, there was increased focus on issues related to social equity. Foremost among these were the efforts made to increase employment, improve access to health and education and alleviate poverty, especially in those Caribbean countries which had experienced slow growth or political instability in the decades under review. Efforts were made, as well, to improve gender equity in the subregion, through the implementation of policies and programmes to improve the social and economic status of women. Increased migration and population growth continued to modify the characteristics of the Caribbean population. In 1994, the adoption of the Small Island Developing States Programme of Action (SIDS-POA) focused the attention of governments in the subregion and the world community on the need to preserve the fragile environment of these mostly island States, within the context of sound, sustainable development policies. This paper seeks to review the social and economic performance of Caribbean countries in the 1980 s and the 1990 s and highlight a few of the changes which have taken place. 1 International Monetary Fund - World Economic Outlook and International Capital Markets, Interim Assessment - December 199...|$|R
40|$|Using a new {{international}} dataset of trade-weighed exchange rates, this paper highlights a neglected adjustment mechanism in the classical gold standard literature. Since gold-pegged countries traded extensively with economies operating more flexible monetary regimes and where parity change was a common adjustment device to systemic shocks, we show that such parity adjustments induced worldwide swings in nominal effective exchange rates. These translated into real exchange rate variations to which trade balances responded with an average elasticity of unity and {{in the direction of}} restoring <b>external</b> <b>disequilibria.</b> We conclude that some nominal exchange rate flexibility thus present in the pre- 1914 system was instrumental to international payments adjustment. ...|$|E
40|$|Broadly speaking, the balance-of-payments {{constraint}} hypothesis as {{developed by}} Thirlwall has been empirically supported. Yet it shows some shortcomings highlighted in the literature. In our opinion, {{two of them}} must be analyzed. First, temporary disequilibria and capital flows must {{be incorporated into the}} balance-of-payments-constrained growth models. Second, the role of relative prices must be made explicit, since it can be relevant even in an external constraint framework. This study is aimed at developing a model that incorporates both possibilities: temporary <b>external</b> <b>disequilibria</b> and the impact of relative prices. This model is subsequently used to analyze the evolution of the Spanish and Portuguese economies in past decades, and, in particular, the different paths shown by both countries since their accession to the euro zone. exchange rate, external constraint, growth,...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} some salient {{features of}} the balances of payments of the developed countries outside the Group of Ten since 1968, first comparing their current accounts {{to those of the}} other main groups in the world, then relating their export performance to that of the OECD area as a whole and finally examining the financing of their current-account deficit and the resulting indebtedness. Despite the diversity of the countries in the ODC group, they have not generally suffered pronounced, prolonged <b>external</b> <b>disequilibria</b> as a result of autonomous disturbances, thanks to tight monetary policy and structural reforms. The policy reaction of ODCs to the two oil shocks has differed with regards to the financing of the consequent deficits (from reserves {{in the case of the}} first shock; by external borrowing in the case of the second), resulting high levels of indebtedness for some ODCs. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper evaluates {{current account}} {{dynamics}} {{in countries with}} different exchange rate regimes within the EU. In this, the empirical analysis explicitly differentiates between countries with a flexible and a fixed exchange rate regime and members of a monetary union. In addition, we model the adjustment process of <b>external</b> <b>disequilibria</b> by referring to the flexibility of exchange rates and interest rates. The sample covers annual data for 27 EU countries from 1994 to 2011. The estimation {{is based on a}} simple autoregressive model and comes to the conclusion that current account adjustment is significantly hampered in countries that are members of a monetary union. This holds particularly in comparison with floating exchange rate regimes owing to lower exchange rate flexibility. However, the persistence of current account balances in member countries of a monetary union is also more pronounced than in fixed-rate regimes due to less flexible interest rates {{as a result of the}} single monetary policy...|$|E
40|$|The main {{question}} {{addressed in this}} study is the performance of the labour markets in the Western Balkans. The aim is to find out whether they can deliver growth of employment and decline of unemployment in the medium run and whether they can withstand short-term shocks due to changes in demand or supply. These questions are particularly pressing in view of the monetary policy based on fixed exchange rates which is followed by the majority of the countries in this region. In terms of the theory of optimal currency areas, if the exchange rate is fixed, labour markets have to be flexible if there are adverse shocks. Otherwise, adjustment would work through a fall in employment levels and an increase in unemployment. The alternative of flexible exchange rates has been abandoned by most monetary authorities in the region for fears of risk of an exchange rate crisis.

40|$|A {{monetary}} union raises new economic {{questions about the}} interpretation {{and the implications of}} high current account de?cits for the economic performance of its members in the medium term. Recent literature has argued that conventional measures of external sustainability are misleading because they omit capital variations on net foreign asset positions. In this paper we analyze external sustainability making use of the database developed by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007 a) that incudes these valuation effects. The sample period studied covers from the launching of the monetary integration process in Europe (the creation of the ?European Snake? in 1972) up to 2007. The econometric methodology used accounts for the increasing cross-section dependence among EMU countries as well as possible structural breaks endogenously determined.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThis {{document}} {{contains an}} analysis of and statistics on the economic performance of {{the region as a}} whole and of individual Latin American and Caribbean countries in 2001. Regional output grew at a very slow pace (0. 5 %) in 2001 and growth prospects for 2002 are not promising. This situation is directly linked to the global economic crisis, which is affecting the region primarily through trade channels in the midst of unstable world financial markets. Given the scope of these adverse external factors, however, the region's economies succeeded in averting serious domestic or <b>external</b> <b>disequilibria.</b> The one exception was Argentina, which has been {{in the throes of a}} crisis for the last three years. Inflation has continued to abate, and the increase in the external deficit was very small.

40|$|This paper makes three points. The {{first is}} that {{external}} imbalances between Member States are relevant {{for the performance of}} a monetary union when the latter is not backed by a strong political commitment and a solid political framework. Eurozone policymakers have ignored these inter-member imbalances and have instead concentrated on union-wide imbalances, so much so that statistical data on the former phenomenon still remain largely incomplete. There are signs that a correction is in the making, which we hope will lead to a comprehensive quantitative knowledge of intra-EMU imbalances. The second objective of the paper is to design specific policies aimed at reducing inter-member <b>external</b> <b>disequilibria,</b> for example by fixing targets on current-account imbalances symmetrically applied to both deficit and surplus countries. The contrast between the keen attention of the EZ policymakers on national fiscal imbalances and the belated and lukewarm attention given to external imbalances is striking. The third aim of the paper is to propose a more flexible monetary policy aimed at controlling the distribution of liquidity among Member States, resulting from inter-member external imbalances. Our proposal is that National Central Banks should add a risk premium cost to official interest rates on banks that accumulate ‚Äúexcessive‚Äù borrowings or deposits to compensate, respectively, for outflows and inflows of the monetary base due to the effect of external imbalances.

Our approach allows time deformation in order to examine jointly the foreign currency skyrocketing price and its implications on inflation and output level. The stylized results compared to Brazilian economy performance since 1999, evidence that tight monetary and fiscal policies may preclude agents ‚Äô lost of confidence as well as exchange rate huge increases. The domestic currency devaluations that took place in 1999 and 2001, respectively near of 50 % and 33 %, corresponding to 100 % devaluation, improved the external accounts. However it did not solve the chronicle currency account deficit that increased steadily from 1993 to 1998, and remains around 4. 5 % as GDP percentage. Therefore, we claim a currency crash remains open. We estimate the smallest nominal exchange rate that may bring about the external equilibrium is close to R$ 5. 5, a 130 % exchange devaluation respecting December 2001 last rate. For computing this exchange rate, we estimated a vector error correction mechanism among the net exports, the real GDP, the inflation rate, and the real exchange rate. We employed annually data and we did not impose any exogeneity hypothesis. With the impulse-response function following this order, we performed the estimation. We contemplate the floating exchange regime as an alternative solution to internal and <b>external</b> <b>disequilibria...</b>|$|E
40|$|Monetary integration, {{and more}} specifically, the {{creation}} of a monetary union in Europe, raises new economic questions concerning its functioning and governance.
