5000|$|A hybrid {{integrated}} circuit, HIC, <b>hybrid</b> <b>microcircuit,</b> {{or simply}} hybrid is a miniaturized electronic circuit constructed of individual devices, such as semiconductor devices (e.g. transistors and diodes) and passive components (e.g. resistors, inductors, transformers, and capacitors), bonded to a substrate or {{printed circuit board}} (PCB). If the components are on Printed Wiring Board (PWB) then, according {{to the definition of}} MIL-PRF-38534, it is not considered hybrid. A PCB can be called PWB if does not contain embedded components. Hybrid circuits are often encapsulated in epoxy, as shown in the photo. A hybrid circuit serves as a component on a PCB {{in the same way as}} a monolithic integrated circuit; the difference between the two types of devices is in how they are constructed and manufactured. The advantage of hybrid circuits is that components which cannot be included in a monolithic IC can be used, e.g., capacitors of large value, wound components, crystals, inductors.|$|E

40|$|The {{exchange}} of Computer Aided Design (CAD) information between dissimilar CAD systems is a problem. This {{is especially true}} for transferring electronics CAD information such as multi-chip module (MCM), <b>hybrid</b> <b>microcircuit</b> assembly (HMA), and printed circuit board (PCB) designs.
