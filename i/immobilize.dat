40|$|Enzyme {{immobilization}} as {{a technique}} attaches free forms of enzyme molecules to stationary support materials to permit enzymes {{to be reused}} several times. Bovine trypsin as a model enzyme was <b>immobilized</b> onto controlled pore glass (CPG) beads to investigate the optimum conditions for immobilization, {{as well as the}} physico-chemical properties of the <b>immobilized</b> enzyme versus the free form of the enzyme. At pH 9, about 60 % of the enzyme protein incubated with CPG was <b>immobilized</b> onto the CPG, and <b>immobilized</b> bovine trypsin activity was determined as 0. 265 BAPNA U/g CPG beads. The <b>immobilized</b> bovine trypsin showed lower affinity for its substrate, lower susceptibility to inhibition by soybean trypsin inhibitor and higher thermal stability, while the optimum pH and optimum temperature values were shifted to higher values compared to those of the free enzyme. The <b>immobilized</b> enzyme was evaluated for its capacity to extract carotenoproteins from shrimp shell. After 11 re-uses, the <b>immobilized</b> enzyme retained about 77 % of its initial activity, and the total yield of the product from the same <b>immobilized</b> trypsin was 4. 3 times higher than a single use of the same amount of the free enzyme. Cunner fish is a cold water adapted, stomachless teleost fish. Cunner fish trypsin possesses some unique properties compared with homologous trypsins from (i) species acclimated to warm temperature regimes, and (ii) species with functionally distinct-stomachs. Cunner fish trypsin was extracted from pancreatic tissue, and <b>immobilized</b> onto CPG beads using glutaraldehyde as cross-linking reagent. The influence of enzyme loading, the properties of the <b>immobilized</b> enzyme in terms of specific activities, and responses to pH and temperature were investigated. The kinetic properties and operational stability of the <b>immobilized</b> cunner trypsin were studied as well. The pH optimum of the <b>immobilized</b> fish trypsin shifted from pH 8. 5 to pH 9, and the temperature optimum also increased from 45 ºC to 50 ºC versus the free form of the cunner enzyme. The catalytic efficiencies (Vmax/Km) of the <b>immobilized</b> fish trypsin were determined for both amidase and esterase reactions, using BAPNA and TAME as substrates and were found to be greater than those of <b>immobilized</b> bovine trypsin. Thus, the <b>immobilized</b> cunner fish trypsin had a higher catalytic capacity for the hydrolysis of both the amide and ester substrates. The operational stability of <b>immobilized</b> fish trypsin was studied by extracting carotenoprotein from shrimp shell. The <b>immobilized</b> fish trypsin retained 75 % of its initial hydrolytic capacity after 11 re-uses, and the yield obtained was over 20 % higher than that of <b>immobilized</b> bovine trypsin. When the <b>immobilized</b> cunner fish trypsin was applied to digest native pectin methylesterase (PME), it exhibited greater capacity to inactivate the PME than <b>immobilized</b> bovine trypsin. The inactivation efficiency of the <b>immobilized</b> fish trypsin was 20 % higher than that of the <b>immobilized</b> bovine trypsin. The inactivation of PME was influenced by PME concentration, incubation time and temperature. In general, higher temperature, longer incubation period, and lower initial PME concentration produced more PME inactivation. PME inactivated by <b>immobilized</b> fish trypsin and bovine trypsin regained part of its activity during storage at 4 ºC. The initial PME concentration affected the reactivation period. The kinetic studies indicated that the inactivation rate constants increased and D-values (time to inactivate 90 % of the enzyme) decreased with increasing temperature for both <b>immobilized</b> fish trypsin and bovine trypsin. The activation energy (Ea) of PME inactivation by the <b>immobilized</b> fish trypsin was lower than that by the <b>immobilized</b> bovine trypsin, which explains why the <b>immobilized</b> fish trypsin had higher catalytic capacity at various temperatures than <b>immobilized</b> bovine trypsin...|$|R

5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to <b>immobilize</b> high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E

The gastrozooids are small and plump and extend four to six tentacle stubs through their pores but are otherwise invisible. The dactylzooids have hairlike tentacles covered in cnidoblasts. Stings from the cnidocysts <b>immobilize</b> an item of prey and the tentacles thrust it through the mouth of an adjacent gastrozooid, from where it passes into the stomach for digestion.
