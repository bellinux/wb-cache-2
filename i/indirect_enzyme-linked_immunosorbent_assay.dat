40|$|<b>Indirect</b> <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assays</b> (ELISAs) are {{frequently}} run as endpoint ELISAs (e-ELISAs).

Specifically, to determine whether it was possible to run both k-ELISA and e-ELISA on the same plate and establish an appropriate time interval for k-ELISA measurements. A normalization method for k-ELISA slopes (slope ratio) is proposed. Using an indirect e-ELISA test measuring antibodies against Ostertagia ostertagi in milk from dairy cattle, we found that running a k-ELISA had no effect on optical density ratio results of an e-ELISA on the same plate, and that agreement was very strong at 10, 15, and 28 min, allowing for a reduction in the total processing time for ELISA tests...|$|R

40|$|Development and {{evaluation}} of <b>indirect</b> <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> for a screening test to detect antibodies against classical swine fever virus An <b>indirect</b> <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> (ELISA) was developed for a screening test to detect antibodies against classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Viral glycoproteins, which were purified from swine kidney cells infected with CSFV ALD/A 76 strain by the immunoaffinity purification using monoclonal antibody against E 2 protein, were adsorbed on a microtiter plate as the antigen for the antibody detection. Each antibody titer of serum sample was expressed as a sample per positive value calculated with optical absorbance of each sample and that of a positive control. The advantage of this ELISA is its higher sensitivity: most sera containing more than 4 neutralization titers were determined to be positive.

40|$|Seven {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{were produced}} against soybean nodule xanthine dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in ureide synthesis. Specificity {{of the seven}} monoclonal antibodies for xanthine dehydrogenase was demonstrated by immunopurifying the enzyme to homogeneity from a crude nodule extract using antibodies immobilized to Sepharose 4 B beads. Each monoclonal antibody was covalently bound to Sepharose 4 B beads for the preparation of immunoaffinity columns for each antibody. All seven antibodies {{were found to be}} of the IgG 1,K subclass. A competitive, <b>indirect</b> <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> demonstrated that two of the seven antibodies shared a common epitope while the remaining five antibodies defined unique determinants on the protein. Rapid, large scale purification of active xanthine dehydrogenase to homogeneity was performed by immunoaffinity chromatography. The presence of xanthine dehydrogenase activity and protein in every organ of the soybean plant was determined. Crude extracts of nodules, roots, stems, and leaves cross-reacted with all seven monoclonal antibodies in an <b>indirect</b> <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay.</b> A positive correlation was observed between the degree of cross-reactivity of a given organ and the level of enzyme activity in that organ. These data demonstrate that xanthine dehydrogenase is not nodule specific. Antigenic variability of xanthine dehydrogenase present in crude extracts from nodules of soybean, wild soybean, cowpea, lima bean, pea, and lupin were detected in the <b>indirect</b> <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> which corresponded to six binding patterns for xanthine dehydrogenase from these plant species.

40|$|Baylisascaris schroederi is {{a common}} {{parasite}} of captive giant pandas. The diagnosis of this ascariasis is normally carried out by a sedimentation-floatation method or PCR to detect eggs in feces, but neither method is suitable for early diagnosis. Fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) and galectin (GAL) exist in various animals and participate in important biology of parasites. Because of their good immunogenicity, they are seen as potential antigens for the diagnosis of parasitic diseases.

Coinfections with these agents may be common in certain areas of endemicity. Currently, a species-specific method for serological diagnosis of monocytic ehrlichiosis is not available. Previously, we developed two <b>indirect</b> <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assays</b> (ELISAs) using the major antigenic protein 2 (MAP 2) of E. chaffeensis and E. canis. In this study, we further characterized the conservation of MAP 2 among various geographic isolates of each organism and determined if the recombinant MAP 2 (rMAP 2) of E. chaffeensis would cross-react with E. canis-infected dog sera. Genomic Southern blot analysis using digoxigenin-labeled species-specific probes suggested that map 2 is a single-copy gene in both Ehrlichia species. Sequences of the single map 2 genes of seven geographically different isolates of E. chaffeensis and five isolates of E. canis are highly conserved among the various isolates of each respective ehrlichial species.
