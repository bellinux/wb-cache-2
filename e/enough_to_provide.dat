5|$|The {{secretary}} of the Treasury was delighted to hear Keynes had amassed <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a temporary solution for the British Government. But Keynes did not hand the pesetas over, choosing instead to sell them all to break the market: his boldness paid off, as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 11.5 GW of onshore wind potential exists, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> 45 TWh of energy. More than double this amount exists on offshore sites where mean wind speeds are greater than on land. The total offshore potential {{is estimated}} at 25 GW, which although more expensive to install, could be <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> almost half the total energy used in Scotland. Plans to harness up to 4.8 GW of the potential in the inner Moray Firth and Firth of Forth were announced in January 2010. Moray Offshore Renewables and SeaGreen Wind Energy were awarded development contracts by the Crown Estate {{as part of a}} UK-wide initiative. Also in 2010, discussions were held between the Scottish Government and Statoil of Norway with a view to developing a 5-turbine floating windfarm, possibly to be located off Fraserburgh. In July 2016, RSPB challenged development in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. The dimensions of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the masses of the two components.|$|E

5|$|Within four days, 2,300 men had {{answered}} Ellsworth's call. A selection {{of only the}} most desirable men cut that number to 1,100, which was considered a regiment's full strength. When the state {{could not afford to}} supply the new troops, fundraisers were successful in raising $60,000 for the regiment, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> uniforms, several different models of Sharps rifles, and provisions.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{the case}} {{fatality}} rate {{is estimated to}} be 21% by 30days after TBI. A study on Iraq War soldiers found that severe TBI carries a mortality of 30–50%. Deaths have declined due to improved treatments and systems for managing trauma in societies wealthy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> modern emergency and neurosurgical services. The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell from almost half in the 1970s to about a quarter {{at the beginning of the}} 21stcentury. This decline in mortality has led to a concomitant increase in the number of people living with disabilities that result from TBI.|$|E

5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate for successful frequency-division multiplexing. Network analysis was not yet powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E
5|$|The new Order {{was again}} struck {{down by the}} Divisional Court and Court of Appeal before {{proceeding}} to the House of Lords where it was heard by Lords Hoffmann, Bingham, Rodger, Carswell and Mance between 30 June and 3 July 2008. In their judgment, issued on 22 October 2008, the Lords decided by a 3-2 majority to uphold the new Order in Council, stating that it was valid and, although judicial review actions could look at Orders in Council, the national security and foreign relations issues in the case barred them from doing so. In addition, Cook's statement had not been clear and unambiguous <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> legitimate expectation.|$|E
5|$|The skyway was a {{constraint}} in {{the building}} of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the turnpike bridge by , without shutting it to traffic.|$|E

5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 20,000 tickets, {{out of a}} total capacity of 52,063. The remaining seats are accounted for by Hampden Park debenture holders, hospitality, sponsors, media and segregation areas. In excess of 1,000 unused debentures were distributed to each club. The allocation was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> for the season ticket holders of each club, with Hearts having 10,000 and Hibs 7,500 approximately, although both clubs anticipated that there would be little or no need for a general public sale. Hearts decided to sell tickets using their loyalty points system, while Hibs connected their allocation to sales of season tickets and memberships. Due to high demand, Hearts tightened the criteria needed for a ticket during the sales process. Regular tickets cost £35 or £28 for adults and £10 for children under 15 years old.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
5|$|From 1947, Ivatt 2-6-0 {{lightweight}} tender locomotives were {{allocated to}} Goole shed, and were soon {{operating on the}} Axholme Joint Railway. The last two Barton Wright 0-6-0 locomotives left Goole shed in December 1950 for Wakefield {{and all of the}} seven Ivatt locomotives are thought to have worked on the line. They were popular with the crews, as the tender was fitted with a back sheet for the cab, and was low <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> good visibility when running tender-first across the moors on the return journey to Goole. In 1957 they were briefly replaced by four elderly J10 0-6-0 tender engines, transferred from Liverpool, but all were withdrawn in 1958. Small diesel shunters were allocated to Goole shed in 1960, for use in the docks, but were also used on the Axholme Joint Railway. Only one of the Ivatt 2-6-0 locomotives was left at Goole by mid-1962.|$|E

5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E
5|$|NEERC is {{expected}} to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned to generate electricity for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21MW of electricity, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. The plant will be a mirror image of the current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 {{in the construction of the}} plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.|$|E
5|$|Gonzalo de Alvarado {{and his men}} {{decided to}} remain; the area was {{apparently}} well-populated <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> worthwhile tribute, {{and the existence of}} precious metal deposits in the region had already been established by earlier forays. Alvarado decided to found the new town of Gracias a Dios at Opoa, rather than at the nearby site that had been set aside by Chávez. In late 1536, Gonzalo de Alvarado finally founded the new town, assigning officials as had been designated by his brother. Although 100 citizens had been assigned by Pedro de Alvarado, in reality it had about 40 upon its foundation. The town only remained at Opoa for a brief period, before it was transferred to a new site. Gonzalo and his men campaigned to impose their control over a wide area, penetrating as far as the Comayagua valley. Although claiming conquest of a wide region, Gonzalo had too few soldiers to effectively control it. Native resistance was such that the colonists were soon threatened by starvation, and the natives refused to serve the Spanish. San Pedro was in a similar situation, and was unable to provide any kind of relief to Gracias a Dios. The colonists appealed to Maldonado in Guatemala for assistance, and were informed that Francisco de Montejo would soon be taking up governorship, and would provide any assistance necessary.|$|E

5|$|Stanley {{produced}} a 'Panoptic Stereoscope' in 1855, which was financially successful. Stereoscopes had sold for five shillings each– Stanley discovered a simpler method to make them, which {{enable him to}} sell them for one shilling. He {{was able to take}} an additional shops at 3–4 Great Turnstile and 286 High Holborn, as well as a skilled assistant. He did not patent the Panoptic, so it was soon copied around the world, but he had sold <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the capital required to manufacture scientific instruments. In 1861 he invented a straight line dividing machine for which he won first prize in the 1862 International Exhibition in London. Stanley brought out the first catalogue of his products in 1864. By the fifth edition, Stanley was able to list important customers such as several government departments, the Army, the Royal Navy, railways at home and abroad, and London University. From 1865, he worked on improving the elegance and stability of surveying instruments, especially the theodolite, whose construction he simplified. It had a rotating telescope for measuring horizontal and vertical angles and able to take sights on prominent objects at a distance. The component parts were reduced to fewer than half of the 226 used in the previous version, making it lighter, cheaper and more accurate.|$|E
