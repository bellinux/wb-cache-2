40|$|This project aims at {{establishing}} a new method {{to characterize the}} interface between 4 H-SiC and passivating dielectric layers. The investigations are made on metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) test structures. The oxides are made of Al 2 O 3, deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), and SiO 2, deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and the semiconductor is lowly doped 4 H-SiC n-type epitaxial layers. These structures {{have been exposed to}} different fluencies of Ar ion irradiation to induce damage at the interface and then measured by well-established electrical techniques, as well as the new method utilizing optical <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (<b>FCA)</b> technique to assess the interface traps. We have furthermore developed an analytical tool using Matlab that can extract surface recombination velocity (SRV) from the optical data. This tool is developed for an idealized epi-layer between two surfaces, but could also be applied, for instance, to the region between the emitter and base contacts on SiC mesa etched BJT’s. First, optical <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (<b>FCA)</b> measurements are carried out to measure the effective lifetimes in the structures. The data obtained from FCA is then fitted with the analytical tool and SRVs, for samples with both types of dielectrics with various Ar ion fluencies, are extracted. Standard electrical measurements using capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements are also undertaken and the density of interface traps (Dit) is extracted using the Terman method. Extracted SRV values are then compared to Ditvalues. It is observed that SiO 2 samples show a large rise of SRVs, from 0. 5 x 104 cm/s for a reference sample to 8 x 104 cm/s for a fluence of 1 x 1012 cm- 2, whereas Al 2 O 3 samples show more stable SRV, changing from 3 x 104 cm/s for the un-irradiated reference sample to 6 x 104 cm/s for a fluence of 1 x 1012 cm- 2. A very similar trend is observed for Dit values extracted from CV measurements and it can therefore be concluded that the FCA method is very suitable for characterization of the interface, and together with CV, {{it should be possible to}} obtain quantitative values on charge carrier trapping dynamics...|$|R

To this end, we {{examine the impact of}} several types of loss on the total amplification of the Stokes wave that can be achieved via SBS. We account for linear loss and nonlinear loss of third order (two-photon absorption, 2 PA) and fifth order, most notably 2 PA-induced <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (<b>FCA).</b> From this, we derive an upper bound for the output power of continuous-wave Brillouin-lasers and show that the optimal operating conditions and maximal realisable Stokes amplification of any given waveguide structure are determined by a dimensionless parameter ℱ involving the SBS-gain and all loss parameters. We provide simple expressions for optimal pump power, waveguide length and realisable amplification and demonstrate their utility in two example systems. Notably, we find that 2 PA-induced FCA is a serious limitation to SBS in silicon and germanium for wavelengths shorter than 2200 nm and 3600 nm, respectively. In contrast, three-photon absorption is of no practical significance. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the optical properties of n- and p-type polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) layers. We determine the optical constants n and k {{of the complex}} refractive index of polycrystalline silicon by using variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. Moreover, we {{investigate the}} effect of different doping levels in the poly-Si on <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (<b>FCA).</b> Thereby, we demonstrate that the FCA in poly-Si can be described by a model developed for crystalline silicon (c-Si) at a first approximation. The optical properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers (a-Si:H) are also investigated as a reference. With ray tracing simulations the absorption losses of poly-Si and of the a-Si:H layers are quantified {{with respect to the}} film thickness. Based on this approach we find that the short-circuit current density losses due to parasitic absorption of poly-Si layers are significantly lower when compared to a-Si:H layers of the same thickness. For example the short-circuit current density loss due to a 20 nm thick p-type poly-Si layer is around 1. 1 mA/cm 2, whereas a 20 nm thick p-type a-Si:H layer leads to a loss of around 3. 5 mA/cm 2...|$|R
40|$|Determination of dopant {{concentrations}} and mobilities {{is highly}} relevant for compensated silicon materials but crucial as standard models and standard methods fail {{due to the}} presence of multiple dopant species. Thus, an alternative method for direct determination of the net doping concentration p 0 is presented, which is based on measurements of the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (<b>FCA)</b> with the help of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and enables the majority carrier conductivity mobilities to be determined purely experimentally. Using a set of p-type FZ-silicon samples {{with a wide range of}} base resistivities, accuracy of the FTIR-FCA method for determining p 0 and of the iron-boron pairing association time method for determining the total boron concentration are evaluated in depth and found to be highly satisfactory. These methods are applied to a set of samples from three compensated silicon crystals, with large differences in the dopant concentrations and the compensation ratio. Measurements of the dopant concentrations and the majority carrier conductivity mobilities as a function of ingot position indicate that the Klaassen mobility model is a good description for the conductivity mobility in compensated p-type silicon for a wide range of dopant concentrations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{requirements}} for a micromorph tandem cell front {{transparent conductive oxide}} (TCO) are multiple. This essential layer needs a high transparency, excellent conduction, strong light scattering into silicon and good surface morphology for the subsequent growth of silicon cells. These parameters are all linked and trade-offs have to be found for optimal layer. The optimum combination, taking into account current achievable materials properties, is still unclear. Concerning transparency, we study here the impact of <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (<b>FCA)</b> on the photogenerated current by using first doped and non-intentionally-doped zinc oxide (ZnO). Then, Bi-layers made of flat indium tin oxide (ITO) under various thicknesses of rough ZnO allow {{a study of the}} haze influence alone. It is shown that FCA induces drastic current losses in the infra-red part of the spectrum, and haze increase enhances the cell response in the infra-red part up to a certain limit of grain size. Surface feature sizes above 0. 4 µm appear to be useless for haze increase purpose at the ZnO/Si interface. By using an optimized 2 µm thick LPCVD ZnO, micromorph cells showing 13. 7 % initial efficiency, with a total current of 27. 7 mA/cm 2 could be obtained with 240 nm and 2. 8 µm of top and bottom cell thicknesses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA firing {{study has}} been {{conducted}} {{for a variety of}} samples with different surface morphologies as well as with different bulk and emitter doping concentrations. In this study the firing settings were fixed and the temperature profile on the sample was measured with thermocouples. We have observed that the measured peak temperature on solar-cell R&D samples in an infrared (IR) conveyer belt firing furnace is strongly dependent on the surface morphology of the sample and its doping level. The surface morphology determines the coupling of IR radiation into the substrate. Samples with a random pyramids (RP) surface texture have reached temperatures that were 150 oC higher than that of their polished counterparts. In addition to that, the doping level determines the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (<b>FCA)</b> and thus the heating up due to absorption of IR radiation. We have derived an analytical expression for a Planck-spectrum weighed FCA coefficient that is inversely proportional with the absolute black-body temperature (T) squared. Since the total energy radiated by a black body scales with T 4, the radiation absorption is proportional with T 2. The total doping level of a sample was quantified by Gtot, the summation of the sheet conductance values [Ω- 1 /sq] of the base and emitter region(s). For a sample with a base resistivity of 3 Ωcm and two emitters of 100 Ohm/sq on either side, yielding Gtot= 0. 028 Ω- 1 /sq, the measured peak temperature was found to be 150 oC higher than that of a ‘bare’ (lifetime) sample of 10 Ωcm with Gtot= 0. 0016 Ω- 1 /sq...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{fabrication}} of high efficiency (9 - 10 %) microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H) p-i-n solar cells on glass {{has been so}} far reported mostly for cells deposited on sputtered and etched zinc oxide (ZnO). In this paper, we describe the preparation of µc-Si:H devices with efficiencies close to 10 %, using glass coated with ZnO deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). These results are achieved both by improving the transparency of the TCO in the infrared part of the spectrum and by changing the surface morphology. The LPCVD front and back contacts are first optimized for p-i-n microcrystalline silicon solar cells by decreasing the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (<b>FCA)</b> of the layers and by increasing the surface roughness of the front contact. These modifications result in an increase of the current density but also in a reduction of the fill-factor (FF) and of the open-circuit voltage (Voc). To avoid these reductions, a surface plasma treatment of the ZnO is introduced. It modifies the surface morphology by turning the typical V-shaped valleys of the LPCVD ZnO into U-shaped valleys and by erasing from the surface small-sized pyramids and asperities. As a result, for fixed deposition parameters, the p-i-n µc-Si:H silicon solar cell efficiency increases from 3. 3 % to 9. 2 %. This increase {{is caused by the}} disparition of microcracks and damaged areas which appear otherwise {{at the bottom of the}} V-shaped valleys. Further optimization of the modified ZnO front contact and of the cell process lead to an efficiency of 9. 9 %. Finally, we report the {{fabrication of}} micromorph cells with 11. 8 % initial efficiency on the modified ZnO...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of n-type back-contacted back-junction silicon solar cells where the boron-doped emitter diffusion {{on the rear}} side is locally overcompensated by a phosphorus-doped base-type back surface field (BSF) diffusion has been analysed theoretically and experimentally. By overcompensating the emitter diffusion the noncollecting base-type region can be reduced significantly allowing electrical shading losses to be minimized. It {{has been found that}} for solar cells with a lowly doped BSF diffusion the local external quantum efficiency and the short-circuit current density Jsc could be improved significantly. For reference solar cells with an undiffused gap between emitter and BSF diffusion and a large noncollecting base-type region, a maximum Jsc of 40. 9 ?mA/cm 2 could be achieved and for solar cells with a locally overcompensated boron-doped emitter diffusion featuring a small noncollecting base-type region a maximum Jsc of 41. 4 ?mA/cm 2 has been measured. The reduction of Jsc losses caused by <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (<b>FCA)</b> in highly doped silicon at near-infrared wavelengths is also shown. Furthermore, theoretical investigations are performed by one-dimensional device simulations and the influence of highly doped and lowly doped emitter and BSF diffusions on the open-circuit voltage Voc is presented. For solar cells with a locally overcompensated boron-doped emitter diffusion Voc could be improved from 629 to 652 ?mV when lowly-doped diffusions and thermally grown SiO 2 and antireflection plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposited (PECVD) SiNx passivation stacks are applied. For the reference solar cells with an undiffused gap between the lowly doped emitter and BSF diffusions Voc of 693 ?mV could be achieved for a plasma enhanced atomic layer deposited (PEALD) Al 2 O 3 passivation layer...|$|R
40|$|Quantum Cascade Lasers are {{coherent}} sources {{based on}} quantum confinement and tunneling in semiconductor heterostructures. They are unipolar devices where the lasing action takes place between two conduction subbands of biased multi-quantum well structure. These innovative devices are promising photonic sources especially because they allow an emission in the THz range. Nevertheless there are loss mechanisms that limit their performances {{and the research}} for improved structures is pursued worldwide. <b>Free</b> <b>Carrier</b> Absorption (<b>FCA)</b> is a plausible source of losses for far-IR and THz lasers. It consists in the reabsorption of the laser photons by the <b>free</b> <b>carriers,</b> in particular those that occupy the upper laser subband. FCA arise from intra-subband and inter-subband oblique transitions (in the k space) activated by static scatterers or phonons. Tayloring FCA requires to deeply {{understand the nature of}} the optical transitions in imperfect structures. We have solved numerically the Schrödinger equation by an exact diagonalization for a GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum well (DQW) structure in presence of ionized impurities. These static scatterers are randomly placed on a plane located either in the wells or in the barrier of the DQW. The results of the calculation show that ionized impurities change dramatically the nature of the energy spectrum by creating bound states below the subband edges (1). Nevertheless we have found that the effect of the impurity potential on the absorption spectrum can be tailored by adjusting the position of the impurity plane with respect to the heterostructure wave functions. For comparison the absorption spectrum was also calculated by the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach (2), which takes into account scattering within the self-consistent Born approximation (dotted lines). While this approximation does not provide the effects of bound states, the general trend regarding the position dependence of the linewidth is reproduced. In the present work, we will present the results of a detailed analysis {{of the nature of the}} optical transitions and point out the existence of efficient optical quasi-selection rules in disordered structures, with a specific attention to the case of ionized impurities. These calculations allow to better understand the FCA spectrum shape and to quantitatively assess its magnitude in cascade structures.

40|$|In {{this work}} optical {{studies of the}} effect of surface {{passivation}} for surface recombination velocity at the interface between 4 H-SiC epitaxial layer and various passivation layers are presented. Four samples have been used consisting of three main parts: thin film oxide layer, 4 H-SiC epitaxial layer and 4 H-SiC substrate. The substrates for all samples are the same, highly doped n-type. The doping and thickness of the epitaxial layers are different; three samples have n-type epilayer, doping around 3 - 5 × 1015 cm- 3 and one sample, the thinnest one, has a p-type doping of 1 × 1017 cm- 3. Two types of oxide are used as passivation layer: Al 2 O 3 on the n-type and p-type with 80 nm thickness, which is prepared by the ALD method, and SiO 2 – grown layer with 50 nm thickness, which is produced by thermal growth technique at 1250 ºC in N 2 O ambient for 8 hours. The forth epilayer was bombarded with 30 keV energy argon ion implanted with different doses through a native oxide. <b>Free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (<b>FCA)</b> technique was used to extract effective lifetime of excess carriers. The excess carriers are created by a high energy laser (355 nm) pulse, exiting electrons to the conduction band. The decay of these carriers is then studied by a second laser at 861 nm. The carriers in the substrate recombine quickly, but in the thin epilayer the lifetime is long enough to be influenced by surface recombination at the epi-passivation layer interface. By fitting the experimental results, the surface recombination velocity (SRV) at the interfaces of epi/oxide can be extracted. The SRV of substrate/epi is assumed constant at 1 × 106 cm/s value. The highest SRV, 5. 7 × 104 cm/s, is found in the n-type epitaxial layer with 50 nm SiO 2 and the slowest value, 1. 07 × 103 cm/s, is found in the p-type epitaxial layer with 80 nm Al 2 O 3. For the argon implanted sample, we did not find the anticipation results. Although the highest dose gives the most defects, the SRV, 1. 41 × 103 cm/s, was not very different for other doses...|$|R

40|$|On {{the road}} towards silicon {{thin-film}} photovoltaic modules with a conversion efficiency of 10 %, the micromorph tandem solar cell is a promising candidate. Two ingredients {{are commonly used}} for light-management within the micromorph solar cell: (1) nano-textured interfaces and (2) insertion of an intermediate reflector in-between the two component cells of the tandem. The purpose of the nano-textures is to promote light scattering at the optical interfaces and therefore to increase the probability of absorption of red light in the amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) absorber of the top cell and of infrared light in the microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H) absorber of the bottom cell. For micromorph devices deposited on glass plates, these nano-textures are obtained by the deposition of the solar cell on a surface-textured transparent conductive front electrode. The function of the second ingredient, the intermediate reflector, {{is to increase the}} photo-current density within the a-Si:H top cell, thanks to reflections produced at the additional optical interface. This document study the interplay between those two ingredients within the optoelectronic system formed by the micromorph solar cell. In particular, the impact of the surface morphology of the front contact on the growth and performances of µc-Si:H solar cells is described. A study of the electronic transport within µc-Si:H cells is carried out using Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy and two original methods based on conductive atomic force microscopy. Also, the importance of the angular distribution of the light scattered by nano-textured front electrodes is demonstrated. Angular distributions for light scattered in-air and in a-Si:H are calculated from atomic force microscopy pictures of different front electrodes. The calculations are performed using phase screens and the scalar scattering theory. Theoretical results obtained with this approach are successfully confronted with experimental data obtained in-air. Besides, a quantitative comparison of the relative importance of a reduced <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (<b>FCA)</b> in the front electrode and of an improvement of its light-trapping capability is presented. For the different types of front contacts used in this work, this comparison shows that the reduction of FCA produces more than 50 % of the gains in photo-current density. Regarding the direct effect of the intermediate reflector, this work experimentally demonstrates that the gain obtained in the current density of the top cell is larger with nano-textured interfaces than with flat interfaces. An experimental gain up to 2. 8 mA/cm 2 is achieved here. With respect to device optimization, the best initial conversion efficiency achieved in this work is 13. 3 % for a 1. 2 cm 2 micromorph cell deposited on a glass plate with an anti-reflection (AR) coating, yielding the remarkably high value of 13. 8 mA/cm 2 for the short-circuit current density.

40|$|We {{study the}} ac {{anomalous}} Hall conductivity σ_xy(ω) of a Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry. Even {{in the absence}} of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> these materials exhibit a "universal" anomalous Hall response determined solely by the locations of the Weyl nodes. We show that the <b>free</b> <b>carriers,</b> which are generically present in an undoped Weyl semimetal, give an additional contribution to the ac Hall conductivity. We elucidate the physical mechanism of the effect and develop a microscopic theory of the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> contribution to σ_xy(ω). The latter can be expressed in terms of a small number of parameters (the electron velocity matrix, the Fermi energy μ, and the "tilt" of the Weyl cone). The resulting σ_xy(ω) has resonant features at ω∼ 2 μ which may be used to separate the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> response from the filled-band response using, for example, Kerr effect measurements. This may serve as diagnostic tool to characterize the doping of individual valleys. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{modelled}} the nonlinear {{effects in}} silicon waveguides which are crucial for many applications, including all-optical signal processing, switching, wavelength conversion. I {{have developed the}} model for ultrafast all-optical switching using split-step Fourier method and calculated the nonlinear phase shift due to the Kerr effect and including the nonlinear losses (i. e. two-photon absorption, <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption and <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> index) ...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to enhancing the visible light absorption, doped ions further influence {{the concentrations of}} the <b>free</b> <b>carriers.</b> Because <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption is the main photon absorption mechanism in the NIR region, the NIR reflectance of oxide pigments can be improved by controlling the concentrations of <b>free</b> <b>carriers.</b> In addition, the NIR reflectance is also connected to the TiO 2 host material properties, such as crystal structure, particle morphology, and size. In view of the different mechanisms influencing VIS and NIR reflectance, doped TiO 2 pigments {{should be able to}} be prepared with dark color and high NIR reflectance. This would simultaneously satisfy the need for energy savings and a pleasing color palette.|$|R
30|$|Vice versa, the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> {{concentration}} can {{be calculated}} if the frequency of SO phonon mode {{and the size of}} the NWs are known. Here, the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration in sample B is estimated to be 2.25 × 1017 cm- 3 using the measured diameter (42 nm) and SO phonon frequency (230.0 cm- 1). This result is close to the value obtained through electrical measurements in [5]. This high <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration in the InAs NWs might be caused by the unintentional doping due to carbon background incorporation [5]. To get more understanding of this SO phonon mode in InAs NWs, temperature-dependent Raman measurements are also performed on the InAs NWs in sample B, the results are shown in Figure 2 c. It is observed that the SO phonon peak shifts to lower frequency with increasing the temperature, which is similar to the temperature behavior of the LO and TO mode of InAs NWs, and can be explained by the lattice expansion in NWs. It should be noted that though the SO feature is not apparent at high temperatures (> 173 K) the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration should still be around the value (2.25 × 1017 cm- 3) at low temperatures considering the fact that the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration induced by unintentionally doping is much higher than that of intrinsic carrier in InAs materials (~ 1 × 1015 cm- 3).|$|R
