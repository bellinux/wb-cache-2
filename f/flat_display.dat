40|$|Non-flat {{interactive}} displays {{have one}} very distinct property that {{differs from the}} touch displays we use on tablets or smartphones: the spatial structure that defines their non-flatness. In this paper, we investigate one specific class of spatial structure – planes bent in one dimension with both concave and convex curvature. We study horizontal pointing and dragging along those bends {{to see how it}} differs from <b>flat</b> <b>displays.</b> Structure can also enable new interactions that have not been possible with <b>flat</b> <b>displays,</b> e. g. perceivable vertical dragging across a horizontal structure. Overall, we found that accuracy of interaction as well as subjective preference can be increased, and that the new interactions can enhance existing direct touch control...|$|R

Also note that OUI is a successor to and form of tangible user interface that always features a bitmapped display skin around its multi-shaped body. Finally, note that all OUIs are examples of haptic technologies, as their physical shapes, like real objects, provide passive tactile-kinaesthetic feedback even in non-actuated cases.|$|E

5000|$|One of Sylvania's heavily-advertised TV {{features}} was {{a lighted}} perimeter mask of adjustable brightness called [...] "HALOLIGHT", which was purported {{to ease the}} optical transition if a viewer glanced from a dark background to the bright TV screen. Today Philips markets an Ambilight feature, lighting the wall behind a <b>flat</b> <b>display</b> to soften the viewing experience. HALOLIGHT could not be adapted for color TV, because color TV white balance (aka tracking from low to high brightness) was unpredictable. Since the white color temperature of the HALOLIGHT and the illuminated color screen could not be made equivalent, HALOLIGHT was withdrawn.|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : Long and Short PapersInternational audiencePointing {{tasks are}} {{a crucial part}} of today’s {{graphical}} user interfaces. They are well understood for <b>flat</b> <b>displays</b> and most prominently are modeled through Fitts’ Law. For novel displays (e. g., curved displays with multi-purpose areas), however, it remains unclear whether such models for predicting user performance still hold – in particular when pointing is performed across differently oriented areas. To answer this question, we conducted an experiment on an angularly coupled display – the Curve – with two input conditions: direct touch and indirect mouse pointer. Our findings show that the target position affects overall pointing speed and offset in both conditions. However, we also found that Fitts’ Law can in fact still be used to predict performance as on <b>flat</b> <b>displays.</b> Our results help designers to optimize user interfaces on angularly coupled displays when pointing tasks are involved...|$|R
50|$|A sideboard, {{also called}} a buffet, is {{an item of}} {{furniture}} traditionally used {{in the dining room}} for serving food, for displaying serving dishes such as silver, and for storage. It usually consists of a set of cabinets, or cupboards, and one or more drawers, all topped by a <b>flat</b> <b>display</b> surface for conveniently holding food, serving dishes, or lighting devices. The overall height of the tops of most sideboards is approximately waist level. The words sideboard and buffet are somewhat interchangeable, but if the item has short legs, or a base that sits directly on the floor with no legs, it {{is more likely to be}} called a sideboard; if it has longer legs it is more likely to be called a buffet.|$|E
50|$|The first laptop in {{the modern}} form was the Grid Compass 1101, {{designed}} by Bill Moggridge in 1979-80, and released in 1983. Enclosed in a magnesium case, it introduced the now familiar clamshell design, in which the <b>flat</b> <b>display</b> folded shut against the keyboard. The computer could be run from batteries, and was equipped with a 320×200-pixel electroluminescent display and 384 kilobyte bubble memory. It was not IBM-compatible, and its high price (US$8,000-10,000) limited it to specialized applications. However, it was used heavily by the U.S. military, and by NASA on the Space Shuttle during the 1980s. The GRiD's manufacturer subsequently earned significant returns on its patent rights as its innovations became commonplace. GRiD Systems Corp. was later bought by the Tandy (now RadioShack) Corporation.|$|E

To carry out a full looping display the cloud base must be above 4,500 feet to avoid the team entering the cloud while looping. If the cloud base is less than 4,500 ft but more than 2,500 ft the Team will perform the Rolling Display, substituting wing-overs and rolls for the loops.

5000|$|A laptop computer, {{also called}} a notebook, {{is a small}} {{personal}} computer designed for portability. Usually, all of the hardware and interfaces needed to operate a laptop, such as the graphics card, audio devices or USB ports (previously parallel and serial ports), are built into a single unit. Laptops usually have [...] "clamshell" [...] design, in which the keyboard and computer components are on one panel and a <b>flat</b> <b>display</b> screen on a second panel, which is hinged to the first panel. The laptop is opened for use and closed for transport. Closing the laptop also protects the screen and keyboard during transportation. Laptops have both a power cable that can be plugged in and high-capacity batteries that can power the device, enhancing its portability. Once the battery charge is depleted, {{it will have to}} be recharged through a power outlet. In the interests of saving power, weight and space, laptop graphics cards are in many cases integrated into the CPU or chipset and use system RAM, resulting in reduced graphics performance when compared to an equivalent desktop machine. For this reason, desktop or gaming computers are usually preferred to laptop PCs for gaming purposes.|$|E
40|$|While large flat {{vertical}} displays {{may facilitate}} persistent public sharing of work, they may {{do so at}} a cost of limited personal display space when everyone can see each other’s activity. By contrast, new form factors, such as spherical displays, support sharing display space by limiting the user’s view to at most one hemisphere. In this paper, we investigate how different interactive large display form factors can support differences in sharing of information during competitive and cooperative task conditions. We implemented three different large display types: spherical, flat, and a <b>flat</b> <b>display</b> with divider. Results show that task performance of the <b>flat</b> <b>display</b> with divider did not differ significantly from that of the spherical display. Additionally, we implemented and compared three peeking techniques that facilitated sharing of information. Results show participants peeked significantly more in competitive tasks than they did in cooperative tasks. Usage of peeking techniques between the spherical display and the <b>flat</b> <b>display</b> with divider were similar, and distinct from that of the <b>flat</b> <b>display.</b> Not surprisingly, results show that the affordance of easily glancing at a partner’s work on the <b>flat</b> <b>display</b> provided a significant advantage in cooperative tasks...|$|E
