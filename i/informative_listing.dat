40|$|BACKGROUND: Variegation in flower {{color is}} {{commonly}} observed in many plant species and also occurs on ornamental peaches (Prunus persica f. versicolor [Sieb. ] Voss). Variegated plants are highly valuable in the floricultural market. To gain a global perspective on genes differentially expressed in variegated peach flowers, we performed large-scale transcriptome sequencing {{of white and}} red petals separately collected from a variegated peach tree. RESULTS: A total of 1, 556, 597 high-quality reads were obtained, with an average read length of 445 bp. The ESTs were assembled into 16, 530 contigs and 42, 050 singletons. The resulting unigenes covered about 60 % of total predicted genes in the peach genome. These unigenes were further subjected to functional annotation and biochemical pathway analysis. Digital expression analysis identified a total of 514 genes differentially expressed between red and white flower petals. Since peach flower coloration {{is determined by the}} expression and regulation of structural genes relevant to flavonoid biosynthesis, a detailed examination detected four key structural genes, including C 4 H, CHS, CHI and F 3 H, expressed at a significantly higher level in red than in white petal. Except for the structural genes, we also detected 11 differentially expressed regulatory genes relating to flavonoid biosynthesis. Using the differentially expressed structural genes as the test objects, we validated the digital expression results by using quantitative real-time PCR, and the differential expression of C 4 H, CHS and F 3 H were confirmed. CONCLUSION: In this study, we generated a large EST collection from flower petals of a variegated peach. By digital expression analysis, we identified an <b>informative</b> <b>list</b> of candidate genes associated with variegation in peach flowers, which offered a unique opportunity to uncover the genetic mechanisms underlying flower color variegation...|$|R

40|$|Little is known, from a {{clinical}} perspective, {{about the use}} of wrist motion during daily living activities. This work aimed to identify an <b>informative</b> <b>list</b> of physical tasks that could be measured practically in {{a clinical}} setting. Measurement methods including data gloves were investigated, but these were not used for reasons of practicality and accuracy. A commercial electrogoniometer system was chosen and used to measure wrist motion in flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation planes while eighteen right-handed, healthy, volunteer subjects (twelve male and six female, aged 23 to 56 years, mean 29. 9 years) carried out mock-ups of the twelve everyday tasks listed in the Michigan Hand Questionnaire. The 2 -plane data from each task-measurement test were displayed on an angle-angle scatter plot, overlaid with an elliptical, estimated maximum-motion envelope. The mean ranges of motion, averaged over all eighteen subjects, varied widely between tasks: 1. 3 ° of flexion/extension (S. D. 1. 49 °) and 1. 4 ° of radial/ulnar deviation (S. D. 2. 10 °) were seen while holding a glass of water, and corresponding values of 61. 4 ° (S. D. 12. 1 °) and 24. 3 ° (S. D. 7. 79 °) while buttoning a shirt. Frequency plots were also generated to show which wrist positions were most commonly used during the tasks. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to reduce the original task list to just four tasks which represented a wide range of aspects of wrist motion, including large mean ranges of motion and mean locations that were displaced away from the neutral wrist position. These four short-listed tasks (holding a frying pan, turning a key in a lock, holding a glass of water and buttoning a shirt) could all be carried out whilst seated, with little reliance on other physiological joints and with low-cost props. The overall approach described in this thesis could be refined into a useful clinical tool, either for identifying motion impairments tracking individual patients’ progress. In particular, the use of the elliptical estimated motion envelopes gave immediate and useful context to the task data. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{increased}} {{accessibility of}} gene expression tools has enabled {{a wide variety}} of experiments utilizing transcriptomic analyses. As these tools increase in prevalence, the need for improved standardization in processing and presentation of data increases, as does the need to guard against interpretation bias. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis is a powerful method of interpreting and summarizing biological functions. However, while there are many tools available to investigate GO enrichment, there remains a need for methods that directly remove redundant terms from enriched GO lists that often provide little, if any, additional information. Findings Here we present a simple yet novel method called GO Trimming that utilizes an algorithm designed to reduce redundancy in lists of enriched GO categories. Depending on the needs of the user, this method can be performed with variable stringency. In the example presented here, an initial list of 90 terms was reduced to 54, eliminating 36 largely redundant terms. We also compare this method to existing methods and find that GO Trimming, while simple, performs well to eliminate redundant terms in a large dataset throughout the depth of the GO hierarchy. Conclusions The GO Trimming method provides an alternative to other procedures, some of which involve removing large numbers of terms prior to enrichment analysis. This method should free up the researcher from analyzing overly large, redundant lists, and instead enable the concise presentation of manageable, <b>informative</b> GO <b>lists.</b> The implementation of this tool is freely available at: [URL] </p...|$|R

40|$|Genomics {{profiling}} {{based on}} high dimensional data from high throughput experiments that measure {{the expression of}} tens of thousands of genes or biomarkers holds great promises for clinical application. Diagnosis, prognosis and treatment selection for individual patient can become more accurate with strong statistical prediction models based on robust <b>informative</b> gene <b>lists.</b> Numerous studies have been published claiming to have built accurate prediction models. However the initial enthusiasm has been tempered by the uncovering of many false claims. The reason for these false claims lies mainly in the inadequate statistical methodology that is being used to develop the quantitative model underlying prediction or classification. Predictive modeling in gene expression data is challenging and it suffers from a lack of reproducibility as well as instability of the findings, which is strongly associated to the curse of dimensionality in these datasets (a very low number of samples relative to the number of available genes). Literatures showed there is no unique gene signature list resulting from different prediction models that were constructed on the same data. The set of genes involved in predictive models depended heavily on the chosen subset of samples in predictive modeling. We used information from published gene expression studies to serve the two following goals. First, we evaluated potential factors affecting the accuracy of predictive models in binary outcome data. Second, meta-analysis was performed as a method to generate a more accurate list of differentially expressed genes, as well as to evaluate the added value of meta-analysis as a feature selection method in predictive modeling...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to examine hepatic gene expression changes caused by GH transgenesis and enhanced growth. This is the first use of cDNA microarrays to study the influence of GH transgenesis on liver gene expression in a non-mammalian vertebrate, and the first such study using sexually immature animals. Three groups of coho salmon were examined: GH transgenic on full ration (T), GH transgenic on restricted ration (R), and control non-transgenic (C). Specific growth rates for weight in T were approximately eightfold higher than in C, and fourfold higher than in R. Differential gene expression in T, R, and C samples was determined using 3500 and 16 000 gene microarrays, and R and C samples were compared on a different 4000 gene microarray. The use of multiple microarray platforms increased the overall proportion of the hepatic transcriptome considered in these studies. Cross-platform comparisons identified genes behaving similarly between studies. For example, genes encoding a precerebellin-like protein and complement component C 3 were downregulated in R relative to C (R C in all three studies. Comparisons of <b>informative</b> gene <b>lists</b> within and between studies inferred causes of altered gene expression. For example, ten genes, including 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, hemoglobins and 31 ̆ 78, and a C-type lectin, were likely induced by GH transgenesis due to their presence in both T>C and R>C gene lists. Eleven genes, including hepcidin, nuclear protein p 8, precerebellin-like, transketolase, and fatty acid-binding protein, were present in both T<C and R<C gene lists and were, therefore, likely suppressed by GH transgenesis. A large number of salmonid genes identified in these studies are involved in iron homeostasis, mitochondrial function, carbohydrate metabolism, cellular proliferation, and innate immunity. Pentose phosphate pathway genes phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, transaldolase, and transketolase, were dysregulated in GH transgenic samples relative to control samples. Changes in the expression of genes involved in maintaining hemoglobin levels (heme oxygenase, hemoglobins and 31 ̆ 78, Kruppel-like globin gene activator, hepcidin) in R and T fish indicate a need for additional hemoglobin in the transgenic fish, perhaps due to higher metabolic rate required for enhanced growth.

40|$|Serving {{more than}} one billion users around the world, today's online social {{networks}} (OSNs) pervade our everyday life and change the way people connect and communicate with each other. However, the open nature of OSNs attracts a constant interest in attacking and exploiting them. In particular, they are vulnerable to various attacks launched through malicious accounts, including fake accounts and compromised real user accounts. In those attacks, malicious accounts are used to send out spam, spread malware, distort online voting, etc. In this dissertation, we present practical systems that we have designed and built to help OSNs effectively throttle malicious accounts. The overarching contribution of this dissertation is the approaches that leverage the fundamental weaknesses of attackers to defeat them. We have explored defense schemes along two dimensions of an attacker's weaknesses: limited social relationships and strict economic constraints. The {{first part of this}} dissertation focuses on how to leverage social relationship constraints to detect fake accounts. We present SybilRank, a novel social-graph-based detection scheme that can scale up to OSNs with billions of users. SybilRank is based on the observation that the social connections between fake accounts and real users, called attack edges, are limited. It formulates the detection as scalable user ranking according to the landing probability of early-terminated random walks on the social graph. SybilRank generates an <b>informative</b> user-ranked <b>list</b> with a substantial fraction of fake accounts at the bottom, and bounds the number of fake accounts that are ranked higher than legitimate users to O(log n) per attack edge, where n is the total number of users. We have demonstrated the scalability of SybilRank via a prototype on Hadoop MapReduce, and its effectiveness in the real world through a live deployment at Tuenti, the largest OSN in Spain. The second part of this dissertation focuses on how to exploit an attacker's economic constraints to uncover malicious accounts. We present SynchroTrap, a system that uncovers large groups of active malicious accounts, including both fake accounts and compromised accounts, by detecting their loosely synchronized actions. The design of SynchroTrap is based on the observation that malicious accounts usually perform loosely synchronized actions to accomplish an attack mission, due to limited budgets, specific mission goals, etc. SynchroTrap transforms the detection into a scalable clustering algorithm. It uncovers large groups of accounts that act similarly at around the same time for a sustained period of time. To handle the enormous volume of user action data in large OSNs, we designed SynchroTrap as an incremental processing system that processes small data chunks on a daily basis but aggregates the computational results over the continuous data stream. We implemented SynchroTrap on Hadoop and Giraph, and we deployed it on Facebook and Instagram. This deployment has resulted in the unveiling of millions of malicious accounts and thousands of large attack campaigns per month. Dissertatio...|$|R

How about making that rank higher for every citation, and more so if the citing paper was itself often cited? For many of us, these may be “academic questions”, {{but they are not}} irrelevant. Citations are the currency of research - a bit like links are the currency of the web. And in some fields, this currency is well managed and accessible to most of the researchers - {{it seems to me that}} PubMed acts that way for medicine, and maybe arXiv does for physics. Of course, general citation indexes like Web of Science are supposed to address this problem, but they are terribly inadequate for our research domain: Web of Science is relatively easy to search, as I can include my affiliation in my search (and I haven’t changed affiliations, which is probably an exception!), but it includes only 13 of my papers and finds only 7 citations of those - though more and more every year, so maybe there is reason to be optimistic Somewhat more representative for our domain may be citeseer: I am not sure how many of my papers it includes (I can’t seem to search on author?!), but it does find 50 citations to them. This requires browsing through many pages of citations of some paper by some Duval, so this is not very easy to use or process. DBLP nicely presents a number of different authors whose name resembles mine. It lists 50 of my papers and presents an <b>informative</b> co-author <b>list,</b> but it does not include any information about citations. Google Scholar seems to include most of my papers and many more references than the previous systems, but there are quite a few doubles and results from (very) gray literature. Also, it is difficult to distinguish self-citations from those by external authors. In a simple exploration, Xavier analysed the google scholar results for our “Metadata Principles and Practicalities” paper: the site mentions 136 references: of which 38 were self references and 10 were unusable, so there were 88 left. Most of those 88 just had the author and the title of the paper (or master thesis or technical report). So, Xavier searched the web and completed the information.

40|$|Endocytosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic {{processes}} in a mammalian cell. Beside the regulation of protein and lipid composition of cell and vesicle membranes, it also is responsible for signaling and trafficking processes such as protein and pathogen degradation or protein and molecule sorting. The protein machinery regulating the necessary vesicle fission, fusion and transport has been partly investigated, however a number of processes observed haven’t been explained yet and proteins involved are still unknown or not examined in relation to endocytosis. This thesis will investigate methods to determine and understand a potential endosomal proteome. The endosomal proteome is the collection of proteins that associate with these intracellular organelles. This will include the early endosome, late endosome, recycling endosome, lysosomes subcellular compartments and the membrane transport vesicles generated or directed to these subcellular compartments. I will focus on computational, specifically on bioinformatics methods, which have already been published. The integration of several methods can combine individual strengths and gives enough evidence for a membership of a protein in the endosomal proteome. The mammalian protein subcellular localization database LOCATE grew substantially over the last years. Not only the human proteome has been added, but also computational subcellular location prediction methods, automated image analysis and third party submission of literature data. LOCATE contains a manually reviewed set of endosomal proteins with peer-reviewed literature evidence. Computational tools allow subcellular location prediction for a complete proteome in a high- throughput approach. I reviewed the five leading prediction tools and tested them on an independent data set. This evaluation study revealed individual weaknesses and strengths, but also highlights the need of high quality data sets. The underrepresentation of minor organelles such as Golgi apparatus and endoplasmatic reticulum results in misleading information. The attempt to use computational prediction methods to determine endosomal proteins has been abandoned, as none of the methods are predicting this cellular compartment with any reliability. I described a new method to establish the endosomal proteome by using computational approaches only. Starting with the confident data set of endosomal proteins from LOCATE and applying text- mining, similarity, homology and affiliation to known protein complexes resulted in a potential data set of 645 proteins labeled Endo 645. Incorporation of relational networks and their properties yielded new insights into Endo 645, but also showed the effect of predicted annotations as from Gene Ontology. No certainty can be given to Gene Ontology annotations, as the majority has not been manually curated. The different extensions of the network in Endo 645 resulted in a variety of protein-protein interaction networks with low <b>informative</b> value. The <b>list</b> of proteins in Endo 645 serves now as a foundation for the computationally defined endosomal proteome. To evaluate Endo 645 for being the endosomal proteome additional computational analysis was conducted. Gene expression data from the tissues and cells from the immune system was integrated and mapped onto the Endo 645 protein-protein interaction network. A major finding was the significant difference in gene expression levels of Endo 645 genes compared to the average expression levels of the whole mouse genome. I showed different ways to compare gene expression data between individual genes and in protein complexes to investigate high correlating profiles. In conclusion, this work focused initially on the update of LOCATE and the evaluation of computational prediction tools aiming to source information for endosomal proteins. The outcome led me to set up my own methods and analysis to establish a potential endosomal proteome. The final data set of 645 proteins has the potential to represent the endosome proteome. Endo 645 provides the foundation for further analysis, computationally and experimentally...|$|R
40|$|RECOMMENDATION REQUIRES EFFORT Collaborative {{filtering}} {{methods have}} been applied {{to a number of}} domains like books, videos, audio CDs and Usenet news. These systems require some {{effort on the part of}} users before they can generate recommendations (see for example [5] on the 9 ̆ 3 cold-start 9 ̆ 4 problem). How much effort they require depends on domain and application. Some recommender systems for books or videos require rating a specific number of items before they generate the first prediction. If users can save money by not buying the wrong books and videos this effort might pay off. The Usenet news filter GroupLens [2] gathers ratings while users read articles so the process of building the profile and getting recommendations is interleaved. This strategy might lower the threshold for getting started. How much effort a user is willing to make depends not only on the domain but also on the personal value of the recommendation. Users who depend on the information in a newsgroup might make every required effort, but occasional users with a less serious information interest might not. To summarize: The higher the required effort the more potential users will quit. Recommending TV programs has much in common with recommending Usenet news articles. Like news articles TV programs are a daily updating stream unlike the rather stable databases within book and video recommender systems. There is a relatively high number of programs/ newsgroup articles every day. Recommendation is supposed to help users to cope with the flood and to find the few interesting items for them. How much effort are users going to spend on TV recommendations? Interviews showed: Not much. 9 ̆ 3 I don 9 ̆ 2 t watch much TV anyway 9 ̆ 4, 9 ̆ 3 I just want to know what 9 ̆ 2 s on tonight 9 ̆ 4 and so on. It seems that TV doesn 9 ̆ 2 t have much value to people, although statistics show that people do spend a lot of time watching. All users we asked already had experience with printed guides, which gave them a rather clear expectation of what a TV guide should do. Traditionally, both TV and TV guides have been broadcast media. TV makers broadcast, viewers watch. Editors write, readers read. Interactive and collaborative concepts are new here. It is obviously a risky undertaking to try to introduce new techniques in such a 9 ̆ 3 where is the beef 9 ̆ 4 situation. DESIGN GOALS The low disposition of interviewed persons to spend much effort on TV guides was the motivation for our group to try out a new way of gathering ratings. We made two basic design decisions: (a) don 9 ̆ 2 t ask users to do something they don 9 ̆ 2 t have an immediate benefit from and (b) don 9 ̆ 2 t overtax users with concepts unknown to them like rating, relevance or recommendation. Figure 1 gives an overview of our recommendation engine. Before programs reach users they are first globally rated and ranked according to the size-of-the-audience ratings (see below). Then they are selected according to user-individual genre profiles. Personal rating offsets are added. Next, programs are presented to the users as ordered lists or tables. Individual programs in the lists and tables are color-coded to indicate the personalized ratings. From these lists and tables users choose the programs they actually want to watch and collect them in their personal laundry lists. The laundry list serves as a reminder which can be printed out and taken to the VCR or TV set. Preliminary user tests suggest that the laundry list is perceived as a useful tool. To avoid any additional questioning we use the content of users 9 ̆ 2 laundry lists as an input for recommendation generation. Programs in the laundry lists are interpreted as being rated high and recommended to other users. This approach has similarities with the implicit ratings deduced from reading time of newsgroup articles described in [6]. Laundry list content is processed by the two modules sizeof- the-audience rating and opinion leaders. 9 ̆ 3 SIZE OF THE AUDIENCE 9 ̆ 4 The size-of-the-audience rating generates a general ranking of all programs. The rating of an individual program is calculated as the number of times the program occurs in users 9 ̆ 2 laundry lists. The more often a program has been selected for viewing the higher the rating. The size-of-the audience rating can lead users 9 ̆ 2 attention to unexpected events that are not covered by personal profiles. In Germany, for example, the Tour de France came first into the focus of public interest when the German Telekom team was very successful in 1997. Although (or because) it is not personalized, the size-of-the-audience rating can be useful for detecting such events. OPINION LEADERS Since the ratings delivered by the size-of-the-audience ratings are general to all users, so-called opinion leaders are added as a source of more distinct, personal and higher quality recommendation. Opinion leaders are users that publish their otherwise private laundry list along with their names in a public folder. The system offers and recommends opinion leaders like it recommends genres. 9 ̆ 3 You could have found all these programs more easily if you had subscribed to the genre Basketball and the opinion leader Lars Brückner. Do you want to do that now? 9 ̆ 4 How to become an opinion leader? Based on user profiles and laundry lists a program can estimate which users 9 ̆ 2 selections could be of interest for the community. Candidates should a) correlate with many other users, b) cover interest areas not yet covered by enough opinion leaders and c) use the laundry list on a regular basis. If these requirements are fulfilled the system will suggest that a user becomes an opinion leader. Being an opinion leader requires no extra work. But to deserve their name we want them to select more accurately or even to rate or annotate programs. Why should users do the extra work? 9 ̆ 3 Ways to provide compensatory benefits to those group members need to be found 9 ̆ 4 [3, p. 810]. We have to reward them. One way is to organize the opinion leaders in a competitive way and to reward the winners. The success of an opinion leader can be measured in subscriptions, i. e. the number of users that selected them as their favorites. Concept Tour de France: a) display opinion leaders ordered by their success as a leader board. The currently first and most successful one wears the yellow jersey b) reward the best ones by giving awards and prices at the end of each stage c) drop the least successful one when new users apply. DISCUSSION The central element of the suggested no-extra-effort rating system is the laundry list. Certainly: The laundry list is a magnitude less powerful than explicit seven-items scale ratings: It provides only Boolean input, reasons for selecting and not selecting items are ambiguous and it can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies. The applied technique shows similarities to last year 9 ̆ 2 s experiments at MyYahoo to correlate users according to uploaded bookmark lists. On the other hand the laundry list approach frees us from explaining users that they will help generating recommendations using it. The direct utility of the laundry list avoids lots of the trouble of explaining, convincing and persuading users to rate. This solves much of the general problem that many users experience the promised benefit associated with rating as being far away. After all, recommendation is a rather abstract concept and the question is how many first time users are willing to learn enough about it for it to become an incentive. But at the end, those users that want more than the mainstream recommendation of the size-of-the-audience rating do have to spend some effort. The system can suggest opinion leaders, but since these suggestions are based on the less <b>informative</b> laundry <b>lists,</b> users will have to check and fine tune to get equally good results as they would with systems using ratings on seven-items scales. How do opinion leaders relate to those systems where the virtual community is selected by the computer? In those systems one 9 ̆ 2 s virtual community can change by the hour. Opinion leaders are an attempt using active collaborative filtering [5] to provide 9 ̆ 3 names 9 ̆ 4 behind recommendations, like a large set of editors 9 ̆ 6 along with the option to become one. Hill et al. state: 9 ̆ 3 Recommendation and evaluations should come from people, not a black box machine or so-called agent 9 ̆ 4 [4, p. 196]. The opinion leader concept is built on the assumption of role specialization: 9 ̆ 3 Yet there is evidence that people naturally prefer to play distinct producer/consumer roles in the information ecology 9 ̆ 4 [1, p. 60]. It divides users into two distinct groups: A large majority of consumers that contribute only a little to a mass-average and a group of self-selected leaders that are willing to spend more effort on the system for getting social or monetary reward. How far can we get at zero user effort? We need more user tests to find out how much information we can draw out of implicit ratings and which other techniques can be applied to edit them and offer them to users. This will be subject to evaluations that will follow our online debut in May...|$|R
