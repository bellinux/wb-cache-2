500|$|John Brousseau was not {{sent to the}} Hole, {{but what}} he saw of it made him decide to leave Scientology in 2010 after 33 years in the Church. He {{was struck by how}} [...] "dozens of these people , they were just so alive, but <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> now and they were just husks. They wouldn't say or {{originate}} anything, they seemed to have no purpose, they were just like sheep. There's no way 100 people could be evil horrid [...] and DM's the only [...] one. No way." [...] He had known and been friends with some of those in the Hole for decades and could not bear what he was seeing. As he put it, [...] "I can't stop it, but I can at least stop supporting it. So I left." [...] He left a note in his room for his colleagues to find: [...] "By now you've noticed I'm gone. I couldn't stand to see my Sea Org friends so mistreated. I won't support it anymore. Goodbye." ...|$|E
60|$|Euphemia and the boarder {{looked at}} each other. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> Then I opened my mouth in earnest.|$|E
60|$|As I spoke <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> with a {{smile of}} renewed hope; {{but there was no}} {{answering}} smile in their eyes. It was Dian who enlightened me.|$|E
6000|$|Especially {{the young}} women. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> as they dart and flash before the shops, like wagtails {{on the edge}} of a [...] pool.|$|R
6000|$|She paused again a little. [...] "It was high, certainly--for those fragments. I think I feel, as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> there, rather {{ashamed to}} say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' sighed {{the good}} lady, 'I must believe you, for now <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>'em</b> <b>I</b> think I {{should have known}} 'em anywhere. My dear Miss Pecksniffs, how happy your Pa has made me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> as she pointed. [...] "That is true!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "I see it {{when you}} show it. Lines meant for effect. No {{straightness}} or directness in them!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course I {{looked at}} the dragoons most,' said Anne, disconcerted. 'And when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> my eyes {{naturally}} fell upon the trumpets. I {{looked at the}} dragoons generally, no more.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> {{they were}} just talking among themselves. I only looked for a moment because I {{was in a hurry}} to get to the kitchen and get back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't imagine," [...] {{answered}} he. [...] "I've noticed {{them for}} some time, and fancied they were black sea-gulls; {{but the more}} <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> the more <b>I</b> feel convinced they are much larger than gulls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There; {{this is my}} cheek, and {{the other}} is Lucy's; though now that <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> both, <b>I</b> think that hers is getting to be the most blooming; sweeter dews fall on that one, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about his luck. He's one of those fellows that make me hate them the first time <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> I've {{a sort of a}} feeling that I shall live to kick him some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Comrade! Monsieur! Ah, {{what a good}} word! And they, {{such men}} as these two, had made it accursed. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> I remembered their lies, their promises, their menaces, and all my days of misery. Why could they not have left me alone after I came out of prison? <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> and thought that while they lived I could never be free. Never. Neither I nor others like me with warm hearts and weak heads. For I know I have not a strong head, monsieur. A black rage came upon me--the rage of extreme intoxication--but not against the {{injustice}} of society. Oh, no! ...|$|E
60|$|Judging by appearances, the bed had {{certainly}} been occupied. Thrown across the counterpane lay the nightgown he had worn. I took {{it up and}} saw some spots on it. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> a little closer. They were spots of blood.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> it was true. They {{were huge}} {{and ran up}} for fifty or sixty feet without a bough. Moreover, it was {{probable}} that the god climbed better than we could. The Kalubi began to move inland in an indeterminate fashion, and I asked him where he was going.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed! Well, now <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> more carefully, <b>I</b> {{see that}} their {{garments}} do speak of squalid poverty. I have never before seen such a ragged crew, though I have sometimes encountered individuals of the class on the streets." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{say when}} I'm grown up these things will appear [...] More plain {{than they do}} when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> here, [...] But I think I see some things uncommonly clear, [...] As <b>I</b> sit and <b>look</b> down from the window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor ever will, I doubt not. I {{feel myself}} to be back upon my throne when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> But tell me, dear coz, what shall we do next, when we have driven this bastard Henry from the kingdom which he hath filched?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Harding and Mr. Densmore were announced. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> curiously. They {{were both}} most {{correctly}} dressed in evening clothes. They both had somehow the hard expression of worldly men, tempered not altogether pleasantly by symptoms of good living. They greeted Mr. Bundercombe with bluff heartiness. He gave them each a hand.|$|E
60|$|These were {{a melancholy}} sight, a mere heap of sodden and still smoking ashes. I could have wept when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> {{thinking}} {{of all the}} trade goods and stores that were consumed beneath, necessities for the most part, the destruction of which must make our return journey one of great hardship.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was those}} banknotes, Mr. Bundercombe," [...] he confessed. [...] "You {{gave me one}} packet to be {{destroyed}} in the kitchen. I obeyed; but <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> first. Never did I see such wonderful work! Those notes--every one seemed real! Every one, as I {{put it into the}} fire, gave my heart a pang.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> now, these pages, {{written in}} the days of stress and dread, wear a look of strange serenity. They were written calmly, yet not in cold blood, and are perhaps the only kind of pages I could have written at that time full of menace, but also full of faith.|$|R
6000|$|... "On he came, {{his head}} well up (a buffalo does not {{generally}} lower his head till {{he does so}} to strike); those great black horns--as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> before me, gentlemen, I seem to see <b>them</b> come charging <b>at</b> me as I did ten years ago, silhouetted against the green bush behind;--on, on!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal," [...] said Haley, [...] "I'm fillin' out {{an order}} for a plantation, and I think I shall put her in. They telled me {{she was a good}} cook; and they can use her for that, or set her at the cotton-picking. She's got the right fingers for that; <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>'em.</b> Sell well, either way;" [...] and Haley resumed his cigar.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's lucky <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> first, because I couldn't tell whose {{they are}} now," [...] he said. [...] "Anyway, as I guess the stuff hasn't {{had time to}} get inside, Steve will know they're his when he opens them." [...] He raised the bag a little and {{examined}} it. [...] "This thing's surely wet." ...|$|E
6000|$|At last, I {{found the}} number I desired; but the closely-printed columns swam before me as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> A {{glass of water}} stood on a table near me--I dipped my {{handkerchief}} in it, and cooled my throbbing eyes. The destiny of my future life might {{be decided by the}} discovery I was now about to make! ...|$|E
60|$|With a {{sense of}} danger my intellect and {{observation}} quickened, and I grew more watchful than was my wont. I noticed that the old woman's eyes were constantly wandering towards my hands. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> too, and saw the cause--my rings. On my left little finger I had a large signet and on the right a good diamond.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say," [...] he said, [...] "I {{like your}} teeth. They're so white an' regular, an' not big, an' not dinky little baby's teeth either. They're ... they're just right, an' they fit you. I {{never seen such}} fine teeth on a girl yet. D'ye know, honest, they kind of make me hungry when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>'em.</b> They're good enough to eat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{speaking}} {{of my own}} grapes, as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> when <b>I</b> use that argument for my own comfort. The worst {{of it is that}} when we know that the grapes are not sour,--that they are the sweetest grapes in the world,--the argument is of no use. I won't tell any lies about it, to myself or anybody else. I want my grapes at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Watson," [...] said he, [...] "that {{it is one}} of the curses of a {{mind with}} a turn like mine that <b>I</b> must <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{everything}} with reference to my own special subject. You <b>look</b> <b>at</b> these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> {{and they}} looked at me for quite a long while, since {{following}} my usual rule, I determined not {{to be the first to}} speak. Moreover, if they meant to kill me there was no use in speaking. At length their leader, an elderly man with thin legs, a large stomach and a rather pleasant countenance, saluted politely, saying-- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{gasped and}} stared, and could {{scarcely}} believe my ears. But {{he was not}} joking; he was as serious {{as if he had}} addressed himself to one of his officers. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> all, standing interested and expectant. Dick was as grave and erect as a deacon. Jim seemed much impressed. But old Hiram Bent, standing somewhat back of the others, deliberately winked at me.|$|E
60|$|I went {{a little}} farther into the room, Mr. Parker, with a sigh, {{abandoned}} his position. He unclosed {{the fingers of his}} hand and removed the silk handkerchief. I saw upon the table my aunt's brooch, my sister's pendant and Sir Blaydon Harrison's diamond pig. I said not a word. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> and I looked at Mr. Parker. He smiled weakly and scratched his chin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{a glimpse}} of a large enclosure, with some big buildings. Perhaps <b>I</b> can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> better as <b>I</b> go back to Boston." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have two}} {{delightful}} old china dogs there. May <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> closely?" [...] said Aline, crossing the room towards {{the fireplace and}} thereby becoming the unconscious cause of the other accident. Picking up Magog, {{she sat down on}} the cushion under which was secreted Priscilla's chocolate cake. Priscilla and Anne exchanged agonized glances but could do nothing. The stately Aline continued to sit on the cushion and discuss china dogs until the time of departure.|$|R
5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|R
