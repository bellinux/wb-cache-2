2500|$|The Rogallo wing is a {{flexible}} type of airfoil {{composed of two}} partial conic surfaces with both cones pointing forward. Neither a kite, glider, or a type of aircraft, the Rogallo wing is most often seen in toy kites, but {{has been used to}} construct spacecraft parachutes during preliminary testing for NASA's Gemini program in the early 1960s, <b>dirigible</b> <b>parachutes,</b> ultralight powered aircraft like the trike, as well as hang gliders. Before the end of 1948, American aeronautical engineer Francis Rogallo had succeeded in inventing the first fully successful flexible-wing kite that he called the 'Flexi-Kite'. A patent was applied for in 1948 and granted in 1951. His wife, [...] Gertrude Rogallo, also made a significant impact upon the invention, having sewed the fabric into the required dimensions that used household items like kitchen curtains. Rogallo believed that flexible wings provided more stability than fixed surfaces, leading to an elimination of rigid spars during flight. Because of this, Rogallo's concepts are seen as classics examples of purity and efficiency in aviation.|$|E
5000|$|It was on October 4, 1957, {{when the}} Russian {{satellite}} Sputnik became a {{concern to the}} United States and {{marked the beginning of}} the 'space race' and the creation of NASA. Rogallo was in position to seize the opportunity and with his help at the wind tunnels, NASA began a series of experiments testing Rogallo's flexible wing, which got renamed Parawing, in order to evaluate it as a recovery system for the project Gemini space capsules. Rogallo designed his flexible wing to allow the astronauts to deploy it like a parachute at subsonic speeds during reentry, then glide their capsule to a specified touchdown point. F. Rogallo's team collaborated with at least two American aircraft companies, Ryan Aeronautical Company and North American Aviation, as there was potential for gliders, <b>dirigible</b> <b>parachutes,</b> and other new types of manned aircraft; this mainly involved stabilizing the leading edges with compressed air beams or rigid structures like aluminium tubes. By 1961 NASA had already made test flights of an experimental STOL [...] "aerial utility aircraft" [...] - the Ryan XV-8 (also known as the [...] "Flying Jeep" [...] or [...] "Fleep") and by March 1962, of a weight-shift glider called Paresev.|$|E
50|$|The craft {{caught fire}} at about 4:55pm while {{cruising}} {{at an altitude}} of 1200 ft over the Chicago Loop. When it became clear the dirigible was lost, the pilot, Jack Boettner, and chief mechanic, Harry Wacker, used parachutes to jump to safety. A second mechanic, Henry Weaver, died when his parachute caught fire. Another passenger, Earl H. Davenport, a publicity agent for the White City Amusement Park, jumped from the <b>dirigible,</b> but his <b>parachute</b> got tangled in the rigging and he hung fifty feet below the burning craft; he was killed when the airship crashed. A fifth person who <b>parachuted</b> from the <b>dirigible,</b> Chicago Daily News photographer Milton Norton, broke both legs and later died at a hospital.|$|R
