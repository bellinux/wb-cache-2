The research focuses on the efficiency of the healthcare system. One of the goals was to compare the efficiency of private <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> hospitals and <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> hospitals owned by county, town or municipality. To evaluate the efficiency the Data Envelopment Analysis method was used, which is a benchmarking method applied to measure the efficiency of homogeneous organisational units. When undertaking such measuring it is crucial to assume that inputs are minimalised and outputs are maximised, i. e. outputs must bring a positive result while inputs must be as low as possible. Even though the research did not prove that either private <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> hospitals or <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> hospitals owned by the county, town or municipality to be more efficient than the others, the results are valuable as they point at specific options for increasing the efficiency of individual hospitals...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an assessment concerning {{the potential of}} <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> aquaculture, with outcomes assessed from a systems-based perspective. A literature review concerning the negative impacts and the limitations of current wastewater management approaches demonstrated that improved strategies are required. <b>Horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> aquaculture was proposed, where the productive reuse of aquaculture wastewater ameliorates associated negative impacts. A definition for <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> aquaculture is presented and management strategies that conform to this definition reviewed. The development and application of the ADEPT bioeconornic model to assess the potential of a constructed wetland and trout fishery to treat wastewater from a commercial smolt unit in Scotland is described. The model outputs were tested against observations from commercial facilities operating under comparable conditions to those envisaged for <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> systems. Findings demonstrated that the modelling approach adopted was generally effective in predicting the composition of wastewater outputs from the farm {{and the effect of}} the selected treatment strategies. The model was applied to two further case studies. One assessed the potential of treating wastewater from shrimp farms in Thailand using a constructed mangrove wetland; the second evaluated the possible advantages of a rational design approach to lagoon-based wastewater treatment and reuse, as opposed to a conventional design and traditional practices developed in peri-urban Calcutta...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} the multinational firm and the determination of international trade policy. At issue is whether the multinational firm exerts a protectionist or liberalizing influence on countries' national trade policies. Vertical integration appears quite unambivalently to give the multinational firm reason to favor liberal international trade policies. <b>Horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> multinational enterprises, on the other hand, are inherently more protectionist than national firms since they own local import-competing production facilities at home and abroad, and hence have an interest in protection in both markets. Such protectionist presumption notwithstanding, we nevertheless demonstrate that via the process of political competition the <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> multinational enterprise has a liberalizing influence on the determination of countries' international trade policies...|$|R

40|$|SME {{clustering}} {{has attracted}} much attention to date as it encourages SMEs to achieve competitive advantage through co-operation. Although the Australian government advocates and actively promotes the formation of SME clusters, much academic commentary is dissatisfied with the theory on clusters, in particular its reliance on geographic proximity. The literature primarily addresses the benefits of industry clusters but overlooks the processes of how clusters are formed. This leaves some sections of the SME population underserved particularly those involved in <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> value chains. This thesis explores the formation process of a horizontal alliance and compares this to Rogers’ innovation-diffusion theory. Through {{a case study of}} an Australian carpet buying group, SMEs were surveyed to collect data on the characteristics of buying group growth over a 13 year period. Our results show that the S-shaped innovation diffusion pattern of Rogers’ theory accurately describes the growth of the buying group over this time. In particular, strong support was found for the opinion leadership theory. The use of Rogers’ theory led {{to a better understanding of}} the role of networks and ICTs in promoting information sharing. In particular, the research finds that the dominant theory of geographical proximity advanced by Porter (1998 a) needs to be qualified in relation to <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> value chains where SMEs share a high degree of homogeneity...|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{aquaculture}} {{development is}} frequently associated with negative environmental impacts, competition for resources and conflict. Consequently, {{a new paradigm}} of ecologically-sound, socially responsible and economically viable aquaculture development based on systems-thinking, resource use efficiency and joint analysis with stakeholders is needed. Horizontal integration, combining aquaculture production systems to optimise resource use efficiency constitutes a promising approach in this regard. Research shows that an array of <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> systems are technically viable, however, few studies have combined this with consideration of the managerial, financial and economic demands. A bioeconomic modelling approach was employed here to assess the broader implications of adopting <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> land-based marine aquaculture in temperate and warm water settings. The temperate system, integrating fish, microalgae and shellfish culture and a polishing lagoon was developed on the Atlantic coast of France. Modelling outcomes predicted that when all costs were considered this approach failed to generate a positive Internal Rate of Return (IRR) over ten years. Subsequent scenarios showed a worthwhile return (ten-year IRR 19. 4 %) was generated when land and labour opportunity costs were omitted and a 20 % premium on products included. The warm water system developed near Eilat, Israel combined sea urchins, shrimp and seaweed culture with a constructed wetland. Assuming baseline production of one million sea urchins annually from year three onwards, modelling outcomes showed a reasonable ten-year IRR of 18 %. Reducing sea urchin mortality from 15 % to 9 % annually resulted in an IRR of 29. 4 %, while assuming that Salicornia spp. production would reach 33 kg m− 2 y− 1 in the wetland resulted in an IRR of 133. 4 %. Findings suggest that bioeconomic modelling {{can contribute to the}} optimisation of <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> aquaculture systems, helping elucidate promising scenarios and identify key constraints and priorities for targeted research and development. Bioeconomic modelling of other horizontal integration strategies, such as shrimp culture with shellfish, macroalgae and mangrove wetlands could elucidate economically viable approaches to much needed ecologically-sound and socially responsible practices. However, modelling should be supplemented by market analysis, including assessment of consumer attitudes, comprehensive risk assessment, ethical review, environmental impact assessment and joint assessment with stakeholders. Moreover, an enabling institutional framework is a prerequisite to more widespread adoption of horizontal integration; policy initiatives and regulatory tools focused on internalising environmental costs of aquaculture development will be critical...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many high {{technology}} goods {{are based on}} standards that require several essential patents owned by different IP holders. This {{gives rise to a}} complements and a double mark-up problem. We compare the welfare effects of two different business strategies dealing with these problems. Vertical integration of an IP holder and a downstream producer solves the double mark-up problem between these firms. Nevertheless, it may raise royalty rates and reduce output as compared to non-integration. Horizontal integration of IP holders (patent pool, pass through) solves the complements problem but not the double mark-up problem. Vertical integration discourages entry and reduces innovation incentives, while a <b>horizontally</b> <b>integrated</b> firm always benefits from entry and innovation...|$|R
