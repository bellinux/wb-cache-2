They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
500|$|This season's episodes were {{produced}} {{in a process}} {{similar to those of}} the previous season. Each episode was outlined in two-to-three pages that contained the necessary plot information. These outlines were then handed to storyboard artists, who created full storyboards. Design and coloring were done in Burbank, California, and animation was handled overseas in South Korea by Rough Draft Korea or Saerom Animation. The season was storyboarded and written by Cole Sanchez, Rebecca Sugar, Tom Herpich, Skyler Page, Ako Castuera, Moynihan, Bert Youn, Somvilay Xayaphone, and Steve Wolfhard. Ward was proud with the writing staff for the season, saying, [...] "Everyone [...] is super talented [...] And they're all a bunch of brainiacs, super smart". He explained that [...] "They're amazing in helping us because they let us write really cool ideas [...] they're really supportive, <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> trying to say, of what we're trying to do." [...] The season was produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Frederator Studios.|$|E
500|$|Since {{completing}} {{the purchase of}} the club, Ashley has announced that he planned to sell the club on three different occasions. The first occurred after fan protests over the resignation of Kevin Keegan on 14 September 2008, when Ashley stated, [...] "I have listened to you. You want me out. That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now trying to do." [...] However, he took it off the market on 28 December 2008 after being unable to find a buyer. On 31 May 2009, it was reported that Ashley was attempting to sell the club again. On 8 June 2009, Ashley confirmed that the club was up for sale at an asking price of £100million. By the end of August 2009, the club was back off the market. On 16 October 2017, Newcastle United announced that owner Mike Ashley had once again put the club up for sale, reporting that he hoped that a deal could be concluded by Christmas 2017.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 21 years old, Zamzam Mohamed Farah was {{the only}} female athlete {{competing}} for Somalia at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was making her first appearance in the quadrennial event. Prior to the competition, Farah spoke of her and Mohamed's training which involved running through manned militia road blocks who occasionally mistaken them for suicide bombers and threatened to shoot them. Despite this, {{she said that she}} was [...] "very much excited" [...] to compete at the Games: “I hope I will win, inshah’Allah [...] That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> expected to do, so that I can change the narrative of Somalia.” Farah competed in the first heat of the women's 400 metre discipline on 3 August, finishing seventh and last of all runners, with a time of one minute and 20.48 seconds. She finished behind Geisa Coutinho of Brazil (53.43 seconds) and Kazakhstan's Marina Maslyonko (53.66 seconds) in a heat led by Francena McCorory of the United States (50.78 seconds). Farah finished 45th (and last) out of all runners overall, and was unable to advance into the semi-finals after finishing 28.39 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in her heat who made the later stages. After the event she was appaulded by the crowd and said: [...] "It was great to be here to participate in the Olympic Games and tell people Somalia is still here." ...|$|E

2500|$|Explicitly {{addressing}} {{the question of}} inability to believe, Pascal argues that if the Wager is valid, the inability to believe is irrational, and therefore must be caused by feelings: [...] "your inability to believe, because reason compels you to [...] and yet you cannot, [...] from your passions." [...] This inability, therefore, can be overcome by diminishing these irrational sentiments: [...] "Learn from those who were bound like you[...] [...] [...] Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.—'But this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid of.'—And why?

2500|$|In 2006 Panahi made Offside. In the film, a {{group of}} young Iranian girls {{disguise}} themselves as boys to sneak into Azadi Stadium to watch the World Cup qualifying football playoff game between Iran and Bahrain. The film was partially shot during the actual game it depicts. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution women have been banned from attending football matches in Iran on grounds of rowdy and aggressive language, lewd behavior, and seeing men in shorts and short sleeve shirts. At one point Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had wanted to repeal the law but was overruled by the ulema. Panahi has stated [...] "I use the football game as a metaphor to show the discrimination against women on a larger scale. All my movies have that topic at their center. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> trying to change in Iranian society." [...] The film was inspired by an incident several years earlier when Panahi's daughter was refused entry to a football stadium but ended up sneaking into the stadium anyway.|$|E

As mayor Greg Nickels put it, [...] "This is not about music, this is not about a party. This was about a guy who decided {{he was going to kill}} people and he had the firepower to do it." [...] Several city council members spoke up against the [...] "quick fix" [...] mentality inherent in the Times editorial; council member Peter Steinbrueck added he was [...] "really incredulous over young teenaged girls going out all night unsupervised and mixing with much older people," [...] but didn't see that as an issue over the nature of the place where they had socialized. Sandra Williamson, mother of shooting victim Christopher [...] "Deacon" [...] Williamson, announced, [...] "I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that those raves continue… That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to do for Chris." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer added that [...] "even… former City Attorney Mark Sidran", whom they described as [...] "Seattle's best-known defender of underage dance restrictions," [...] said that [...] "Some tragedies defy any sort of rational response in terms of regulation because they're completely irrational events you can't really predict or prevent." ...|$|E
