40|$|Specific binding of 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> was {{demonstrated}} in microsomal membranes (microsomes) from rat and rabbit kidneys. Female rabbit kidney microsomes showed the highest binding activity and {{were used for}} further study. The association of 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> was time- and temperature-dependent and the binding reaction was reversible. Scatchard analysis of saturation data indicated a dissociation equilibrium constant, KD, of 56 pM and a binding capacity of 37 fmol per mg of protein. Similar results were obtained from competition experiments. Binding of 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> to the microsomes was specifically inhibited by hormones with lactogenic activity. The binding sites, as well as 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin,</b> were not inactivated on incubation. Treatment of the microsomes with trypsin and chymotrypsin decreased the specific binding by over 90 %. Preheating of the microsomes at 55 degrees C for 15 min abolished 50 % of the specific binding activity...|$|E

40|$|Quantitative data {{concerning}} the binding of 22000 -mol. wt. <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> and its 20000 -mol. wt. variant are described using pregnant-rabbit liver and mammary-gland receptors. The purification and the complete chemical characterization of both <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> and its 20000 -mol. wt. variant is also presented. Contamination of the 20000 -mol. wt. -variant preparation by 22000 -mol. wt. hormone {{was found to be}} 0. 5 % by weight as measured in radioimmunoassay using monoclonal antibody. Labelling of <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> and its 20000 -mol. wt. variant using the Iodogen method is described as well as the characterization of the binding to pregnant-rabbit liver and mammary-gland receptor preparations. The maximum binding capacity of the 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> was between 50 and 60 % to liver particulate receptor, whereas that of the 20000 -mol. wt. variant was 30 %. The specificity of binding of both forms to rabbit hepatic and mammary-gland receptor was found to be similar for both proteins in the same system. The affinity constants and capacity were respectively 0. 7 X 10 (10) M- 1 and 815 fmol/mg of protein for <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> and 0. 6 X 10 (10) M- 1 and 1. 250 fmol/mg of protein for the 20000 -mol. wt. variant.

40|$|Receptors {{specific}} for lactogenic hormones were solubilized by 1 % (v/v) Triton X- 100 {{from the}} crude particulate membrane fraction of livers of pregnant and non-pregnant female rats and {{the characteristics of}} both preparations were compared. <b>Human</b> 125 I-labelled <b>somatotropin</b> was used for binding studies of lactogenic hormone. The solubilized receptor retained most of the characteristics noted in the particulate fraction. The binding of <b>human</b> 125 I-labelled <b>somatotropin</b> to the solubilized receptor is a saturable process, depending on temperature and time. Scatchard analysis of displacement curves revealed similar affinity constants ranging from 1. 02 × 109 to 1. 20 × 109 1 /mol, while the binding capacity was 4. 5 times greater in the pregnant rat livers than in the non-pregnant female rat livers. The receptors for <b>human</b> 125 I-labelled <b>somatotropin</b> from livers of non-pregnant and pregnant female rats were equally adsorbed onto a concanavalin-A-Sepharose column and were dissociated from the column with α-methyl-d-glucoside or α-methyl-d-mannoside in the same manner. By gel filtration on Sepharose 6 B, however, the molecular sizes of the hepatic receptors {{were found to be}} different. The apparent Mr value was approx. 270000 with a Stokes' radius of 5. 5 nm in the non-pregnant female rats and approx. 330000 with a Stokes' radius of 5. 5 nm in the pregnant rats. Furthermore, isoelectric-focusing experiments showed that {{a major part of the}} receptor from the non-pregnant female rat livers had a neutral pI (7. 0 — 8. 5), whereas that from pregnant-rat livers had an acidic pI (4. 2 — 4. 7). These data suggest that the increase in the lactogenic binding capacity in rat liver membranes during pregnancy may be associated with marked changes of the physicochemical properties of the receptors...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a gene coding for {{a fourth}} <b>human</b> somatostatin (<b>somatotropin</b> release-inhibiting factor) receptor. This additional somatostatin receptor (hSSTR 4) is specifically expressed in human fetal and adult brain and lung tissue. The deduced amino acid sequence of the receptor displays both sequence and structural homology to three cloned somatostatin receptors {{as well as to}} other members of the family of GTP-binding-protein-coupled seven-helix transmembrane-spanning receptors. Pharmacological characterization of the expressed receptor reveals specific, high-affinity binding of somatostatin 14 and somatostatin 28. Surprisingly, several well-characterized synthetic somatostatin analogs fail to exhibit high-affinity binding to hSSTR 4, indicating the existence of pharmacologically different receptor subtypes. Our data suggest that the diverse biological effects exerted by somatostatin are mediated by a family of receptors with discrete patterns of expression and different pharmacological properties...|$|R
40|$|Specific binding of 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> was {{demonstrated}} in isolated hepatocytes from male mice. In {{the presence of}} divalent cations (Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) the binding of 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> was competitive with ovine prolactin. Scatchard analysis of competition data indicated a KD of 1. 4 +/- 0. 2 nM and a binding capacity of 13 000 +/- 2000 sites/cell. In the absence of divalent cations and {{in the presence of}} EDTA, human and bovine somatotropins were found to be equally effective to displace bound 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin,</b> while ovine prolactin showed a weak competition.

40|$|At 5 min after {{intravenous}} injection, both 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> and 125 I-labelled {{bovine somatotropin}} were concentrated in rat liver and kidney. When the labelled hormones were administered {{along with an}} excess of the corresponding unlabelled hormone, a significant decrease of the uptake was observed in the liver, {{but not in the}} kidney. Study of the subcellular distribution of radioiodinated somatotropins in liver revealed that most of the radioactivity was specifically concentrated in the microsomal fraction. In contrast, the kidney fraction that accounted for most of the radioactivity was the 100 000 g supernatant. After solubilization, with 1 % (w/v) Triton X- 100, of the microsomal fractions obtained from both organs, the radioactive material was analysed by gel filtration on Sepharose CL- 6 B. By using this approach, it was demonstrated that both 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> and 125 I-labelled bovine somatotropin bind in vivo to proteins present in liver. A small proportion of 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> was also shown to form complexes with proteins present in kidney. The present results demonstrate that the liver uptake is mainly due to binding of somatotropins to specific proteins, in contrast with the kidney, in which binding to specific sites contributes minimally to the overall uptake...|$|E
40|$|The 1 H-n. m. r. {{spectra of}} <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> (growth hormone) show perturbed peaks from {{individual}} aromatic and aliphatic apolar residues, {{characteristic of a}} specifically folded globular structure. The imidazole C- 2 -H resonances of the histidine residues (at positions 18, 21 and 151 in the somatotropin sequence) were individually resolved, and their titration behaviour in the pH range 1. 2 - 11. 5 was investigated. The imidazole C- 2 -H resonance of histidine- 151 is assigned, by comparison of its titration behaviour in <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> and desamido-somatotropin (Asn- 152 leads to Asp- 152). The C- 2 -H resonances of all three histidine residues are assigned, by comparison of their relative deuterium-exchange rates (determined by n. m. r.) and the relative tritium-exchange rates of the histidine residues (determined by tryptic digestion of tritiated <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> and reversed-phase high-pressure liquid-chromatographic separation of the histidine-containing tryptic peptides). There is evidence that histidine- 18 forms an ion-pair bond with a glutamic acid or aspartic acid residue.

40|$|Biotechnology has {{developed}} a number of compounds that partition nutrients away from fat tissue deposition and towards lean (muscle) tissue accretion in swine. Two compounds that have received considerable research attention are porcine somatotropin (growth hormone) and beta agonists. Somatotropin is a naturally occurring protein found {{in the blood of}} all mammals. Beta agonists are compounds commonly used in <b>human</b> medicine. <b>Somatotropin</b> and beta agonists can dramatically influence carcass leanness and ultimately pork product quality. Research has shown that porcine somatotropin can increase daily gains up to 19 %, improve feed efficiency up to 28 %, and reduce backfat thickness up to 33 %. Research is underway {{to determine the effects of}} such compounds on nutrient requirements and reproduction in swine. Provided economic and safety requirements are met, somatotropin and/or beta agonist could revolutionize the future of the swine industry.

40|$|Studies {{in female}} ob/ob mice {{demonstrated}} diabetogenic properties of <b>human</b> growth hormone (<b>somatotropin)</b> {{and of a}} fragment generated therefrom by controlled digestion with pepsin; both the fragment and parent growth hormone produce long-term effects on carbohydrate metabolism; in acute glucose tolerance tests, only the fragment is active. Two nonacidic diabetogenic fractions have been separated from inactive fractions by chromatography on Bio-Gel P- 6 followed by ion exchange chromatography at pH 4. 3 and gel filtration on Bio-Gel P- 2 and/or Sephadex G 25; these active fractions exhibited multiple NH 2 -terminal (Lys, Phe, Leu, and Tyr). Fraction CD has these characteristics: (i) It induces glucose intolerance in fasting female ob/ob mice when injected subcutaneously in a divided dose, 15 min before and concurrently with glucose; mice injected with sufficient peptide exhibit elevated fasting glucose levels as long as 7 months after a single glucose tolerance test. (ii) It is a peptide smaller than that reported to stimulate body growth, but larger than somatostatin.

40|$|The binding of 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> (growth hormone) to a crude {{membrane}} preparation {{from the}} liver of pregnant rabbit, and to receptors solubilized from this fraction by Triton X- 100, {{was dependent on}} time, temperature and receptor concentration. At 4 degrees C a steady state was reached after 20 h, and maximum specific binding (as a percentage of total tracer added) was approx. 50 % for both membrane-bound and solubilized receptors. Solubilization did not significantly affect the binding properties of the receptor at low concentrations of Triton X- 100 (less than 0. 05 %, v/v, in the assay tube). However, at higher concentrations (approx. 0. 1 %, v/v), the detergent lowered the ability of some hormones, for example ovine prolactin, to displace 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin,</b> but did not affect other hormones such as bovine somatotropin. Some somatogenic hormones, such as bovine somatotropin, and some lactogenic hormones, such as ovine prolactin, displaced 125 I-labelled <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> from membrane-bound and solubilized receptor preparations. Furthermore, 85 % of 125 I-labelled bovine somatotropin was displaced from membrane-bound receptors by ovine prolactin, and 125 I-labelled ovine prolactin was almost completely displaced by bovine somatotropin. Scatchard analysis of the binding data for <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> suggested a single class of binding sites in the membrane-bound receptor preparation, with an affinity (Ka) of 1. 9 X 10 (9) M- 1 and a capacity of 1726 fmol/mg of protein; these values were slightly increased by solubilization (Ka = 3. 2 X 10 (9) M- 1, capacity = 2103 fmol/mg of protein). Scatchard analysis of binding to membrane-bound receptors also indicated a single class of high-affinity binding sites for bovine somatotropin (Ka = 4. 8 X 10 (9) M- 1, capacity = 769 fmol/mg) and for ovine prolactin (Ka = 6. 1 X 10 (9) M- 1, capacity = 187 fmol/mg) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>{{somatotropin}}</b> {{competed for}} 125 I-human somatotropin binding to hepatocytes from female or male rats. Bovine somatotropin and prolactin each inhibited part, but not all, of the uptake of 125 I-human somatotropin. The binding of 125 I-prolactin was inhibited by <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> and prolactin, {{but not by}} bovine somatotropin. Bovine somatotropin and <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin,</b> but not prolactin, competed for 125 I-bovine somatotropin binding sites. 125 I-labelled hormones were covalently coupled to membrane receptors with higher efficiency on hepatocytes from female than from male rats, allowing structural descriptions of lactogenic and somatogenic binding sites {{that had not been}} possible previously. Disuccinimidyl suberate covalently coupled 125 I-human somatotropin into saturable complexes of Mr 300 000, 220 000, 130 000, 65 000 and 50 000. Bovine somatotropin inhibited the incorporation of 125 I-human somatotropin into complexes of Mr 300 000, 220 000 and 130 000, whereas low concentrations of prolactin competed for incorporation into the 65 000 - and 50 000 -Mr species. 125 I-bovine somatotropin was incorporated into complexes of Mr 300 000, 220 000 and 130 000. <b>Human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> and bovine somatotropin, but not prolactin, inhibited the production of these complexes. 125 I-prolactin binding produced complexes of Mr 65 000 and 50 000. Native prolactin and <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin,</b> but not bovine somatotropin, inhibited uptake of 125 I-prolactin into these species. Thus direct affinity labelling, as well as competition for covalent coupling, suggests that the 300 000 -, 220 000 - and 130 000 -Mr species are components of the somatotropin receptor and that the 65 000 - and 50 000 -Mr complexes result from hormone binding to the prolactin receptor. By subtracting the Mr of prolactin, it was calculated that the hormone was bound to species of Mr 43 000 and 28 000. These Mr values were not affected by reduction of solubilized membranes, suggesting that the structure of the prolactin receptor is not stabilized by interchain disulphide bonds between subunits. Subtracting the Mr of somatotropin from somatogenic complexes indicated that the hormone had bound to species of Mr 280 000, 200 000 and 100 000. The 300 000 - and 220 000 -Mr complexes were not isolated from reduced membranes, whereas the amount of the 130 000 -Mr species was augmented. These observations could suggest that a major component of the somatotropin receptor is a trimeric aggregate in which some subunits are retained in a larger complex by interchain disulphide bonds...|$|E

40|$|Summary: A {{radioimmunoassay}} for {{the measurement}} of cyclic somatostatin is described. Synthetic somatostatin was conjugated with bovine serum albumin or human serum-globulin using glutaraldehyde as the coupling reagent. Anti-sera were raised in rabbits injected with the hapten-bovine serum albumin-, or with the hapten-human serum a-globulin-conjugate. Since somatostatin lacks a tyrosine residue that can be readily iodinated, three different radiolabeling procedures for synthetic cyclic Tyr^som'atostatin were compared with each other. In addition, cyclic somatostatin was radiolabeled with the Bolton-Hunter reagent. The radiolabeled antigens were purified by G- 25 Sephadex adsorption chromato-graphy and thus separated from unreacted components. Maximal yields were achieved when Tyr 1 -somatostatin was iodinated with chloramine-T the largest immunochemical reactivity, however, was obtained by applying the lactoper-oxidase-catalysed iodination with 125 I. Iodinated somatostatin-derivatives adsorbed onto an inorganic {{as well as an}} organic matrix; the percentage of non-specific binding was 14 %. The radioimmunoassay was performed with an antiserum dilution of 1 : 5000.

40|$|Somatropin, a {{recombinant}} protein containing 191 amino acids, {{is derived from}} the endogenous <b>human</b> growth hormone, <b>somatotropin.</b> This protein is clinically used in children and adults with inadequate endogenous growth hormone to stimulate a normal bone and muscle growth. In addition, somatropin is recently being investigated for the diagnosis and radiotherapy of certain hormonal cancers. In some of these cancers, over-expression of the human growth hormone receptor (hGHR) is described. The modification of the protein with a chelating agent like NOTA (1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane- 1, 4, 7 -triacetic acid) allows the inclusion of metals coupled to the protein. The NOTA unit is selectively introduced on a lysine side chain. As site-specific labelling is necessary to avoid active region interactions (1 - 16, 41 - 68, 103 - 119 and 167 - 175), characterization of the chelate-modified somatropin is indispensable. Therefore, we have applied an enzymatic digestion procedure using trypsin, chymotrypsin and a combination of both enzymes. The resulting peptides were then monitored using HPLC-MSn, allowing the investigation of the exact amino acid modifications. The use of a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin gave an enhanced information efficiency. Moreover, the intact protein, without enzymatic degradation, was analysed on a protein HPLC column using UV detection for quantification and ESI-MS/MS for characterization. Based upon the HPLC-MSn results of the digested somatropin, the chelating molecule is mainly bound to a specific lysine amino acid that is located away from the receptor binding site. Therefore, the cell-binding functionality of the characterized NOTA-somatropin is measured, using a HepG 2 cell line...|$|R
40|$|Our earlier binding {{studies of}} the 22000 - and 20000 -Mr {{variants}} of <b>human</b> growth hormone (<b>somatotropin)</b> to pregnant-rabbit liver and mammary receptors [Closset, Smal, Gomez & Hennen (1983) Biochem. J. 214, 885 - 892] suggested that the 20000 -Mr variant was a lower-affinity analogue of the 22000 -Mr molecule. Since the receptor population in these tissues is not fully characterized, we have now investigated the binding of both variants to the well-characterized and highly specific human-growth-hormone receptor of the human lymphocyte IM- 9 cell line. The maximum bindability of radioiodinated 22000 - and 22000 -Mr to IM- 9 cells was 60 and 45 % respectively. Both hormone variants have essentially the same binding characteristics: slow association (equilibrium reached in 8 - 10 h at 30 degrees C), poor reversibility ('tight binding'), linear Scatchard plot, same specificity as shown by lack of competition by bovine, porcine or equine growth hormones or human growth hormone-(32 - 46) -(missing in the 20000 -Mr variant),-(1 - 134) - and -(141 - 191) -peptides. Both unlabelled hormones inhibit binding of both tracers completely, with the 20000 -Mr variant being only half as potent as the 22000 -Mr one. The apparent affinity is 2. 8 X 10 (9) M- 1 for the 22000 -Mr variant and 1. 6 X 10 (9) M- 1 for the 20000 -Mr variant. This decreased affinity of the 20000 -Mr variant appears {{to be due to}} a lower association rate constant. Concentrations (5 ng/ml) of the two variants that occupy about 15 % of the total sites induce a marked down-regulation of the receptors after 18 h incubation, but the 20000 -Mr variant (50 % decrease) has a smaller effect than the 22000 -Mr variant (75 % decrease). Thus the only consequence of the residues- 32 - 46 deletion in the 20000 -Mr variant is a lower association rate and affinity for the IM- 9 lymphocyte human-growth-hormone receptor. The close binding characteristics of the two forms suggest that the known differences in their insulin-like effects cannot be explained by differences in the nature of their interaction with the human-growth-hormone receptor...|$|R

For the somatotropin assay, reaction conditions include a borate/bovine serum albumin buffer (pH 8. 4) and a 20 -h incubation at 4 #{ 176 }C. Assay results for clinical samples compared favorably (correlation coefficient = 0. 930) with values {{obtained from a}} reference laboratory. The means determined for 92 patients ’ samples were 4. 3 tg/Iiter (reference laboratory) and 5. 1 tg/liter (Centria). Intra- and inter-run precision ranged from 3. 2 to 15. 9 %. For the insulin assay, a phos-phate/bovine serum albumin buffer (pH 7. 4) is used, with a 20 -h incubation at 4 #{ 176 }C. Previously analyzed insulin samples from a reference laboratory were determined by the Centria analyzer with excellent correlation (r = 0. 965) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to acquire evidence regarding the secretory capacity of cells in the pars tuberalis of the rat pituitary by the application of immunocytochemical staining. For this purpose the conjugated antibody and immunoglobulin-enzyme bridge techniques were utilized with antisera to the following hormones of the pars distalis: <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin,</b> human thyrotropin, human β-melanotropin, ovine luteinizing hormone (LH), porcine β 17 – 39 -corticotropin, and β 1 – 24 -corticotropin. Only LH-containing cells were demonstrated. They were exceedingly rare in the cephalic pars tuberalis beneath the median eminence. The frequency of LH-cells was greater in the pars tuberalis associated with the infundibulum and increased distally. LH-cells were most common ventrolateral to the infundibular stem and occurred singly and in clusters. These results indicate that following hypophysectomy {{the portion of the}} pars tuberalis that remains in situ has the capacity to secrete only LH of all the pars distalis hormones. ...|$|E
40|$|Summary. An {{attempt was}} made to {{determine}} if any of the specialized secre-tory cell types common to the pars distalis also occur in the pars tuberalis of the human hypophysis. Available for study were 18 specimens of the in-ferior pars tuberalis, which partially surrounds the infundibular stem, and 3 specimens of the superior pars tuberalis that is attached to the median eminence. Antisera to <b>human</b> <b>somatotropin,</b> mammotropin, chorionic gonadotropin, follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH r, luteinizing hormone, LH r, thyrotropin, TSHfl, as well as to fll- 24 -corticotropin, porcine f 117 - 39 -corticotropin, and ovine LH were used with the Sternberger peroxidase-antiperoxidase immuno-cytochemical procedure to identify the probable cells of origin for these hor-mones. The evidence indicated that gonadotropic cells constitute the major portion of the parenchymal cell population in the pars tuberalis. They occurred throughout all of the pars tuberalis and were usually arranged in clusters. Somatotropic, mammotropic, orticotropic, and thyrotropic ells were rare and not found in all specimens. When present, they often formed a common group suggesting that their occurrence in the pars tuberalis resulted from displacement of primordial tissue of the pars distalis during embryogenesis.

40|$|The α-subunit of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) {{receptor}} is {{a member}} of the hematopoietin receptor family. The alignment of its amino acid sequence with those of other members of this family (<b>human</b> <b>somatotropin</b> receptor/murine IL- 3 receptor β and human IL- 2 receptor β) has suggested that amino acids included in two SSFY repeats found in each of its hematopoietin receptor domains, contribute to the binding of the ligand. The involvement of these amino acids in IL- 6 binding and signal transduction was studied by site- directed mutagenesis and molecular modelling. We present a computer-derived three-dimensional model of the IL- 6 /IL- 6 receptor complex based on the structure of the human somatotropin/human somatotropin receptor complex. This model allowed the location of distinct regions important for IL- 6 and gp 130 binding. We show that some of the residues included in the SSFY repeats located in our IL- 6 receptor model in the loops between β-strands E and F of domain- 1 and B' and C', of domain-II, participate in the formation of a major IL- 6 -binding site. These residues are necessary for IL- 6 and gp 130 binding and for signal transduction. Using our IL- 6 receptor mutants we mapped the epitopes of four anti-(IL- 6 receptor) neutralising monoclonal antibodies to these residues. Our results demonstrate that a generic hematopoietin receptor family structural module can be used for the study of both α and β receptor subunits belonging to this family.
