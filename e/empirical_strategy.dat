Coined at least as early as 1990 in Business Week, the conception was theoretically clarified in 1992: that an <b>empirical</b> <b>strategy</b> for defining a stateless corporation is with analytical tools at the intersection between demographic analysis and transportation research. This intersection is known as logistics management, and it describes the importance of rapidly increasing global mobility of resources. In a long history of analysis of multinational corporations we are some quarter century into an era of stateless corporations - corporations which meet the realities of the needs to source materials on a worldwide basis and to produce and customize products for individual countries.|$|E

40|$|The {{deterioration}} of the income and employment position of unskilled workers in the OECD area since the 1980 s is a well-documented fact. The debate {{about the causes of}} this development is dominated by two competing hypotheses, "North-South Trade" or "globalisation" and technological progress. Several <b>empirical</b> <b>strategies</b> have been used to identify the importance of technological and globalisation shocks: factor content analyses, consistency checks, regression analyses and numerical methods. However, no consensus has been achieved so far and there is considerable methodological controversy. This paper uses the Jones model as theoretical backbone to identify and settle the sources of disagreement, to consolidate recent results, to derive new insights and to provide an integrative assessment of the different <b>empirical</b> <b>strategies...</b>|$|R

Two different <b>empirical</b> <b>strategies</b> are implemented using the per capita operating expenditures of 90 French local jurisdictions (the départements) for an 8 -year period. The first strategy focuses directly on the impact of the electoral margin, the fragmentation of the majority and the concentration of the opposition on the annual budget growth rates. The second strategy regresses the present expenditures on last year's expenditures over several subsamples. Both <b>empirical</b> <b>strategies</b> lead to the following conclusions.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} causal effects of Catholic primary {{schooling}} on student outcomes such as test scores, grade retention, and behavior.

Estimates based on several <b>empirical</b> <b>strategies,</b> including an approach developed by Altonji et al.

All of the <b>empirical</b> <b>strategies</b> point to sizeable negative effects of Catholic schooling on mathematics achievement. Similarly, we find very little evidence that Catholic schooling improves behavioral and other non-cognitive outcomes once we account for selection on unobservables...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposePatients with {{persistent}} or recurrent neutropenic fevers at risk {{of invasive}} fungal disease (IFD) are treated empirically with antifungal therapy (AFT). Early treatment using a diagnostic-driven (DD) strategy may reduce clinical and economic burdens. We compared costs and outcomes of both strategies from a UK perspective. MethodsAn <b>empirical</b> <b>strategy</b> with conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate (C-AmB), liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB), or caspofungin was compared with a DD strategy (initiated based on positive ELISA results for galactomannan antigen) and/or positive results for Aspergillus species on polymerase chain reaction assay) using C-AmB, voriconazole, or L-AmB in a decision-analytic model. Rates of IFD incidence, overall mortality, and IFD-related mortality in adults expected to be neutropenic for ≥ 10  days were obtained. The <b>empirical</b> <b>strategy</b> was assumed to identify 30 % of IFD and targeted AFT to improve survival by a hazard ratio of 0. 589. AFT-specific adverse events were obtained from a summary of product characteristics. Resource use was obtained, and costs were estimated by using standard UK costing sources. All costs are presented in 2012 British pounds sterling. FindingsTotal costs were 32 % lower for the DD strategy (£ 1561. 29) versus the <b>empirical</b> <b>strategy</b> (£ 2301. 93) due to a reduced incidence of adverse events and decreased use of AFT. Administration of AFT was reduced by 41 % (DD strategy, 74 of 1000; <b>empirical</b> <b>strategy,</b> 125 of 1000), with similar survival rates. ImplicationsThis study suggests that a DD strategy {{is likely to be}} cost-saving versus empirical treatment for immunocompromised patients with persistent or recurrent neutropenic fevers...|$|E
40|$|A large {{theoretical}} literature {{predicts that}} housing has substantial effects on financial markets, but empirical evidence on these effects remains limited. We estimate the causal effect {{of changes in}} mortgages and home equity on portfolio allocations using two <b>empirical</b> <b>strategies.</b> First, we use two instruments —average house prices in an individual’s state in the current year and in the year he purchased his home —to generate cross-sectional variation in home equity and mortgages that is plausibly orthogonal to unobserved determinants of portfolios. Second, we use panel data to study how portfolio allocations change when individuals buy houses. Both <b>empirical</b> <b>strategies</b> show that housing reduces the amount households invest in stocks substantially: a $ 10, 000 increase in mortgage debt (holding fixed total wealth) reduces the stock share of liquid wealth by approximately 6 %. Auxiliary evidence suggests that housing induces individuals to hold more conservative portfolios primarily because of a “consumption commitment”effect rather than exposure to house price risk...|$|R

40|$|Whether or not {{seniority}} has {{a substantial}} effect on wages {{has been the}} subject of much controversy in the past decade, mainly in the U. S. Several economists have noted that unobserved heterogeneity across individuals and across job matches may produce inconsistent OLS-estimates of the effect of tenure on wages and turnover. Hence, labor economists have put forward two <b>empirical</b> <b>strategies</b> to deal with unobserved heterogeneity: Altonji and Shakotko (1987) use an instrumental variable for tenure, which is uncorrelated with the individual and job-specific component of the error term, but highly correlated with job tenure, whereas Topel’s (1991) basic idea is that within-job wage growth combines the returns to general and job-specific experience. These two <b>empirical</b> <b>strategies</b> revealed different returns to seniority and experience for the U. S. labor market. Our goal is, on one hand, to use the different methodologies for the Swiss labor market and, on the other hand, to evaluate the sources of these differences. Thus, we replicate these methods with Swiss data (Swiss Labor Force Survey, SLFS). In a first step, we estimate returns to tenure and experience with the standard regressio...|$|R
