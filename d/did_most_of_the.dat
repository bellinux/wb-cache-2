5|$|James L. Quinn: November 1952– August 1958. From May 1953 to March 1954, Larry T. Shaw was Associate Editor; {{he wrote}} editorials {{for at least}} three issues, {{beginning}} with September 1953, and generally <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> editorial work.|$|E

5|$|Ensemble Studios worked {{together}} with Big Huge Games to develop The Asian Dynasties, Age of Empires IIIs second expansion. This {{was the first}} joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios was busy with other projects—particularly Halo Wars—while Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work, but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen joined in the brainstorming, and had control over the final product. Both studios had roles in testing the game before its release.|$|E
5|$|Hitchcock <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{promotion}} on his own, forbidding Leigh and Perkins to {{make the}} usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of their revealing the plot. Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public, which, despite possibly affecting their reviews, certainly preserved the secret.|$|E
5|$|Howard went to Chicago Vocational Career Academy, {{where he}} went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball. Vocational had an {{unheated}} gym and no locker rooms, which required that the team dress for games in a history classroom. Nonetheless, Howard went on to be named a 1991 All-American basketball player by Parade magazine and won McDonald's All American honors. He was also chosen for the National Honor Society and served as Vocational's homecoming king. During recruiting visits by college coaches such as Illinois' Lou Henson, DePaul's Joey Meyer and Michigan's Steve Fisher, Jannie Mae Howard <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> questioning.|$|E

5|$|Parker {{published}} in 1572 a work entitled De Antiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae & Priuilegiis Ecclesiae Canuariensis, cum Archiepiscopis eiusdem 70, {{which is the}} first privately printed work to appear in English. Although Parker claimed in a letter that he was the author, it is likely that at the very least Joscelyn <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research, and the manuscript of the work, which is now Vitellius E xiv, is largely in his handwriting. Further, Parker's son, after the archbishop's death, noted beside the bequest notation for Joscelyn's brother Thomas that John Joscelyn was the author of the work.|$|E
5|$|Hanson {{remained}} silent during the team's interviews while Hawk <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> talking. The team won its first title on August 3, 1965, when they defeated Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomuka {{to win the}} Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They also competed in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, where they became the inaugural NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Champions. They held the title belts four times between 1968 and 1971 while feuding with George Becker and Johnny Weaver. During that time, they also won the IWA World Tag Team Championship while competing in Tasmania. While in the Carolinas, Hanson and Hawk {{spent a lot of}} time with Ric Flair when Flair entered the wrestling business. Hawk stated that Flair used to cause trouble for the group, including one incident in which Flair flirted with the girlfriend of a Mafia member. Hanson and Hawk used their friendship with the Mafia member to help Flair escape from being killed in revenge.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1536, the north of England was convulsed {{in a series of}} uprisings collectively known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, the most serious {{opposition}} to Henry's policies. Cromwell and Cranmer were the primary targets of the protesters' fury. Cromwell and the king worked furiously to quell the rebellion, while Cranmer kept a low profile. After it was clear that Henry's regime was safe, the government took the initiative to remedy the evident inadequacy of the Ten Articles. The outcome after months of debate was The Institution of a Christian Man informally known from the first issue as the Bishops' Book. The book was initially proposed in February 1537 in the first vicegerential synod, ordered by Cromwell, for the whole Church. Cromwell opened the proceedings, but as the synod progressed, Cranmer and Foxe took on the chairmanship and the co-ordination. Foxe <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final editing and the book was published in late September.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} battles {{during the first}} two weeks of September, the South Korean troops, {{demoralized}} though they were, <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground fighting. American tanks, artillery, and ground units supported them. Uncontested UN aerial supremacy and naval gunfire from offshore also supported the South Korean troops, and probably were the factors that tipped the scales in their favor. After the initial phase of their September offensive, the North Koreans labored under what proved to be insurmountable difficulties in supplying their forward units. The North Korean system of supply could not resolve the problems of logistics and communication necessary to support and exploit an offensive operation in this sector of the front. Nevertheless, the breakthrough was severe enough that the Eighth Army considered pulling back for several days, eventually deciding to stand its ground.|$|E
5|$|Miller and Lindwall then {{sought to}} gain an {{advantage}} over England's leading batsmen—Hutton and Compton—before the Tests. The MCC side, composed almost entirely of Test players, reached 91/2, Toshack removed Compton and Hutton in quick succession to reduce the hosts to 104/5. He took three more wickets to end with 6/51 as the MCC were eventually dismissed for 189, conceding a first innings lead of 363 runs. Some English observers decried Toshack's leg stump attack as being negative, but former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Toshack's line {{was close enough to}} leg stump that most balls had to be played. Bradman opted to enforce the follow on, and his spinners <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damage, McCool taking 4/35 and Johnson 3/37. Only Len Hutton of the locals batsmen passed 26 during the match, scoring 52 and 64, and Australia had taken a key psychological victory ahead of the Tests with an innings victory. The total attendance was 60,000.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian Army in Palestine {{was divided}} between {{infantry}} and cavalry regiments {{and consisted of}} thousands of professional soldiers, known as nezzam. During the revolt, this force was buttressed by over 15,000 reinforcements who arrived with Muhammad Ali, bringing the number of Egyptian soldiers in Palestine to well over 20,000. While its army <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting, Egypt also commissioned or requested the participation of various irregulars. In the southern Gaza region, Egypt dispatched Bedouin from the tribes of Awlad Ali, al-Jamaiyat, al-Jahma, and al-Fawayd to pursue rebels and raid their villages. In the northern Galilee region, {{towards the end of}} the revolt, the forces of Emir Bashir were mobilized upon Ibrahim Pasha's request, but their mobilization sufficed in convincing the northern rebels to surrender. Thus, Bashir's Lebanon-based forces saw no combat. Local peasant fighters under Husayn Abd al-Hadi also fought alongside the Egyptian army, particularly during the final battles for Jabal Nablus.|$|E

5|$|The {{avalanche}} {{scenes were}} due to be filmed in co-operation with the Swiss army who annually used explosions to prevent snow build-up by causing avalanches, but the area chosen naturally avalanched just before filming. The final result {{was a combination of}} a man-made avalanche at an isolated Swiss location shot by the second unit, stock footage, and images created by the special effects crew with salt. The stuntmen were filmed later, added by optical effects. For the scene where Bond and Tracy crash into a car race while being pursued, an ice rink was constructed over an unused aeroplane track, with water and snow sprayed on it constantly. Lazenby and Rigg <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving due to the high number of close-ups.|$|E
5|$|The stunt {{crew was}} the same one used in Cruise's Mission: Impossible 2, and was {{responsible}} for complex action scenes. These included the auto factory chase scene, filmed in a real facility using props such as a welding robot, and the fight between Anderton and the jetpack-clad officers, filmed in an alley set built on the Warner Bros. studio lot. Industrial Light & Magic <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special effects, and DreamWorks-owned PDI {{was responsible for the}} Spyder robots. The company Pixel Liberation Front did previsualization animatics. The holographic projections and the prison facility were filmed by several roving cameras which surrounded the actors, and the scene where Anderton gets off his car and runs along the Maglev vehicles was filmed on stationary props, which were later replaced by computer-generated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|When Frank Sels {{left the}} Studio in 1967, Karel Biddeloo took {{over most of}} the {{realistic}} series of Vandersteen. He made Karl May from 1967 until 1969, when the Bessy-studio took over the job. He also took over Biggles, which ended in 1969, when it was replaced by the jungle series Safari, inspired by Daktari. At the start of the series, Vandersteen <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creative work, but after a few albums he left most of the work to Biddeloo. The series ended in 1974. Biddeloo then devoted most of his time to De Rode Ridder, where he started inking the stories by Vandersteen in 1967 and took completely over in 1969, when Vandersteen lost his interest. He continued working on it until his death in 2004.|$|E

5|$|After being {{contacted}} by Dean, Castiel, now wearing a new suit and trenchcoat and driving a stolen car {{as he can}} no longer teleport, returns to the bunker where he comes up with the plan to have Crowley help expel Gadreel from Sam. Castiel knocks Gadreel out and comforts Dean when the torture they have Crowley perform to bring forth Sam's mind proves too much for Dean. Castiel is furious to learn that it is Gadreel, blaming him for all the evil in the universe, but Dean calms him down. When Gadreel proves resistant to their efforts to expel him, Dean tries to have Castiel possess Sam to let him know of the situation but he can't without Sam's permission. Crowley agrees to do it instead in exchange for his freedom and though Castiel is reluctant, he removes Sam's anti-possession tattoo. The plan works and Sam expels Gadreel. After leaving Crowley to deal with Abaddon, Castiel heals Sam's injuries from the torture and informs him he can finish his healing from the Trials over time as Gadreel <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> job. He remains behind with Sam as Dean leaves on his own.|$|E
5|$|Inspiration for {{the book}} came from a Douglas-fir tree with a curve in its trunk. While sitting by the tree, at his home on Quadra Island, near Vancouver, David Suzuki {{realized}} that even though his family had played on it for years, {{he did not know}} how old it was or how its uncharacteristic curve had developed. Suzuki, a science writer and broadcaster, and former zoologist, speculated that the soil might have slid when the tree was young or that another plant might have blocked the sunlight. He thought that the tree must have endured much hardship throughout its life and made a connection between biographies of people and the story of this tree's life. It also reminded him of an idea he had for a children's book about interconnectivity of life, especially within plants. Along with a research assistant, he studied the topic. Suzuki started to write a draft but a busy schedule interfered so he sought a collaborator. Science writer and former Harrowsmith editor Wayne Grady agreed to participate. Suzuki provided the research, framework, and some original writing and Grady <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writing. Together, Grady in Ontario and Suzuki in Vancouver, went through five drafts. Wildlife artist Robert Bateman was brought into the project through social connections between the wives of Bateman and Suzuki. In creating the book, their intention was to illustrate the complexity and interconnectivity of this ecosystem by focusing on one tree's role over time.|$|E
5|$|Li Shimin's {{plan was}} successful: apart from skirmishes {{between the two}} armies' cavalry, the two armies {{maintained}} their standoff from about 08:00 until noon, when the Xia troops began {{to show signs of}} thirst and weariness. Li Shimin, from a high vantage point, saw this and sent 300 cavalry in a probing attack. When he saw that the demoralized Xia recoiled from this assault, he sent more of his cavalry to turn Dou's left flank from the south. Dou reacted by ordering the withdrawal of his entire army from the river to the better defensive position offered by the eastern escarpment of the Sishui valley, but this manoeuvre created confusion in the Xia lines, breaking their battle order. Awaiting this opportunity, Li Shimin ordered his army to launch a general attack against the withdrawing Xia, himself spearheading the attack at the head of his remaining cavalry. Li Shimin always led from the front—accompanied by an elite force of 1000 black-clad, black-armoured horsemen—as indeed <b>did</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contemporary Chinese military leaders, who were expected to prove their personal bravery on the battlefield and motivate their men by their example, rather than stay in the rear and co-ordinate their army.|$|E
