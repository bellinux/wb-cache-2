50|$|The Mexican Red Cross is a {{non-governmental}} {{humanitarian assistance}} organization {{affiliated with the}} International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to help those in dangerous situations, such as natural disasters, {{as well as providing}} <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>services.</b> The organization finances its aid, assistance, and education programs through the work of thousands of volunteers and donation from individuals, institutions, organizations, associations and companies. It originated with a presidential decree in 1910 and was recognized internationally in 1912. Today it participates in national and international aid and disaster relief missions as well as various health services, training in first aid and for emergency medical technicians. Early in its history, it developed a program in nursing, which eventually became the Escuela Nacional de Enfermería y Obstetricia (National School of Nursing and Obstectrics), today part of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Pastoralism {{is used to}} {{describe}} a society that derives majority of their food and income from livestock. This form of farming system is largely practised in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL). It is estimated that 70 % of the landmass in the Horn of Africa is dry land; in Kenya 80 % of the landmass is classified as ASAL, while approximately half of Tanzania consists of dry land. These dry lands support wild resource harvesting, tourism but most importantly livestock rearing. It is estimated that over 75 % of cattle herds in Kenya and 90 % in Tanzania are kept by pastoralists who supply the bulk of meat consumed in the countries. In this paper we present current animal health challenges and opportunities being faced by pastoral farmers in Tanzania and Kenya based on primary data collected in Kajiado County, Kenya and Tanga and Morogoro regions in Tanzania. In the midst of many challenges and opportunities, food safety and food security are never assured amongst the pastoralists. We highlight pastoral community high livestock dependency for food and income, market access to livestock products, access to animal and <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>services,</b> livestock-wildlife interaction, factors that hinder increase of livestock assets and explore the knowledge of disease and exposure to zoonoses within the pastoral community...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOpinion 1 / 08 of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) {{resolves}} {{a dispute}} between the European Commission, supported by the European Parliament, on the one hand, and the Council of the European Union (Council) and fifteen member states, on the other, as to the competence of the European Community (EC) to conclude [...] with certain members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) [...] particular agreements (Agreements) modifying the schedules of specific commitments (Schedules) of the EC and its member states under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). More importantly, by interpreting {{for the first time}} some of the provisions defining the common commercial policy (CCP) as they were recast by the Nice Treaty in 2001, this opinion clarifies the scope of the external powers of the EC vis-à-vis its member states. The Court held in essence that the Agreements [...] although concerning neither exclusively nor predominantly sensitive sectors, such as culture, education, as well as social and <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> [...] fall within the shared competence of the EC and its member states. Interestingly enough, the opinion was rendered on November 3 ' 8 2009, {{on the eve of the}} entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which, inter alia, modified once more the CCP provisions. Yet, this opinion remains relevant to the extent that it helped to resolve another dispute pending before the ECJ on whether the approval of Vietnam's membership in the WTO fell solely under the competence of the EC or whether it also required the participation of the member states...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} tourism in the Philippines can be largely {{attributed}} to nature-based destinations but communities {{in these areas}} largely depend on farming and fishing to sustain their day-to-day needs.   The need to capacitate the community’s social and human capital in addressing climate change impacts to their livelihood, properties and natural environment is deemed necessary to lessen their vulnerability issues {{in the management of}} agriecotourism destinations. The study aimed to 1.) characterize and rank hazards that are likely to affect the nature-based tourism communities, 2.) describe the nature-based tourism communities’ current sensitivity and exposure to climate stresses; and 3.) estimate future vulnerability and risks of nature-based tourism communities.   Three agri-ecotourism communities were selected using five criteria such as attraction uniqueness, hazard type, risk level, tourism dependency and market potential.   The areas were subjected to tourism vulnerability case assessment focusing on services and energy; human health; food, security, water and agriculture; business and continuity; and biodiversity and culture.    Calaguas Island’s top hazards are typhoon, drought and strong wind.   Pecuaria Farm’s main hazards are drought, rat infestation and grass fire while Bulusan Lake’s major hazards are heavy rains and ash falls brought by volcanic eruption.   Generally, vulnerability is high in the <b>human</b> <b>health,</b> <b>services</b> and energy sectors of tourism. The vulnerability of the three agri-ecotourism sites was intensified by factors that merely characterize the kind of community they have: a) high marketing dependency, b) poor political will, c) low level of awareness and preparedness, d) poor farming practices and e) lack of tourism-related livelihood options. Destinations with functioning agricultural areas are the most affected sites due to an estimated increase in the temperature and increase in rainfall precipitations.   Poverty remains to be the major factor why vulnerability is high...|$|E

40|$|Rabies is {{of great}} public health {{importance}} because it is almost universally fatal without timely intervention. Approximately over 60, 000 people die from rabies each year. Canine rabies accounts for over 90 % of human rabies cases worldwide and disproportionately affects the poorest population in Asia and Africa. The disability-adjusted life years due to rabies {{is estimated to be}} 1. 9 million. The economic burden of rabies is US$ 6 billion globally. Rabies is often misdiagnosed due to limitation in ante-mortem diagnosis and the clinical signs often resemble encephalitis. Cost of rabies biologics is often a huge barrier to treatment for many in the developing countries. Canine rabies can be eliminated as demonstrated in North America and Western Europe. An integrative approach combining veterinary and <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> with commitment from local governments and support from international agencies is required for elimination to be successful and sustainable. In regions where canine rabies has been eliminated, continuing surveillance and maintaining adequate vaccine coverage are imperative to prevent re-emergence of canine rabies. In the U. S. where wildlife is the main reservoir for rabies, it is crucial to prevent spill over infection from wildlife into domestic animals. The Allegheny County Health Department in Western Pennsylvania processed 367 domestic animals during 2012, which accounts {{for more than half of}} all the animals submitted. The analysis to better understand the high number of domestic animals and to assess the reason for each domestic animal submission was done. The findings showed that key pieces of information that determine the need for rabies testing are often missing. An exposure date is often not reported and information on the vaccine status of the animal that is critical for monitoring vaccine failure is also lacking. Furthermore, the majority of the submission did not report the animal’s health status, which determines the need for quarantine and rabies testing. Accurate and complete information is essential for effective management and monitoring. Updating the existing submission form may increase the quality and the quantity of information collected for each submission...|$|E
40|$|In an {{extensive}} literature review, the author develops policy recommendations to facilitate scaling up community-based animal health systems {{to the national}} level. Noting that human and animal health services in rural areas have much in common, and that {{an extensive}} literature studies policy regarding primary healthcare for humans exists, she surveys that literature for observations and conclusions applicable to policy analysis of primary animal healthcare. She notes differences in the history {{and development of the}} two delivery systems. The push for <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> came with a worldwide initiative agreed at a high level in 1978. Health for All was set out as a moral imperative, and programmes have been strongly top-down. Delivery of animal health services, by contrast, has been viewed mainly in terms of economic development, and community-based systems have been cobbled together bottom-up, with NGOs taking the lead. As a result, community animal health workers are not integrated into national systems, and how they are trained and monitored varies even within districts. More broadly, the author details regional differences in community-based animal healthcare initiatives. Whereas in Asia there is considerable government involvement, private practitioners hold much more sway in East Africa. Although the literature is sparse on West Africa and Latin America, professional acceptance of community health workers appears to be high in both regions. The core of the paper is devoted to elaborating six criteria for assessing community-based animal health systems, which the author adapts from studies on primary healthcare systems for humans. She argues that the criteria equity, efficiency, accessibility of services, quality of services, human resources and financial resources must be addressed when scaling-up community-based programmes. The author recommends that policymakers clearly state their national animal health objectives and encourage dialogue between NGOs and existing national structures to allow better coordination of efforts and more equitable and consistent delivery of animal health services in rural areas. She adds that bringing community animal health workers into institutional frameworks and agreeing a standard training curriculum would improve equity in the distribution of benefits.
