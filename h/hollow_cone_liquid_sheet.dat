40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to model the pesticide atomization {{in order to get the}} droplet size and velocity very close to the nozzle exit. The two-phase flow was calculated inside and outside the nozzle. The model was based on classical fluid mechanics transport equations for the liquid dispersion, velocity and turbulence. Moreover, a novel transport equation was developed for the mean liquid/gas surface area, coming from studies in automotive and aeronautics fields. Coupling the transport equations for the liquid mass fraction and the surface area led to an estimation of a Sauter Mean Diameter. These equations have been implemented in the commercial CFD code Fluent. A swirling flow was found inside the nozzle. Moreover, a <b>hollow</b> <b>cone</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> expanded outside the nozzle. Calculations have been conducted with various injection pressure values, leading to a mass flow rate in good accordance with manufacturer data. Surfactant influence has been studied by varying the surface tension coefficient in the surface area transport equation: as expected, droplets obtained are smaller than when water is considered...|$|E

With fine grid resolution, the ligament and droplet formation processes are captured in detail. The spray structure of fully developed sprays and the flow field are observed firstly. A central recirculation zone is generated inside the <b>hollow</b> <b>cone</b> section due to the entrainment of air by the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and strong turbulent structures promote the breakup of ligaments. At the exit of injector nozzle, surface instability occurs due to disturbance factors. Axial and transverse mode instabilities produce a net-like structure ligament zone. Finally, the generation mechanism of the droplet is analyzed. It is found that the breakup mechanism of ligaments {{is located at the}} Raleigh capillary region. Axial symmetry oscillation occurs due to the surface tension force and the capillary waves pinch off from the neck of the ligaments.

Cold flow experiments on the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> breakup were carried out by employing custom fabricated gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers using water and air as experimental fluids. Photographic techniques were employed to capture the flow behavior of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> at different flow conditions. Quantitative variation on the breakup length of the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and spray width were obtained from the measurements deduced from the images of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets.</b> The sheet breakup process is significantly influenced by the central air jet. It is observed that low inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> are more vulnerable to the presence of the central air jet and develop shorter breakup lengths at smaller values of the air jet Reynolds number Re-g. High inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> ignore the presence of the central air jet at smaller values of Re-g and eventually develop shorter breakup lengths at higher values of Re-g. The experimental evidences suggest that the central air jet causes corrugations on the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> surface, which may be promoting the production of thick liquid ligaments from the sheet surface.

The droplet size spectra were measured for these 15 spray mixtures using a Malvern Particle Sizer and characterised by the Volume Median Diameter (VMD) {{and the percentage of}} liquid contained in droplets less than 100 m (% < 100 m). Horizontal ground drift was measured in a wind tunnel, on glass fibre collectors using a fluorescent tracer dye technique. The relative drift of each spray mixture was characterised by the Drifted Part (DP) which is the part of the sprayed volume drifted between 2 and 6 metres. Although the nozzle type was the predominating parameter regarding to the droplet size spectra and the DP, differences were observed due to the liquids characteristics. The EC formulation produced a smaller droplet size and a greater DP than the SC formulation whatever the tank mix adjuvant used. For the different spray mixtures, the DP was poorly correlated to the VMD or the % < 100 m. However, correlations between the VMD, the % < 100 m and the DP of the flat-fan nozzle and of the <b>hollow</b> <b>cone</b> nozzle were significant.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{studying}} {{the breakup of}} swirling <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> discharging from the outer orifice of gas centered swirl coaxial atomizers. Such atomizers are considered as propellant injection systems for semi-cryogenic liquid rocket engines. A gas centered swirl coaxial type atomizer discharges an annular swirling <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> which is atomized by a gaseous jet issuing from the central orifice of the atomizer. The primary objectives of this work were to understand the fluid dynamic interaction process between the outer <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the central gas jet and its role on the breakup process of the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet.</b> Cold flow experiments were carried out by constructing custom made gas centered swirl coaxial atomizers. Two different atomizer configurations with varying swirl effect were studied. The jets were injected into ambient atmospheric air medium with tap water and air as experimental fluids. The flow conditions were {{described in terms of}} Weber number (Wel) and Reynolds number (Reg) for <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the air jet respectively. Spray images were captured by employing an image acquisition system comprising a high resolution digital camera and a strobe lamp. The captured spray images at different combinations of Wel and Reg were analyzed to extract quantitative measurements of breakup length (Lb), spray cone angle (θs), spray width (SW) and two-dimensional surface profile of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets.</b> Quantitative analysis of the variation of Lb with Reg with different values of Wel suggested that low inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> undergo an efficient breakup process. High inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> ignore the presence of central air jet at lower values of Reg however undergo air jet breakup at higher values of Reg. Qualitative analysis of experimental observations revealed that the entrainment process, established between the inner surface of the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the boundary of central jet, triggers the air assisted sheet breakup by drawing the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> closer to the spray axis. The entrainment process may be developing corrugations on the surface of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> which promotes the production of thick liquid ligaments from the sheet surface. The level of surface corrugations on the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet,</b> quantified by means of tortuosity of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> profile, increases with increasing Reg.
