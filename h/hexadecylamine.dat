50|$|Ramirez et al. {{reported}} {{the influence of}} ligand and solvent effects on {{the size and shape}} of platinum nanoparticles. Platinum nanoparticle seeds were prepared by the decomposition of Pt2(dba)3 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) under carbon monoxide (CO). These conditions produced Pt nanoparticles with weakly bound THF and CO ligands and an approximate diameter on 1.2 nm. <b>Hexadecylamine</b> (HDA) was added to the purified reaction mixture and allowed to displace the THF and CO ligands over the course of approximately seven days, producing monodispersed spherical crystalline Pt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2.1 nm. After the seven-day period, an elongation of the Pt nanoparticles occurred. When the same procedure was followed using a stronger capping agent such as triphenyl phosphine or octanethiol, the nanoparticles remained spherical, suggesting that the HDA ligand affects particle shape.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBimetallic CuPt nanocrystals with size {{ranging from}} 3 to 30 nm were {{synthesized}} {{in the presence}} of either <b>hexadecylamine</b> or poly(vinylpyrrolidone) as a capping agent. Different growth stages of CuPt nanoparticles prepared with <b>hexadecylamine</b> have been investigated and a non-classic mechanism governing the formation of the metal alloy was revealed. It was found that the precursor molecules aggregate into amorphous spheres at a very early stage, followed by surface multiple nucleation, formation and combination of crystalline islands to produce a core–shell structure with surface-to-core extension of the crystallization to achieve single crystals. CuPt nanocrystals synthesized with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) grew via the classic route. Dealloying treatment was applied on these CuPt nanoalloys to selectively remove Cu.

The roles of the amine and organic acid are discussed. A novel ligand mediated mechanism is proposed, in which the formation of a stable monolayer structure of the ligands is the driving force to guide the 1 D growth of the alloy nanorods without the influence of the crystal orientation. Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water has been performed using CuPt nanorods as a cocatalyst, which has a higher production rate (234. 08 μmol h− 1 g− 1) than that of Pt nanorods under the same conditions (~ 66. 35 μmol h− 1 g− 1).

The incorporation of β-CD within the mesoporous framework {{was supported by}} IR, Raman, MALDI TOF MS, 13 C solids CP-MAS NMR, and TGA results. Small-angle X-ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption provide evidence of ordered silica mesostructured frameworks. For materials with similar CD loading, the textural properties (surface area and pore volume) doubled as the surfactant changed from dodecylamine (C 12) to <b>hexadecylamine</b> (C 16). The textural properties decrease with CD loading (2 to 6 %). The sorption capacity of gas phase polar and apolar species (nitrogen and methyl chloride) varies along with the adsorption properties in aqueous solution toward p-nitrophenol according to the CD loading (2 – 6 %) and surfactant template employed. Along with gas adsorption of model compounds, the structural effects relate to the surfactant alkyl chain length due to the structure directing effects of the C 12 to C 16 surfactants.
