5|$|According to Brelsford, {{the elderly}} Harrison Clark {{remained}} highly respected among {{the indigenous people}} and was sometimes called upon to settle disputes. His last job was personnel manager at a local mine. He dedicated his final years to the writing of {{a book about his}} life, the manuscript for which was lost when his house burned down. Clark alleged that the BSAC orchestrated the fire to stop him from publishing unflattering information about the early days of Company rule. He died <b>from</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in Broken Hill on 9 December 1927, aged about 67, and was buried in the Protestant section of the town cemetery. The modest savings he possessed {{at the time of his}} death were left to his sister in Port Elizabeth.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: It {{is widely}} held {{that there will}} be an {{epidemic}} of heart failure in Europe and North America as a result of increased survival from myocardial infarction and other coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> The study objective was to discover if the decline in mortality <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> has been accompanied by a rise in mortality <b>from</b> <b>heart</b> failure in the study population. DESIGN: Analysis of database of mortality records including all certified causes of death, not just the underlying cause, from 1979 - 2003. SETTING: Former Oxford NHS Region, England. PATIENTS: Data from death certificates of all who died in the population covered. MAIN RESULTS: Mortality rates for heart failure fell at very similar rates as those <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> In men, the average annual fall in mortality <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> was - 2. 7 % (95 % confidence intervals - 2. 8 to - 2. 5) and that <b>from</b> <b>heart</b> failure was - 2. 9 % (- 3. 2 to - 2. 5). In women, the average annual fall in mortality <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> was - 2. 3 % (- 2. 6 to - 2. 1) and that <b>from</b> <b>heart</b> failure was - 2. 6 % (- 3. 0 to - 2. 3). CONCLUSIONS: The decline in mortality <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> has not been accompanied by a rise in mortality <b>from</b> <b>heart</b> failure. A future epidemic of heart failure, {{as a consequence of the}} decline in mortality <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> seems unlikely...|$|R
5|$|John S. Clark {{was born}} on 21 March 1885 in Glasgow, Scotland, to parents James Souttar Clark, a coach-painter, and Maggie Clark (née Scott). At an early age, Clark had an {{interest}} in entomology throughout his years in Glasgow and adult life in Australia. Clark migrated to Australia in 1905 with little formal education but found himself working for the state railways in Queensland. There, he found an interest in ants and made his first collection of specimens in North Queensland. In May 1908, Clark married his first wife, Maggie Forbes, at the Cairns Presbyterian Church. After their marriage, they moved to Geraldton in Western Australia, where Clark worked for the railways as a wheelwright. He had one son and three daughters with Forbes; Forbes would later die <b>from</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Robinson did {{not long}} outlive his son. Complications <b>from</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and {{diabetes}} weakened Robinson {{and made him}} almost blind by middle age. On October 24, 1972, nine days after his appearance at the World Series, Robinson {{died of a heart}} attack at his home on 95 Cascade Road in North Stamford, Connecticut; he was 53 years old. Robinson's funeral service on October 27, 1972, at Upper Manhattan's Riverside Church adjacent to Grant's Tomb in Morningside Heights, attracted 2,500 mourners. Many of his former teammates and other famous baseball players served as pallbearers, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave the eulogy. Tens of thousands of people lined the subsequent procession route to Robinson's interment site at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, where he was buried next to his son Jackie and mother-in-law Zellee Isum. Twenty-five years after Robinson's death, the Interboro Parkway was renamed the Jackie Robinson Parkway in his memory. This parkway bisects the cemetery in close proximity to Robinson's gravesite.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} from Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, Valiente formed her own coven with Grove as High Priest, {{still following}} {{the tradition of}} Gardnerian Wicca, albeit without the Wiccan laws, which she believed to be entirely an invention of Gardner's. This coven however failed to last, breaking up amid arguments between its founders. In 1956, Valiente, {{along with her husband}} and her mother, moved into a basement flat in Lewes Crescent, Kemptown, in the southern coastal town of Brighton, although in 1968 they moved into a flat nearer to the town centre. She befriended another Kemptown resident, the journalist Leslie Roberts, who shared her interest in the supernatural. He attracted much attention to himself in the local press through his claims that practitioners of black magic were also operating in the area. Valiente remained a good friend to Roberts until his death <b>from</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in 1966. She also got back in touch with Gardner, and mended their friendship, remaining on good terms until his death in 1964, when he left her £200 in his will. During the early 1960s she also developed a correspondence with two Gardnerian initiates in Sheffield, Patricia Crowther and her husband Arnold Crowther, finally meeting them when the latter couple visited Brighton in 1965.|$|E

5|$|Riley's father {{returned}} from the war partially paralyzed. He was unable to continue working in his legal practice and the family soon fell into financial distress. The war had a negative physiological effect on him, and {{his relationship with his}} family quickly deteriorated. He opposed Riley's interest in poetry and encouraged him to find a different career. The family finances finally disintegrated and they were forced to sell their town home in April 1870 and return to their country farm. Riley's mother was able to keep peace in the family, but after her death in August <b>from</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> Riley and his father had a final break. He blamed his mother's death on his father's failure to care for her in her final weeks. He continued to regret the loss of his childhood home and wrote frequently of how it was so cruelly snatched from him by the war, subsequent poverty, and his mother's death. After the events of 1870, he developed an addiction to alcohol which he struggled with for the remainder of his life.|$|E

40|$|Systolic and diastolic blood {{pressures}} {{were compared}} {{as predictors of}} mortality <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in Norwegian men aged 35 - 49. A total of 39, 207 men were followed up {{for an average of}} 8. 9 years; 385 died of coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Diastolic blood pressure seemed to be the better predictor, the difference being most pronounced in the age group 35 - 39. At this age 26 % more deaths <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> were found in the upper quintile of diastolic blood pressure compared with the upper quintile of systolic blood pressure. At ages 45 - 49 there were almost the same numbers of deaths <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in the upper quintiles of systolic and diastolic pressures. These findings suggest that the relative predictive strength of systolic and diastolic blood pressure may be dependent on age. Furthermore, for very obese men the association between blood pressure and death <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> is much weaker...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 {{years it has}} become clear that passive smoking is {{correlated}} with an increased risk of coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> The relative risk of 25 - 30 % is comparable to that of lung cancer due to passive smoking. Since coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> is {{the most common cause of}} death, it is likely that passive smoking causes many more deaths <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> than <b>from</b> lung cancer. For the Netherlands, yearly figures of 2, 500 to 4, 000 deaths <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> due to passive smoking are estimated. In other words, of every 10 deaths <b>from</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> due to cigarette smoke, one is caused by passive smoking.
