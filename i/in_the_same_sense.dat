5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E

25|$|Standard Model neutrinos are {{fundamental}} point-like particles. An effective size {{can be defined}} using their electroweak cross section (apparent size in electroweak interaction). The average electroweak characteristic size is r2 = n × 10−33cm2 (n × 1nanobarn), where n = 3.2 for electron neutrino, n = 1.7 for muon neutrino and n = 1.0 for tau neutrino; it depends on no other properties than mass. However, this is best understood as being relevant only to probability of scattering. Since the neutrino does not interact electromagnetically, and is defined quantum mechanically by a wavefunction, {{it does not have}} a size <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> as everyday objects. Furthermore, processes that produce neutrinos impart such high energies to them that they travel at almost the speed of light. Nevertheless, neutrinos are fermions, and thus obey the Pauli exclusion principle, i.e. that increasing their density forces them into progressively higher momentum states.|$|E

500|$|While it is {{sometimes}} assumed, particularly in the United States, to have been borrowed from Arabic political discourse, its evolution has followed a circular course from Arabic to English and then back. Lebanese newspapers began referring to just [...] "the street" [...] during the 1950s; later in the decade reports in The New York Times used the term in English to explain Gamal Abdel Nasser's broad appeal not just in his native Egypt but across the Arab world. Later commentators added the [...] "Arab" [...] and eventually dropped the scare quotes to create the current usage, which became widespread in American media during the First Palestinian Intifada in 1987.

500|$|While the noun ski {{originates}} {{from the}} Norwegian language, unlike the English skiing {{there is no}} corresponding verb in Norwegian. Fridtjov Nansen, for instance, describes the crossing of Greenland as På ski over Grønland, literally [...] "On skis across Greenland", while the English edition of the report was titled, The first crossing of Greenland. Nansen referred to the activity of traversing snow on skis as [...] (he used the term also in the English translation), which may be translated as ski running. Nansen used skilöbning, regarding all forms of skiing, but noted that ski jumping is purely a competitive sport and not for amateurs. He further noted that in some competitions the skier [...] "is also required to show his skill in turning his ski to {{one side or the}} other within given marks" [...] at full speed on a steep hill. Nansen regarded these forms (i.e., jumping and slalom) as [...] "special arts", and believed that the most important branch of skiing was travel [...] "in an ordinary way across the country". In Germany, Nansen's Greenland report was published as Auf Schneeschuhen durch Grönland (literally [...] "On snowshoes through Greenland"). The German term, Schneeschuh, was supplanted by the borrowed Norwegian word, Ski, in the late 19th century. The Norwegian encyclopedia of sports also uses the term, skiløping, (literally [...] "ski running") for all forms of skiing.

500|$|Steam devils are {{vortices}} typically about 50 to 200 metres in diameter, essentially vertical, {{and up to}} 500 metres high.

[...] Steam devils rotate with a cyclonic direction of motion, but not very fast or powerfully, usually just a few rotations per minute, and sometimes apparently not at all. [...] There is usually a well-defined inner part of the rotating column of steam and a more ragged outer part from which clumps of steam often detach. [...] Rather smaller steam devils can form over small lakes, especially the warm water in the hot springs of geyser basins. [...] In these cases typical dimensions are a metre or so diameter, but can vary from less than 0.1 to 2 metres, and a height of 2 to 30 metres with a somewhat faster rotation of 60 rpm or so. [...] The central core of the steam devil can be clear, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> that the centre of a dust devil is clear of dust.
