5|$|The ideal {{habitat for}} these rabbits {{is in an}} area between mature and young forests. They use the dense mature forests as {{protection}} and {{for the presence of}} pampas grass, in the summer, and acorns, in the winter, for their diets. They also use the high density of perennial grasses and herbaceous ground cover in the young forests for their diets during different times of the year. Therefore, the best habitat for them to live in is where they <b>have</b> <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> both young and mature forests with no obstructions between the two forest types.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, York, Pennsylvania-based {{department}} store chain The Bon-Ton acquired the AM's chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, on December 14, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo {{was struck by}} a dump truck while trying to get to her first day of work in the mall's food court from a NFTA Metro bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's African-American community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority East Side to <b>have</b> <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the mall. In settling a wrongful death claim against Walden Galleria and NFTA Metro and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall, where it remains today. Bonwit Teller closed off its upper level in 1996 as part of the chain's restructuring, with Old Navy soon opening in the store's former upper level. By the end of the year, Bonwit Teller had closed the rest of its store as well, with the lower level becoming the area's first Bed Bath & Beyond store in 1997. Also in 1996, sporting apparel retailer Finish Line opened what was then one of its largest stores, in the space vacated by Filene's Basement two years previous.|$|E

25|$|The National Rail Administration and Ruter have {{in their}} Oslo Hub reports {{identified}} Bryn as one of three main public transit hubs they wish to develop. The area already features a metro station which covers three metro lines, Østensjø, Lambertseter and Furuset, although the two stations to not <b>have</b> <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> each other. The railway station has poor access and narrow platforms. An upgrade of the station has been called for, in which the tracks would be {{moved closer to the}} river and an island platform established. It could have access from Østensjøveien. Establishing a new hub at Bryn would not only involve several new lines terminating there, but would also require a significant urban renewal of the area.|$|E
25|$|He left Florence in September to {{continue}} to Rome. With the connections from Florence, Milton was able to <b>have</b> <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Rome's intellectual society. His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli, who praised Milton within an epigram. In late October, Milton attended a dinner given by the English College, Rome, despite his dislike for the Society of Jesus, meeting English Catholics who were also guests—theologian Henry Holden and the poet Patrick Cary. He also attended musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas. Milton left for Naples {{toward the end of}} November, where he stayed only for a month because of the Spanish control. During that time, he was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso, patron to both Torquato Tasso and to Giambattista Marino.|$|E
25|$|Female mate {{guarding}} is {{the act of}} guarding {{a potential}} partner away from other competing females. It occurs when women mate with males that are seen as desirable due to their paternal value, see mate value, {{and are therefore more}} likely to attract other females. Over 50% of females asked in a survey admitted to poaching (see Mate poaching) another woman’s’ mate, as well as 50% of men admitting that they were unfaithful when presented with a poaching female. It is therefore a balancing act between having close female friendships that can help with childcare, and the sharing of resources, but not letting friends become too close that they <b>have</b> <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> poach successfully. Females have therefore come up with tactics to ward of any potential threats.|$|E

25|$|Minority {{populations have}} {{increased}} exposure to environmental hazards that include lack of neighborhood resources, structural and community factors {{as well as}} residential segregation that result in a cycle of disease and stress. The environment that surrounds us can influence individual behaviors and lead to poor health choices and therefore outcomes. Minority neighborhoods have been continuously noted to have more fast food chains and fewer grocery stores than predominantly white neighborhoods. These food deserts affect a family’s ability to <b>have</b> <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> nutritious food for their children. This lack of nutritious food extends beyond the household into the schools that {{have a variety of}} vending machines and deliver over processed foods. These environmental condition have social ramifications and in the first time in US history is it projected that the current generation will live shorter lives than their predecessors will.|$|E
25|$|The COW gun {{mounting}} in {{the nose}} was of Westland design, and allowed the gun to be trained over a wide arc. It supported the gun on the apex of a pyramidal structure, that was asymmetric to allow the gunner to <b>have</b> <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the weapon. This structure was fixed on a rotating base, which also provided the gunner with a rotating platform to stand on. The gunner could train the mount by turning a hand gear, or push on a pedal to engage a brake that locked the mount in its position. The elevation and depression of the gun were accomplished by the muscle power of the gunner. As the large ammunition clip of the COW gun prevented sighting over the barrel, a sight was installed to its left. The gun {{is reported to have}} been successfully fired in the air, also when trained to the side.|$|E

25|$|From 1939 to 1956, the De La Cruz family {{worked for}} the Russell Giffen cotton company. In Huron where they lived from 1944-1956, Lopez-De La Cruz worked in a lunch truck that served Braceros. Her cooking and {{services}} were popular with fieldworkers and community members. She worked in the truck, raised her children, {{and worked in the}} fields with her husband and children. It was during this time that Gary Soto says that Lopez became vocally aware of the injustices faced by farm workers. He noted that Lopez-De La Cruz observed Mexican Americans working in brutally hot conditions, foremen stealing and pocketing workers Social security, state, and federal taxes, company stores on farms charging on average 3 times more than stores in the city knowing that farm workers would only <b>have</b> <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the company store; as well as issues like the lack of access to higher education for children of farm workers and the unfair wage hierarchy between racial groups on the farms.

25|$|Although Venezuelan {{extra-heavy}} oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of {{the difference}} is due to temperature. Once the oil {{comes out of the}} ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies over a decade ago, can handle. The upgraders have a combined capacity of , which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of naphtha to use as diluent to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much natural gas condensate from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not <b>have</b> <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> condensate from new US shale gas production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline diluent, and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems – {{as a result of the}} country's economic crisis -, and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved.|$|E
