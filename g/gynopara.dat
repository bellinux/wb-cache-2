40|$|We tested {{host plant}} {{suitability}} of 10 taxa in the Rhamnaceae for successful preoverwintering development of soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Homoptera: Aphididae). In the laboratory, we offered each <b>gynopara</b> and ovipara a single member of each putative host plant and measured survivorship and fecundity. Rhamnus cathartica L. and Rhamnus alnifolia L’Héritier were confirmed as suitable host plants, and eight other taxa were confirmed as unsuitable. This study supports {{results from a}} companion study in which soybean aphids were offered multiple members of the Rhamnaceae in field cages. Of the two suitable host plants, R. cathartica supported greater longevity and oviposition rates in oviparae.

40|$|As adults, {{the summer}} (alate virginopara) and autumn (<b>gynopara)</b> winged {{forms of the}} black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, utilise {{different}} host plants, the bean Vicia faba, and the spindle tree, Euonymus europaeus, respectively. Electroantennograms (EAGs) were recorded from the antennae of these aphid forms, reared from a single clone, to thirty five plant volatiles and to paraffin oil extracts from leaves of the two host plants. The EAG peak responses were normalised against the adjacent responses to a standard stimulus ((E) - 2 -hexenal at log 2 dilution). The comparison of different parameters of the EAG responses, i. e. peak, rise and decay, reveals that peripheral olfactory perception of most volatiles is not significantly different between these two forms. In addition, the responses of adult wingless virginoparae to thirteen of the plant volatiles show, with one exception, similar peripheral perception. The results indicate that any odour discrimination between the two alternative host plants by their respective colonisers is not perceived {{at the level of}} the peripheral olfactory receptors. The EAG response profile of A. fabae differs from that of the vetch aphid, Megoura viciae, which also colonises bean...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} sex {{allocation}} in aphids have shown, in one case, a constant investment in males, and in another, an equal investment in males and females. We show here {{that in the}} host-alternating aphidine, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), investment fits neither of these patterns. In a series of laboratory experiments, we investigated the effect of manipulating an environmental cue (day length) on the timing of sexual offspring production and the relative investment in males and gynoparae. The latter are winged parthenogenetic females capable of giving birth to sexual female offspring (oviparae). Exposure of wingless parthenogenetic females to long nights brings about endocrine changes resulting {{in the production of}} gynoparae and males on the summer (secondary) host plant. Gynoparae and males then fly to the winter (primary) host, where the oviparae are born, mating occurs and overwintering eggs are laid. Our experiments confirm that gynoparae precede males among the progeny of an individual, and show that the sex ratio on the secondary host is male biased. Because each <b>gynopara</b> contains four to five oviparae, the ultimate sex ratio on the primary host is potentially slightly female biased. The field sex ratio, however, will depend on survival time of the mothers of the sexual forms, those that survive longer producing relatively more males. The patterns of variation in sex ratio are discussed in relation to current theory and other recent studies on aphid sex allocation...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} concept of the {{evolutionary}} individual as the basis for an attempt to characterise sex-allocation patterns in aphids. We then examine the various selection pressures involved in the evolution of aphids 2 ̆ 7 sex ratios, and propose a novel explanation for biased sex allocation in host-alternating aphidines, in which inbreeding is impossible. Their production of <b>gynoparae</b> (females that migrate from secondary to primary hosts to produce the sexual females) before males is the clonal equivalent of sex reversal - sequential hermaphroditism. Selection on the timing of the reversal, and thus the overall sex-allocation ratio, should depend largely on the rate of decline of the populations on the secondary hosts in autumn and on how long it takes oviparae (sexual females) to reach maturity. The longer the nymphal period of the oviparae, the sooner investment in <b>gynoparae</b> becomes futile, since both <b>gynoparae</b> and oviparae must mature and oviparae must oviposit before leaf-fall. It is the combination of a deadline - leaf-fall - and a delay - the two generations that must be completed between allocation to <b>gynoparae</b> and oviposition - that determines the selection on the allocation ratios of host-alternating aphidines.

40|$|The rosy {{apple aphid}} Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini) is a key pest in western European apple orchards; the {{economic}} damage threshold is so low that outbreaks cannot be forecasted. A mass rearing of the species on plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) was initiated, with the aim to infest apple trees with either the autumn migrants, gynoparae and males, or the egg-laying females (oviparae). Here, data are presented about the propagation of the species on plantain, on the production of autumn migrants under laboratory conditions, and on the duration of juvenile development and reproductive capacities of both gynoparae and oviparae. Under long-day conditions (18 h light/day) on plantain, the thermal constant {{for the duration of}} juvenile development was 166 dd (day-degrees) above the lower development threshold of 5. 1 degreesC, and daily larviposition amounted to 1. 87 times the temperature (degreesC) minus 0. 8, above a lower threshold of 4. 3 degreesC. Between 32 and 36 larvae were produced by the young female before the first larvae become adult and their reproduction started to overshadow their mother's. A plant freshly infested with 12 reproducing females and transferred to short-day conditions (12 h light/day) yielded up to 5, 000 autumn migrants, with males in the majority. The first gynoparae appeared after about 25 days at both 16 and 20 degreesC, and males appeared after 40 and 33 days, respectively. Young adult gynoparae produced most of their about ten offspring right after landing on apples, unless temperature was well below 15 degreesC. The duration of juvenile development of these oviparae appeared to be rather variable and their egg-laying so protracted that each of these females needs to survive several weeks to produce a handful of winter eggs. With reproductive capacities of up to 14 progeny/female for gynoparae and 7. 4 for oviparae, release of one <b>gynopara</b> in the field could theoretically lead to the deposition of 100 winter eggs...|$|E
40|$|The soybean aphid Aphis glycines MATSUMURA is {{the main}} sap-sucking pest on {{soybeans}} Glycine max. In Japan, it is distributed from Hokkaido to Kyushu (Sakai, 1949); abroad, it is found in Korea, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Malay (Paik, 1965), the Phillipines (Takahashi, 1966), and India (Raychaudhuri et al., 1980). In addition to soybeans, wild Glycine species {{are known to be}} a secondary host. Matsumura reported this aphid species on soybean (1917 a) and in the same year recorded that its eggs over-wintered on plants belonging to the wild pea family (1917 b). Shindo (1928, 1932) originally identified Kitsunenomago Justicia procumbens and purplish amaranth Amaranthus blitum as primary hosts, but later retracted and reported that the eggs over-winter in the roots of the Japanese chaff flower Acyranthes japonica (1941). However, Sakai (1949, 1950 a, b) showed in greenhouse studies that this aphid does not over-winter in the chaff flower, and concluded that the species found on chaff flower was actually Aphis justiciae SHINJI which Shindo (1928) considered to be the same as Aphis glycines. While the controversy in Japan about the primary host remained unresolved, in China it was reported by Wang et al. (1962) that the eggs over-wintered in the Dahurian buckthorn Rhamnus davurica of the buckthorn family. Zhang and Zhong (1982) subsequently established that several of the 15 species in the genus Rhamnus found in China were primary hosts. In the reports from China, only the body color and the number of secondary sensilla of the third antennal segment of <b>gynopara</b> were reported, and no mention was made of the morphs on the primary host.

Here we report a comparative analysis of differential gene expression profiling among parthenogenetic females, <b>gynoparae</b> and sexual females of the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii, using the RNA-seq approach with next-generation sequencing platforms, followed by RT-qPCR. At the cutoff criteria of fold change $ 2 and P, 0. 01, we identified 741 up- and 879 down-regulated genes in <b>gynoparae</b> versus parthenogenetic females, 2, 101 up- and 2, 210 down-regulated genes in sexual females compared to <b>gynoparae,</b> and 1, 614 up- and 2, 238 down-regulated genes in sexual females relative to parthenogenetic females.

40|$|The {{interval}} timer mechanism was examined in two clones of Myzus persicae (Sulzer) originating from peach in Naousa, North Greece. Overwintering eggs {{were collected in}} April 1997 and after egg hatch the morphs of progeny were recorded at LD 10 : 14 h and 17 degreesC until the appearance of sexuals. In one clone, observations were continued until the 21 st generation after egg hatch. In addition, the production of sexual morphs was examined in two other clones originating from Lehonia, Central Greece, when apterae (wingless females) were transferred from long to short days and 17 degreesC {{in the second and}} eighth generation of parthenogenetic rearing after their collection from peach trees.

40|$|The host-plant {{acceptance}} behaviour of aphids was examined, in two aphid species, {{the bird}} cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi and the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphum pisum, to elucidate the recognition factors {{used to assess}} plant suitability for parthenogenetic reproduction. In addition, host-plant chemistry was investigated to study possible cues that initiated reproduction. The probing and parturition behaviour of R. padi on barley, Hordeum vulgare, or bird cherry leaves, Prunus padus, were monitored by electrical penetration graph (EPG) coupled with a simultaneous video recording. The autumn winged <b>gynoparae</b> and the summer winged virginoparae initiated reproduction on their host plants, P. padus and H. vulgare, respectively, before phloem contact occurred and {{these findings suggest that}} phloem contact is not necessary for host-acceptance decisions. Host acceptance behaviour of A. pisum, on susceptible and phloem-based resistant line of Medicago truncatula was monitored and found to be similar on both plant lines. The phloem-based resistance mechanism did not affect parturition behaviour indicating that reproduction is initiated prior to phloem contact. The results also imply that sign chemicals used as host recognition cues located in a peripheral tissue rather than in the phloem of host plants. Bioassays were employed to characterise the sign chemicals within host-plants of R. padi. It was found that virginoparae reproduced similarly on a neutral medium such as water or holidic diet as well as host-plant aqueous extract, which suggests that particular stimulants may be not involved in host-plant recognition by this generalist morph. On the other hand, aqueous extracts of bird cherry leaves specifically stimulated parturition in autumn <b>gynoparae.</b> Bioassay-guided chemical fractionation showed that at least five secondary metabolites appear to be involved in host recognition by <b>gynoparae.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGovernment of KoreaGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Aphids {{are known}} as {{important}} pests of plants specially almond trees. Seasonal population fluctuation of two aphid species, Brachycaudus amygdalinus (Schout.) and Hyalopterus amygdali (Blanch.) were studied in 1999 - 2000 on almond trees in Najafabad area. Characteristics such as times of egg hatch, appearance, outbreak, spring migration to alternative hosts, migration from alternative hosts in fall, oviposition, number of eggs laid, damage degree, alternative, other primary hosts and some natural enemies were investigated. In early spring damage signs of B. amygdalinus were expressed on almond twigs as serious leaf curling followed by retarded growth of twigs and shortened internodes. Shortly after that H. amygdali colonized other leaves. For both species egg hatching was coincided in late winter however colonization and population increase of H. amygdalei were observed two weeks later than what was observed for B. amygdalinus. With the onset of warm season, both species moved from almonds to alternative hosts for aestivation. <b>Gynoparae</b> shortly followed by males appeared on alternative hosts in late summer and migrated to almonds.

The time required for the first penetration and first cell puncture of the non-vascular tissues was shorter in apterae than in <b>gynoparae</b> and males.

In addition, phloem ingestion was much longer in apterae than in winged morphs, 3458 s and 25 - 70 s respectively. In contrast, winged morphs spent 14 - 21 % of the available time ingesting sap from xylem while in apterae xylem sap uptake was only for 2 % of the time. Furthermore, the data showed that males perform in general all the feeding behaviours that other conspecific morphs exhibit.

By increasing the number of short day cycles at 17 degreesC, the aphids switched to male production earlier and produced more males. The highest mean number of male progeny was observed in apterae that were transferred to short day conditions 13 - 14 days prenatally. Apterae that were transferred to short day conditions after the fourth nymphal instar produced only females. Apterous virginoparae were produced by aphids that were transferred to short day conditions 0 - 1 days prenatally or postnatally.

50|$|While on buckthorn, <b>gynoparae</b> {{produce a}} {{generation}} of apterous female sexual morphs (oviparae) that mate with male alatae to produce overwintering eggs.

Male alatae locate oviparae on buckthorn through two sex pheromones commonly found in aphid species, (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactol and (4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactone, that are emitted by oviparae in a species-specific combination. After mating on buckthorn, oviparae deposit their eggs on the plant. Ragsdale et al.

40|$|ABSTRACT The soybean aphid,Aphis glycinesMatsumura, has a heteroecious, {{holocyclic}} life cycle. Soybean aphids overwinter as eggs, hatch in the spring, reproduce asexually, and undergo {{three or}} more generations on buckthorn,Rhamnus spp., before migrating to a secondary host such as soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr. The ability of different soybean aphid life stages to survive low temperatures potentially experienced during fall or winter is not known. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the supercooling point (SCP) of various soybean aphid life stages and to determine the annual probability that winter temperatures within the North Central region of the United States would equal or fall below the mean SCP of soybean aphid eggs. Aphid eggs are considered the most cold-hardy stage; therefore, their SCP {{can be used as a}} conservative estimate for aphid overwintering mortality. In our study, eggs had the lowest mean SCP (approximately 34 C) among all life stages, whereas <b>gynoparae</b> and oviparae had the highest mean SCPs (approximately 15 C).

40|$|Changes in wing {{development}} and development through the stadia of Aphis fabae are examined after parasitisation by Aphidius colemani {{along with the}} underlying mechanisms. Parasitoid oviposition into nymphs of winged <b>gynoparae</b> of A. fabae shows that wing development is inhibited and the earlier parasitism takes place, the stronger the effect. Consideration of the timing of events indicates that the active component(s) is most likely injected during oviposition and {{is not related to}} hatching and growing of the parasitoid larva. When extracts of venom glands are injected into late-second stadium aphids, many develop to fourth-stadium possessing rudimentary wingbuds, show developmental arrest and often die while moulting to the adult stage. Injections with extracts of female or male parasitoids into later stadia give similar results with regard to development to the adult but aphids injected in the late-fourth stadium develop normally. Experiments with long-day winged virginoparae reveal similar results in development to the adult but injections into long-day wingless aphids, which develop more rapidly, show this effect only when performed early in the third stadium. The earlier the injection before the final moult the greater the effect of the extract on preventing adult development. The results indicate that there is an active factor(s) in the female parasitoid’s venom that disrupts wing {{development and}}/or inhibits development to the adult; the loss of activity after treatment at 100 °C or with protease makes it likely that the factor(s) is a protein. Surprisingly, injections of extracts from male parasitoids have similar effects. The location and function of such a factor(s) in males are unknown. Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography is used to fractionate the parasitoid extracts and bioassays reveal activity in fractions 16 - 25. Aphidius ervi venom also inhibits development of A. fabae (a non-host) whereas A. colemani venom has no effect on the development of Megoura viciae (a non-host). Injection with lipopolysaccharides and infection with a fungal pathogen are used to test whether stimulation of the immune response affects wing development in the host and the possibility that the host is in control of inhibiting its own wing development in order to support its immune system is discussed.

40|$|The soybean aphid {{is widely}} {{distributed}} among all major soybean growing regions in China. It causes severe damage in Jilin, Liaoning, and Helongjiang Provinces, {{and part of}} the inner Mongolian autonomous region, and those areas are often called aphid-stricken areas. Its hosts include wild soybean (Glycine benth forma lanceolate Makino), buckthorn (Rhamnus davuricus) as well as soybean. Results of field investigation and inoculation experiments confirmed that the widely distributed buckthorn in the Northern Provinces is the over-wintering host for soybean aphids. According to the life cycle of aphids and their characteristic damage to soybeans, three different periods of impact can be recognized: 1) starting from seedling stage to blooming stage (mid-July), the aphid population reaches its peak point. About 50 - 70 % of the whole aphid population colonizes on the tender leaves and twigs on top of the soy plants. The soybean damage caused during this period has the worst impact on the plants. 2) During the third ten days of July when the soybean plants cease to grow, aphids then migrate from the top leaves and twigs to the middle or lower ones and feed {{on the underside of the}} leaves. At the same time, the young nymphs appear. The aphid population grows slowly, and their damage to soybean plants is at a low tide. 3) From late August [...] the late pod bearing period [...] to early September [...] the yellow maturing period [...] aphids start their late multiplying stage. In late Fall, aphids migrate back to buckthorn, their overwintering host, and oviposit overwintering eggs after mating. During Fall, the male aphids and the ovipositional female aphids are living on different hosts. <b>Gynoparae</b> live on buckthorn, and the male aphids live on soybean. Aphids reproduce 15 generations a year on soybean. After analyzing the life cycle of aphids, their growth pattern in the field, as well as the meteorological data in recent years, we came to preliminary results about the growth and decline pattern of aphids and their affecting factors: 1) the more the overwintering eggs and aphids numbers were at the seedling stage, the more severe their impact on seedlings; 2) Average temperatures between 22 - 25 °C and relative humidity below 78 % from late June to early July greatly favored the growth and reproduction of aphids. Even if the original aphid population is small, severe aphid epidemics still could occur during the blooming period in July because aphids reproduced very quickly under those favorable weather conditions; 3) As the growth points ceased growing in late July and the nutrient condition deteriorated, the aphid population declined. In summary, we may make long- or short-term predictions of aphid epidemics based on the number of overwintering eggs, meteorological data, and current and past aphid information. Based on the results of several years’ laboratory and field experiments, the following aphid control measures achieved very good results: 0. 5 % lindane (benzene hexachloride, or BHC), 1 to 300 - 400 diluted 6 % BHC wettable powder, 1 to 15000 diluted E 605 (parathion), 1 to 100 diluted tobacco leaf solution, and seed coating with 20 % BHC. Among these methods, 0. 5 % BHC powder and seed coating with 0. 7 % of 20 % BHC have been widely used in agricultural practice. Originating text in Chinese.
