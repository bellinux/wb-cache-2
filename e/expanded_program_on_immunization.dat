40|$|Abstract Background The {{greatest}} challenge facing <b>expanded</b> <b>programs</b> <b>on</b> <b>immunization</b> in general, and in Burkina Faso in particular, lies in {{their capacity to}} achieve and sustain levels of immunization coverage that will ensure effective protection of children. This article aims to demonstrate that full immunization coverage of children, which is the primary indicator for monitoring national immunization programs, is sufficient neither to evaluate their performance adequately, nor to help identify the broad strategies that must be implemented to improve their performance. Other dimensions of performance, notably adherence to the vaccination schedule and {{the efficacy of the}} approaches used to reach all the children (targeting) must also be considered. Methods The study was carried out using data from surveys carried out in Burkina Faso: the 1993, 1998 and 2003 Demographic and Health Surveys and the 2003 national Survey of Immunization Coverage. Essentially, we described levels of immunization coverage and their trends according to the indicators considered. Performance differences are illustrated by amplitudes and maximum/minimum ratios. Results The health regions' performances vary according to whether they are evaluated on the basis of full immunization coverage or vaccination status of children who have not completed their vaccinations. The health regions encompass a variety of realities, and efforts of substantially different intensity would be required to reach all the target populations. Conclusion Decision-making can be improved by integrating a tripartite view of performance that includes full immunization coverage, adherence to the vaccination schedule (timely coverage), and the status of children who are not fully vaccinated. With such an approach, interventions can be better targeted. It provides information on the quality and timeliness of vaccination and identifies the efforts required to meet the objectives of full immunization coverage.

40|$|Background: In 2008, the GAVI Alliance {{funded the}} {{introduction}} of new vaccines (including pentavalent diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis [DTP] plus hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b antigens) in Guinea-Bissau. The introduction was accompanied by increased vaccination outreach services and a more restrictive wastage policy, including only vaccinating children younger than 12 months. We assessed coverage of all vaccines in the <b>Expanded</b> <b>Program</b> <b>on</b> <b>Immunizations</b> before and after the new vaccines' introduction, and the implications on child survival. Methods: This observational cohort study used data from the Bandim Health Project, which has monitored vaccination status and mortality in randomly selected village clusters in Guinea-Bissau since 1990. We assessed the change in vaccination coverage using cohort data from children born in 2007 and 2009; analysed the proportion of children who received measles vaccine after 12 months of age using data from 1999 – 2006; and compared child mortality after age 12 months in children who had received measles vaccine and those who had not using data from 1999 to 2006. Findings: The proportion of children who were fully vaccinated by 12 months of age was 53 % (468 of 878) in the 2007 cohort and 53 % (467 of 879) in the 2009 cohort (relative risk [RR] 1 · 00, 95 % CI 0 · 89 – 1 · 11). Coverage of DTP- 3 and pentavalent- 3 increased from 73 % (644 of 878) in 2007 to 81 % (712 of 879) in 2009 (RR 1 · 10, 95 % CI 1 · 04 − 1 · 17); by contrast, the coverage of measles vaccination declined from 71 % (620 of 878) to 66 % (577 of 879; RR 0 · 93, 0 · 85 – 1 · 01). The effect of the changes was significantly different for DTP- 3 coverage compared with measles vaccine coverage (p= 0 · 002). After 12 months of age, the adjusted mortality rate ratio was 0 · 71 (95 % CI 0 · 56 – 0 · 90) for children who had received measles vaccine compared with those who had not (0 · 59 [0 · 43 – 0 · 80] for girls and 0 · 87 [0 · 62 – 1 · 23] for boys).

We {{model the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of {{the introduction of}} a pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine into the Ex-panded <b>Program</b> <b>on</b> <b>Immunization.</b> We use a dynamic stochastic simulation model of the epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum in malaria-endemic areas and of case management in Tanzania. We consider a range of vaccine characteristics and a range of transmission settings. At low vaccine prices, the cost-effectiveness of such vaccines may be similar to that of other established preventative and curative interventions against malaria. The cost-effectiveness ratio increases rapidly and approximately linearly with vaccine cost per dose. The approach can be adopted for comparative analyses of the cost effectiveness of different vaccines and other intervention strategies...|$|R

50|$|Of the 350 {{million to}} 400 million {{individuals}} worldwide {{infected with the}} hepatitis B virus (HBV), one-third reside in China, with 130 million carriers and 30 million chronically infected. Since the <b>Expanded</b> <b>Program</b> <b>on</b> <b>Immunization</b> (EPI) beginning 1992, the prevalence of HBV has declined, especially among children 3 to 12 years old. During a 5-year period, 10.0% of patients with chronic hepatitis developed cirrhosis, and 20.3% of the cases with compensated cirrhosis progressed to decompensated cirrhosis. 6.5% of the people with cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis progressed to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 5-year survival for compensated cirrhosis is 55%, that for decompensated cirrhosis is 14%, and that for HCC is less than 5%. Every year, 300,000 people die from HBV-related diseases in China, including 180,000 patients with HCC. However, the incidence of hepatitis B is still increasing, from 21.9 in 100,000 people in 1990 to 53.3 in 100,000 in 2003. That increase has occurred despite a vaccination program for newborn babies since the 1990s, which showed good effectiveness for reducing chronic HBV infection in children.|$|E

5000|$|The USAID {{initiative}} {{provided an}} important impetus to a World Health Organization (WHO) program to eradicate smallpox {{throughout the world}} within a 10-year period. In 1966, Henderson moved to Geneva to become director of the campaign. At that time, smallpox was occurring widely throughout Brazil and in 30 countries in Africa and South Asia. More than 10 million cases and 2 million deaths were occurring annually. Vaccination brought some control, but the key strategy was [...] "surveillance-containment". This technique entailed rapid reporting of cases from all health units and prompt vaccination of household members and close contacts of confirmed cases. WHO staff and advisors from some 73 countries worked closely with national staff. The last case occurred in Somalia on October 26, 1977, only 10 years after the program began. [...] Three years later, the World Health Assembly recommended that smallpox vaccination could cease. Smallpox is the first human disease ever to be eradicated. This success gave impetus to WHO’s global <b>Expanded</b> <b>Program</b> <b>on</b> <b>Immunization,</b> which targeted other vaccine-preventable diseases, including poliomyelitis, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough.

40|$|Though {{vaccines}} are {{the most}} successful interventions of the biomedical sciences, few people have negative aspects of vaccination. Due to greater demands of vaccines against HIV, malaria, and TB, vaccinologists are {{in the hope of}} current research for the newer vaccines. This viewpoint addresses the current opinions of provaccinists and antivaccinists in an area where people do not know much about vaccination. This paper concludes that vaccination is one of the boons of biomedical sciences and it needs an extra care during preservation, transportation and preparation of vaccines in injection. This will be supportive to successfully immunize the children and to lower the negative perception of antivaccinists.
