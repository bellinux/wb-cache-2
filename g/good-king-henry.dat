50|$|Blitum bonus-henricus (syn. Chenopodium bonus-henricus), {{also called}} <b>Good-King-Henry,</b> Poor-man's Asparagus, Perennial Goosefoot, Lincolnshire Spinach, Markery, English mercury, or mercury {{goosefoot}}, is {{a species of}} goosefoot which is native to much of central and southern Europe.|$|E
40|$|The total, soluble and {{insoluble}} oxalate {{contents of}} the leaves, stems and buds of <b>Good-King-Henry</b> (Blitum Bonus-Henricus) were extracted and measured using HPLC chromatography. The large, mature leaves contained 42 % more total oxalate than in the small leaves and the soluble oxalate content of the large leaves was 33 % higher than the smaller leaves. Cooking the mixed leaves, stems and buds in boiling water for two minutes significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced the total oxalate {{when compared to the}} raw plant parts. Pesto sauce made from mixed leaves contained 257 mg total oxalate/ 100 g fresh weight; this was largely made up of insoluble oxalates (85 % of the total oxalate content). Soup made from mixed leaves contained lower levels of total oxalates (44. 26 Â± 0. 49 mg total oxalate/ 100 g fresh weight) and insoluble oxalate made up 49 % of the oxalate contents. The levels of oxalates in the <b>Good-King-Henry</b> leaves were high, suggesting that the leaves should be consumed occasionally as a delicacy because of their unique taste rather than as {{a significant part of the}} diet. However, the products made from <b>Good-King-Henry</b> leaves indicated that larger amounts could be consumed as the oxalate levels were reduced by dilution and processing...|$|E
