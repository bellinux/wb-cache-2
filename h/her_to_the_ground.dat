However, when Abi finds a present that Ben has got for Paul, she realises he has feelings for Paul and confides in Babe, who helps her to publicly announce that she is pregnant. Ben asks Abi to have a termination but then changes his mind, saying he wants the baby. Abi then goes to Babe, panicking because she has lied and is not really pregnant. When Ben accompanies her to a doctor's appointment, she gets him out of the room and confesses her lie to the doctor, who encourages her to be honest, but she then tells Ben the baby is due in October. Abi plans to get pregnant by Ben, but when he admits he may have caught an STI from a stranger, she is unable to have sex with him, so Babe tells her to get pregnant by another man. Babe forces her into getting drunk, and after a drunk Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) compliments her, they have unprotected sex. However, Abi does not get pregnant. She decides to tell Ben the truth, but as she is about to do so, he tells her he has caught chlamydia. Abi later tests positive for chlamydia and realises that Lee may have caught it too. Abi panics to Babe that Ben will discover she is not pregnant, so during an argument between Ben and Phil, Babe pushes Abi into Ben as he is pushed by Phil, knocking <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Babe takes Abi away from the square, and on their return, Abi tells Ben she has had a miscarriage. When she later sees Ben being comforted by Paul, she feels uneasy.|$|E

25|$|Males and new queens take {{on their}} {{responsibilities}} in mid-September and mid-October, respectively. During this time, their body color becomes intense {{and the weight}} of the queen increases about 20%. Once the males and queen leave the nest, they do not return. In V. mandarinia, males wait outside the nest entrance until the queen emerges. Once the queen emerges, they attack her midair, bring <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and copulate from 8 to 45 seconds.

25|$|After {{the success}} of ChickFight, Dave Prazak and Allison Danger set up Shimmer Women Athletes, a {{promotion}} with ties to Prazak's Ring of Honor intending to raise the credibility of women's wrestling on an international scale. Her first match with the promotion was on November 6, 2005, for Volume 1 in a losing effort to MsChif, starting a wild feud between the two. The loss saw Anderson demand a special attraction rematch—the match would be Shimmer's first hardcore match, fought under Falls Count Anywhere rules and helped Anderson gain the victory after nearly thirty minutes of wrestling on February 12, 2006, at Volume 4. MsChif took her revenge at Volume 5 by distracting Anderson during a match with Allison Danger, {{causing her to lose}} the match. Naturally the rivalry was not abated and their next match, main eventing Volume 6 on 21 May, was declared a Last Woman Standing match with MsChif eventually coming out on top. Further interferences took an interesting turn at Volume 7 when Anderson came out during MsChif's match against Rain. However, before she could interfere, Rain's partner Lacey pushed <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> while trying to distract the referee in order to allow Rain to use an illegal weapon; an incensed Anderson fought back against Lacey in time for the referee to see the foreign object in the ring and declare MsChif the winner via disqualification. After Anderson had won her main event match, Lacey and Rain (The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew), ambushed her with a beat down until MsChif ran out, saving her nemesis before leaving her to celebrate the victory. The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew had threatened Anderson for involving herself in their plans against MsChif and similarly threatened MsChif for being in the way of ambushing Melissa and, after declaring themselves the best tag team in the world, demanded a match with the two for Volume 8 which became the penultimate bout of the evening. The Home Wrecking Crew's experience won out over MsChif and Anderson when a double team maneuver led to MsChif being pinned; after the match Anderson and MsChif shook hands as a sign of respect. The two soon showed they could work as a team though when they beat veterans The Experience (Lexie Fyfe and Malia Hosaka), with MsChif pinning Hosaka.|$|E

In a 1985 interview with Spin magazine, Ike admitted, [...] "Yeah, I hit her, but I didn't hit her more than the average guy beats his wife.... If she says I abused her, maybe I did." [...] He worded this slightly differently in his memoirs, Taking Back My Name (1999), writing: [...] "Sure, I've slapped Tina.... There have been times when I punched <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> without thinking. But I have never beat her." ...|$|E
500|$|On the June 5, 2006 {{episode of}} Raw, Haas {{inadvertently}} knocked Lilian Garcia off the ring apron {{as he was}} entering the ring. It was announced on WWE's official website that as a result, Garcia suffered a sprained wrist. As {{a result of the}} legitimate accident, Haas began a feud with Garcia's onetime storyline love interest Viscera. Haas made advances towards Garcia, at one point forcefully kissing her and then dropping <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Haas and Viscera continued to fight for Garcia's affection in the ring, until she told them both that she wanted to be [...] "just friends". Haas gave Viscera an eye rake in anger, and a blinded Viscera accidentally gave Garcia a Samoan drop. Though it was unintentional, when both Haas and Viscera had seen what had happened to their now former love interest, they simply had a laugh about it, thus making Haas a villain. After that, Viscera and Haas became a tag team, competing on both Raw and Heat until splitting in December 2006.|$|E

500|$|Anastasia's daring {{occasionally}} {{exceeded the}} limits of acceptable behavior. [...] "She undoubtedly held the record for punishable deeds in her family, for in naughtiness she was a true genius", said Gleb Botkin, son of the court physician Yevgeny Botkin, who later died with the family at Yekaterinburg. Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors. As a child, she would climb trees and refuse to come down. Once, during a snowball fight at the family's Polish estate, Anastasia rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana, knocking <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> A distant cousin, Princess Nina Georgievna, recalled that [...] "Anastasia was nasty {{to the point of}} being evil", and would cheat, kick and scratch her playmates during games; she was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was. She was less concerned about her appearance than her sisters. Hallie Erminie Rives, a best-selling American author and wife of an American diplomat, described how 10-year-old Anastasia ate chocolates without bothering to remove her long, white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house.|$|E

As he prepares to kill Mickey, Violet calls the landline from Johnnie's cell phone and quickly convinces Caesar to pretend that he's on the phone with Gino, who's calling from a hospital to explain that he and Johnnie were in a car accident. Mickey is convinced and leaves for the hospital. Corky tells Caesar where she has hidden the money, and he goes next-door to find it. Violet escapes and makes a phone call to Mickey, telling him that Caesar stole the money and forced her to keep quiet. In the meantime, Corky tries to stop Caesar from taking the money, but he beats <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Just as he is about to kill her, Violet arrives and pulls a gun on Caesar, telling him that Mickey is on his way and that he should run while he can.

500|$|During {{this period}} of {{commercial}} success, the extensive media attention and [...] "the stress of the grand tour" [...] began to affect Björk, as she repeatedly complained about the intrusiveness of tabloids and reporters. During the Asian leg of the Post Tour, Björk arrived at Bangkok International Airport with her son Sindri after a long haul flight; reporters were present, despite Björk's earlier request that the press leave her and her son alone until she held a press conference. While she was {{walking away from the}} reporters, Julie Kaufman began to ask Sindri questions; this angered Björk, who lunged at Kaufman, knocking <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Björk's record company said that the reporter had been pestering her for four days. She later apologised to Kaufman, who declined to involve the police. The televised incident generated unwanted attention, as did the suicide of Björk's stalker Ricardo López, which caused a media sensation. On 12 September, López sent a letter bomb rigged with sulfuric acid to Björk's residence in London, returned home and filmed his suicide. After viewing his video diary, police contacted Scotland Yard, who intercepted the package without incident. To record in privacy away from the unwanted interest of the press, Björk's tour drummer Trevor Morais offered his studio in Málaga, Spain for Björk to record what would be Homogenic. Björk had begun the first sessions of the album in 1996, at her Maida Vale residence, after the completion of the extensive Post Tour gave her an urgent need to write new songs as a form of therapy.|$|E
