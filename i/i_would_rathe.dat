40|$|JTD). In this editorial, I {{first report}} {{on a number of}} these {{excellent}} developments. I also discuss one new concern for JTD—plagiarism in some submitted articles—that has come to light because of new detec-tion methods. This consideration of intellectual integrity leads me to some more general thoughts about superficiality in the evaluation of intellectual contributions and in ethics education. JOURNAL VITALITY This editorial is appearing in our very first JTD Issue Number 5. Beginning with Volume 12, published in 2011, JTD’s frequency increased from four to five issues per year, a sign of our vitality. This year we have also migrated from a purely e-mail-based submission process to submission through ScholarOne ManuscriptsTM, a Web-based submission portal pro-vided by Taylor & Francis. Between October 2010 (when we went live with ScholarOne) and June 2011, we had {{more than twice as many}} new submissions (not including revisions, special issue papers, book reviews, or invited papers) as we had between October 2009 and June 2010. Thus, even with the increase in the number of issues, it is easy to fill our journal with high-quality papers. I realize that editors are supposed to boast about their rejection rates, as if high levels of rejection prove one’s superiority, but in my ideal world I would never have to turn away a deserving submission. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rathe...</b>|$|E
