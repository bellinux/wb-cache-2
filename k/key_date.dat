25|$|Controversy {{was very}} active in this area {{in parts of the}} 19th century, with some dormant periods also. A <b>key</b> <b>date</b> was the 1859 re-evaluation of archaeological {{evidence}} that had been published 12 years earlier by Boucher de Perthes. It was then widely accepted, as validating the suggestion that man was much older than previously been believed, for example than the 6,000 years implied by some traditional chronologies.|$|E
25|$|Finally, a {{case has}} been made that Kant wrote Dreams before, not after, the Knobloch letter {{and that this was}} {{accomplished}} by accidentally or deliberately falsifying the dates of the documents involved, notably that of the Knobloch letter. This alteration, if true, would strengthen the case for Swedenborg’s work being viewed by Kant, in the last analysis, positively. However, {{the fact of the matter}} is difficult to determine since the <b>key</b> <b>date</b> involved is that of the original of the Knobloch letter, which is lost.|$|E
25|$|The {{defensive}} buildings, {{spread out}} over a large distance, rendered access to the city increasingly difficult: the fortress became a straitjacket for its inhabitants. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the gaps in the old medieval defences were closed off. The Marie gate was buried under Bastion Marie in 1548. The Lampert, Orvis, Beckerich and Jost gates disappeared in the early 17th century under the Berlaimont, Louis, Beck and Jost bastions. The military logic behind {{the need for an}} inaccessible fortress contrasted with that in favour of a merchant city, open to the outside. The 1644 closure of the Jews' gate, the city's main access from the West which had facilitated trade with the Netherlands, was a <b>key</b> <b>date</b> in this process. Traffic was obliged to bypass the plain, and enter by the New Gate (Porte-Neuve) built from 1626 to 1636. A traveller coming from France now had to descend into the Grund and come up through the Fishmarket, passing through several gates on the way.|$|E

500|$|The 1916-D Mercury dime, {{struck at}} the Denver Mint, is the <b>key</b> <b>date</b> of the series, with a mintage of 264,000pieces. The low mintage is because in November 1916, von Engelken {{informed}} the three mint superintendents {{of a large}} order for quarters, and instructed that Denver strike only quarters until it was filled. [...] Striking of dimes at Denver did not resume until well into 1917, making the 1917-D relatively rare as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{invasion}} {{plans were}} {{laid down by}} the Soviet General Staff under Boris Shaposhnikov and Alexander Vasilevsky. The Soviet timetable was clearly and rigidly defined, {{with little or no}} margin for error. The <b>key</b> <b>date</b> was 21 December, Stalin's sixtieth birthday. By then, the Finnish capital Helsinki would have been [...] "freed of the Fascist oppression".

[...] The half eagle series is longer; 24 pieces by date and mint mark.

500|$|The Standing Liberty {{quarter was}} struck at the Philadelphia Mint from 1916 to 1930 with the {{exception}} only of 1922, when no quarters were struck at any mint. [...] It was produced less regularly at Denver and San Francisco beginning in 1917. [...] The mint mark [...] "D" [...] for Denver or [...] "S" [...] for San Francisco may {{be found at the}} base of the wall, just to the left of Liberty's visible foot. [...] While the <b>key</b> <b>date</b> in the series is the 1916 with a mintage of 52,000 (it catalogs for $3,250 even in worn Good-4 condition), the 1921 issue from Philadelphia and the 1923 struck at San Francisco (1923-S) are also expensive, with costs in the hundreds of dollars even for a circulated specimen. The Standing Liberty quarter is the only 20th-century regular issue U.S. coin for which no proof coins were struck. [...] However, a handful of specimen examples of the 1917 Type 1 issue (that is, the coins struck early in 1917 before MacNeil revised the design) exist. [...] Breen reported six known, all with exceptionally sharp central details.|$|E
