40|$|This study {{compared}} {{three types}} of feeders for broilers: Fenix, <b>Tube</b> and Automatic <b>feeders.</b> Bird's feeding behavior and preference were considered in this the evaluation. Preference was assessed by examining birds' behavioral activities, such as eating, standing and lying around the equipments, and meal duration as function of the environmental variables. Data on the behavioral activities and meal size were collected in a broiler commercial farm using a portable video camera, and the direct footages were analyzed. The time spent in each activity, feeding bout duration and time spent near the trough were statistically analyzed using the test of means and medians. Pearson's correlation {{test was used to}} evaluate the relationship between ambient environmental data and the time of feeding. A prospective scenario was established and data were pair wised compared to it. There were interactions between environmental characteristics and feeding and lying down activities during the experiment. Eating behavior was more frequent in the area around the <b>Tube</b> <b>feeder.</b> The duration of feeding time was higher when the birds used the <b>Tube</b> <b>feeder</b> (214 +/- 28 s), followed by the use of the Fenix feeder (123 +/- 17 s) and the Automatic feeder (77 +/- 29 s). Birds preferred eating from the <b>Tube</b> <b>feeder</b> probably due to the absence of the partition grid above the feeder plate...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of group size and diet form on performance and feeding behavior of weaned pigs and to determine an optimal number of pigs per feeding space for pellets or meal provided in a <b>tube</b> <b>feeder.</b> Methods: During six consecutive trials, feeding behavior and performance of groups comprising 30 (G 30), 40 (G 40), or 50 (G 50) weaned pigs were compared for 6 weeks after weaning. A <b>tube</b> <b>feeder</b> was used for all groups, delivering either pellets or meal (trough length 64 cm; two integrated drinkers). Results: Mean ADG was 5 % higher when pigs were fed pellets rather than meal (P =. 06). Whatever the diet, ADG was lower in G 50 than in G 40 (P <. 05). In groups fed meal, ADG was lower in G 40 than in G 30 (P <. 001). Average time using the feeder was 4. 7 minutes per hour for pigs fed pellets, and 7. 3 minutes per hour for pigs fed meal (P =. 003). Overall feeder occupation rates during the day were 139 ± 30 % for meal and 93 ± 21 % for pellets (P =. 01), and during the night, 91 ± 33 % for meal and 54 ± 15 % for pellets (P =. 03), assuming 100 % is four pigs eating simultaneously during the observation period. Implications: Diet form influences the optimal number of pigs per feeder space. For the <b>tube</b> <b>feeders</b> in this study, the recommended maximum number of pigs per feeding space is 6. 5 for pigs fed meal and 10. 2 for pigs fed pellets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the spectral {{properties of the}} Woodstock Gamelan, a 3 ‐octave set of tubular chimes built by Woodstock Percussion in upstate New York. One of the main features of the instrument is expandability, and it includes 75 microtones in the middle octave. The justly tuned instruments of Harry Partch inspired the instrument. The Woodstock Gamelan has two types of aluminum tubes. Racks support the tubes down to Eb 4, and these have a vibraphonelike timbre. The larger <b>hanging</b> <b>tubes</b> go down to G 3, and have larger diameters than the rack tubes. The sound of the <b>hanging</b> <b>tubes</b> {{is similar to that}} of orchestral chimes. The Woodstock Gamelan has five exponentially decaying partials, and their frequency ratios are the same in the low and high registers. The frequency ratios measured were about 1, 2. 69, 5. 15, 8. 38, and 12. 08. The ratios are close to the just ratios of 1, 2. 667, 5. 333, 8. 533, and 12.

5000|$|The feed {{must remain}} clean and dry; {{contaminated}} feed can infect poultry. Damp feed encourages fungal growth. Mycotoxin poisoning, as an example, is [...] "one {{of the most}} common and certainly most under-reported causes of toxicoses in poultry". Diseases can be avoided with proper maintenance of the feed and feeder. A feeder is the device that supplies the feed to the poultry. For privately raised chickens, or chickens as pets, feed can be delivered through jar, trough or <b>tube</b> <b>feeders.</b> The use of poultry feed can also be supplemented with food found through foraging. In industrial agriculture, machinery is used to automate the feeding process, reducing the cost and increasing the scale of farming. For commercial poultry farming, feed serves as the largest cost of the operation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{process is}} multi-stepped: first, pharmaceutical-grade plastic resin is {{vertically}} heat extruded through a circular throat {{to form a}} <b>hanging</b> <b>tube</b> called the parison.

The mould is transferred to the filling zone, or sterile filling space, where filling needles (mandrels) are lowered and used to inflate the plastic to form the container within the mould. Following {{the formation of the}} container, the mandrel is used to fill the container with liquid. Following filling the mandrels are retracted and a secondary top mould seals the container. All actions take place inside a sterile shrouded chamber inside the machine. The product is then discharged to a non-sterile area for labeling, packaging and distribution.|$|R
50|$|Clivia shares common {{features}} {{with the other}} members of the subfamily Amaryllidoideae. Individual flowers have three sepals and three petals, all very similar (although the sepals are typically narrower than the petals) and collectively called tepals. In Clivia the tepals are fused at the base to form a tube, although this may be very short. The flower varies in shape from an open cup to a narrow <b>hanging</b> <b>tube.</b> In the species the flowers are mainly in shades of yellow through orange to red. The flowers are arranged in umbels (i.e. the flower-stalks or pedicels radiate from a single point); each umbel has a long stalk or peduncle. Several bracts subtend the umbels. Each flower has six stamens and an inferior ovary (i.e. one which is below the tepals) made up of three locules. The stamens have long filaments and anthers which are free to move on their filaments. The style is longer than the tepals, ending in a short three-part stigma.|$|R

Risk factors {{and the likelihood of}} the presence of this agent in these flocks were determined. Management practices, such as cleaning and disinfection, feeding, drinkers, and litter treatments, were assessed. Results were evaluated using Odds Ratio (OR) test, and their significance was tested by Fisher’s test (p< 0. 05). A Campylobacter prevalence of 81. 8 % was found in the broiler flocks (18 / 22), and within positive flocks, it varied between 85 and 100 %. Campylobacter incidence among sample types was homogenous, being 81. 8 % in cecal droppings, 80. 9 % in feces, and 80. 4 % in cloacal swabs (230). Flocks fed by automatic feeding systems presented higher incidence of Campylobacter as compared to those fed by <b>tube</b> <b>feeders.</b> Litter was reused in 63. 6 % of the farm, and, despite the lack of statistical significance, there was higher likelihood of Campylobacter incidence when litter was reused.

40|$|Animals {{are confronted}} with {{potential}} stressors at zoos compared to in the wild, such as visitors and lack of environmental stimulation. This study included two projects conducted on the drills at Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna where I investigated: 1) the effect of visual barriers on the behaviour of the drills and if the visual barriers can moderate the visitor effect on the drills and 2) how outdoor-only access together with feeding enrichment (frozen fruit and <b>tube</b> <b>feeders)</b> affects the behaviour of the drills. 1 / 0 - sampling method was used when observing the behaviours of the drills with 1 minute-intervals. Resting/Sleeping increased, while social agonistic behaviour and stereotypies decreased with visual barriers. A moderated visitor effect was shown in resting/sleeping and social affiliative behaviour in the drills with visual barriers. However, social agonistic behaviour and visitor interaction were still affected by visitors after {{the installation of the}} visual barriers, implying that the drills still find visitors stressful to some extent and that further alterations on the observation area viewing the indoor enclosure is recommended for the welfare of the drills. With outdoor-only access together with feeding enrichment, locomotion, foraging/eating and body-shaking increased, while resting/sleeping, social affiliative and agonistic behaviour, stereotypies, visitor interaction, scratching and self-grooming decreased. This suggests that outdoor-only access and feeding enrichment improve the behaviour of the drills and would be a valid option during summer season for the drills at Parken Zoo. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of two cleaning and disinfection programs on broiler performance and on the microbiological status of the facilities. This trial was an observational study of comparative character. Two experiments were conducted, with 960 birds each. Both experiments were carried out in a positive-pressure broiler house. Broilers were distributed in pens equipped with a bell drinker and a <b>tube</b> <b>feeder</b> each. In the first experiment, new wood shavings were used as litter material, and in the second, reused wood shavings were used. Two treatments with 16 replicates of 30 birds each were evaluated. The regular treatment consisted of dry and wet organic matter removal, followed by washing. The European treatment consisted of dry organic matter removal, humidification, washing with water under high pressure, detergent application, rinsing, and application of two combined disinfectants: glutaraldehyde 250 g/L + formaldehyde 185 g/L; p-chlor-m-cresol 210 g/L. Biosecurity measures were adopted during daily management tasks to prevent cross contamination between treatments. The effectiveness of the treatments was evaluated by microbiological analysis performed before and after treatment applications, as well as by broiler performance results. Live performance results were similar between both treatments when broilers were reared on new litter. When reused word-shavings were used as litter material, the European treatment promoted better broiler performance. The European treatment was more effective than the regular treatment in reducing total microbial counts in the facilities when reused wood shavings were used as litter material, and positively influenced broiler performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} for {{the first}} time a new lithofacies that formed in the passage zone during the construction of pahoehoe lava-fed deltas in the north and NE coastal areas of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Atlantic Ocean). These lavafed deltas, which are Pliocene in age, present similar lithofacies associations to those previously described in the literature, except for two distinct features: low abundance of hyaloclastites and a new lithofacies in the passage zone. This new lithofacies, which we propose to name ‘polygonal <b>feeder</b> <b>tubes</b> filled with hydroclasts’, comprises metre-scale lava <b>feeder</b> <b>tubes</b> with decimetre-scale coherent poorly vesicular and aphanitic rinds of polygonal morphology, filled with closely packed hydroclasts generated in situ.

50|$|Seed feeders {{are mainly}} {{squirrel}} proof, tube-like or hopper. Due {{to the need}} of keeping squirrels away from the bird food, manufacturers have created different defense mechanisms that may deter squirrels from getting close to the seed. Some seed feeders come with weight sensitive technology which shuts off the access to the seed ports whenever a heavy weight is detected (as most squirrels are heavier than birds). Birds can still feed as they weigh less and the ports remain open under their weight. Other seed feeders {{are designed to be}} mounted on poles as it is believed that squirrels reach seed feeders more easily from trees than from poles. The simplest type of squirrel proof feeder is a tube-like feeder surrounded by a metal cage. These feeders also offer protection from larger and more aggressive birds. <b>Tube</b> seed <b>feeders</b> are primarily made of clear plastic tubes with plastic or metal caps, bases and perches.

Two regimes of nozzle operation were identified, depending on the environmental pressure. Near sea-level conditions, unsteady gas-dynamic effects associated with the mass of air contained in the nozzle increase the impulse as much as 72 % for the largest nozzle tested over the baseline case of a plain tube. Near vacuum conditions, the nozzles quasi-steadily expand the flow, increasing the impulse as much as 43 % for the largest nozzle tested over the baseline case of a plain tube.
