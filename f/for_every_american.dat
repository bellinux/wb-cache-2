2500|$|The {{political}} ideas {{during the time}} of assimilation policy are known by many Indians as the progressive era, but more commonly known as the assimilation era.(1890–1928). [...] The progressive era was characterized by a resolve to emphasize the importance of dignity and independence in the modern industrialized world. [...] This idea is applied to Native Americans in a quote from Indian Affairs Commissioner John Oberly: [...] " [...] must be imbued with the exalting egotism of American civilization so that he will say ‘I’ instead of ‘We’, and ‘This is mine’ instead of ‘This is ours’." [...] Progressives also had a faith in the knowledge of experts. [...] This was a dangerous idea to have when an emerging science was concerned with ranking races based on moral capabilities and intelligence. [...] Indeed, the idea of an inferior Indian race made it into the courts. [...] The progressive era thinkers also wanted to look beyond legal definitions of equality to create a realistic concept of fairness. [...] Such a concept was thought to include a reasonable income, decent working conditions, as well as health and leisure <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>American.</b> [...] These ideas {{can be seen in the}} decisions of the Supreme Court during the assimilation era.|$|E

[...] The magazine stated that Grillo's book can be as [...] "perceptive as his high-octane reportage". The Kirkus Reviews noted that the book emphasizes the [...] "chilling account of the murderous growth of Mexican drug cartels", and concluded that El Narco is a [...] "valuable contribution to {{the literature of the}} Drug War". The weekly television show known as Dan Rather Reports, that airs on HDNet, noted that El Narco is [...] "riveting, authoritative reporting from {{the front lines of the}} Mexican drug wars". It argued that the book shows how the Mexican drug war has [...] "explosive potential consequences <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>American,</b> and Ioan Grillo's book shows you why". The West Australian said that El Narco is an essential reading for those wishing to understand [...] "how a violent criminal insurgency can take root in an advanced country with a trillion-dollar economy". But, it said that the book is not [...] "for the faint hearted". According to the newspaper, the book engulfs an account of the [...] "rivers of blood in which its citizens are drowning", since Mexico's drug war [...] "is a case study in the way brutal mafia capitalism has morphed into a criminal insurgency, the like of which is spreading 'like bushfire' in the Americas".|$|E

Over this sea the islanders long asserted a jurisdiction, exceeding that which reason concedes to any power on the highway of nations, and which frequently led to conflicts that caused an expenditure of blood and treasure, utterly disproportioned to the advantages that can ever arise from the maintenance of a useless and abstract right.

50|$|Researchers {{commonly}} cite deinstitutionalization, or the emptying {{of state}} mental {{hospitals in the}} mid-twentieth century, as a direct cause {{of the rise of}} mentally ill people in prisons. In the 2010 study “More mentally ill persons are in jails and prisons than hospitals: a survey of the states,” researchers noted, at least in part due to deinstitutionalization, it is increasingly difficult to find beds for mentally ill people who need hospitalization. Using data collected by the Department of Health and Human Services, they determined there was one psychiatric bed <b>for</b> <b>every</b> 3,000 <b>Americans,</b> compared to one <b>for</b> <b>every</b> 300 <b>Americans</b> in 1955. They also noted increased percentages of mentally ill people in prisons throughout the 1970s and 1980s and found a strong correlation between the amount of mentally ill persons in a state’s jails and prisons and how much money that state spends on mental health services. In the book Criminalizing the Seriously Mentally Ill: The Abuse of Jails As Mental Hospitals, researchers note that while deinstitutionalization was carried out with good intentions, it was not accompanied with alternate avenues for mental health treatment for those with serious mental illnesses. According to the authors, Community Mental Health Centers focused their limited resources on individuals with less serious mental illnesses, federal training funds for mental health professionals resulted in lots more psychiatrists in wealthy areas but not in low-income areas, and a policy that made individuals eligible for federal programs and benefits only after they’d been discharged from state mental hospitals unintentionally incentivized discharging patients without follow-up.|$|R
