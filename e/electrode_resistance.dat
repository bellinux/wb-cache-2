Advantages of primary batteries with aqueous electrolyte over lithium ion batteries include their eco friendliness and the ease of fabrication. A flexible zinc-carbon battery using single-walled carbon nanotubes as current was reported by Hiraral in 2010; later in 2013 one with conductive polymer and cheaper multiwalled carbon nanotubes was published by Mitra. Et. al. Binders were used to maintain the flexibility and integrity of electrodes, and the carbon nanotubes dramatically reduced <b>electrode</b> <b>resistance.</b> The primary alkaline battery is more durable than conventional zinc-carbon under heavy load. An alkaline battery uses MnO2 as the active material along with zinc anode and KOH is used as an electrolyte here. A flexible alkaline cell offers several challenges because compared to zinc-carbon cells using weak acidic or neutral electrolytes, KOH is more basic and corrosive. Gaikwad first proposed an alkaline battery using nylon mesh [...] and more recently Wang and Mitra [...] reported an alkaline cell using. A rechargeable flexible alkaline battery has also been reported by the same group.|$|E

The focus-one protocol is a new method for estimating single <b>electrode</b> grounding <b>resistances</b> by measuring the resistance between a single electrode in an ERT array and all the remaining electrodes connected in parallel. For large arrays, the measured resistance is dominated by the grounding <b>resistance</b> of the <b>electrode</b> under test, the focus electrode.

Here we studied the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-YSZ electrodes as a function of Ni content, water concentration and dc bias for WRR and HOR under SOEC and SOFC modes, respectively. The activity of Ni-YSZ cermet increases significantly with the increase of YSZ content due to the enhanced three phase boundaries (TPB). The electrode activity for the WRR and in less degree for the HOR increases with the increase of steam concentration. The <b>electrode</b> polarization <b>resistance,</b> RE, for the WRR increases with the dc bias, while in the case of HOR, RE decreases with the dc bias, demonstrating that kinetically the WRR and HOR is not reversible on the Ni-YSZ cermet electrodes under SOFC and SOEC operation modes.
