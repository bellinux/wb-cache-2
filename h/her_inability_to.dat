With Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and (in the latter 2 games) Cream, she frees animals from inside Eggman's robots {{to keep him}} from building an empire.

5|$|Phineas and Ferb's {{elaborate}} backyard cirque is {{a parody}} of Cirque du Soleil, a real-life Canadian traveling company which performs circus arts and street entertainment. The scene where Candace jumps onto the stage and sings about her hardships, mainly concerning <b>her</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> successfully tattle on her brothers, references a scene in the film Adventures in Babysitting (1987) in which Elisabeth Shue's character sings about her hardships in a similar manner.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Melanie was {{primarily}} negative; critics expressed disapproval of {{her decision to}} support her boyfriend instead of enrolling in medical school. Media commentators also panned the character's representation as a mother, such as <b>her</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> properly care for her stepson. On the other hand, fans responded positively to Melanie and felt drawn to her relationship with Derwin. Mowry's performance received positive feedback from critics, who agreed that the role displayed her maturity as an actress. She received nominations for two NAACP Image Awards and a Teen Choice Award for the role.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{chapters}} expound on how {{the arrangement}} came to be: the children's stepmother, Parwana, grew up as the less-favored child to her beautiful twin sister Masooma. One day, {{in a flash of}} jealousy, she caused Masooma to suffer a debilitating injury that resulted in paraplegia. Parwana subsequently spent several years caring for her sister until the latter asked her to help her commit suicide and to then marry Saboor. Their older brother, Nabi, left to work for Mr. Wahdati, a wealthy man in Kabul, and became infatuated with his wife, Nila. After Nila expressed dismay about <b>her</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> have children, Nabi arranged for Pari to be sold to the couple.|$|E

When it is revealed that Bart has been cheating by using Lego bricks as hotel pieces, Bart threatens Lisa and Homer assaults him. Marge and Lisa try to pry them apart.

With help from an edible taffy-like substance and a robot, the entire Simpson family is arrested for causing a domestic disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Afonso III of Portugal was not {{the eldest}} son, {{therefore}} heraldic practices stated he should not take his father's arms without adding a personal variation. Before becoming king, Afonso was married to Matilda II of Boulogne but <b>her</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> provide him with a royal heir led Afonso to divorce her, in 1253. He then married Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X of Castile. It {{is more likely that}} it was this family connection with Castile (his mother was also Castilian) that justified the new heraldic addition to the royal arms—a red bordure charged with an undetermined number of yellow castles—rather than the definitive conquest of the Algarve and its Moorish fortresses, considering that the number of castles was only fixed in the late 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>her</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> take a wicket in the WNCL, Ebsary was {{retained}} in the national team {{and in the next}} five months of international cricket, she did not bowl a ball. Ahead of the 2009 World Cup, the Australians headed to New Zealand for a Rose Bowl series, Ebsary was left out of the first two ODIs against New Zealand, but was recalled for the next two matches at Seddon Park in Hamilton. She scored 30 from 47 balls in the first match before making her ODI top-score of 86 the next day. Batting at No. 3, she struck nine boundaries and faced only 76 balls, scoring at faster than a run-a-ball. This helped set up Australia's 4/307 and they went on to win by 44 runs, their second consecutive victory. The teams returned to Australia where Ebsary made her T20 international debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground. She did not bat or bowl in a rain-affected Australian win.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 14–15 April 1809, contact was {{maintained}} with the French squadron by Recruit, Captain Charles John Napier firing on the rearmost ship Hautpoult and coming under fire from the French stern-chasers, guns situated {{in the rear of}} a ship to fire on pursuers. Shortly after 04:00, Pompee came within range and began to fire her bow-chasers, the chase continuing westwards into the Caribbean Sea. Frustrated by <b>her</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> escape Recruit, Hautpoult eventually turned and fired a broadside at 10:45, causing severe damage but failing to dissuade Napier, who immediately counter-attacked. Hautpoults manoeuvre caused her to lose ground to her pursuers and throughout the day the squadrons exchanged shots, neither causing significant damage but the French being driven deeper into British held waters and unable to drive off their opponents.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few months}} later, on 14 December 1861, Albert died at Windsor Castle. During his final illness, Alice {{remained}} at his bedside. Alice sent for the Prince of Wales by telegram, without {{the knowledge of the}} Queen, who refused to notify him because she blamed him for Albert's death. The Queen was distraught by her husband's death, and the court entered a period of intense mourning. Alice became her mother's unofficial secretary, and for the next six months, the physical representation of the monarch. Through her passed the Queen's official papers to and from her government ministers, while the Queen secluded herself from all public life. Alice was aided in this task by her younger sister Princess Louise. Although Princess Helena, Louise's elder sister, would normally have been selected to assist, <b>her</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> go long without crying was held against her.|$|E
5|$|Recalling <b>her</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> {{help the}} wounded people whom she saw during the Second World War, Hsu {{decided to become}} a nurse. As she was overaged at 47, she wrote a request to the chief matron of the Nursing Council in London. Touched by Hsu's sincerity and dedication, her {{application}} was accepted. She spent eight years in England doing nursing and another eight in Paraguay {{as a member of the}} German charity group Bruderhof, to start hospitals and homes for the aged there. In her mid-50s, she decided to return home to Penang to be with her mother. In Malaysia, she assisted her brother in starting the Assunta Foundation for the Poor in Ipoh. She also played a key role in the startup of three homes for the elderly and two homes for young girls and neglected children in Ipoh.|$|E
50|$|In New York {{she became}} matron of the Wilson Industrial School for Girls {{where she worked}} with poor, largely {{immigrant}} families living in the east side tenement district of the city. Concerned with <b>her</b> charges <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> perform even domestic tasks, she sought to make her lessons instructive and enjoyable.|$|R
60|$|These {{things at}} least were certain: Ayesha had {{achieved}} {{the secret of}} an existence so enduring that for all human purposes it might be called unending. Within certain limitations--such as <b>her</b> utter <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> foresee the future--undoubtedly also, she was endued with powers {{that can only be}} described as supernatural.|$|R
50|$|Maheeda {{hails from}} Edo State. She was born 22 November 1982 in {{northern}} Nigeria. Maheeda's {{mother died when}} she was at a tender age and she never knew her dad.

She had a daughter at age 14.|$|R
5|$|Rowling {{has contributed}} money {{and support for}} {{research}} and treatment of multiple sclerosis, from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward {{the creation of a}} new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic. In 2010 she donated a further £10million to the centre. For reasons unknown, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers. In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, citing <b>her</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.|$|E
5|$|Ethalion {{took over}} pursuit of Bellone from Melampus, {{and for two}} hours {{maintained}} continuous fire with her bow-chasers on the French ship. Ethalion was faster than her quarry, and she slowly pulled parallel with Bellone during the afternoon, but could not get close enough for a decisive blow. It took another two hours of pursuit before the battered Bellone eventually surrendered. Hoche apart, Bellone had suffered more casualties than any other ship present. To the south of this conflict, the struggling Anson discovered herself in danger when the surviving frigates of the French vanguard swept towards her en masse. Captain Durham was initially confused by their approach {{as he had been}} too distant to witness the action and the French ships flew false British ensigns, but he rapidly realised their true identity and at 16:00 opened fire on Loire. The damaged Anson was severely hampered by <b>her</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> manoeuvre, and so could do nothing when the French ships pulled back and sailed away, except to continue to fire until they were out of range. During the evening, the surviving French frigates gradually pulled away from their pursuers and disappeared into the gathering night, leaving behind four of their squadron, including their flagship, as captives.|$|E

50|$|Her novels {{have been}} disparaged {{for a variety}} of weaknesses...and almost all her plots rely too heavily on coincidence. Her sharp sociological {{observations}} provide valuable insight for students of cultural history, however; in addition, her strengths as a novelist are evident in the detailed, naturalistic portraits of the daily lives of her characters, and in <b>her</b> <b>inability</b> sic <b>to</b> involve the reader in the problems her characters face.|$|R
2500|$|Stein's {{literary}} output was {{a subject}} of amusement for her brother Leo Stein, who characterized her writing as an [...] "abomination". Later detractors of Stein's work deemed her experimentation as the serendipitous result of <b>her</b> alleged <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> communicate through linguistic convention, deficient in the skills required [...] "to deal effectively with language, so that she made her greatest weakness into her most remarkable strength".|$|R

50|$|Intent and studious, but {{a little}} absentminded, Maeve tends to stand out among demons and humans alike. Her quirky habits mark her as someone just {{learning}} the ways of a culture, and <b>her</b> utter <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> lie convincingly adds to the peculiar image. Despite her training, she often forgets what she's meant to be doing among the humans and loses herself in the fun of the moment.|$|R
