5|$|The {{number and}} value of {{contracts}} coming to the station significantly increased during World War II; the 1943–1944 budget {{was the first in}} which industry and government contracts exceeded the station's other income, most notably, its state appropriation. Director Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the Georgia General Assembly had cut the station's appropriation by 40%, but increased support <b>from</b> <b>industry</b> and government eventually compensated for lower state funding. World War II is credited with GTRI's entry into electronics, especially telecommunications and electronic warfare; the electronics and communications work that Director Rosselot attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research. Two of the larger projects were a study on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, and United States Navy–sponsored radar research.|$|E

5|$|World War II {{resulted}} in a dramatic increase of sponsored research, with the 1943–1944 budget being the first in which industry and government contracts exceeded the EES's other income (most notably, its state appropriation). Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the state had cut the station's appropriation by 40 percent, but increased support <b>from</b> <b>industry</b> and government eventually counteracted low state support.

5|$|The game is {{presented}} in black-and-white tones, using lighting, film grain effects and minimal ambient sounds to create an eerie atmosphere often associated with the horror genre. Journalists praised the dark presentation, describing the work as comparable to film noir and German Expressionism. Based on its aesthetics, reviewers classified Limbo {{as an example of}} video games as an art form. Limbo received positive reviews, but its minimal story polarised critics; some critics found the open-ended work to have deeper meaning that tied well with the game's mechanics, while others believed the lack of significant plot and abrupt ending detracted from the game. A common point of criticism from reviewers was that the high cost of the game relative to its short length might deter players from purchasing the title, but some reviews proposed that Limbo had an ideal length. The title was the third-highest selling game on the Xbox Live Arcade service in 2010, generating around $7.5 million in revenue. The title won several awards <b>from</b> <b>industry</b> groups after its release, and was named {{as one of the top}} games for 2010 by several publications. Playdead's next title, Inside, was released in 2016, and revisited many of the same themes presented in Limbo.|$|E
5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts <b>from</b> <b>industry</b> analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E

30|$|Labour market {{outcomes}} of older workers are {{also related to}} {{the condition of the}} local labour market in the <b>industry</b> <b>from</b> which they are displaced. Workers displaced <b>from</b> <b>industries</b> in which the local labour market was structurally declining have worse employment probabilities and wage prospects. In the first 2 years after displacement, employment probabilities for older workers displaced <b>from</b> declining <b>industries</b> are respectively 5 to 8 percentage points below those of older workers displaced <b>from</b> better performing <b>industries,</b> whereas wages are 2 to 3 percentage points lower, which effect persists in the long run. In general, older workers are not more often displaced <b>from</b> declining <b>industries</b> than prime-age workers, but within the group of older workers, the ones displaced <b>from</b> declining <b>industries</b> perform worse. In terms of employment outcomes, prime-age workers are less sensitive to the situation in the local labour market in the <b>industry</b> <b>from</b> which they were displaced. Our results suggest that job- and sector-specific factors are important for understanding the more vulnerable position of older workers after job loss.|$|R
