40|$|The study {{examined}} the financial feasibility and impacts of livestock management models found around Mt. Mutis forest in Timor Island of Indonesia. Data was collected through interviewing 40 communities around the forest. There were two livestock management models around the forest, the first model was livestock management which raise livestock in the cattle pen, and the second model was <b>livestock</b> management which <b>graze</b> <b>livestock</b> in the forest. This study found that both livestock management models were financially feasible. However, if commercial cost of workers was counted, the livestock management model which raise livestock in the cattle pen was financially not feasible while livestock management model which <b>graze</b> <b>livestock</b> in the forest was financially feasible. Livestock management model which <b>graze</b> <b>livestock</b> in the forest however had negative impacts on the regeneration of trees.

25|$|The {{arrival of}} 600 colonists from Norfolk Island between 1807 and 1813 {{increased}} tensions as they established farms along the River Derwent and {{east and west}} of Launceston, occupying 10 percent of Van Diemen's Land. By 1814 12,700ha of land was under cultivation, with 5000 cattle and 38,000 sheep. The Norfolk Islanders used violence to stake their claim on the land, attacking Aboriginal camps at night, slaughtering parents and abducting the orphaned children as their servants. The attacks prompted retaliatory raids on settlers' cattle herds in the southeast. Between 1817 and 1824 the colonial population rose from 2000 to 12,600 and in 1823 alone more than 1000 land grants totalling 175,704ha were made to new settlers; by that year Van Diemen's Land's sheep population had reached 200,000 and the so-called Settled Districts accounted for 30 per cent of the island's total land area. The rapid colonisation transformed traditional kangaroo hunting grounds into farms with <b>grazing</b> <b>livestock</b> as well as fences, hedges and stone walls, while police and military patrols were increased to control the convict farm labourers.|$|E
25|$|Early human {{settlements}} were dependent on proximity to water and, {{depending on the}} lifestyle, other natural resources used for subsistence, such as populations of animal prey for hunting and arable land for growing crops and <b>grazing</b> <b>livestock.</b> But humans have a great capacity for altering their habitats by means of technology, through irrigation, urban planning, construction, transport, manufacturing goods, deforestation and desertification, but {{human settlements}} continue to be vulnerable to natural disasters, especially those placed in hazardous locations and characterized by lack of quality of construction. Deliberate habitat alteration is often done {{with the goals of}} increasing material wealth, increasing thermal comfort, improving the amount of food available, improving aesthetics, or improving ease of access to resources or other human settlements. With the advent of large-scale trade and transport infrastructure, proximity to these resources has become unnecessary, and in many places, these factors are no longer a driving force behind the growth and decline of a population. Nonetheless, the manner in which a habitat is altered is often a major determinant in population change.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 1820s the Van Diemen's Land Company created a track or stock route from Deloraine to Emu Bay (now Burnie) that ran via Chudleigh and Mole Creek.

The company built facilities, including a store, in Chudleigh. Europeans settled the area west of Deloraine from the early 1800s, and cattle were being grazedillegallyin the Chudleigh area from as early as 1823. John Badcock Gardiner, who probably named Chudleigh after the village with the same name in Devon, England, was granted [...] in the area after arriving in Tasmania in 1829 with his family.

30|$|Pastoralists {{working on}} the private ranch contended with strict herding conventions. Of {{importance}} to respondents was that ranch managers made all decisions independent of herders, including where and when to move herds, where and when to <b>graze</b> <b>livestock,</b> and when to treat for ticks or other diseases. While herders had decision-making roles in, for example, choosing exact routes to take to reach grazing areas prescribed by managers, they noted that this amounted to little autonomy. In cases where herders were resistant to managers’ instructions, reasons were practical. Often herders were instructed to <b>graze</b> <b>livestock</b> in areas known for high wildlife density, for example, and herders rarely felt that the risks were worthwhile. Given that employees were animal caretakers rather than owners, herders unanimously {{felt that there was}} little incentive to risk injury or death to graze in wildlife-rich areas, even if those areas held more nutritious or abundant grasses.|$|R
