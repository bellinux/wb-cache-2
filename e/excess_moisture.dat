5|$|Play {{began after}} the tea break, and Australia needed to score 317 {{in the last}} session if they wanted victory. The pitch played very slowly due to the <b>excess</b> <b>moisture,</b> which meant the ball slowed {{significantly}} upon hitting the ground surface. As Australia were not looking to chase the runs, {{there was no need}} for run-saving fieldsmen, so Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. In the first half hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Jack Young replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp and falling for six to leave Australia at 1/10. Australia batted for another two hours without further loss, to reach 1/92 from 61 overs before the match was finally ended after a series of periodic rain interruptions. Johnson had an unhappy game, scoring only seven runs in two innings, dropping a catch and taking match figures of 0/93.|$|E
5|$|When Bill Edrich {{came to the}} crease, Bradman advised Lindwall not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, {{fearing that}} it would be {{interpreted}} as retaliation for Edrich's bouncing of Lindwall in the first innings and lead to a negative media and crowd reaction. Although Lindwall did not retaliate, Miller did so with four consecutive bouncers, earning the ire of the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop, before apologising to Edrich. England reached 3/174, a lead of 316, at the end of day three, but declared on the fifth morning after the fourth day was washed out. Bradman chose the light roller and play was supposed to begin after lunch. However, play did not begin until after tea and the pitch played very slowly because of the <b>excess</b> <b>moisture.</b> With Australia not looking to chase the runs, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions.

5|$|Play {{finally began}} after the tea, and the pitch played very slowly {{because of the}} <b>excess</b> <b>moisture.</b> As Australia had no {{intention}} of chasing the runs, England captain Norman Yardley often installed seven men in close catching positions. In the first half-hour, the tourists showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Johnson then fell for six to leave Australia at 1/10. Bradman came to the crease and played 11 balls without scoring while Morris scored two streaky fours from Bedser. Yardley used his spinners for an hour, while Morris and Bradman made little effort to score. For 105 minutes, Morris stayed at one end and Bradman at the other; neither looked to rotate the strike by taking singles. The Australian skipper faced only eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled when his partner wanted a single that he sent him back. Thereafter, the tourists batted steadily and defensively to ensure a draw. They ended at 1/92 from 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, with 35 maidens; this was the slowest innings run rate for the series to date. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century during the Test series. The match finally ended after a series of periodic rain interruptions.|$|E

25|$|When {{the pasta}} leaves the dies {{it has the}} {{moisture}} content of 31%. The final desired moisture of the dried pasta is about 12% which helps the pasta to be hard and retain its shape and have a long storage life. Drying process is slightly different for long and short pastas, but in general, pasta is exposed to hot air to lose the <b>excess</b> <b>moisture</b> in two stages. “Pre-drying” starts immediately after extrusion where the pasta hardens on the outside but still soft on the inside. It takes one tenth of the whole drying time, and {{one third of the}} <b>excess</b> <b>moisture</b> is lost in this stage. “Final drying” removes most of the moisture and gives the pasta a firm shape. This stage consists of two phases: in the first phase product exposed to high temperature and humidity and in the second phase temperature drops quickly and cold air is provided for stabilizing. Stabilizing help the remaining moisture to distribute evenly through the pasta and prevents cracking.|$|E

500|$|At the Beecher's facility, their {{process for}} cheese {{manufacturing}} is multi-staged. Thousands {{of gallons of}} milk are hose-fed from delivery trucks into the manufacturing area, where it is heated to complete the pasteurization of the milk. The heated milk is processed into a stainless steel trough, and the temperature further increased, while the first live cheese cultures and rennet, a coagulant, {{are added to the}} developing mixture. According to Amir Rosenblatt, a cheesemaker at Beecher's, the heating and cheese temperatures used in their cooking process are tightly controlled through the sustainable technology of steam power. [...] "A variation of half a degree [...] can change the flavor of the cheese," [...] he said. Cheesemakers use stainless steel [...] "rakes" [...] to then gather the milk mixture, before allowing it to settle briefly, at which point the cheese is cut repeatedly by hand until it achieves a yogurt-like texture and substance. This process is repeated often, until a desired consistency is reached. The mixture is then drawn away to a new trough where most of the remaining water and whey is drained from the cheese. While the whey is continually pulled from the cheese, cheesemakers constantly separate the cheese by hand into smaller and small stacks of cheese curds, which form as the whey is removed. To complete the curding, a large amount of salt is added to cure the cheese and draw still more whey from it. The curds are finally cut into portions, filled into cheese molds, stacked on top of each other, and the remaining <b>excess</b> <b>moisture</b> is forced from the cheese with a constant [...] of pressure for at least 24 hours, before the finished cheese is stored to age. For every 10 pounds (10 kilograms) of milk and whey, Beecher's will typically create 1 pound (1 kilogram) of finished cheese.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the bond strength of ceramic restorations luted using a self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX Unicem, 3 M ESPE) under different dentin conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the experimental groups, ceramic restorations were luted to bovine incisors with RelyX Unicem under the following conditions: [Dry dentin]: surface was dried using air stream for 15 s; [Moist dentin]: <b>excess</b> dentin <b>moisture</b> was removed with absorbent paper; [Bonding agent]: Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray) self-etching adhesive system was previously applied to dentin. In the Control group, cementation was done using an etch-and-rinse adhesive (Excite DSC) and Variolink II resin cement (Ivoclar Vivadent). Photoactivation of the resin cements was performed with UltraLume LED 5 unit (Ultradent). The restorations (n= 5 per group) were sectioned into beams and microtensile testing was carried out. Data were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey's test (p< 0. 05). Failure modes were classifed under Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) (x 120 magnifcation). RESULTS: The bond strength was dependent on the moisture status of the dentin. Bond strength in the "dry dentin group" was signifcantly lower than that of all other groups, which showed similar results. A predominance of mixed failures was detected for the control group, while a predominance of adhesive failures was observed for the "bonding agent" and "dry dentin" groups. The "moist dentin" group presented predominantly cohesive failures within the luting material. The previous application of a self-etching adhesive showed no signifcant effect. CONCLUSIONS: Only <b>excess</b> dentin <b>moisture</b> should be removed for the cementation of ceramic restorations with self-adhesive resin cements...|$|R
