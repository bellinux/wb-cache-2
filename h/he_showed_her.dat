500|$|Andrić felt he {{was destined}} to become a writer. He began writing in {{secondary}} school, but received little encouragement from his mother. He recalled that when <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> {{one of his first}} works, she replied: [...] "Did you write this? What did you do that for?" [...] Andrić published his first two poems in 1911 in a journal called Bosanska vila (Bosnian Fairy), which promoted Serbo-Croat unity. At the time, he was still a secondary school student. Prior to World War I, his poems, essays, reviews, and translations appeared in journals such as Vihor (Whirlwind), Savremenik (The Contemporary), Hrvatski pokret (The Croatian Movement), and Književne novine (Literary News). One of Andrić’s favorite literary forms was lyrical reflective prose, and many of his essays and shorter pieces are prose poems. The historian Wayne S. Vucinich describes Andrić’s poetry from this period as [...] "subjective and mostly melancholic". Andrić’s translations of August Strindberg, Walt Whitman, and a number of Slovene authors also appeared around this time.|$|E
500|$|Her parents, nicknamed 'Ernie' and 'Ducky,' {{were first}} cousins who {{married at the}} {{instigation}} of their common grandmother, Queen Victoria. The marriage was an unhappy one from the start. Princess Victoria Melita was eighteen {{at the time of}} Elisabeth's birth. She was fond of Elisabeth, but found it hard to compete with Ernst's devotion to their daughter. Ernst was convinced even before Elisabeth could speak that he alone could understand her. At the age of six months, she was scheduled to move to a new nursery and her father 'consulted' her on her color preferences. He claimed that she made 'happy little squeals' when <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> a particular shade of lilac material. Ernst then decorated her nursery in shades of lilac. He later had a playhouse built for his daughter that stood in its own garden. Adults were forbidden to enter [...] "much to the frustration of royal nurses and tutors, who could be seen pacing up and down impatiently outside as they waited for their high-spirited young charges to stop their games and emerge." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{drifting}} {{with college}} friends {{through a few}} jobs for which she did not feel she was well-suited, Marjory Stoneman met Kenneth Douglas in 1914. She {{was so impressed with}} his manners and surprised at the attention <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> that she married him within three months. He portrayed himself as a newspaper editor, and was 30years her senior, but the marriage quickly failed when it became apparent he was a con artist. The true extent of his duplicity Marjory did not entirely reveal, despite her honesty in all other manners. Marjory may have unwittingly married Douglas while he was already married to another woman. While he spent six months in jail for passing a bad check, she remained faithful to him. However, his scheme to scam her absent father out of money worked in Marjory's favor when it attracted Frank Stoneman's attention. Marjory's uncle persuaded her to move to Miami and for the marriage to end. In the fall of 1915, Marjory Stoneman Douglas left New England to be reunited with her father, whom she had not seen since her parents' separation when she was six years old. Shortly before that time, her father had remarried Lillius ("Lilla") Eleanor Shine, whose great-great grandfather was Thomas Jefferson. (Her grandfather was Francis W. Eppes.) Marjory later wrote that Lilla Shine [...] "remained my first and best friend all my life in Florida." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the RKO board {{approved}} the Kong test, Cooper decided a blonde would provide {{contrast to the}} gorilla's dark pelt. Dorothy Jordan, Jean Harlow, and Ginger Rogers were considered, but the role finally went to Wray who wore a blonde wig in the film and was inspired more by Cooper's enthusiasm than the script to accept the role. According to her autobiography, On the Other Hand, Wray recounts that Cooper had told her he planned to star her opposite the [...] "tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood". She assumed he meant Clark Gable until <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> a picture of Kong climbing the Empire State Building.|$|E
