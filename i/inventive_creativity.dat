[...] Ted Gioia, in his book West Coast Jazz, writes of the album that, [...] "In terms of playing style, Getz meshed well with Manne and the other musicians on the date ... and his playing throughout the album exemplifies the tasteful, <b>inventive</b> <b>creativity</b> {{that has long been}} a hallmark of Getz's recordings." ...|$|E

His later works {{contributed to the}} development of the Sonoran Desert regional vocabulary yet maintained the same principles of his earlier work. His work was a bridge between the California art's and crafts architects and the desert modernists. He also travelled the world extensively for his World Architecture lecture course. It was attended by over 12,000 students. His travels drooped into the western architectural design vocabulary forms and world architectural influences. The Western Savings and Loan branch bank in Phoenix, Arizona reflects his <b>inventive</b> <b>creativity.</b> Straub said, [...] "We created that roof form to hide the mechanical units, it was a smashing Idea." [...] This project was used for his widely utilized architectural text Design Process and Communications. This roof form swept across the architectural landscape and is arguably the first use of this Polynesian inspired roof form in a modern western structure.|$|E

Housed {{within the}} Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, the Lemelson Center aims to document, interpret, and {{disseminate}} information about invention and innovation. The Center encourages <b>inventive</b> <b>creativity</b> in young people, and fosters {{an appreciation for}} the central role of invention and innovation {{in the history of the}} United States. [...] The Center frequently provides a multi-year focus on some aspect of how invention has influenced American society, such as its 2015 [...] "Places of Invention" [...] theme. Programs include a yearly symposium, presentations and guest speakers within and outside the National Museum of American History, and often the publication of a book detailing aspects of the topical focus. The Center also provides free curricular material to classrooms throughout the United States; organizes traveling museum exhibitions (such as [...] "Invention at Play"); provides research opportunities and fellowships for scholars; and finds, obtains, and processes archival collections related to invention on behalf of the museum's Archives Center. These collections consist of the papers and materials documenting the work of past and current American inventors.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of social networks {{within and across}} cities influences urban creativity {{and the potential for}} new knowledge creation. We propose that cities achieve greater <b>inventive</b> <b>creativity</b> when there is (1) a short average social distance among inventors in a city, and (2) those inventors are highly clustered. A short average social distance allows knowledge to circulate quickly across a larger pool of knowledge sources; clustering promotes trust, cooperation, and a more effective use of the acquired knowledge. At the same time, a short average social distance between a city’s inventors and knowledge sources outside the city will enrich and renew a city’s inventive network by facilitating faster access to fresh external knowledge. We find evidence to support these propositions in a longitudinal study of the inventive productivity of 331 U. S. citie...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{creative}} drama {{in the classroom}} is a student-focused process where experiential learning can be fostered and developed within any given curriculum. It can help students to develop divergent thinking skills, <b>inventive</b> <b>creativity,</b> and cognitive thinking skills, and it can stimulate the development of oral and written communication skills. Used in a social context, creative drama can show the student the way to be empathetic to the needs of others and consequently the student will be better able to form a value judgment. Fostering intuition, creative drama helps the student to relegate inner strengths of "knowing " into concrete action. Creative drama is a holistic approach to academic learning. Non-threatening classroom exercises can provide a genuine feeling of surprise and fun in the classroom and help students to become aware of the utilization of their imagination. In one exercise, student...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the intriguing but only sparsely explored phenomenon of “leisure time invention, ” where the main underlying idea for the new product or process occurred when the inventor was away from the workplace. We add to previous research by focussing on the <b>inventive</b> <b>creativity</b> of the individual researcher, and reassessing the image of researchers inventing during unpaid time – who have often been dispatched as “hobbyists”. Based on the responses from a survey of 3, 000 German inventors, we test hypotheses on {{the conditions under which}} leisure time invention is likely to arise, and how valuable it is. We find that the incidence of leisure time invention is positively related to high workplace inventive productivity, and exposure to a variety of knowledge inputs. Leisure time inventions are more frequently observed in conceptual-based technologies than science-based technologies, and in smaller R&D projects. The average value of leisure time inventions exceeds the value of work time inventions. ...|$|E

Using specific examples of interpretations of literary works we show that productive research assignments encourage students' creative and <b>inventive</b> expression, <b>creativity,</b> imagination and criticality and enable them to develop {{in accordance with their}} personality, individual preferences and abilities. In the examples of their use in problem solving, we determine how productive research tasks are conducive to gifted students who need to learn through problem solving and school work and to experience learning as a challenge. They present the basis for independent research, which allows gifted students to express their own creativity and the need to acquire new, challenging knowledge, and represent a powerful motivational tool that teachers can use in order to further develop their talent. Creative application of the productive research tasks in teaching Serbian language and literature is the possibility that the education of gifted students is not treated as elitist question, but to transform teaching process into development of giftedness and talent, where the role of the teacher in the teaching process rises {{to the role of the}} mentor...|$|R
