Therefore, the medial axis of the union of these <b>inner</b> <b>balls</b> can be computed more efficiently and robustly than for a general union of balls. Our algorithm requires only the computation of a single Delaunay triangulation which is of complexity O(nlogn), whereas the general algorithm needs two Delaunay triangulations and a power diagram of quadratic complexity {{in the number of}} <b>inner</b> Voronoi <b>balls.</b> Also, our solution yields robust results even without using exact arithmetic, because it avoids the computation of the power diagram of the <b>inner</b> Voronoi <b>balls</b> whose configuration is highly degenerate...|$|R

Upper bounds to the random Schmidt- 2 robustness allow us to construct a particularly simple distillability criterion.

The REBs {{are the most}} widely used mechanical parts in rotating machinery under high load and high rotational speeds.

The defect in rolling elements may lead to serious catastrophic consequences resulting in costly downtime.

The purpose of the mission is experimental verification of the spherical glass retroreflector satellite concept as well as obtaining SLR data for solution of scientific problems in geophysics, geodynamics, and relativity [...] The design of BLITS {{is based on the}} optical Luneburg lens concept. The retroreflector is a multilayer glass sphere; it provides uniform reflection characteristics when viewed within a very wide range of angles, and can provide a cross-section sufficient for observations at low to medium orbit heights. A similar design was already tested on a smaller laser reflector carried on board of the METEOR-3M spacecraft launched on December 10, 2001.The satellite body consists of two outer hemispheres (radius 85.16 mm) made of a low-refraction-index glass and an <b>inner</b> <b>ball</b> lens (radius 53.52 mm) made of a high-refraction-index glass; the two outer hemispheres and the <b>inner</b> <b>ball</b> are glued together, and one of the outer hemispheres is externally coated with a reflective coating, covered with a protective varnish.

The satellite was spinning at a spin period of 5.6 seconds around the axis normal to its orbit plane, allowing laser light to be reflected in short bursts because only half of the satellite is covered in a reflective coating. Being the satellite made of glass, minimum in-flight slowdown of spin rate was expected, as there were no conducting parts where currents interacting with the Earth magnetic field can be induced.The expected operative life was at least 5 years, but the mission was interrupted in 2013 after a collision with space debris.|$|E

Therefore, {{the capacity of the}} large conducting body to accept radio frequency energy is greater than that of the surrounding air. The energy available to the filaments of plasma within the globe will preferentially flow toward the better acceptor. This flow also causes a single filament, from the <b>inner</b> <b>ball</b> to the point of contact, to become brighter and thinner. The filament is brighter because there is more current flowing through it and into the 150 pF capacity, or capacitance, presented by an object, a conducting body, the size of a human.
