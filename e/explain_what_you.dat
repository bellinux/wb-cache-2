6000|$|... "Well, you've come to!" [...] said Clemantiny, eyeing Chester severely. [...] "And now perhaps you'll <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean by fainting away on doorsteps and scaring {{people out}} of their senses." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wer. Yes--you! You know me not, and {{question}} me, [...] And wonder that I answer not--not knowing [...] My inquisitor. <b>Explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would have, [...] And then I'll satisfy yourself, or me. [...] 550 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are pleased}} to be unintelligible," [...] said the great man, with a smile. [...] "Would <b>you</b> mind <b>explaining</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean by 'the yoke'?" ...|$|R
3000|$|Elaborate your weekly {{activities}} in the MOOC by <b>explaining</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> learned. Have you encountered this content earlier in your studies at FOI? (only in 2015 / 2016 and 2016 / 2017) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "We mean to {{keep you}} by us, sir," [...] said Mr. Green on his other side, [...] "until <b>you</b> have <b>explained</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were doing with those papers--what is your {{interest}} in them." ...|$|R
6000|$|At this {{extraordinary}} criticism {{the young man}} looked graver than he had yet {{been able to do}} since the beginning of their acquaintance. He said, presently, [...] "I wish you would <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean by slippery." ...|$|E
60|$|Give {{the meaning}} of these lines, and <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think is Lowell's purpose in the preface from which they are taken. Give the {{substance}} of the corresponding preface to {{the other part of the}} poem, and account for the difference between the two.|$|E
60|$|The letters {{seem all}} very nice--I shall {{have very little}} to say about them, except to <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> observe and have been misunderstood.... Of course my notes shall be sent to you and added to when you see need. But I cannot do it quickly.|$|E
5000|$|Jeff Foster further <b>explains</b> <b>What</b> <b>you</b> are {{is simply}} this open space of {{awareness}} (consciousness, awakeness, Being) in which absolutely {{everything seems to}} come and go, and that space is already at rest; it’s already Home.|$|R
500|$|As {{football}} coach, {{he developed}} a unique offensive scheme called the [...] "Byrd system", which combined elements of the single-wing and double-wing formations. One of Byrd's track and football players, Geary Eppley, said, [...] "He never yelled in practice or at a game... He pointed out mistakes and <b>explained</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did wrong. He took a calm approach. The strongest thing he'd say was 'for cripes sake.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{said the}} Baroness; [...] "at least, I {{should know better}} if <b>you</b> would <b>explain</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean by the Sumurun manner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is very extraordinary, Mr. Thurston," [...] rejoined Julia, whose {{sense of}} womanly propriety {{began to take}} the alarm; [...] "and I must insist on an explanation. Your {{language}} would seem to infer--really, I do not know, what it does NOT seem to infer. Will you have the goodness to <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean by that 'yes?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{go ahead}} with what you was goin' to do," [...] Daughtry grumbled, the rush of events too swift and too hidden for him to comprehend. [...] "An' when you're done with that, I {{just want you to}} <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said about leprosy an' that nigger-boy there. He's my boy, an' you can't pull {{anything}} like that off on him [...] . or me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, Alice, this is {{certainly}} a strange coincidence, that you should know even thus much of a foolish secret that makes me employ this little holiday time, which I have stolen out of a weary life, in a wild-goose chase. But, believe me, you allude to matters that are more {{a mystery to me}} than my affairs appear to be to you. Will you <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would suggest by this badinage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps you {{had better}} <b>explain</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean," [...] Reist said, curtly. [...] "I do not {{understand}} this Western journalism. It is new to me." ...|$|R
40|$|The article <b>explains</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{need to do}} to {{incorporate}} XML directly into your computational science application. The exploration involves the use of a standard parser to automatically build object trees entirely from application-specific classes. This discussion very much focuses on object-oriented programming languages such as Java and Python, but it can work for non-object-oriented languages as well. The ideas in the article provide a glimpse into the Natural XML research project...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{are very}} young, my boy," [...] he said, [...] "very young indeed. Perhaps {{that is my}} fault for not having let you {{see more of the}} world. You have got some very queer ideas into your head. A little too much novel reading lately, eh? I might treat you differently. I might laugh at you and send you out of the room. I won't. I'll tell you what you ask. I'll <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> find so mysterious. The person to whom I have been {{speaking}} is my stockbroker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There can't be {{anything}} impossible in doing it," [...] Godfrey said. [...] "Why, did not Burton disguise himself {{and go with}} a caravan to Mecca and visit the holy places, and that was twenty times as difficult and dangerous. Going along the caravan route of course the difficulty is the language and the Buriats. If one could talk Mongol, or whatever the fellows call their language, {{it would be easy}} sailing; but I own that it is a difficult thing to get along and <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want with people who cannot understand a word you say. I suppose the Buriats speak Russian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} no wrongs from me, madam," [...] said the adept. [...] "You sought one who is little {{grateful}} for such honour. He seeks no one, and only gives responses to those who invite and call upon him. After all, you have but learned a little sooner the evil which you must still be doomed to endure. I hear your servant's step at the door, and will detain your ladyship and Lady Forester no longer. The next packet from the Continent will <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have already partly witnessed. Let it not, if I may advise, pass too suddenly into your sister's hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Teddy, be sensible. Let it pass, and I'll <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> I can. <b>You</b> can't stay here, so what's the use {{of being}} melodramatic?" ...|$|R
40|$|Individual task: Imagine {{you are a}} {{developmental}} engineer in a company specializing in instrumentation for environmental monitoring. The company so far is pursuing development and manufacturing of equipment for chemical analysis of water pollutants, but now would like to extend its activities to measurements of atmospheric gases. You were sent out to visit the Atomic Physics Division at LTH, where you were given a 5 hour demonstration. Now you are expected to write a 3 page report (in Swedish or in English) to your boss Sune Svanberg, the Head of R & D of your company, <b>explaining</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> saw, and containing your recommendation for action...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, William," [...] said I, [...] "but now {{you think}} you have laid your {{preliminary}} at first so home that I should have nothing to say; that is, that when I had got money enough, it would be natural to think of going home. But <b>you</b> have not <b>explained</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean by home, and there you and I shall differ. Why, man, I am at home; here is my habitation; I never had any other in my lifetime; I was a kind of charity school boy; so that I can have no desire of going anywhere for being rich or poor, for I have nowhere to go." ...|$|R
60|$|You are startled, {{but give}} {{me a moment to}} <b>explain.</b> <b>What,</b> <b>you</b> would say to me, do you mean to tell us that we deny Christ? we who are {{essentially}} modern in every one of our principles and feelings, and yet all of us professing believers in Christ, and we trust most of us true ones? I answer, So far as we are believers indeed, we are one with the faithful of all times,--one with the classical believer of Athens and Ephesus, and one with the mediæval believer of the banks of the Rhone and the valleys of the Monte Viso. But so far as, in various strange ways, some in great and some in small things, we deny this belief, in so far we are essentially infected with this spirit, which I call Modernism.|$|E
6000|$|And now, if your imaginative friend {{chimed in}} triumphantly with: [...] "Do you {{not see that}} I was right after all? Do you not see that it fell from the clouds? that it was swept away hither, {{all the way from}} South America, by some south-westerly storm, and wearied out at last, dropped here to find rest, as in a sacred-place?" [...] what would you answer? [...] "My friend, that is a {{beautiful}} imagination; but I must treat it only as such, as long as I can explain the mystery more simply by facts which I do know. I do not know that humming-birds can be blown across the Atlantic alive. I do know they are actually brought across the Atlantic dead; are stuck in ladies' hats. I know that ladies visit the cathedral; and odd as the accident is, I prefer to believe, till I get a better explanation, that the humming-bird has simply dropped out of a lady's hat." [...] There, again, you would be speaking common sense; and using, too, sound inductive method; trying to <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do not know from what you do know already.|$|E
6000|$|Enough of this sham antiquarianism. Yes, {{it is in}} {{the matter}} of the book, of course, that {{collaboration}} shows; as for the manner, it is superficially all mine, {{in the sense that the}} last copy is all in my hand. Lloyd did not even put pen to paper in the Paris scenes or the Barbizon scene; it was no good; he wrote and often rewrote all the rest; I had the best service from him on the character of Nares. You see, we had been just meeting the man, and his memory was full of the man's words and ways. And Lloyd is an impressionist, pure and simple. The great difficulty of collaboration is that you can't <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean. I know what kind of effect I mean a character to give - what kind of TACHE he is to make; but how am I to tell my collaborator in words? Hence it was necessary to say, 'Make him So-and-so'; and this was all right for Nares and Pinkerton and Loudon Dodd, whom we both knew, but for Bellairs, for instance - a man with whom I passed ten minutes fifteen years ago - what was I to say? and what could Lloyd do? I, as a personal artist, can begin a character with only a haze in my head, but how if I have to translate the haze into words before I begin? In our manner of collaboration (which I think the only possible - I mean that of one person being responsible, and giving the COUP DE POUCE to every part of the work) I was spared the obviously hopeless business of trying to explain to my collaborator what STYLE I wished a passage to be treated in. These are the times that illustrate to a man the inadequacy of spoken language. Now - to be just to written language - I can (or could) find a language for my every mood, but how could I TELL any one beforehand what this effect was to be, which it would take every art that I possessed, and hours and hours of deliberate labour and selection and rejection, to produce? These are the impossibilities of collaboration. Its immediate advantage is to focus two minds together on the stuff, and to produce in consequence an extraordinarily greater richness of purview, consideration, and invention. The hardest chapter of all was 'Cross Questions and Crooked Answers.' You would not believe what that cost us before it assumed the least unity and colour. Lloyd wrote it at least thrice, and I at least five times - this is from memory. And was that last chapter worth the trouble it cost? Alas, that I should ask the question! Two classes of men - the artist and the educationalist - are sworn, on soul and conscience, not to ask it. [...] You get an ordinary, grinning, red-headed boy, and you have to educate him. Faith supports you; you give your valuable hours, the boy does not seem to profit, but that way your duty lies, for which you are paid, and you must persevere. Education has always seemed to me one of the few possible and dignified ways of life. A sailor, a shepherd, a schoolmaster - to a less degree, a soldier - and (I don't know why, upon my soul, except as a sort of schoolmaster's unofficial assistant, and a kind of acrobat in tights) an artist, almost exhaust the category.|$|E
