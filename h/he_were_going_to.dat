25|$|On June 9, 1962, Geiger crashed {{directly}} into the center field wall at Fenway Park attempting to catch a Tito Francona drive as the Red Sox lost to his old team Cleveland in 13 innings. He ventured back on the dirt track and looked as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{come up with the}} ball. He made a sudden leap for it but struck the wall, and the ball caromed back onto the field. He landed on his feet, clapped his head with his arm, sank slowly to his knees and fell flat on the ground. He was removed on a stretcher and taken to a hospital.|$|E
2500|$|Casolaro's family {{argued that}} he had been murdered; that before he left for Martinsburg, he had {{apparently}} told his brother {{that he had been}} frequently receiving harassing phone calls late at night; that some of them were threatening; and that if something were to happen to him while in Martinsburg, it would not be an accident. They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times [...] A number of law-enforcement officials also argued that his death deserved further scrutiny, and his notes were passed by his family to ABC News and Time Magazine, both of which investigated the case, but no evidence of murder was ever found.|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the problem}} {{might have been the}} sheer size of Rubinstein's hands. They were huge, and many {{observers}} commented on them. Josef Hofmann observed that Rubinstein's fifth finger [...] "was as thick as my thumbâ€”think of it! [...] Then his fingers were square at the ends, with cushions on them. [...] It was a wonderful hand." [...] Pianist Josef Lhevinne described them as [...] "fat, pudgy ... with fingers so broad at the finger-tips that he often had difficulty in not striking two notes at once." [...] The German piano teacher Ludwig Deppe advised American pianist Amy Fay to watch carefully how Rubinstein struck his chords: [...] "Nothing cramped about him! [...] He spreads his hands as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take in the universe, and takes them up with the greatest freedom and abandon!" ...|$|E

Should he do it? ...|$|R
6000|$|ALL the {{way home}} from Maine, Babbitt <b>was</b> certain that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a changed man. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} <b>to</b> serenity. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cease worrying about business. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have more [...] "interests"--theaters, public affairs, reading. And suddenly, as he finished an especially heavy cigar, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop smoking.|$|R

2500|$|Luckinbill's musical ability was {{utilized}} in J.T. and Colleen's storyline. He {{stated that the}} writers and producers felt {{like it would be}} a good idea. He added: [...] "They wanted me to sing a song by Alison Krauss called, [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". I liked it, was sitting at home one night working on that song and this new song just came about." [...] The new song Luckinbill wrote was entitled [...] "Feel". In writing the song, Luckinbill said he was [...] "thinking of the character's viewpoint, from J.T. to Colleen. If <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write her a song, what would he write? And these words came out. I ended up writing a song that night, which I took to our producers and said, 'I know you want me to sing this song, but how do you feel about this one? It's character driven.'" [...] Smith decided Luckinbill would sing both [...] "Feel" [...] and [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". Luckinbill sang Krauss' song on the episode dated December 26, 2002, where J.T. serenades Colleen on her sixteenth birthday. Smith wrote a scene specifically for the song Luckinbill wrote, featuring J.T. playing his guitar at Colleen's Valentine's Day dance where he performed [...] "Feel". After J.T. cheats on Colleen with Anita, Luckinbill wrote an untitled song in character for the show and performed it in character on the episode dated July 24, 2003.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a series}} of unusual loyalty tests over the next months, Sting would confront a WCW wrestler in the ring and shove the wrestler several times with his bat until the wrestler was {{provoked}} enough to advance on him. Then Sting would draw the weapon back as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> assault him, causing the wrestler to stop. Sting would hand the bat to the offended wrestler and turn his back, offering the wrestler a chance at retaliation. When the wrestler hesitated or declined, Sting would nod, retrieve the bat and leave the ring. In January 1997, a [...] "blackballed" [...] Randy Savage returned to WCW {{for the first time}} since Halloween Havoc and aligned himself with Sting as a [...] "free agent" [...] as he refused to join the nWo although WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff, also one of the leaders of the nWo, declared he would not be allowed back in WCW if he didn't. For the next few weeks the two were seen in the rafters together and coming to the ring together. This story, however, petered out at SuperBrawl in February; Sting and Savage had come to the ring together to watch Roddy Piper face Hogan in a match for the WCW world title. As Sting left, Savage went to the ring and helped Hogan win the match, thus going back on his word and joining the nWo. Over the next couple weeks, Sting would accompany the nWo, indicating that he too joined the group. However, at WCW Uncensored in March 1997, as the nWo celebrated a victory in the main event battle royal which guaranteed them title shots whenever they desired with their newest recruit, Chicago Bulls NBA star Dennis Rodman, Sting rappelled from the roof of the arena on a vertical zip-line. When Hall and Nash went to approach him, Sting attacked them and Randy Savage when he tried to intervene, revealing his allegiance to WCW.|$|E
