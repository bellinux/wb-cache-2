5|$|The {{accounts}} in Mino Khirad, written during the Savafid period, {{demonstrate that the}} Zoroastrians were subjected to harassment by the Shi'ite majority, their places of worship were under a constant threat of being destroyed. By 1707, when Le Bruyn visited <b>Isfahan,</b> the Zoroastrians were no longer able practice their religion freely. He notes that the most deprived Zoroastrians {{had been brought to}} <b>Isfahan,</b> and had been forced to become Muslim three years earlier. In 1821, Ker Porter visiting <b>Isfahan</b> notes that there were hardly any Zoroastrians left in <b>Isfahan</b> and Gabrabad was in ruins.|$|E
5|$|Fanna Khusraw {{was born}} in <b>Isfahan</b> on September 24, 936, {{he was the son}} of Rukn al-Dawla, who was the brother of Imad al-Dawla and Mu'izz al-Dawla. According to Ibn Isfandiyar, Fanna Khusraw's mother was the {{daughter}} of the Daylamite Firuzanid nobleman al-Hasan ibn al-Fairuzan, who was the cousin of the prominent Daylamite military leader Makan ibn Kaki.|$|E
5|$|In the Islamic East, the Caliph {{was forced}} to {{acknowledge}} {{the reality of the}} Saffarids' domination and established a modus vivendi with them, perhaps hoping, according to Hugh Kennedy, to harness them in a partnership analogous to that which the Tahirids had enjoyed in previous decades. Consequently, the Saffarids were recognized in their possession of Khurasan and eastern Persia as well as Fars, while the Abbasids were to exercise direct control over western Persia, namely Jibal, Rayy and <b>Isfahan.</b> This policy gave the Caliph a free hand to recover the territories of the Dulafids, another semi-independent local dynasty that was centred on <b>Isfahan</b> and Nihavand. When the Dulafid Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Abi Dulaf died in 893, al-Mu'tadid moved swiftly to install his son al-Muktafi as governor in Rayy, Qazvin, Qum and Hamadan. The Dulafids were confined to their core region around Karaj and <b>Isfahan,</b> before being deposed outright in 896. Nevertheless, the Abbasid hold over these territories remained precarious, especially due to the proximity of the Zaydi emirate in Tabaristan, and in 897 Rayy was handed over to Saffarid control.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century the great Safavid king, Shah Abbas I settled {{a number of}} Zoroastrians {{in a suburb of}} his new capital, <b>Isfahan.</b> The suburb of <b>Isfahan</b> where the Zoroastrians lived was called Gabr-Mahal, Gabristan or Gabrabad, derived from the word Gabr. Europeans who visited his court left {{accounts}} of the 'Gabars' or 'Gabrs', (an insulting term used for Zoroastrians by the Muslims), agree on the poverty and simplicity of their lives. Fearing desecration by Muslims, Zoroastrians hid the sacred fires, and conversed in a newly invented dialect called Dari. Later Safavid kings were not as tolerant as Shah Abbas. Muhammad Baqir Majlisi persuaded Sultan Husayn (1688–1728 CE) to decree the forcible conversion of Zoroastrians, those who refused were killed.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Islamic {{geometric}} patterns {{is increasing}} in the West, both among craftsmen and artists including M. C. Escher {{in the twentieth}} century, and among mathematicians and physicists including Peter J. Lu and Paul Steinhardt who controversially claimed in 2007 that tilings at the Darb-e Imam shrine in <b>Isfahan</b> could generate quasi-periodic patterns like Penrose tilings.|$|E
5|$|Martyn {{arrived in}} India in April 1806, where he preached and {{occupied}} {{himself in the}} study of linguistics. He translated the whole of the New Testament into Urdu, Persian and Judaeo-Persic. He also translated the Psalms into Persian and the Book of Common Prayer into Urdu. From India, he set out for Bushire, Shiraz, <b>Isfahan,</b> and Tabriz.|$|E
5|$|In 1086, 7- and 10-point girih {{patterns}} (with heptagons, 5- and 6-pointed stars, triangles {{and irregular}} hexagons) {{appear in the}} Friday Mosque at <b>Isfahan.</b> 10-point girih became widespread in the Islamic world, except in the Spanish Al-Andalus. Soon afterwards, sweeping 9-, 11-, and 13-point girih patterns {{were used in the}} Barsian Mosque, also in Persia, in 1098; these, like 7-point geometrical patterns, are rarely used outside Persia and central Asia.|$|E
5|$|Persia at {{the time}} was divided into British and Russian spheres of influence, with a neutral zone in between. Germany {{exercised}} influence over the central parts of the country through their consulate in <b>Isfahan.</b> The local populace and the clergy, opposed to Russian and British semi-colonial designs on Persia, offered support to the mission. Niedermayer and von Hentig's groups reconnoitred <b>Isfahan</b> until the end of June. The Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge, was already receiving reports of pro-German sympathies among Persian and Afghan tribes. Details of the progress of the expedition were being keenly sought by British intelligence. By now, British and Russian columns close to the Afghan border, including the Seistan Force, were hunting for the expedition. If the expedition was to reach Afghanistan, it would have to outwit and outrun its pursuers over thousands of miles in the extreme heat and natural hazards of the Persian desert, while evading brigands and ambushes.|$|E
5|$|The {{aesthetic}} {{value of}} tilings {{has long been}} appreciated, and remains a source of interest in them; here the visual appearance (rather than the formal defining properties) of Penrose tilings has attracted attention. The similarity with some decorative patterns used in the Middle East has been noted; the physicists Peter J. Lu and Paul Steinhardt have presented evidence that a Penrose tiling underlies some examples of medieval Islamic geometric patterns, such as the girih (strapwork) tilings at the Darb-e Imam shrine in <b>Isfahan.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Imad al-Dawla in 949, Adud al-Dawla's father Rukn al-Dawla, who was the most {{powerful}} of the Buyid rulers, claimed the title of senior emir, which Mu'izz al-Dawla and Adud al-Dawla recognized. In 955, a Daylamite military officer named Muhammad ibn Makan seized <b>Isfahan</b> from Rukn al-Dawla. Adud al-Dawla then marched towards the city and recaptured it from Muhammad ibn Makan. Another Daylamite military officer named Ruzbahan also shortly rebelled against Mu'izz al-Dawla, while his brother Bullaka rebelled against Adud al-Dawla at Shiraz. Abu 'l-Fadl ibn al-'Amid, however, managed to suppress the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|But the Parthian Empire, {{weakened}} by internal strife and wars with Rome, {{was soon to}} be followed by the Sassanid Empire. Indeed, shortly afterward, Ardashir I, the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern Fars Province, Iran) from Estakhr began subjugating the surrounding territories in defiance of Arsacid rule. He confronted Artabanus V at the Battle of Hormozdgān on 28 April 224AD, perhaps at a site near <b>Isfahan,</b> defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire. There is evidence, however, that suggests Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228AD.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scenery}} design, layout {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many {{pictures of his}} hometown of <b>Isfahan,</b> Iran for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring {{was done with the}} computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.|$|E
5|$|In addition, 'Adud al-Dawla is {{credited}} with sponsoring and patronizing other scientific projects during his time. An observatory was built by his orders in <b>Isfahan</b> where Azophi worked. Al-Muqaddasi also reports that he ordered {{the construction of a}} great dam between Shiraz and Estakhr in 960. The dam irrigated some 300 villages in Fars province and became known as Band-e Amir (Dam of the emir). Among his other major constructions was the digging of the Haffar channel, that joined the Karun river to the Shatt al-Arab river (the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates). The port of Khorramshahr was built on the Haffar, at its joining point with the Shatt al-Arab.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{determine}} {{that one of}} the dead men belonged to an Islamic terrorist group, the <b>Isfahan,</b> and using the ATM video are able to track down Lauren. A screenshot of the video reveals a blurry figure who appears to be Howard Graves. The agents meet with Lauren at her home and after initially denying it, she admits to the incident but knows nothing about the murders. Upon leaving, the agents find their car going out of control on its own, leading it to crash into another car. At a repair shop, the car is found to have no evidence of tampering, but an electrical charge is detected within it.|$|E
5|$|Symmetries are {{prominent}} in textile arts including quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving, {{where they may}} be purely decorative or may be marks of status. Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in <b>Isfahan.</b> Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can have {{a wide variety of}} reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.|$|E
5|$|The film won several awards, {{including}} the Grand Prix Prize at the 2003 Golden Swan Awards, the Golden Butterfly Prize for Best Direction at the <b>Isfahan</b> International Children's Film Festival, and a trio (Best Director, Best Newcomer, and People's Choice Award) at the Montreal Film Festival. It also received two nominations at the 2003 Golden Horse Awards, for Best Theme Song (拥有) and Best New Performer. Megan Zheng, then 10 years old, {{became the first}} Singaporean to win a Golden Horse Award, sharing her Best New Performer award with Wang Baoqiang of Blind Shaft.|$|E
5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them in, {{who say they are}} {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the <b>Isfahan.</b> Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, but it appears that Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{established}} a new archaeological journal, Ancient India, planning {{for it to}} be published twice a year. He had trouble securing printing paper and faced various delays; the first issue was released in January 1946, and he would release three further volumes during his stay. Wheeler married Kim Collingridge in Simla, before he and his wife took part in an Indian Cultural Mission to Iran. The Indian government had deemed Wheeler ideal to lead the group, which departed via train to Zahidan before visiting Persepolis, Tehran, <b>Isfahan,</b> Shiraz, Pasargadae, and Kashan. Wheeler enjoyed the trip, and was envious of Tehran's archaeological museum and library, which was far in advance of anything then found in India. Crossing into Iraq, in Baghdad the team caught a flight back to Delhi. In 1946, he was involved in a second cultural mission, this time to Afghanistan, where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient Bactria and visited the archaeology of Balkh.|$|E
5|$|By early July, {{the sick}} at Kermanshah had {{recovered}} and rejoined the expedition. Camels and water bags were purchased, and the parties left <b>Isfahan</b> separately on 3 July 1915 {{for the journey}} through the desert, hoping to rendezvous at Tebbes, halfway to the Afghan border. Von Hentig's group travelled with twelve pack horses, twenty-four mules, and a camel caravan. Throughout the march, {{efforts were made to}} throw off the British and Russian patrols. False dispatches spread disinformation on the group's numbers, destination, and intention. To avoid the extreme daytime heat, they travelled by night. Food was found or bought by Persian messengers sent ahead of the party. These scouts also helped identify hostile villages and helped find water. The group crossed the Persian desert in forty nights. Dysentery and delirium plagued the party. Some Persian guides attempted to defect, and camel drivers had to be constantly vigilant for robbers. On 23 July, the group reached Tebbes– the first Europeans after Sven Hedin. They were soon followed by Niedermayer's party, which now included explorer Wilhelm Paschen and six Austrian and Hungarian soldiers who had escaped from Russian prisoner of war camps in Turkestan. The arrival was marked by a grand welcome by the town's mayor. However, the welcome meant the party had been spotted.|$|E
5|$|Details of Bajkam's {{early life}} are unknown. He {{was one of}} the ghilman (military slaves, usually of Turkish origin) of the Daylamite warlord Makan ibn Kaki in {{northern}} Iran. Makan took care of the young Bajkam's training and education, something for which the latter showed his gratitude by adopting his patron's name as his nisba (surname). After Makan, Bajkam entered the service of Mardavij, founder of the Ziyarid dynasty, who came to control Daylam, Jibal and Tabaristan. Mardavij mistreated his ghilman, who consequently murdered him at <b>Isfahan</b> in January 935, an act in which Bajkam may have been complicit. After Mardavij's death, most of the ghilman in Ziyarid service dispersed. Bajkam and his fellow officer Tuzun assumed the leadership of a large group and, after first offering their services to the new governor of Jibal, Hasan ibn Harun, proceeded to the Abbasid court at Baghdad. At first, their offers were rejected by the court, where the Caliph's Hujari bodyguards jealously guarded their prerogatives, but the ghilman were eventually taken into the service of Muhammad ibn Ra'iq, governor of Basra and Wasit in southern Iraq. Now known as Bajkam Ra'iqi, Bajkam created a large military force under his command consisting of his own followers as well as additional Turks and Daylamites summoned from Jibal.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Persia, saffron (Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii') was {{cultivated}} at Derbena and <b>Isfahan</b> in the 10th century BC. There, Persian saffron threads {{have been}} found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds. Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities, and as a brilliant yellow dye, perfume, and a medicine. Thus, saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Indeed, Persian saffron threads, used to spice foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an aphrodisiac. These fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine. In addition, Persian saffron was dissolved in water with sandalwood {{to use as a}} body wash after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun. Later, Persian saffron was heavily used by Alexander the Great and his forces during their Asian campaigns. They mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice. Alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water, taking after Cyrus the Great. Much like Cyrus, he believed it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment. He even recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron's perceived curative properties, continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in <b>Isfahan</b> in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E
25|$|<b>Isfahan</b> has a {{population}} of around 2.2 million (2016 census), and is Iran's third most populous city. It is the capital of the province of <b>Isfahan,</b> and was also the third capital of the Safavid Empire. It is home {{to a wide variety of}} historical sites, including the famous Shah Square, Siosepol, and the churches at the Armenian district of New Julfa. It is also home to the world's seventh-largest shopping mall, <b>Isfahan</b> City Center.|$|E
25|$|Clashes {{were also}} {{reported}} in <b>Isfahan.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Georgian {{language}} is still {{used by many}} of the Georgians in Iran. The centre of Georgians in Iran is Fereydunshahr, a small city 150km to the west of <b>Isfahan.</b> The western part of <b>Isfahan</b> province is historically called Fereydan. In this area there are 10 Georgian towns and villages around Fereydunshahr. In this region the old Georgian identity is retained the best compared to other places in Iran. In many major Iranian cities, such as Tehran, <b>Isfahan,</b> Karaj and Shiraz, and Rasht live Georgians too.|$|E
25|$|Umar {{decided to}} strike the Persians {{immediately}} after their defeat at Nihawand, when he had gained a psychological advantage over them. Umar had to decide {{which of the following}} three to conquer first: Fars in the south, Azerbaijan in the north or <b>Isfahan</b> in the center. Umar chose <b>Isfahan,</b> as it was the heart of the Persian Empire and a conduit for supply and communication lines between Sassanid garrisons in various Persian provinces. In other words, capturing <b>Isfahan</b> would isolate Fars and Azerbaijan from Khurasan. After having captured the heartland of Persia, that is Fars and <b>Isfahan,</b> the next attacks would be simultaneously launched against Azerbaijan, the North Western province, and Sistan, the most eastern province of the Persian Empire. The conquest of those provinces would leave Khorasan, the stronghold of Emperor Yazdegerd III, isolated and vulnerable. In the last phase of this campaign, Khorasan was to be attacked, completing the conquest of Sassanid Persia.|$|E
25|$|Some {{time later}} a local ruler named Amir Mohammad Khan, who with another local ruler named Taqi Khan (the ruler of Yazd), had {{recently}} defeated Jafar Khan and seized many riches, invaded Qajar territory, and marched towards <b>Isfahan.</b> Jafar Qoli Khan, {{who was still}} the governor of <b>Isfahan,</b> left the city before Taqi Khan could reach it and defeated the latter. Agha Mohammad Khan then went southwards once again. He met Jafar Qoli Khan at <b>Isfahan</b> in 1788, and after some time, made Taqi Khan accept Qajar suzerainty, and thereafter punished some Qashqai tribes, who fled into the mountains. Agha Mohammad then approached Shiraz, where he hoped to bait Jafar Khan out of the city, which was strongly fortified, making {{it very hard to}} besiege. Unfortunately for Agha Mohammad Khan, Jafar Khan remained in the city. Agha Mohammad Khan returned to <b>Isfahan,</b> where he appointed his brother Ali Qoli as its governor, succeeding Jafar Qoli Khan. He then left for Tehran.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isfahan,</b> Nain, and Qom revived or started carpet {{manufacture}} by the mid-twentieth century. All-silk, or silk pile on cotton foundation carpets {{are produced}} with asymmetrical knots. Their design is often inspired by Safavid designs. Carpets from Qom and Nain often have richly decorated medaillons, and tender light blue and ivory colours. <b>Isfahan</b> carpets use more dark {{red and blue}} colours.|$|E

25|$|In 1715, by {{orders of}} Peter the Great {{he was sent}} to <b>Isfahan,</b> Persia (which he reached in March 1717) as the new Russian ambassador. During his {{travelling}} he was supposed to redirect the silk trade route in Persia to Russia with the Armenians' help. During his stay in <b>Isfahan,</b> Volynsky signed a treaty with the Shah Husayn giving commercial advantages over a country torn by revolts.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the wheat sifter, a few prominent Siyyids in <b>Isfahan</b> were converted by Mullá Husayn.|$|E
25|$|Some time later, while Agha Mohammad Khan was in {{northern}} Iran, Jafar Khan quickly marched towards <b>Isfahan</b> and re-captured it. He then sent troops towards Kashan and Qum, while he marched towards Hamadan. He was, however, defeated by local tribal chieftains, among them Khosrow Khan and Mohammad Hosayn Khan Qaragozlu. Jafar Khan then withdrew to <b>Isfahan.</b> When Agha Mohammad Khan {{heard about the}} Zand invasion of <b>Isfahan</b> and its surroundings, he quickly moved towards the city, which made Jafar Khan retreat to Shiraz once again. Agha Mohammad Khan then appointed Jafar Qoli Khan as the city's governor. However, the governor of Zanjan shortly revolted afterward, which forced Agha Mohammad Khan to go back north, where he suppressed the latter's revolt and pardoned him.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, he {{had written}} to Abu Ya'far, the prefect of the dynamic city of <b>Isfahan,</b> {{offering}} his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hiding, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of <b>Isfahan</b> and Hamadãn; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik mercenaries. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped from {{the city in the}} dress of a Sufi ascetic. After a perilous journey, they reached <b>Isfahan,</b> receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.|$|E
25|$|With Agha Mohammad Khan {{once again}} in the north, Jafar Khan began raising an army to prepare another attack against <b>Isfahan</b> and its surroundings. When Ali Qoli found out about it he sent a group of tribesmen to Qumishah, a city south of <b>Isfahan.</b> However, Jafar Khan managed to easily defeat them. Ali Qoli {{thereafter}} retreated to Kashan. Agha Mohammad Khan, learning of this, rapidly marched towards <b>Isfahan,</b> which made Jafar Khan withdraw to Shiraz once again. Agha Mohammad Khan returned to Tehran rather than attacking Shiraz again. Jafar Khan was murdered on 23 January 1789, which started a four-month civil war between several Zand princes who fought for succession to the throne. In May Jafar Khan's son Lotf Ali Khan emerged the victor in this civil war.|$|E
25|$|In making <b>Isfahan</b> {{the centre}} of Safavid Empire, Abbas {{utilized}} the Armenian people, whom he had forcibly relocated to <b>Isfahan</b> from their Armenian homelands. Once they were settled, he allowed them considerable freedom and encouraged them to continue in their silk trade. Silk {{was an integral part}} of the economy and considered to be the best form of hard currency available. The Armenians had already established trade networks that allowed Abbas to strengthen the Iran's economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{preparation}} and planning of {{the conquest of}} the Persian Empire was completed by early 642. Umar appointed Abdullah ibn Uthman, commander of the Muslim forces, to invade <b>Isfahan.</b> From Nihawand, Nu'man marched to Hamadan, which was already in Muslim hands. Once Hamadan was captured, Nu'man marched 370 kilometres (230mi) southeast against the city <b>Isfahan</b> and defeated an Sasanian army {{under the command of}} Shahrvaraz Jadhuyih and other notable Sasanian generals. Shahrvaraz Jadhuyih, along with another Sasanian general was killed during the battle. After his victory at <b>Isfahan,</b> he laid siege to the city; there the Muslim army was reinforced by fresh troops from Busra and Kufa under the command of Abu Musa Ashaari and Ahnaf ibn Qais. The siege continued for a few months and finally the city surrendered.|$|E
