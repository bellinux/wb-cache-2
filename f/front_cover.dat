5|$|The <b>front</b> <b>cover</b> {{depicted}} {{an advanced}} civilization {{with a vast}} landscape of skyscrapers and red, sunburst-like flames {{rising out of the}} cityscape as representations of Agharta's power. Yokoo used a combination of collage, airbrushing, and painting techniques as he had with his previous work, along with postcards collected from his trips to Tahiti and New York City; the cityscape on the <b>front</b> <b>cover</b> was taken from one of his postcards. The back cover showed the city submerged in water, embedded in coral reefs, and hovered over by a diver, fish, and a squid ascending from the city. According to graphic designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell, Yokoo depicted groups of jellyfish, coral reefs, and brightly colored fish to suggest an association between Agharta and Atlantis. The foreground of the back cover's illustration featured a reptilian creature. Cultural studies researcher Dagmar Buchwald interpreted this image as an allusion to similar ideas about Lemuria; this mythological continent supposedly existed during Earth's prehistory and was inhabited by an advanced civilization, later forced under the Earth's surface after its homeland was destroyed by a great flood.|$|E

5|$|Kobayashi and his editors {{collaborated on}} the plotlines. Kobayashi would then draw the basic {{illustrations}} for each chapter before passing his material to assistants to finish. As the series' manga artist, Kobayashi also designed the cover art. Originally, the fifth volume's <b>front</b> <b>cover</b> was to feature Akira Takano, but after re-reading the volume Kobayashi concluded that since {{much of its}} plot in that volume revolves around Karen Ichijo, she {{should be on the}} cover instead. Desiring to feature a male character, he placed Harima on the cover of volume six. Kobayashi designed a poster to commemorate the ending of the series with the final chapter of School Rumble Z.|$|E
