5|$|At {{the start}} of 1894, Robey {{travelled}} to Manchester {{to participate in the}} pantomime Jack and Jill, where he was paid £25 a week for a three-month contract.

Robey fabricated a story that he had just dined with the Lord Mayor before detailing exactly what he had eaten. The routine was such a <b>hit</b> <b>that</b> it was incorporated into the show as part of the script.|$|E

5|$|DiMaggio {{played his}} final MLB season in 1951, while highly touted outfielder Mickey Mantle made his debut for New York. Pitcher Allie Reynolds threw two no-hitters during 1951, as the Yankees claimed the AL pennant {{for the third}} {{straight}} year. They then won the 1951 World Series against the Giants, four games to two. When their 1952 team took the AL pennant, the Yankees had an opportunity to match the four straight World Series championships won by the team from 1936 to 1939. In another Yankees–Dodgers matchup, New York fell behind three games to two, but victories in games six and seven gave the Yankees the title. New York and Brooklyn were matched again in the 1953 World Series, and a Billy Martin base <b>hit</b> <b>that</b> decided the sixth and final game of the Series gave the Yankees another four games to two victory and a fifth title in a row.

5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge <b>hit,</b> <b>that</b> if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E
