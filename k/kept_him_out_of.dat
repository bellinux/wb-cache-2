5|$|He {{was little}} known {{personally}} to the English public. His absence at sea, and on travels and duty with his regiment, <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the general eye... at times, {{there was a}} sallowness of hue, which much increased the grave aspect... {{not only in the}} metropolis, but throughout the country, somehow, it was always said, 'He will never come to the throne.|$|E

50|$|Avery's {{associate}} Martin Dawson at The Rockefeller Hospital confirmed each of Griffith's reported findings. Even before Griffith's publication, Fred Neufeld had confirmed them as well, and {{was merely}} awaiting publication of Griffith's findings before publishing his confirmation. Over the following years, Avery's illness, Graves' disease, <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> much <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his laboratory as other researchers in it experimented to determine, largely by process of elimination, which constituent was the transforming factor.|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Wickersham {{also played}} for the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League for the 1987 {{and part of the}} 1988 seasons.

50|$|Morgan-Smith started 2011-12 on form, scoring nine {{goals in}} 13 league matches, before a {{succession}} <b>of</b> serious injuries <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> for most <b>of</b> the remaining campaign. The uncertainty over his fitness led to Luton manager Paul Buckle releasing {{him from his}} contract in June 2012.|$|R
50|$|On May 7, 2009, Giancola {{was signed}} by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, five years after his last CFL stint. Giancola {{suffered}} a groin injury that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> for most <b>of</b> training camp. On June 19, 2009, he was released by the team during training camp.|$|R

5|$|Expectations for Schenn {{were high}} {{heading into the}} 2009–10 season. During {{training}} camp, Toronto Head Coach Ron Wilson named {{him as one of}} the team's top four defencemen. As the season progressed, however, Schenn's play was disappointing, and Wilson <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the line-up for a game in October and again for a three-game stretch in December. Towards the end of the season, Schenn and some of his younger teammates improved their play. In a game against the Ottawa Senators, Schenn posted his first career two-goal game, helping him finish the season with new career-highs in goals (5) and points (17) in 79 games played.|$|E

5|$|Hirst's leg injury <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the England {{side for}} the first two Test matches against Australia, {{although}} {{he would have been a}} certain selection had he been fit. He was chosen in the squad for the second match but was left out on fitness grounds. However, Hirst was not particularly successful in the three Tests he played that season, hitting a highest score of 40 not out; as a bowler he never took more than three wickets in an innings. In the series he scored 105 runs at an average of 35.00 and took 6 wickets at 35.33. England won the series 2–0, mainly due to the all-round efforts of Hirst's Yorkshire teammate Stanley Jackson, who headed the batting and bowling averages for the series.|$|E
5|$|Robben's {{first goal}} of the Bundesliga season came from a penalty kick in a 3–0 defeat of Bayer Leverkusen on 29 August.

On 24 October, Robben returned to the Bayern team, playing 65 minutes and scoring the opening goal of a 4–0 win against 1. FC Köln, the club's 1,000th Bundesliga victory. He made his first Champions League appearance of the season on 4 November, scoring after coming on as a substitute in Bayern's 5–1 win over Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Roy's NBA debut {{was in his}} {{hometown}} against the Seattle SuperSonics. He scored 20points in that game, and 19 in the following game.

At the end of January 2007, Roy led all NBA rookies with 14.5points per game. He became the fourth Trail Blazer to be selected for the rookie squad of the NBA All-Star Weekend Rookie Challenge {{since its inception in}} 1994.

5000|$|Wright {{was placed}} on the {{transfer}} list by Gary Mills in December 2009 to [...] "freshen up" [...] his squad.

50|$|In 1953, however, Yuhas {{appeared}} in only 2 games. In one inning, Yuhas had an 18.00 era, with three hits and two earned runs given up before suffering an arm injury that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> the rest <b>of</b> the season. With Yuhas <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action, the 1953 Cardinals fell to an 83-71 record. They did, however, maintain {{third place in}} the standings.|$|R
60|$|McMurdo had {{obtained}} a temporary job as bookkeeper {{for he was}} a well-educated man. This <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> most <b>of</b> the day, and he had not found occasion yet to report himself {{to the head of}} the lodge of the Eminent Order of Freemen. He was reminded of his omission, however, by a visit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow member whom he had met in the train. Scanlan, the small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed man, seemed glad to see him once more. After a glass or two of whisky he broached the object of his visit.|$|R
