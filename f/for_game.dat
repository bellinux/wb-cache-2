Modal logics {{have proven}} to be a very {{successful}} tool <b>for</b> reasoning about <b>games.</b> However, until now, although logics have been put forward <b>for</b> <b>games</b> in both normal form and games in extensive form, and <b>for</b> <b>games</b> with complete and incomplete information, the focus in the logic community has hitherto been on games with pure strategies. This paper is a first to widen the scope to logics <b>for</b> <b>games</b> that allow mixed strategies. We present a modal logic <b>for</b> <b>games</b> in normal form with mixed strategies, and demonstrate its soundness and strong completeness. Characteristic for our logic is a number of infinite rules...|$|R
