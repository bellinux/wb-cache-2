50|$|On May 3, 2012, {{one week}} after losing to Robbie E <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Gut</b> Check match, Silva had his in-ring segment to {{determine}} if he would receive {{a contract with the}} TNA main roster, with the decision being made by three judges. The script dictated that Ric Flair would say 'no,' Al Snow would say 'yes' and Bruce Prichard would ultimately say 'no.' However, after Flair and Snow made their decisions, Silva was given the opportunity to cut a promo explaining as to why Prichard should say 'yes.' After Silva cut the promo (in which he mentioned his recently deceased father), Flair (going off-script) changed his decision to 'yes.' This gave Silva the necessary two 'yes' votes, meaning that he had earned a main roster contract. By the time Prichard got to announce his decision, he chose to simply say 'yes,' changing his vote in response to Flair's actions.|$|E

If there is impropriety, then just where does such impropriety begin? Is it wrong to look at a picture of a naked figure or at a statue? English ladies of the last generation thought so and avoided the statue galleries, but do so no longer. Or is it a question of sex? Should men make only the statues of men to be looked at by men, while the statues of women should be made by women to be looked at by women only?
