50|$|<b>Gacyclidine</b> (GK-11) is a {{psychoactive drug}} which {{acts as a}} dissociative via {{functioning}} as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. It {{is closely related to}} phencyclidine (PCP), and specifically, is a derivative of tenocyclidine (TCP).|$|E
40|$|<b>Gacyclidine,</b> a novel, noncompetitive NMDA {{receptor}} antagonist, was injected (i. v.) into rats {{at three}} different doses {{to determine if}} the drug could promote behavioral recovery and reduce the behavioral and anatomical impairments that occur after bilateral contusions of the medial frontal cortex (MFC). In the Morris water maze, contused rats treated with <b>gacyclidine</b> at a dosage of 0. 1 mg/kg performed better than their vehicle-treated conspecifics. Rats given <b>gacyclidine</b> at either 0. 3 or 0. 03 mg/kg performed better than brain-injured controls, but not as well as those treated with 0. 1 mg/kg. Counts of surviving neurons in the nucleus basalis magnoceilularis (NBM) and the medial dorsal nucleus (MDN) of the thalamus were used to determine whether <b>gacyclidine</b> treatment attenuated secondary cell death. In both the NBM and the MDN, the counts revealed fewer surviving neurons in untreated contused rats than in gacyclidine-treated rats. Increases in the size and number of microglia and astrocytes were observed in the striatum of gacyclidinetreated contused brains. Although most consequences of MFC contusions were attenuated, we still observed increases in ventricle dilation and thinning of the cortex. tCorresponding author...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (nAChRs) are {{implicated in}} several {{diseases of the}} central nervous system, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. They {{play a role in}} modulating release of neurotransmittors and in the development and intervention of brain seizures and neurodegeneration caused by organophosphate poisoning, a major lethal threat in developing countries. A method was developed to screen drugs for effects on nAChR. The method uses the ratiometric Ca 2 +-probe fura- 2 to measure, {{with the aid of a}} plate reader, nicotine induced responses in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY 5 Y. The method was validated using published data for the Alzheimer drug memantine. Drugs that show effects against tremor and brain seizures were characterised, including the Parkinson drugs biperiden, procyclidine, and trihexphenidyl. These drugs all blocked nAChR with an IC 50 in a narrow range from 0. 75 µM to 1. 5 µM. The potencies of the drugs at the nAChR were greater than at the NMDA receptors, implicating a relevance of drug effects on nAChR in the mechanisms of inhibition of seizures. The nAChR block of the drugs were use- and voltage-dependent, features particularly suitable for a drug used to restrain epileptogenic seizures. Caramiphen, a potent antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, also blocks nAChR with an IC 50 of 0. 3 µM. The novel NMDA-receptor blocker <b>gacyclidine</b> (GK 11) was shown to block the nAChR with an IC 50 of 0. 3 µM for its racemate and 0. 16 µM for the pure (-) -isomer. The novel finding that <b>gacyclidine</b> blocks nAChR makes this receptor a good candidate for the “non-NMDA” binding sites that have been established, but not yet identified, for gacycyclidine. Several novel bis-quarternary pyridine compounds inhibited nAChR with IC 50 values inversely correlated with the length of the carbon chain linker, differing from the relative potencies of the drugs at muscle nAChR. This finding is, because of ganglionic blockade, highly relevant in selecting a suitable candidate to combat organophosphate poisoning...|$|E
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder {{typified by}} a massive loss of motor neurons with few therapeutic options. The exact cause of neuronal degeneration is unknown but it is now admitted that ALS is a multifactorial disease with several mechanisms involved including glutamate excitotoxicity. More specifically, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -mediated cell death and impairment of the glutamate-transport has been suggested to {{play a key role}} in ALS pathophysiology. Thus, evaluating NMDAR antagonists is of high therapeutic interest. <b>Gacyclidine,</b> also named GK 11, is a high affinity non-competitive NMDAR antagonist that may protect against motor neuron death in an ALS context. Moreover, GK 11 presents a low intrinsic neurotoxicity and has already been used in two clinical trials for CNS lesions. In the present study, we investigated the influence of chronic administration of two doses of GK 11 (0. 1 and 1 mg/kg) on the survival and the functional motor activity of hSOD 1 G 93 A mice, an animal model of ALS. Treatment started at early symptomatic age (60 days) and was applied bi-weekly until the end stage of the disease. We first confirmed that functional alteration of locomotor activity was evident in the hSOD 1 G 93 A transgenic female mice by 60 days of age. A low dose of GK 11 improved the survival of the mice by 4. 3 % and partially preserved body weight. Improved life span was associated with a delay in locomotor function impairment. Conversely, the high dose treatment worsened motor functions. These findings suggest that chronic administration of GK 11 beginning at early symptomatic stage may be beneficial for patients with ALS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Organophosphorous (OP) Nerve agents (NAs) {{are known}} as the deadliest {{chemical}} warfare agents. They are divided into two classes of G and V agents. Most of them are liquid at room temperature. NAs chemical structures and mechanisms of actions are similar to OP pesticides, but their toxicities are higher than these compounds. The main mechanism of action is irreversible inhibition of Acetyl Choline Esterase (AChE) resulting in accumulation of toxic levels of acetylcholine (ACh) at the synaptic junctions and thus induces muscarinic and nicotinic receptors stimulation. However, other mechanisms have recently been described. Central nervous system (CNS) depression particularly on respiratory and vasomotor centers may induce respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Intermediate syndrome after NAs exposure is less common than OP pesticides poisoning. There are four approaches to detect exposure to NAs in biological samples: (I) AChE activity measurement, (II) Determination of hydrolysis products in plasma and urine, (III) Fluoride reactivation of phosphylated binding sites and (IV) Mass spectrometric determination of cholinesterase adducts. The clinical manifestations are similar to OP pesticides poisoning, but with more severity and fatalities. The management should be started as soon as possible. The victims should immediately {{be removed from the}} field and treatment is commenced with auto-injector antidotes (atropine and oximes) such as MARK I kit. A 0. 5 % hypochlorite solution as well as novel products like M 291 Resin kit, G 117 H and Phosphotriesterase isolated from soil bacterias, are now available for decontamination of NAs. Atropine and oximes are the well known antidotes that should be infused as clinically indicated. However, some new adjuvant and additional treatment such as magnesium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, <b>gacyclidine,</b> benactyzine, tezampanel, hemoperfusion, antioxidants and bioscavengers have recently been used for OP NAs poisoning. </p...|$|E
