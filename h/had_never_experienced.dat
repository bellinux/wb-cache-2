5|$|The {{story of}} the Jamaican {{bobsleigh}} team at the 1988 Winter Olympics was turned into the 1993 movie Cool Runnings. However, the film was only loosely based on actual events, with real life coach Pat Brown later saying that the team <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced</b> any of the animosity from the other teams as depicted in the movie.|$|E
5|$|Another study {{suggested}} that EFS {{might contribute to}} acute rheumatic fever susceptibility. In this work, {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) from patients with rheumatoid heart disease (RHD) and control subjects that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced</b> acute rheumatoid fever were stimulated with rheumatogenic and non-rheumatogenic group A streptococci (GAS) strains. EFS was one of only four genes with significantly increased expression in both arms of the study: 1) RHD patient versus control PBMCs after stimulation of both groups with rheumatogenic GAS and 2) RHD patient PBMC stimulated with rheumatogenic versus non-rheumatogenic GAS.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevailing}} design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was {{to simultaneously}} appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while {{reaching out to}} new players and Final Fantasy fans who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced</b> the genre before. As a consequence, Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority. To streamline development, he made about 400 fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals, {{with a focus on}} implementing standard features of the genre first. The new workflow pipeline was tested using updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn. The continuing operations of the original release also provided a valuable testing ground for new features that would be carried into the relaunch. Throughout this process, Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust was key, even admitting that sales were secondary compared to redeeming the reputation of the series. Live streaming conversations between the development team and fans, such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events, became a major element of Yoshida's player outreach strategy.|$|E

5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced</b> an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

Thereafter, he used the Pato as a general freight carrier along {{the west coast of}} North America and in voyages back and forth between San Francisco and Hawaii. During this period, Slocum also fulfilled a long-held ambition to become a writer; he became a temporary correspondent for the San Francisco Bee.|$|E
25|$|The {{first serious}} {{concerns}} about driver safety occurred on Friday afternoon. Dr. Steve Olvey, CART Director of Medical Affairs, would later report that two drivers felt dizzy and disoriented after running their cars at over , and that they felt they could not control their cars. The identities of the two drivers were not disclosed, but Tony Kanaan and Alex Zanardi later claimed they experienced the symptoms. Adrian Fernandez also reported to the media he was experiencing dizziness.

They encountered little opposition, there being only a small force of fifty-seven British marines and eleven sailors, {{in addition to the}} Falkland Islands Defence Force (who were later sent to Fox Bay). There was only one Argentine fatality. The event garnered international attention at a level which the islands <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced</b> before, and made them a household name in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Ybor {{also had}} good {{business}} {{reasons to be}} magnanimous. His goal was to not only attract residents to town, but {{to get them to}} stay. His employees in Key West had often traveled back and forth between Florida and Cuba looking for the best pay and conditions. By offering the anchor of land and home ownership – something most tabaqueros <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced,</b> especially in land-scarce Key West – Ybor encouraged his workers to stick around. Though the workforce was still relatively fluid in the early years, enough workers remained in Tampa to keep the cigar factories fully staffed and running year-round.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} physiological explanations for {{parts of the}} OBE. OBE-like experiences have been induced by stimulation of the brain. OBE-like experience has also been induced through stimulation of the posterior part of the right superior temporal gyrus in a patient. Positron-emission tomography was also {{used in this study}} to identify brain regions affected by this stimulation. The term OBE-like is used above because the experiences described in these experiments either lacked some of the clarity or details of normal OBEs, or were described by subjects who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced</b> an OBE before. Such subjects were therefore not qualified to make claims about the authenticity of the experimentally-induced OBE.|$|E

25|$|His {{form in the}} Premier League {{picked up}} remarkably as he {{remained}} unbeaten in his final 11 matches which included a 7–4 victory over Van Gerwen. Taylor {{finished third in the}} table {{for the second year in}} a row to qualify for the play-offs. Taylor led Raymond van Barneveld 3–0 in the semi-finals but could only hit 26% of his doubles during the match and, ultimately was defeated 8–5. This was the first time that the Dutchman had beaten him in the tournament in 21 attempts. Later, Taylor said that the six missed darts at double to move 5–2 ahead had played heavily on his mind and had made him nervous during the match- a feeling which he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced</b> before during his 26-year career.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} linked smoking to anxiety disorders, {{suggesting}} the correlation (and possibly mechanism) {{may be related}} to the broad class of anxiety disorders, and not limited to just depression. Current and ongoing research attempt to explore the addiction-anxiety relationship. Data from multiple studies suggest that anxiety disorders and depression play a role in cigarette smoking. A history of regular smoking was observed more frequently among individuals who had experienced a major depressive disorder at some time in their lives than among individuals who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced</b> major depression or among individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. People with major depression are also much less likely to quit due to the increased risk of experiencing mild to severe states of depression, including a major depressive episode. Depressed smokers appear to experience more withdrawal symptoms on quitting, are less likely to be successful at quitting, and are more likely to relapse.|$|E

500|$|Fundraising for {{the statue}} {{had begun in}} 1882. The {{committee}} organized {{a large number of}} money-raising events. As part of one such effort, an auction of art and manuscripts, poet Emma Lazarus was asked to donate an original work. She initially declined, stating she could not write a poem about a statue. At the time, she was also involved in aiding refugees to New York who had fled anti-Semitic pogroms in eastern Europe. These refugees were forced to live in conditions that the wealthy Lazarus <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced.</b> She saw a way to express her empathy for these refugees in terms of the statue. The resulting sonnet, [...] "The New Colossus", including the iconic lines [...] "Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free", is uniquely identified with the Statue of Liberty and is inscribed on a plaque in the museum in its base.|$|E

500|$|Later {{experiments}} were devised {{to test the}} mother-child bond with mothers who had themselves been reared in isolation as infants.

Harlow found that once these monkeys gave birth, they cared little for their offspring writing, [...] "these monkey mothers that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced</b> love of any kind were devoid of love for their infants". While some mothers simply ignored their children, Harlow characterized others as [...] "evil" [...] and abusive and in some instances reported them [...] "crushing the infant's face to the floor, chewing off the infant's feet and fingers, and in one case... putting the infant's head in her mouth and crushing it like an eggshell".|$|E
500|$|Historian David Carter {{presents}} information {{indicating that}} the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those {{who worked in the}} Financial District. They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay Wall Street customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205people were in the bar that night. Patrons who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>experienced</b> a police raid were confused.

In frigid conditions at Yankee Stadium, Taylor carried 31 times for 85yards and scored the Packers' only touchdown against what was considered the league's best defense, both statistically and by reputation. Lombardi entrusted Taylor with the ball, as he was confident his fullback {{would be able to}} move the offense and not turn it over. The game was highlighted by the fierce rivalry between Taylor and Giants linebacker Sam Huff. The two clashed on nearly every play and engaged in trash talk throughout the game. Steve Sabol, who filmed the game with his father for NFL Films, described it as such:The lasting image of that game in my mind is the ferocity and anger of Jim Taylor ... his barely restrained rage as he ran with the ball. Taylor just got the shit kicked out of him all day long ... There was all this trash-talking between him and especially Sam Huff ... Tons of profanity when they tackled him.
