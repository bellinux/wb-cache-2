In this paper we use the National Systems of Entrepreneurship (NSE) as a conceptual framework in which to question whether SMEs take-up of tax credits has actually led {{to an increase in}} product, service, or process innovations. Our evidence suggests that (a) SME engagement with the policy is fairly randomly distributed across the sector, and (b) there is little additional product-service innovation to justify the expenditure in foregone taxes given the current <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits,</b> but (c) there is evidence of enhanced radical process innovations, particularly when combined with strong capability and planning at the firm level...|$|E

A social planner is assumed to initially distribute {{a certain number of}} travel credits to all eligible travelers, and then there are link-specific charges to travelers using that link. Free trading of credits among travelers is assumed. For a given credit distribution and credit charging scheme, the existence of a unique equilibrium link flow pattern is demonstrated with either fixed or elastic demand. It can be obtained by solving a standard traffic equilibrium model subject to a total credit consumption constraint. The credit price at equilibrium in the trading market is also conditionally unique. The appropriate <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> among travelers and correct selection of link-specific rates is shown to lead to the most desirable network flow patterns in a revenue-neutral manner.

The utility functions of different modes (car, bus, and bicycle) are developed {{by considering the}} income’s impact on travelers’ behaviors. Their purpose is to analyze the demand distribution of different modes. A social optimization model is built aiming at maximizing the social welfare. The optimal tradable credits scheme (<b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits,</b> credits charging, and the credit price), congestion pricing fees, bus frequency, and bus fare are obtained by solving the model. Mode choice behavior under the tradable credits scheme is also studied. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the model’s availability and explore {{the effects of the}} three schemes on traffic system’s performance. Results show congestion pricing would earn more social welfare than the other traffic measures. However, tradable credits scheme will give travelers more consumer surplus than congestion pricing. Travelers’ consumer surplus with congestion pricing is the minimum, which injures the travelers’ benefits.

In doing so the thesis discusses a bank in Bolivia, Caja Los Andes. It firstly examines the effect of the loans on the creditors' businesses. Even after taking selection effects into account there remains a strong positive effect of the loans on sales and assets. Secondly, repayment behaviour is analyzed. Taking the bank's declining repayment rates as a starting point, the thesis asks to what extent this development can be attributed to increasing competition and the economic downturn. It then shows that the effect of competition is two-fold. On the one hand, clients tend to pay more punctual in an area with high competition and supply of loans. On the other hand, clients with multiple loans at the same time are more likely to pay late...|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of activities aimed to mitigate global {{greenhouse gas emissions}} is more cost-efficient in developing countries than {{in most of the}} industrialized world. Thus it has been a major, but contentious topic in the climate negotiations to allow crediting of emissions reduction in developing countries towards domestic emission targets of industrial countries. The Kyoto Protocol instituted a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) that is to assure that the interests of all parties from industrialized and developing countries are equally represented. Many issues concerning the structure of the CDM remain to be decided. Crediting critically depends on these decisions. Credits should accrue only after verification. A crucial issue that influences all decisions on creation and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> is whether they are tradable. Concerning credit creation, it would be advisable not to set quotas on the share of CDM credited toward Annex-B targets as they give no dynamic incentive for innovation. To reach the latter goal, crediting should be gradually reduced in the long run. Crediting should also be related to externalities and thus be differentiated according to project categories. In a fund model, the reduction of credits could be evenly spread over all investors. In a clearinghouse model {{it would have to be}} related to each project. Uncertainties should not be covered through discounting but through a compulsory insurance. Credit sharing leads to higher costs for the investors and a lower demand for CDM projects. Free negotiation of the credit sharing ratio will lead to a competition between host countries. In case of tradability, host countries could set up projects with own funds to earn credits they can sell. Such a de facto extension of emissions trading could work against the goal of inducing developing countries to voluntarily adopt emission targets. This could be promoted by making credits non-tradable but allowing banking against future targets...|$|E
40|$|In face of {{the serious}} urban traffic {{congestion}} problem and consistent public rejection to congestion pricing, this dissertation proposes and studies a novel idea for traffic regulation – tradable credit scheme. With such a scheme, the social planner initially distributes {{a certain number of}} credits to all eligible travelers, charges a link-specific number of credits from travelers using that link, and allows for free trading of the credits among travelers. The performance of such tradable credit schemes in traffic regulation is investigated in general networks with both homogeneous users and heterogeneous users. In the homogeneous user case, we demonstrate that, given a credit charging and distribution scheme, a unique equilibrium link flow pattern with either fixed or elastic demand can be obtained by solving a standard traffic equilibrium model subject to a total credit consumption constraint, and the credit price at equilibrium of the trading market is unique under very mild conditions. As a result, through appropriate <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> among travelers and selection of link-specific credit charging rates, the tradable credit scheme can obtain and sustain most desirable network flow patterns, such as the social optimum and Pareto-improving flow pattern generated by the various congestion pricing or congestion pricing cum revenue-refunding schemes proposed in the literature, in a revenue-neutral manner. However, in the presence of user heterogeneity in terms of different VOTs, no equivalent convex program is identified to yield the user equilibrium (UE) and market equilibrium (ME) conditions from its KKT conditions. Therefore, the combined UE ad ME conditions are instead formulated into a VI problem with existence of solutions guaranteed. Sufficient conditions for unique aggregate UE link flows and credit price are provided. We also demonstrate how appropriate credit schemes can be set up to decentralize system optimal and Pareto-improving flow patterns. Similar as setting an optimal congestion price scheme, to set an appropriate credit scheme for system optimal flow patterns, we need complete information of the demand function, the speed-flow relationship, and the generalized cost (or value of time). To overcome the difficulty of demand function calibration in reality, trial-and-error methods for implementation of tradable credit scheme on both a single road and general networks are proposed. For the single road case, a tradable credit scheme is gradually adjusted by a modified bisection method based on observed credit price, whereas for the general network case, the scheme is updated by successive average method based on observed UE link flows and credit price. Last but not least, this dissertation firstly points out the non-convergence problem of the bisection-based trial-and-error method for congestion pricing proposed by Li (2002), and suggests a modified version to address this problem...|$|E
