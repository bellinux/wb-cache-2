But the clergy, including both Adalberon and Gerbert (who later became Pope Sylvester II), argued eloquently {{for the election}} of Hugh Capet, who was not only of royal blood but had proven himself through his actions and his military might.

500|$|There is no {{historical}} record about the temple, {{but there is}} a mention of the presiding deity Badrinath in Vedic scriptures, indicating the presence of the temple during the Vedic period (–500). According to some accounts, the temple was a Buddhist shrine till the 8th century and Adi Shankara converted it to a Hindu temple. The architecture of the temple resembling that of a Buddhist vihara (temple) and the brightly painted facade which is atypical of Buddhist temples leads to the argument. Other accounts relate that it was originally established as a pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the ninth century. It is believed that Shankara resided in the place for six years from 814 to 820. He resided six months in Badrinath {{and the rest of the}} year in Kedarnath. Hindu followers assert that he discovered the image of Badrinath in the Alaknanda River and enshrined it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs. A traditional story asserts that Shankara expelled all the Buddhists in the region with the help of the Parmar ruler king Kanak Pal. The <b>hereditary</b> <b>successors</b> of the king governed the temple and endowed villages to meet its expenses. The income from a set of villages on the route to the temple was used to feed and accommodate pilgrims. The Parmar rulers held the title [...] "Bolanda Badrinath", meaning speaking Badrinath. They had other titles, including Shri 108 Basdrishcharyaparayan Garharj Mahimahendra, Dharmabibhab and Dharamarakshak Sigamani.|$|R

40|$|The {{succession}} of the sultans {{is one of}} the main points of dispute in Islamic history, because of the vagueness of the Islamic law of succession. In the case of the Sultanate of Delhi, some Indian scholars, discussing this subject rather abstractly, have classified the succession into such categories as election, nomination, heredity and revolution. It is quite necessary, however, to analyze the succession with reference to the power relation between the sultans and the nobles on the one hand and between the nobles themselves on the other. Such an analysis, throws light on the nature of the kingship, the aristocrasy, and the structure of the sultanate. This article is my first analysis for the period of the so-called “Slave Dynasty. ”The main conclusions are that: 1) Actual power was the fundamental criterion in deciding the succession. 2) Albari Turks enjoyed the definite advantage over other tribal elements. (The Khilji revolution was important, because it broke this tradition.) 3. Powerful sultans like Iltutmish and Balban were usually succeeded for a time by their direct descendants. 4) Still, from the cases of Raziya or Kaikhusrau-Kaiqbad it is clear that even when powerful sultans had nominated their successors, the fundamental form of the election by the nobles could supercede this decision. 5) The relative power of factions in the nobility was one of the most important factors. Behind the weak, <b>hereditary</b> <b>successors</b> of Iltutmish there was a sort of balance of powers within the nobility of the “Chehalgani” (the Fourty), and when Balban gained the ascendancy and the balance was lost, the direct heirs of Iltutmish could no longer retain their position...|$|R
5000|$|He {{wrote the}} {{following}} {{about the specific}} case of the inheritance of political power: [...] "Strong emphasis was placed {{at all levels of}} Shang society on the ranking of descent lines within clans and on birth order among siblings of the same sex. Power and authority passed from a man to his eldest son or from older to younger brothers within a specific descent line. Supreme power was vested in the senior line of the Zi clan. Males who were closely related to reigning or previous kings held important court offices or administered territories. Regional offices tended to remain hereditary in the senior male line of their occupants. As the state expanded, new territories were established where younger sons of officials might be installed. Thus officials of higher genealogical status tended to hold land closer to the centre of the state and participated in the functioning of the court while others lived farther away. As lineages expanded, it was increasingly difficult to find positions for younger sons {{that would allow them to}} maintain an upper-class lifestyle. Territories were also assigned to leaders of clans that supported the Zi, while some conquered rulers were allowed to govern all or part of their former territories as Shang vassals. These officials were permitted to marry female members of the royal clan, and some of the most important of them married women of the royal lineage. The Shang upper class thus became a network of officials related directly or indirectly to the king. Officials who governed administrative territories bore the titles hou (archer lord?), bo (patriarch?), and tian or dian (field lord). While these positions normally were <b>hereditary,</b> <b>successors,</b> at least at the higher levels, had to be confirmed by the king, who could also promote or remove individuals from their offices. Officials who headed junior branches of a clan remained ritually and socially subordinate to the leaders of the senior branches from which they had split off, even when they lived far apart".|$|R
5000|$|Mehtar Shuja ul-Mulk reigned under a Council of Regency {{until he}} came of age and was {{invested}} with full ruling powers. He ruled for 41 years, during which Chitral enjoyed an unprecedented period of internal peace. He visited various parts of India and met a number of fellow rulers. In the winter of 1899-1900, Shuja ul-Mulk in company of the Chief of the Gilgit Agency visited the Viceroy of India at Calcutta. It {{was the first of}} a series of visits which immensely enlarged his mental horizon. In May 1902, the Mehtar was present at the Vice-Regal Durbar at Peshawar. He was invited to the Delhi Durbar and attended the Coronation Durbar at Delhi in 1903 [...] where he was made Companion of the Indian Empire (C.I.E). He attended the Coronation Darbar at Delhi again in 1911. In 1919, in recognition of his loyalty and services during the recently concluded Third Anglo-Afghan War, Shuja ul-Mulk was granted a personal salute of 11-guns, along with a Knighthood by being appointed Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, with the title of His Highness following in 1920. The salute and title were made permanent and <b>hereditary</b> to his <b>successors</b> in 1932.|$|R
