40|$|Magnesium sheet alloys {{have huge}} {{potential}} in automotive closure applications {{due to their}} light weight. However, their limited room temperature formability restricts their widespread applications. Microstructure (both geometric and crystallographic) {{plays a key role}} in dictating the formability of an alloy. In this research, a systematic study of the microstructure evolution of a hot-rolled AZ 31 sheet during thermal annealing was carried out, and the effect of microstructure on room-temperature deformation was characterized. The initial <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>sheet</b> had a dominant basal texture with equiaxed grains and shear bands. The annealing treatment imparted to the sheet alloy triggered an anomalous, inhomogeneous grain growth in grains with a large deviation from the basal orientation. At 350 degrees C annealing temperature, a bimodal grain size distribution of grains with basal and non-basal orientations was observed, and this combination was shown to significantly enhance ductility resulting from a complex interplay between slip and twinning deformation mechanisms. This key finding is expected to contribute to the development of engineered microstructures for enhanced room temperature formability in this alloy. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of the boron concentration on phase transformation characteristics, microstructure and mechanical properties of multiphase steels was investigated using computational thermodynamics (Thermo-Calc®), dilatometry, quantitative metallography and tensile tests. Pilot scale 50 kg steel ingots were prepared in an induction furnace operating under an argon gas atmosphere with boron contents between 0 and 47 ppm. The ingots were cut into 35 mm thick blocks, which were reheated to 1250 °C for 1 h and hot rolled for seven passes to attain a thickness of 7. 0 mm. The <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>sheets</b> were machined and then cold rolled to a final thickness of 1. 2 mm. Continuous annealing cycles were performed in a Bähr dilatomer and in a Gleeble machine. Continuous annealing laboratory simulations showed that boron did not significantly influence the amount of austenite formed during heating and soaking steps. However, boron influenced austenite transformation during the cooling step, which reduced the amount of ferrite and increased the amount of bainite. Regarding the mechanical properties, adding boron increased strength and decreased ductility of the product. The steels with boron concentrations up to 27 ppm exhibited the greatest effect. The amount of austenite, which was calculated using Thermo-Calc®, was slightly overestimated compared with that obtained by dilatometry and metallography, particularly for soaking temperatures lower than 800 °C...|$|R

The proposed concepts comprise mainly the alloying elements that improve the atmospheric corrosion resistance (Cu, Ni, P and Cr) {{and those that}} facilitate the adjustment of dual phase microstructure during processing by hot rolling (C, Mn and Si). Moreover, Nb and combined Nb-Mo additions are utilized to enable the controlled-thermomechanical processing and to tailor the mechanical properties.

40|$|Fe 43. 5 Mn 34 Al 15 Ni 7. 5 {{shape memory}} alloys have {{attracted}} attention as potential superelasticity alloys in server environments, capable of exhibiting good superelastic behavior {{with up to}} 5 % recoverable strain over a wide temperature range from - 196 ?C to 240 ?C. The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of martensite variants, aging heat treatment, crystal orientations and grain size on the superelastic properties. Although the theoretical transformation strain of single crystal with the orientation in tension (26. 5 %) is higher {{than it is in}} compression (10. 5 %), the compression sample shows a better recoverable strain than that in the tension sample from the experimental results. The differences in reversibility and the shape of the stress-strain curves under tension and compression are attributed to the lower number of martensite variants activated under tension as compared to compression. The effect of aging has profound influences on the size and volume fraction of precipitates, transformation temperatures, stress-temperature phase diagram, recoverable strain and stress hysteresis. Increasing the aging times improves the superelastic strain in compression and decreases it in tension. The reason for these is related to the selection of martensite variants. The crystal orientations affect the superelastic properties such as the stress-temperature phase diagram and transformation strain. The differences in the slope of the stress-temperature curves and critical stress in different orientation are attributed to the transformation strain and resolved shear stress factors, respectively. Aging heat treatment decreases the orientation effect on slope of stress-temperature curve.

The processes controlling work hardening and removing it were identified by microstructure evolution observations in different stages of compression with the amount of true strain 4 x 0. 23.
