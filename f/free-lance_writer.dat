500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1940 Popular doubled Pohl's {{salary to}} twenty dollars per week.

500|$|Later that year, Captain Sheldon gave Roddenberry an {{additional}} position as technical adviser {{for a new}} television version of Mr. District Attorney. Having spent the intervening years dissecting any scripts {{he could get his}} hands on, and comparing them to the television output, Roddenberry advised the head of the studio's story department that he could write scripts as good as the ones they were using. He submitted his first script on October 22, 1953, under his pseudonym [...] "Robert Wesley". It went into production as episode 9b, [...] "Defense Plant Gambling".

500|$|At the time, Crane was {{intermittently}} {{employed as}} a <b>free-lance</b> <b>writer,</b> contributing articles to various New York City newspapers. He began writing what would become The Red Badge of Courage in June 1893, while living with his older brother Edmund in Lake View, New Jersey. Crane conceived the story {{from the point of}} view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war, only to become disillusioned by war's reality. He took the private's surname, [...] "Fleming," [...] from his sister-in-law's maiden name. He would later relate that the first paragraphs came to him with [...] "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed." [...] Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning. Because he could not afford a typewriter, he carefully wrote in ink on legal-sized paper, occasionally crossing through or overlying a word. If he changed something, he would rewrite the whole page. He later moved to New York City, where he completed the novel in April 1894.|$|E

In August 1991, Casolaro was found dead in a hotel room where he was staying. The initial coroner's report ruled his death suicide, but Casolaro's family and friends were suspicious, and a lengthy second autopsy was conducted. This too ruled Casolaro's death a suicide, but House investigators noted that [...] "The suspicious circumstances surrounding his death have led some law enforcement professionals and others to believe that his death may not have been a suicide," [...] and strongly urged further investigation.|$|E

40|$|The Writer {{carries out}} a {{research}} for her thesis entitled {{the study of}} ambiguity in the articles of Hello English magazine because she is interested in knowing whether the ambiguity appears in Hello English magazine. This thesis {{is limited to the}} articles, which are written by the <b>free-lance</b> <b>writers</b> in Hello English magazine published on February 2001 to April 2001 editions. The problems, which come up in this study are which structurally ambiguous sentences are, and which lexically ambiguous sentences are by looking at the deep structures of both types of ambiguity, and how the occurrence of ambiguous sentences in the articles of Hello English magazine are. In this study, the writer uses a qualitative method because she wants to analyze the ambiguous sentences using the theory that she has. In doing this study, she does not concern about the reason why the ambiguity occurs. For the analysis, the writer uses theory of Radford's and Bornstein's transformational grammar by generating the deep structures using tree diagrams and the theory of Jacobs' and Rosenbaum's on lexical features as additional theory. After getting the findings, which she finds ten types of structural ambiguity and three types of lexical ambiguity, she concludes the findings. In the conclusion she finds that the structural ambiguity appears more than the lexical ambiguity...|$|R

5000|$|However, Abert {{warns that}} the reason why Grimm's Journal [...] "nonetheless needs {{to be treated with}} caution is due to the {{personality}} of its principal contributor, for Grimm was not sufficiently well trained as a musician to do justice to the art that he was describing, nor was he the man to let slip the opportunity for a flash of wit or eloquent turn of phrase, even if it meant violating the truth in the process." [...] Grimm's second prediction {{at the end of the}} same letter didn't turn out as prescient as the first one: [...] "If these children live, they will not remain at Salzburg. Before long monarchs will vie for their possession." [...] In fact, Mozart was unable to obtain employment as an opera composer from a European court and remained a <b>free-lance</b> opera <b>writer</b> all his life.|$|R
