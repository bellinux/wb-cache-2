40|$|Calculating the {{increase}} in fatality risk when exceeding the speed limit. The Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment (IenM) in the Netherlands has developed a toolkit to support the provinces, municipalities, water boards and regional community organisations in their communication about driving speed on the underlying road network which decentralized authorities are responsible for: - 30 km/hour residential area; - urban 50 km/hour road; - 60 km/hour residential area; - rural 80 km/hour road. One {{of the purposes of}} this communication toolkit is to make the users understand that the most common exceeding of the speed limit by drivers (up to 20 km/hour above the limit) increases the fatality risk for vulnerable road users considerably. This can be illustrated by the fatality rate {{in the event of a}} collision between a pedestrian and a car at different driving <b>speeds</b> and <b>excess</b> <b>speeds.</b> IenM has asked SWOV to supply the required data. This report presents the tables and graphs for the fatality rate of pedestrians in a collision with a car at different travel speeds. Furthermore, it contains the tables and graphs for the braking distance for different driving speeds, in dry and in wet weather conditions. On 30, 50 and 60 km/hour roads the pedestrian’s fatality rate roughly doubles when the car exceeds the limit by 10 km/hour. On a 50 km/hour road, for example, about 1 in 10 pedestrians dies at an impact velocity of 50 km/hour. At 60 km/hour (10 km/hour above the limit) 2 in 10 pedestrians sustain fatal injury and a crash at 70 km/hour (20 km/hour above the limit) is fatal for more than 3 in 10 pedestrians. The braking distance also increases at higher speeds. For example, an emergency manoeuvre on the dry surface of a 50 km/hour road, increases the braking distance by about 30 % at 10 km/hour above the limit. This is an extra distance of 8 m. If, also in dry conditions, the driving speed is 70 km/hour (20 km/hour above the limit), the extra braking distance at an emergency stop is 17 m, or approximately 65 % longer than at the speed limit of 50 km/hour. On a wet road surface the braking distance at an emergency stop is considerably longer than in dry conditions. This applies to both the stopping distance at the speed limit in force and for the extra braking distance that is required when the limit is exceeded. The tables in Chapter 3 contain the information for all speeds according to the speed limit and for the <b>excess</b> <b>speeds</b> that were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The study {{analysed}} 13, 390 {{police records}} of road traffic accidents (RTAs) covering a {{three and a}} half year period according to different suspected aetiological factors. The majority of the accidents were recorded for vehicles in good condition on well-paved straight roads with well-operating traffic light systems. Adverse weather conditions such as precipitation, fog and dust were of minimal importance, with most of the accidents being reported during sunny days during the rush period of 12 noon to 3 pm. Driver’s error was identified as the main contributing factor in about two thirds of all RTAs mainly as reckless driving and <b>excess</b> <b>speeding.</b> About 27 % of the drivers were professional drivers and 41 % were in the age group 25 - 35 years in good health with no alcohol or drug intake. Hence, human errors may be attributed to carelessness, experience, lack of knowledge or attention, over-exhaustion or fatigue. The effects of physical stressors on performance of drivers need to be further explored and clarified but this need not under-estimate the importance of vehicle and environment since most accidents are multifactoral and a slight change in them may effectively enhance perception and minimise personal error. Recommendations for remedial measures adopting an interdisciplinary approach are presented...|$|R
50|$|In {{the single}} vehicle accidents, {{motorcycle}} rider error was present as the accident precipitating factor in {{about two-thirds of}} the cases, with the typical error being a slide-out and fall due to overbraking or running wide on a curve due to <b>excess</b> <b>speed</b> or lack of side bite.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that this}} means that a {{relatively}} small extra delta-v above that needed to accelerate to the escape speed results in a relatively large speed at infinity.

30|$|Lynn and Lockwood [24] {{found that}} the average mileage of a company car in England was more than double that of a privately owned car. Furthermore, the crash rate of company cars totaled 0.19 crashes per driver per year, {{compared}} to 0.10 for drivers of privately owned car on work-related car trips and 0.08 for non-work-related trips. The researchers reported that even after controlling for differences in mileage, company car drivers are 50  % {{more likely to be}} involved in a car crash than are other drivers. Therefore, the proportion of company car drivers involved in collisions is higher than their share in the fleet [21]. Clarke et al. [6, 7] {{found that the}} main reason for road crashes involving company cars in Great Britain was <b>excess</b> <b>speeds.</b> Dimmer and Parker [11] found that 27  % of company car drivers reported involvement in at least one crash over the previous 3 -year period, which is considerably higher than the 18  % reported by drivers of privately owned cars in Great Britain. They also concluded that driving under pressure in company cars was a significant cause of crashes of these cars. The foregoing findings suggest that these drivers tend to drive above-average mileage and are exposed to a variety of stressors [21]. The implication is that these factors constitute particular risk factors that are associated with company car drivers and that result in higher collision liability [10, 27].|$|R

In his minority report, Mr. McAdams' said that he would have found the probable cause of the accident to be the Delta crew's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway, and the tower's failure to request additional and precise information prior to clearing TWA 159 for takeoff.|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{recently}} developed Bayesian spatial and ecological regression models {{are applied to}} analyse small-area variation in accident and injury. This study serves to demonstrate how Bayesian modelling techniques can be implemented to assess potential risk factors measured at group (e. g. area) level. Presented here is a unified modelling framework that enables thorough investigations into associations between injury rates and regional characteristics, residual variation and spatial autocorrelation. Using hospital separation data for 83 local health areas in British Columbia (BC), Canada, in 1990 – 1999, we explore and examine ecological/contextual determinants of motor vehicle accident injury (MVAI) among male children and youth aged 0 – 24 {{and for those of}} six age groups (< 1, 1 – 4, 5 – 9, 10 – 14, 15 – 19 and 20 – 24). Eighteen local health area characteristics are studied. They include a broad spectrum of socio-economic indicators, residential environment indicators (roads and parks), medical services availability and utilisation, population health, proportion of recent immigrants, crime rates, rates of speeding charge and rates of seatbelt violation. Our study indicates a large regional variation in MVAI in males aged 0 – 24 in British Columbia, Canada, in 1990 – 1999, and that adjusting for appropriate risk factors eliminates nearly all the variation observed. Socio-economic influence on MVAI was profoundly apparent in young males of all ages with the injury being more common in communities of lower socio-economic status. High adult male crime rates were significantly associated with high injury rates of boys aged 1 – 14.
