5|$|The Schießbefehl was, not surprisingly, very {{controversial}} in the West and was {{singled out for}} criticism by the West Germans. The GDR authorities occasionally suspended the Schießbefehl on occasions when {{it would have been}} politically inconvenient to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> dead refugees, such as during a visit to the GDR by the French foreign minister in 1985. It was also a problem for many of the East German guards and was the motivating factor behind a number of escapes, when guards facing a crisis of conscience defected because of their unwillingness to shoot fellow citizens.|$|E
5|$|Yet it {{also seems}} to many that science will {{eventually}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> such experiences. This follows from an assumption {{about the possibility of}} reductive explanations. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency). In the case of mental states, this means {{that there needs to be}} an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E

500|$|The wooden {{uprights}} {{between the}} wings of the Wright glider were braced by wires in their own version of Chanute's modified Pratt truss, a bridge-building design he used for his biplane glider (initially built as a triplane). The Wrights mounted the horizontal elevator in front of the wings rather than behind, apparently believing this feature would help to avoid, or protect them, from a nosedive and crash like the one that killed Lilienthal. [...] Wilbur incorrectly believed a tail was not necessary, and their first two gliders did not have one. According to some Wright biographers, Wilbur probably did all the gliding until 1902, perhaps to exercise his authority as older brother and to protect Orville from harm as {{he did not want to}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> to Bishop Wright if Orville got injured.|$|E
500|$|In the March 15, 2003 {{episode of}} Saturday Night Live, Tina Fey {{reported}} {{this on the}} satirical Weekend Update: [...] "In a related story, in France, American cheese is now referred to as 'idiot cheese'." [...] The 2006 documentary Freedom Fries: And Other Stupidity We'll <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Explain</b> to Our Grandchildren directed by Carl Christman took a comedic viewpoint on American consumerism and patriotism. In the episode [...] "Stan Knows Best" [...] of American Dad!, after being asked how his French toast is, the main character Stan remarks: [...] "Smelly and ungrateful! But this American toast is delicious." [...] In the comic strip Doonesbury, the characters Mark Slackmeyer and Zonker Harris criticized the name change in French. Slackmeyer said that, translated, the U.S. liberated France in World War II; and that many French newspaper headlines after 9/11 were [...] "We are all American". At the end, he states that the anti-French were [...] "jingoistic, self-regarding conquer-monkeys!" [...] The French American indie band Freedom Fry chose their name based on the Freedom Fries phenomenon. In 2005, Robert Plant and his band Strange Sensation released the album Mighty ReArranger, which contains the track '"Freedom Fries", an anti-war song whose lyrics contains the words [...] "Freedom fries and burns and scars, the liberator goes too far".|$|E

500|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by freelance writer Kenji Terada, based on a story by Sakaguchi. Ishii heavily influenced the game's setting with his idea of the crystals. He also suggested illustrator Yoshitaka Amano as character designer, but Sakaguchi declined at first as {{he had never heard}} the artist's name before. When Sakaguchi showed Ishii some drawings on magazine clippings and told him that this was the art style he was looking for, Ishii revealed to him that these were actually created by Amano, hence leading to his involvement in the game. The music for Final Fantasy was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and marked his 16th video game music composition. Iranian-American programmer Nasir Gebelli was hired to code the game. He initially tried to understand all aspects of the gameplay but was soon advised by Sakaguchi to just program the design concepts so he did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> everything to Gebelli in detail. Among the other developers were graphic designer Kazuko Shibuya, programmers Kiyoshi Yoshii and Ken Narita, as well as debugger Hiroyuki Ito. When the project started to show promise, designer Hiromichi Tanaka and his [...] "B-Team" [...] joined to aid development. The lack of faith in Sakaguchi's team, as well as its unpopularity within the company, motivated the staff members to give their best.|$|E
500|$|Other {{stories were}} {{developed}} from simple concepts. For example, the reformed-vampire episode [...] "Bloodlust" [...] {{was developed to}} suggest that all monsters should not be killed indiscriminately. The plot alluded to [...] "racial issues", but not blatantly; rather, as Padalecki noted, they explored it in a [...] "fun way". The episode [...] "The Usual Suspects" [...] emerged from the writers' desire to keep the audience guessing. Cathryn Humphris pitched a story with a ghost serving as a death omen—warning people of future tragedy, {{rather than trying to}} kill them, unlike previous ghosts on the series. However, Humphris had trouble developing the script's outline. Kripke noted a part of the episode in which brothers are arrested and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> to police what had happened; this scenario ultimately became the framework of the episode, which begins with Sam and Dean being taken into custody. The concept for [...] "Tall Tales" [...] originated as a [...] "he said, he said" [...] episode, in which the brothers would recount conflicting versions of the same storyline. The writers deliberated over the use of five or six monsters in trying to find one appropriate for the episode, but eventually settled on a trickster because it [...] "can do everything [...] want it to". Although the writers typically prefer to put their own spin on folklore, they decided in this case to remain faithful to the archetypal trickster mythos. Because the season alluded to the possibility of Sam becoming bad, the writers wanted to portray how an evil Sam would behave and what Dean's reaction would be. One of the writers' first creative ideas of the season was depicted in the teaser of [...] "Born Under a Bad Sign", in which a blood-covered Sam wakes up not remembering the past week of his life. The plot, which [...] "fell into place" [...] during the writing process, included demonic possession to explain Sam's actions—an event that resulted in the return of the vengeful Meg Masters demon.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} draft of the script, Rubin had not wanted to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> to the {{audience}} how Phil got in the loop, and so had the movie start in medias res, with Phil already {{in the midst of the}} looping; the audience would have followed one of his days after waking up to [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] where he is already aware of what will be happening, and thus provoking curiosity to the audience; the film would then have used voice-over narration by Phil to provide some of the backstory. Rita also would confess to being trapped in a time loop of her own. Rubin considered this draft more in line with the black comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets, particularly on how Phil's suicides were presented.|$|E
2500|$|On November 3, 1978, Hunt gave a security-classified {{deposition}} for the House Select Committee on Assassinations. He denied {{knowledge of}} any conspiracy to kill Kennedy. (The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) released the deposition in February 1996.) Two newspaper articles published {{a few months}} before the deposition stated that a 1966 CIA memo linking Hunt to the assassination of President Kennedy had recently been provided to the HSCA. The first article, by Victor Marchetti– author of the book The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence (1974)– appeared in the Liberty Lobby newspaper The Spotlight on August 14, 1978. According to Marchetti, the memo said in essence, [...] "Some day we will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> Hunt's presence in Dallas on November 22, 1963."
