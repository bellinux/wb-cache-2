40|$|The work re-examines {{the nature}} and causes of <b>economic</b> <b>dualism</b> in the {{underdeveloped}} countries and considers some of its implications for development policy. Dualism may {{be defined as the}} co-existence of a “modern” sector and a “traditional” sector within the domestic economic framework of a country. Existing theories attempt to explain {{the differences between the two}} sectors in terms of sociological and technological factors. In contrast, the author argues that the most significant aspect of <b>economic</b> <b>dualism</b> as it exists in the present-day underdeveloped countries is that scarce inputs such as capital funds, foreign exchange and public economic facilities are being made available on excessively favourable terms to the larger units in the modern sector, and on excessively unfavourable terms to the small economic units in the traditional sector. This interpretation emphasises the importance of domestic policies to promote integration by removing the causes of unequal access to scarce economic resources. JEL: F 31, E 22, O 20, O 38 </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{dual economy}} model, built on {{classical}} foundations, {{served as the}} cornerstone of development theory for several decades after World War II. It subsequently came under neo-classical micro-econometric attack and has fallen into general disuse, at least within the Anglo-Saxon academic establishment. This paper presents a brief intellectual history of the framework and tries to respond {{to some of the}} criticisms that have been leveled against it - some peripheral, others central. We then proceed to inquire into the usefulness of the dual economy model for understanding both historical and contemporary real world situations and for development policy.

In the next two sections we follow Chichilnisky in working out a longer run, Lewis-style model in which <b>economic</b> <b>dualism</b> plus an elastic labor supply can lead to severe problems with realization of the marketed surplus and agricultural exports abroad.

40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty years in particular, a number of papers have {{examined}} various issues concerning the Japanese accounting system. However, previous research has largely ignored the importance of Japanese contextual factors. As such, the objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a holistic theoretical contextual framework for examining the Japanized process of convergence, which aims at integrating the Japanese-specific accounting system with the Anglo-American model, thereby achieving de facto (actual) convergence. This framework includes three heterogeneous genealogies, namely, Accounting Monism, Economic Monism, and <b>Economic</b> and Accounting <b>Dualism,</b> and four contextual dimensions, including legal, historical, political, and economic environments. The results show that because Japan has both globalized large-scale capital markets and well-organized related infrastructures, which include financial systems, governance structures, related laws, auditing standards, and standards-setting bodies, it would be futile to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) without reforming these and related facilities and resources. The findings also show that <b>Economic</b> and Accounting <b>Dualism</b> aims at reconciling heterogeneous concepts in accounting practices, such as future and past measurement attributes, asset-liability and revenue-expense based income, ex ante and ex post income calculation, and information providing role and reconciliation role of financial reporting. Excessive emphasis on Economic Monism and fair value disregards the fact that Japan is undergoing a prolonged, complex, and controversial process for aligning its entire accounting system with IFRS. Importantly, the partial suspension of fair value measurement and the swing-back towards historical cost measurement caused by the recent global financial crisis revealed that fair value is not unconditionally fair. We suggest that social, historical, political, and economic factors cannot be ignored in this rush towards global convergence of financial reporting. We further argue that accounting research can be enhanced by examining the contextual factors in which the uniqueness of accounting system is embedded. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is twofold. First, the possible links between the feared decrease {{of the formation of}} savings and the strong territorial imbalances that characterised the demographic evolution are examined. Second, the authors aim to demonstrate that it makes sense {{to address the problem of}} lack of savings in the global economy above all if it is seen in relative terms, comparing it with the specific investment needs that must be met in order to mitigate economic and demographic imbalances. Attention is focused on a specific and particularly significant aspect of the problem: that of the relationship between family savings and optimal accumulation of human capital at different stages of economic development and population growth.

30|$|Despite the {{importance}} of these studies in providing fundamental insights for policy-makers, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no evidence had been provided on patterns of labour market transitions based on GDP per capita at the region level or individual age, ceteris paribus (e.g. regulatory frameworks). This analysis is important for Italy mainly for three reasons: (a) the country is characterised by <b>economic</b> <b>dualism,</b> with a large disparity between north and south in terms of GDP per capita; (b) the country is characterised by low internal labour mobility due to the frictional effects of factors such as distance, transaction costs, and regional amenities (for further details, see for example Faini et. 1997; Ward–Warmedinger and Macchiarelli 2013); and (c) the issue of unemployment, especially among the youngest generations. In light of these issues, our assumption is that a young individual who lives, for example, in a territory with optimal economic characteristics should have more labour market opportunities than one who resides in an economic territory with poor opportunities, ceteris paribus (including the regulatory framework). Under this framework, we also assume that an individual has opportunities to find (or maintain) a job in their region of residence. Hence, he/she should not be obliged to migrate from his/her residence to find a job.|$|E

However, both individually and jointly, {{have failed to}} ensure economics fundamental goal of well-being for human societies. In response, social enterprise economics (third sector), which features cooperatives and not-for-profit social enterprises {{in the name of}} foundations, trusts/awqāf, social businesses, and similar undertakings, has emerged as a make-up strategy to meet the minimum unmet requirements for social well-being. However, there is a strongly felt belief that the social enterprise economics needs to be broadened and mainstreamed in order to include entirely charitable institutions, predominantly not-for-profit operations, and predominantly for-profit businesses but blended with social justice via provision of social welfare programs like corporate social responsibility, etc., for its emancipation as a major economic system {{to be able to play}} a leading role for ensuring desirable economic growth and development.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the extent and}} trends of regional income inequality in China and Indonesia, and performs a comparative analysis between these two countries in terms of factors determining regional income inequality. There {{are a number of}} studies that have analyzed the relationship between economic development and regional income inequality in China and Indonesia. However, most previous studies employed provincial income and population data to measure regional income inequality and were thus unable to measure inequality within provinces. In order to rectify this drawback, we will use district-level income and population data, rather than provincial data, to measure regional income inequality, and examine not only between-province inequalities but also within-province inequalities by using the two-stage nested Theil decomposition method developed by Akita (2002). China and Indonesia are still at a relatively early stage of economic development; therefore, income-enhancing economic activities tend to have concentrated in a few districts in each province to enjoy agglomeration economies. We will show that a very large regional income inequality exists among the districts of China and Indonesia. This study will also conduct a regression analysis to explore possible determinants of within-province income inequality, in which the following variables are considered: foreign direct investment, <b>economic</b> <b>dualism,</b> and migration. ...|$|E

In addition, by means of hierarchical clustering methodologies the set of economies are segmented. By using the average distance, the study identifies two main performance clubs resembling {{the long run}} prediction of two converge clubs. On the other hand, the distance correlation shows different co-movements between {{members of the same}} cluster, indicating a variety of responses to external shocks. In particular the average distance identifies a clear division between a high performance club consisting of regions from the Center North, and a low performance club composed by regions from the South and islands. The presence of a cluster composed by center north regions is substantially confirmed by the distance correlation analysis, suggesting an homogeneous response to external shock. By contrast Southern regions display the same dynamical evolution but difference in co-movements.

The measure of economic performance is given by the level and the growth rates of per capita GDP. Using the concept of economic regime, we introduce a notion of distance between the dynamical paths of the Italian regions. Afterwards, a Minimal Spanning Tree and a Hierarchical Tree are constructed from time series {{in order to assess}} the existence of groups of regions sharing similar economic performance. Two main clusters are identified, representing high performance and low performance regions, alongside other two small clusters displaying regions with similar dynamic behaviour. The high performance cluster comprises mainly regions from the north, showing the presence of agglomeration externalities. Turning to the evolution of clusters, we see a similar path until 1975, after which the two groups start to slightly diverge. Studying the evolution of each cluster’s diameter we find substantial convergence within the two groups. Splitting the sample into two periods (1975 - 1993 and 1994 - 2005) the hypothesis of two performance clubs is confirmed. The club shift of some regions hints a strong effect on regional economic dynamics of the Italian 1994 crisis. The final analysis of the distance between the two clusters show that in the first period (1975 - 1993) the distance between the two group was constant, while in the second one (1994 - 2005) it has increased. economic convergence, <b>economic</b> <b>dualism,</b> hierarchical clustering...|$|E

The Report asks why, if the origins of <b>economic</b> <b>dualism</b> {{are rooted in the}} cheap, forced, migrant labour introduced by the mining industry and reinforced during apartheid, does dualism persist under democracy when all the relevant laws and many of the practices of the past have been abolished? The breakdown of apartheid did not immediately translate into improved material conditions for the majority of South Africans: 300 years of colonialism and 50 of internal colonialism had hard-wired a duality into the system. Two worlds, which may be conceptualised as the first and second economies, coexisted: a globally integrated world of production, exchange and consumption, and a constrained world of informality, poverty and marginalisation.

The study of a course of business cycle is presented with the use of numerical model with several simplifying assumptions being made. Beginning of a cycle, in both of the systems is marked by ridding of bottle-necks performed in capitalism by means of investments in branches producing final consumption, goods, and in sociailism by investments In branches developing resources.

Both systems enter their optimum stages where unutilization of productive powers effected by existence of bottle necks is lowest, in economy treated as a whole. Further development, forced by internal mechanisms results in a return to the initial stage of structural disequilibrium.

40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>dualism</b> of the {{developing}} countries consisting in co-existence of capitalist sector and state property along with a sector representing pre-capitalistic production relations, reveals its spatial aspect in concentrating the first sector in huge urban agglomerations {{and the existence of}} agriculture in the remaining regions. Many authors hope that a process of industrialization of those countries with the revolutionary function of industry towards traditional agriculture yould level spatial and sector disproportions in economy. Yet, the analysis of basic directions of industrialization in {{the developing}} countries, carried out according to sources of accumulation (industrialization by foreign investments, by private internal capital and by a state) does not confirm that thesis. Contrary, features of the developed industries effect a stable growth of a spatial and sectorial concentration of economic development what in turn results in concentration of incomes. In consequence, the stable dichotomy between growth enclaves and regions and sectors of structural stagnation exists. The verifying material in this respect is furnished by experiences of the so called newly industrialized states. Basic features of industry in those countries causing the mechanism of self expanding concentration of economic development both spatially and sectorially are a subject of analysis. The following have to be ranked among them: use of technology which its not adjusted to labor market in those states., carrying out industrialization on the basis of mostly foreign sources, orienting certain types of production exclusively onto foreign markets; in respect of the industry designed for the internal market a structural limitation of capacities and stimuli for internal accumulation is the discussed feature.

40|$|In the {{contemporary}} context {{of economic and}} public finance crisis, on one side {{there is a strong}} need to boost the industrial productivity through investment in research and technology; on the other side the public budget constraints call for prudency. In this context the need for systematic evaluations of public incentives to firms is particularly strong. In this context, the paper offers an evaluation exercise on the major instruments used to promote R&D and innovation activities of Italian firms. The analysis concentrates in particular on the incentives offered by Law 46 / 1982 (and revisions) and their effects on firms expenditures and employment in R&D. The Law represents the main national funding program as well as the longest lasting single instrument for technology and innovation promotion, although revisions of the Law have occurred. In addition to Law 46 / 1982, Italian firms have the chance to benefit from a larger span of public subsidies, particularly at the regional and local level. This makes the counterfactual question of “what would have happened without the policy” particularly interesting since it is likely, and this is confirmed by the data, that firms that do not access to the incentives of Law 46 / 82 benefit from other sources of public financing. Therefore it is particularly important to consider the effects of Law 46 / 82 not just in the hypothetical situation of complete absence of policy intervention, but also when other similar laws are at work. For this reason besides the difference-in-difference estimation, the paper analyses the effects of Law 46 / 1982 through a difference-in-difference-in-difference model, which allows to verify whether the interaction between different kinds of incentives has a multiplicative or a substitutive effect. The paper also addresses another typical aspect of evaluation studies: the average effect of the policy normally retrieved seems to be not sufficiently informative, especially in a country characterized by a marked territorial <b>economic</b> <b>dualism</b> (Centre-North vs. South) and by a strong presence of small-medium firms, with profoundly different characteristics from large firms. In other words the effects of the policy instrument might vary substantially among firms.

40|$|Even in {{the context}} of neo-classical theory, {{characterized}} by a strong trust in the virtues of the free market, the need for a policy intervention in the field of research and innovation is theorized, {{because of the presence of}} market failures. In the contemporary context of economic and public finance crisis, on one side there is a strong need to boost the industrial productivity through investment in research and technology; on the other side the public budget constraints call for prudency. In this context the need for systematic evaluations of public incentives to firms is particularly strong. In this context, the paper offers an evaluation exercise on the major instruments used to promote R&D and innovation activities of Italian firms. The analysis concentrates in particular on the incentives offered by Law 46 / 1982 (and revisions) and their effects on firms expenditures and employment in R&D. The Law represents the main national funding program as well as the longest lasting single instrument for technology and innovation promotion, although revisions of the Law have occurred. In addition to Law 46 / 1982, Italian firms have the chance to benefit from a larger span of public subsidies, particularly at the regional and local level. This makes the counterfactual question of “what would have happened without the policy” particularly interesting since it is likely, and this is confirmed by the data, that firms that do not access to the incentives of Law 46 / 82 benefit from other sources of public financing. Therefore it is particularly important to consider the effects of Law 46 / 82 not just in the hypothetical situation of complete absence of policy intervention, but also when other similar laws are at work. For this reason besides the difference-in-difference estimation, the paper analyses the effects of Law 46 / 1982 through a difference-in-difference-indifference model, which allows to verify whether the interaction between different kinds of incentives has a multiplicative or a substitutive effect. The paper also addresses another typical aspect of evaluation studies: the average effect of the policy normally retrieved seems to be not sufficiently informative, especially in a country characterized by a marked territorial <b>economic</b> <b>dualism</b> (Centre-North vs. South) and by a strong presence of small-medium firms, with profoundly different characteristics from large firms. In other words the effects of the policy instrument might vary substantially among firms. Therefore the paper takes explicitly into consideration the different effect of the incentives on different sectors (according to Pavitt classification), on different size of firms and in different zones of the country.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{research}} report investigates the theoretical {{foundation of the}} understanding of decision-makers at local government level of the term "development", with specific reference to local government as development agent and Local Economic Development. The choice of theoretical model by these decision-makers to conceptualise their understanding has historical and analytical antecedents, and secondly, the decision-maker is faced with a basic dualism in developmental thinking, ie. the emphasis on universalism (global competitiveness) {{on the one hand}} and the need for specificity (local economic development) on the other. The theoretical principles and assumptions on which the neoliberal and market-orientated approach to development is based are incorporated in the macroeconomic policy approach 'Growth, Employment and Redistribution' in South Africa. This approach has recently overshadowed the social welfarist developmental approach represented by the 'Reconstruction and Development Program' or Sustainable Human Development. The basis for specific policy formulation and intervention strategies are found in the theoretical assumptions, goals and objectives in each of these alternate approaches to development. The research design for the study is primarily qualitative. A semi-structured interview schedule is applied in directing in-depth interviews with identified central decisionmakers in metropolitan and larger "B" municipalities. The research design and process is constructed around three themes based on current and historic analysis of development thinking as a means to address poverty and inequality: theme 1 - theoretical understanding of the term development, Economic Growth in the formal sector versus Sustainable Human Development; theme 2 - the nature and relevance of participation by civil society in the Local Economic Development (LEO) process; and theme 3 - Local Economic Development and the role of infrastructure investment, land use planning and zoning as intervention strategy. A benchmark position is developed on local government as development agent and LEO, using various sources, for example, interview with Director-General in the Department of Provincial and Local Government dealing with Local Economic Development, the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa and legislative acts and policy papers relevant to LED. This position is compared with the position held by local government decision-makers dealing with LED. The analysis of the information collected suggests that the theoretical perspective and policy framework on development, participation and strategies to address inequality and poverty, ie Sustainable Human Development (researchers title) held by the Department of Provincial and Local Government (DPLG) is not compatible with the definition and understanding of the majority of the decision-makers at local government level dealing directly with LED. The notion of participative development with anti-poverty strategies focussed on poor urban citizenry at the local level is not seen as the relevant theoretical or applied focus by developmental decision-makers at municipal level. In addition, limited knowledge is available to local government decision-makers on both formal and informal economic activity. In this regard, de facto leadership has already been handed over to formal-economy organisations and institutions. The idea of using land-use planning and zoning regulations to reorientate economic activity to low- and informal housing settlements and the reconstitution of low-and informal housing as sites of manufacture utilising flexible specialisation principles was positively received. However, the respondents were either not knowledgeable about these principles, for example; Globalisation of production and flexible production processes, or had not considered them in relation to their planning, land use or zoning and development functions. In the light of the above, the notion of local government as development agent with specific reference to addressing poverty and inequality utilising the Local Economic Development process as envisaged by the Department of Provincial and Local Government does not have the majority support of decision-makers at city and metro level. The majority of respondents defined the process of consultation as limited to formal economic sectors that were/could be competitive in the new global economy. The majority of decision-makers hold the view that the redefinition and location of sites of economic activity could be delegated to these formal sector organisations and institutions. Their common understanding of development and the related intervention strategies was based on formal sector growth and related job creation strategies, as well as the "trickle-down" of resources and opportunities to the informal sector. If they wish to remain relevant in this context the Department of Provincial and Local Government has to develop intervention strategies to reorientate and redefine the theoretical and applied definition of development held by the decision-makers especially with regard to Local Economic Development. If these issues are not addressed the form and shape of South Africa cities and metros will be based on the entrenchment and escalation of <b>economic</b> <b>dualism</b> and exclusion of the poor from any developmental decision-making and strategies. This has serious implications for the development of local democracies and developmental institutions based on the formulation and understanding of local conditions and circumstances of poverty and inequality and holds serious implications for social stability in the South African metros and municipalities in the future. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die navorsingsverslag ondersoek die teoretiese begronding van die begrip wat besluitnemers op plaaslike regeringsvlak het van die term "ontwikkeling "met spesifieke verwysing na plaaslike regering as ontwikkelingsagent en Plaaslike Ekonomiese Ontwikkeling. Die keuse van teoretiese modelle deur hierdie besluitnemers het historiese en analitiese voorlopers en tweedens, word die besluitnemer in die gesig gestaar deur 'n basiese dualisme in ontwikkelingsdenke, die klem op universalisme (globale kompeterendheid) aan die een kant en die behoefte aan spesifiekheid (plaaslike ekonomiese ontwikkeling) aan die ander kant. Die teoretiese beginsels en aannames waarop die neoliberale en markgeorienteerde benaderings tot ontwikkeling berus, word gei"nkorporeer in die makro-ekonomiese benadering "Groei, Werkverskaffing en Herverdeling" (GEAR) in Suid Afrika. Hierdie benadering het onlangs die sosiale welsynsontwikkelingsbenadering, wat verleenwoordig is deur die "Heropbou en Ontwikkelingsprogram" (HOP) of Volhoubare Menslike Ontwikkeling, in die skadu gestel. Die basis vir spesifieke beleidsvorming en intervensiestrategiee word gevind in die teoretiese aannames, doelwitte en doelstellings in elk van hierdie altematiewe benaderings tot ontwikkeling. Die navorsingsontwerp vir hierdie studie is primer kwalitatief. 'n Semi-gestruktureerde onderhoudskedule word toegepas am rigting te gee aan in-diepte onderhoude met geidentifiseerde sentrale besluitnemers in metropolitaanse en groter "B" munisipaliteite. Die navorsingsontwerp en proses is gekonstrueer rondom drie temas wat gebaseer is op huidige en historiese analise van ontwikkelingsdenke as 'n manier waarop armoede en ongelykheid aangespreek kan word: tema 1 - teoretiese begrip van die term ontwikkeling, ekonomiese groei in die formele sektor teenoor Volhoubare Menslike Ontwikkeling; tema 2 - die aard en relevansie van deelname deur die siviele samelewing en die Plaaslike Ekonomiese Ontwikkelingsproses (PEO); en tema 3 - Plaaslike Ekonomiese Ontwikkeling en die rol van infrastruktuurbelegging, grondgebruikbeplaning en sonering as 'n intervensie-strategie. 'n Beginpuntposisie word ontwikkel oar plaaslike regering en PEO deur gebruik te maak van verskeie bronne, byvoorbeeld, onderhoude met die Direkteur-Generaal in die Deparlement van Provinsiale en Plaaslike Regering gemoeid met Plaaslike Ekonomiese Ontwikkeling (PEO), die Grondwet van die Republiek van Suid Afrika en wetgewing en beleidskrifte relevant tot PEO. Hierdie posisie word vergelyk met die posisie wat ingeneem word deur plaaslike regeringsbestuurbesluitnemers gemoeid met PEO. Die analise van die inligting wat ingesamel is suggereer dat die teoretiese perspektief en beleidsraamwerk oor ontwikkeling, deelname en strategiee om ongelykheid en armoede aan te spreek, die Volhoubare Menslike Ontwikkeling (navorserstitel) wat gehuldig word deur die Departement van Provinsiale en Plaaslike Regering (DPPR) nie versoenbaar is met die definisie en begrip van die meerderheid van die besluitnemers op plaaslike regeringsvlak wat direk gemoeid is met PEO nie. Die idee van deelnemende ontwikkeling met anti-armoede strategiee wat gefokus is op arm stedelike burgers op plaaslike vlak word nie deur die ontwikkelingsbesluitnemers op munisipale vlak beskou as die relevante oftoegepaste fokus nie. Bykomend is beperkte kennis tot beskikking van plaaslike regeringsbesluitnemers oor beide formele en informele ekonomiese aktiwiteite. In hierdie verband is de facto leierskap alreeds oorhandig aan formele ekonomiese organisasies en instellings. Die idee van die gebruik van grondgebruik- en soneringsregulasies om ekonomiese aktiwiteite tot lae en informele behuisingsnedersetfings te herorienteer en die hersamestelling van lae en informele behuising as plekke vir vervaardiging deur gebruik te maak van buigbare spesialiseringsbeginsels is goed ontvang. Die respondente was egter nie ingelig oor hierdie beginsels, of hulle het weggelaat om hierdie beginsels in berekening te bring by hul beplanning, grondgebruik of sonering en ontwikkelingsfunksies. In die lig van bogenoemde het die idee van plaaslike regering as ontwikkelingsagent met spesifieke verwysing tot die aanspreek van armoede en ongelykheid, deur gebruik te maak van die Plaaslike Ekonomiese Ontwikkelingsproses, soos in die vooruitsig gestel deur die Departement van Provinsiale en Plaaslike Regering, nie die meerderheidsteun van besluitnemers op staats- en metrovlak nie. Die meerderheid van die respondente het die proses van beraadslaging gedefinieer as beperk tot die formele ekonomiese sektore wat kompeterend was of kan wees in die nuwe globale ekonomie. Die meerderheid van hierdie besluitnemers is van mening dat die herdefiniering en plasing van plekke van ekonomiese aktiwiteite gedelegeer kan word aan hierdie formele sektororganisasies en instellings. Hierdie gedeelde begrip van ontwikkeling en verbandhoudende intervensie-strategiee was gebaseer op groei in die formele sektor en verbandhoudende werkskeppingstrategiee, asook die "afsyfering" van bronne en geleenthede na die informele sektor. As dit hul wens is om in hierdie konteks relevant te bly, moet die Oepartement van Provinsiale en Plaaslike Regering intervensiestrategiee ontwikkel om die teoretiese en toegepaste definisie van ontwikkeling, wat gehuldig word deur besluitnemers, veral met betrekking tot Plaaslike Ekonomiese Ontwikkeling te herorienteer en te herdefineer. Indien hierdie aangeleenthede nie aangespreek word nie sal die vorm en fatsoen van Suid-Afrikaanse stede en metros gebaseer wees op die verskansing en uitbreiding van ekonomiese dualisme en die uitsluiting van die armes van enige ontwikkelingsbesluitneming en strategie. Oit het ernstige implikasies vir die ontwikkeling van plaaslike demokrasie en ontwikkelingsinstellings gebaseer op die formulering en begrip van plaaslike toestande en omstandighede van armoede en ongelykheid en hou ernstige implikasies in vir die sosiale stabiliteit in die Suid-Afrikaanse metros en munisipaliteite in die toekoms...|$|E
