50|$|The best {{interests}} of the child is the paramount consideration in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order. Amendments to the legislation in 1995 introduced provisions to guide courts making parenting orders, emphasising the importance of the continuation of <b>joint</b> <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> (the sharing of decisions affecting major long-term issues) following the breakdown of parental relationships. In 2006, further amendments introduced a presumption that <b>joint</b> <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> is in the {{best interests}} of the child in question (except where there is a reasonable belief that a parent or a person living with them has engaged in child abuse or domestic violence).|$|E

The study is set against a backdrop of family law reform in Australia over the past decade which has shifted legal and custodial frameworks towards a presumption of ongoing <b>joint</b> (shared) <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> for children post-separation and divorce. It examines the relationship between separated parents' attitudes to <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> and their sharing practices, and reveals that, despite suggestions to the contrary, attitudes towards responsibility and sharing practices remain highly gendered.

40|$|The Australian Child Support Scheme was {{established}} {{as a means of}} ensuring adequate financial support for children of separated parents. However, within the financial transfer of child support exist notions of &# 039;trust&# 039; and &# 039;fairness&# 039; based on parents navigating their changed relationship post-separation. Previous research has explored the assessment and outcomes of child support for both payee and payer parents, however little attention has been given to how women evaluate the assessment and outcomes of child support. As such, this research aimed to explore payee mothers&# 039; evaluation of their child support experiences based on the value of their child support assessment {{and the extent to which}} these payments were received. Following the methods of constructivist grounded theory, in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 low-income single mothers. Analysis revealed that payee mothers evaluated child support based on the moral assumptions and the rationalities they perceived were underlying payer fathers&# 039; child support compliance. While payee mothers desired arrangements that reflected <b>joint</b> <b>parental</b> financial <b>responsibility,</b> in reality many experienced problematic child support payments, which may ultimately undermine payee parents&# 039; confidence in the Child Support Scheme...|$|R

See Constitutional Court decision 1 BvR 738/01 from March 1, 2004, paragraph II. 1. a) The third sentence is translated into English as: [...] "The <b>joint</b> exercise of <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> presupposes a viable social relationship between the parents and requires a minimal level of agreement between them." [...] If one parent refuses to cooperate, the court changes joint custody to sole custody. The law governing the choice of parent receiving sole custody is based on [...] "best interests of the child" [...] The non-cooperation of a parent is not a factor when determining [...] "best interests of the child" [...] and therefore which parent receives sole custody.

40|$|The {{political}} rhetoric surrounding children and homosexuals often overlooks {{the interests of}} children who are themselves homosexual. Yet under the political radar, legal scholars are becoming increasingly cognizant of the need to discuss the rights of sexual minority children vis-à-vis their parents. As one author notes, 2 ̆ 2 Psychological abuse from family members affects queer youth more than any other group of adolescents, 2 ̆ 2 and sixty percent of gay-related violence suffered by these children takes place in the home. Queer youth who disclose their sexual identity to unaccepting parents may suffer emotional and physical abuse. Parents 2 ̆ 2 may banish the child from the house and shirk their legal duty to provide financial support because they want to disown the sexuality of their child. 2 ̆ 2 Within this web of physical and emotional abuse lie parental efforts to change their child 2 ̆ 7 s sexual orientation, otherwise known as 2 ̆ 2 reparative therapy. 2 ̆ 2 In 1999, Karolyn Ann Hicks proposed that subjecting one 2 ̆ 7 s child to reparative therapy can and should constitute child abuse. Using New York state child abuse law as a framework, Hicks claimed that abuse depends on the 2 ̆ 2 reasonably prudent parent standard. 2 ̆ 2 A reasonably prudent parent researching reparative therapies would discover that they are potentially dangerous and not accepted in the mainstream medical community. Further, taking existing societal homophobia into account, a parent would not subject her child to such therapy. Therefore, a parent who subjects her child to reparative therapy should be guilty of child abuse. Hicks concluded with guarded optimism, however, by stating that since the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick held that a belief in homosexuality 2 ̆ 7 s immorality was a valid public policy consideration, {{it would be difficult for}} states to prosecute parents under this theory. Hicks 2 ̆ 7 s theory has recently taken on new relevance. In 2004, what Hicks claimed as the primary obstacle to her theory 2 ̆ 7 s implementation was removed: Bowers was overruled by Lawrence v. Texas, which held that a belief in homosexuality 2 ̆ 7 s immorality could not serve as a rational basis for any state law. 2 ̆ 2 Regardless of whether Lawrence really means that Hicks 2 ̆ 7 s theory may now be implemented, In re E. L. M. C. demonstrates that such a prospect is not implausible. That 2004 case involved a child custody dispute between a same-sex couple, in which one parent began to believe homosexuality was immoral after the separation. The trial court below awarded the parties <b>joint</b> <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> but required the parent who believed homosexuality was immoral to 2 ̆ 2 make sure that there is nothing in the religious upbringing or teaching that the minor child is exposed to that can be considered homophobic. 2 ̆ 2 The appellate court remanded the case to determine whether homophobic teachings would 2 ̆ 2 significantly impair her emotional development. 2 ̆ 2 Although this was a child custody case, the evidence used to determine custody is often equally applicable in child abuse cases. And although this case did not involve reparative therapy, the motivating factor behind the parent 2 ̆ 7 s potentially homophobic teachings and reparative therapy was the same: the belief, usually religious, that homosexuality is immoral. Therefore, this case shows that a court may not consider that belief to be sacrosanct territory immune from judicial intervention. This Note argues that, for evidentiary reasons, contrary to what Hicks may suggest, reparative therapy cannot be considered child abuse under current law. There is no reliable evidence that reparative therapy works, and there is also no empirical evidence that reparative therapy is harmful. Professional psychological associations 2 ̆ 7 codes of ethics continue to remain silent on the practice, and the courts do not require psychological treatments to empirically demonstrate their effectiveness in order to justify their appropriateness. This Note discusses these evidentiary factors in detail...|$|E

40|$|Background: High {{levels of}} parental anxiety are {{associated}} with poor treatment outcomes for children with anxiety disorders. Associated parental cognitions and behaviours have been implicated as impediments to successful treatment. We examined the association between <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> beliefs, maternal anxiety and parenting behaviours {{in the context of}} childhood anxiety disorders. Methods: Anxious and non-anxious mothers of 7 - 12 year old children with a current anxiety disorder reported their <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> beliefs using a questionnaire measure. Parental behaviours towards their child during a stressor task were measured. Results: Parents with a current anxiety disorder reported a greater sense of responsibility for their child’s actions and wellbeing than parents who scored within the normal range for anxiety. Furthermore, higher <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> was associated with more intrusive and less warm behaviours in parent-child interactions and there was an indirect effect between maternal anxiety and maternal intrusive behaviours via <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> beliefs. Limitations: The sample was limited to a treatment-seeking, relatively high socio-economic population and only mothers were included so replication with more diverse groups is needed. The use of a range of stressor tasks may have allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of parental behaviours. Conclusions: The findings suggest that parental anxiety disorder is associated with an elevated sense of <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> and may promote parental behaviours likely to inhibit optimum child treatment outcomes. <b>Parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> beliefs may therefore be important to target in child anxiety treatments in the context of parental anxiety disorders...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} impact of the new Children’s Act 38 of 2005 on the {{acquisition}} of <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and rights within a newly proposed framework designed for the purpose of reflecting the various ways in which <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and rights can be acquired. The research has shown that the Children’s Act has fundamentally transformed the way in which <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and rights are acquired. The transformation has created a scheme for the acquisition of <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and rights that is for the most part constitutionally compliant and progressive insofar as it gives recognition to the different family forms found in South Africa. To this end the Children’s Act has considerably expanded the ways in which <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and rights can be acquired. Whereas previously exclusively the preserve of heterosexual married parents in a nuclear family, <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and rights can now automatically be acquired by a committed biological father and a married lesbian couple conceiving by artificial means. Apart from authorising courts to assign <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and rights, the Children’s Act allows any holder of <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and rights to confer responsibilities and rights on another by prior approved agreement. The Act also includes specific provisions to regulate the acquisition of <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and rights by commissioning parents {{in the case of a}} surrogate motherhood agreement. The structure developed for the research topic reflects the transformation of the law in this regard by making the application of the best interests-standard, rather than the marital status of the child’s parents, the distinguishing feature of the subdivision between automatic and assigned acquisition. In this way the structure is an embodiment of the paramountcy of the best interests principle in section 28 (2) of the Constitution. Insofar as the law still requires a distinction to be made between biological mothers and fathers, on the one hand, and naturally and artificially conceived children, on the other, the structure also highlights the remaining shortcomings of the law in this regard. The structure is, furthermore, necessarily complicated by the need to distinguish between the acquisition of care, on the one hand, and guardianship, on the other. As far as fathers are still not treated the same as mothers in the automatic allocation of <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and rights, the Act is deemed not to have been progressive enough. Conferring full <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and rights on both parents based on their biological link to the child would not only be in line with worldwide trends, but would also meet the constitutional demands of substantive sex and gender equality. It will further place the focus on the best interests of the child, which emphasises the importance of both parents for the child. While the research shows that tensions between the biological and social constructs of parenthood may possibly hamper the legal recognition of de facto care-givers or other persons with whom the child has developed a psychological bond, the greatest weakness of the Act would seem to lie in the failure to implement an integrated family court structure.
