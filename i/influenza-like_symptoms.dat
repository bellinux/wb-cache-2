5|$|Known as viremia, the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, this causes a self-limiting inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic aseptic meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Interferons, a {{subclass}} of cytokines, {{are produced}} in the body during illnesses such as influenza {{in order to help}} fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms</b> hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the prevalence of and factors associated with H 1 N 1 preventive behaviors in a community-based population. MethodsA cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} three urban and two rural communities in Korea. Interviews were conducted with 3462 individuals (1608 men and 1854 women) aged ≥ 19 years during February–March 2010. Influenza-related information including anxiety, preventive behaviors and their perceived effectiveness, vaccination status, past <b>influenza-like</b> illness <b>symptoms,</b> and sources of and trust in information was obtained. ResultsAmong 3462 participants, 173 reported experiencing <b>influenza-like</b> illness <b>symptoms</b> within the past 12 months. The mean H 1 N 1 preventive behavior score was 25. 5  ±  5. 5 (out of a possible 40). The percent of participants reporting high perceived effectiveness and high anxiety was 46. 2 % and 21. 4 %, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, H 1 N 1 preventive behavior scores were predicted by a high (β =  3. 577, p <  0. 001) or moderate (β =  2. 529, p <  0. 001) perception of their effectiveness. Similarly, moderate (β =  1. 516, p <  0. 001) and high (β =  4. 103, p <  0. 001) anxiety scores predicted high preventive behavior scores. ConclusionEffective methods of promoting population behavior change may be nationwide campaigns through mass media, as well as education and promotion by health care providers and broadcasters...|$|R

THOV is a significant veterinary pathogen, for example, causing a febrile illness and abortion in sheep. As of February 2015, only eight cases of human disease associated with thogotoviruses have been reported: two with THOV, five with DHOV and one with Bourbon virus; there have been two fatalities. The incubation period for THOV is 4–5days. All three viruses were associated with fever. THOV and DHOV also caused neurological symptoms: meningitis and neuromyelitis optica in the case of THOV; encephalitis in the case of DHOV. Hepatitis has been observed with THOV. The single case of disease in a person infected with Bourbon virus was associated with decreases in blood platelets and white cells; no neurological <b>symptoms</b> were observed. <b>Influenza-like</b> respiratory <b>symptoms</b> have not been reported.|$|R

Investigators surveyed 412 of 841 school district employees. Of the respondents, 58 % reported getting the flu vaccine for the 2012 - 2013 season. Most employees reported getting the vaccine at the central school district office. Investigators found that employees who had positive attitudes and perceptions about the flu vaccine {{and those who had}} received the flu vaccine the year before {{were more likely to have}} been vaccinated. The most common reasons for not getting the flu vaccine were beliefs that employees did not need the vaccine, that the vaccine did not work, and that employees did not have time to get vaccinated. A total of 120 responding employees reported <b>influenza-like</b> illness <b>symptoms</b> between August 2012 and March 2013. Of these, 92 reported working while feeling sick. The two most common main reasons cited for working while sick were "I have a professional obligation to my students" and "I did not think I was contagious or could make other people sick. " HHE Program investigators recommended that the employer work with local vaccine providers to offer the flu vaccine to employees at each of the schools. The employer was encouraged to educate employees about the flu and the flu vaccine, emphasizing employees' risk of infection, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccine safety. Employees were encouraged to get the flu vaccine, stay informed, and get information about the flu and the flu vaccine from reliable sources. Investigators recommended that employees not go to work when ill with flu-like symptoms, which include fever, cough, and sore throat.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundA novel {{influenza}} H 1 N 1 {{began in}} March 2009, rapidly spread, {{and then became}} a pandemic outbreak. Diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction result was not always available because of a surge in workload and therefore clinical diagnosis became important. However, clinical differences between the patients infected by the novel H 1 N 1 virus and those infected by the influenza-like non-novel H 1 N 1 have not been reported. This {{study was conducted to}} compare the demographic background, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings between novel H 1 N 1 influenza infections and other non-novel H 1 N 1 infections. MethodsAt an early stage of H 1 N 1 spread, cases presenting with <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptom</b> and travel or contact history were quarantined into infection disease-designated hospitals in Taiwan. Data on consecutive patients under investigation for infection with novel influenza A (H 1 N 1) were collected between April 29 and June 19, 2009. The data set consisted of clinical manifestations, plain chest radiography, hematological results, and biochemical findings. Testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect H 1 N 1. ResultsOverall, 166 cases were collected. Among these individuals, there were 14 confirmed H 1 N 1 cases. The clinical manifestations of the H 1 N 1 cases included fever in 13 patients (92. 9 %), followed by cough, rhinorrhea, a sore throat, myalgia, headache, malaise, abdominal tenderness, and diarrhea. Leukopenia was present in nine patients (64. 2 %) and lymphocytopenia was present in five (35. 7 %). The duration of virus shedding was 7. 0  ±  1. 8 days. When compared with the non-H 1 N 1 cases by multiple logistic regression analysis, cases infected by the novel H 1 N 1 virus {{were more likely to be}} younger than 20 years [Odds ratio (OR)  =  27. 7, 95 % confidence interval (CI)  =  1. 3 – 597. 8, p =  0. 034), have traveled from the US (OR =  14. 5, 95 % CI =  2. 1 – 101. 4, p =  0. 007) or Thailand (OR =  56. 7, 95 % CI =  4. 6 – 700. 6, p =  0. 002) and to have presented with myalgia (OR =  8. 5, 95 % CI =  1. 4 – 52. 0, p =  0. 021) or leukopenia (OR =  17. 4, 95 % CI =  3. 4 – 90. 5, p =  0. 001).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{complete}} {{for the first time}} a full set of Swiss Swine Influenza Virus (SSIV) genome sequences. A previously published method (Zhou et al., 2009, J. Virol. 83, 10309 - 10313) for multi-segment amplification of influenza genomes was used in combination with a panel of 49 SSIV isolates collected between 2004 and 2010. A total of 55 sequences were obtained, covering 15 isolates, 9 representing strains that had previously been propagated in cell culture and 6 derived directly from nasal swabs of pigs with <b>influenza-like</b> disease <b>symptoms.</b> Analyses of the sequences indicated that the SSIV strains were clearly distinct from the recent pandemic H 1 N 1 strain (Mexico 2009) and were related more closely among each other than to a well-characterized European SIV (Haseluenne 2003). All isolates, of which the neuraminidase (NA) sequence could be determined, were Oseltamivir resistant (H 274 Y mutation in NA) and featured the R 194 G mutation in NA, a prerequisite for the consecutive H 274 Y mutation. Moreover, the predicted membrane protein 2 (M 2) aa sequences suggested resistance against the drug Amantadine. Although the pandemic H 1 N 1 circulated in Switzerland already in 2009, it was observed only in 2011 to entering the Swiss pig population, suggesting that this virus actually represents zoonotic features, though, in the case of Switzerland, not originating from pigs and transmitted to humans but rather contrary, originating in humans and transmitted to pigs...|$|R

We conducted a multicentre test-negative case-control study to estimate IVE against hospitalised laboratory-confirmed influenza in the target population in 18 hospitals in France, Italy, Lithuania and the Navarre and Valencia regions in Spain. All hospitalised patients aged >= 18 years, belonging to the target population presenting with <b>influenza-like</b> illness <b>symptom</b> onset within seven days were swabbed. Patients positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza virus were cases and those negative were controls. Using logistic regression, we calculated IVE for each influenza virus subtype and adjusted it for month of symptom onset, study site, age and chronic conditions. Of the 1, 972 patients included, 116 were positive for influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09, 58 for A(H 3 N 2) and 232 for influenza B. Adjusted IVE was 21. 3 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : - 25. 2 to 50. 6; n= 1, 628), 61. 8 % (95 % CI: 26. 8 to 80. 0; n= 557) and 43. 1 % (95 % CI: 21. 2 to 58. 9; n= 1, 526) against influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09, A(H 3 N 2) and B respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{epidemic}} {{patterns of}} influenza B infection and {{their association with}} climate conditions are not well understood. Influenza surveillance in Okinawa is important for clarifying transmission patterns in both temperate and tropical regions. Using surveillance data, collected over 7  years in the subtropical region of Japan, this study aims to characterize the epidemic patterns of influenza B infection and its association with ambient temperature and relative humidity, in a parallel comparison with influenza A. Methods From January 2007 until March 2014, two individual influenza surveillance datasets were collected from external sources. The first dataset, included weekly rapid antigen test (RAT) results from four representative general hospitals, located {{in the capital city}} of Okinawa. A nation-wide surveillance of influenza, diagnosed by RAT results and/or <b>influenza-like</b> illness <b>symptoms,</b> included the age distribution of affected patients and was used as the second dataset. To analyze the association between infection and local climate conditions, ambient temperature and relative humidity during the study period were retrieved from the Japanese Meteorological Agency website. Results Although influenza A maintained high number of infections from December through March, epidemics of influenza B infection were observed annually from March through July. The only observed exception was 2010, when the pandemic strain of 2009 dominated. During influenza B outbreaks, influenza patients aged 5 to 9  years old and 10 to 14  years old more frequently visited sentinel sites. Although both ambient temperature and relative humidity are inversely associated with influenza A infection, influenza B infection was found to be directly associated with high relative humidity. Conclusion Further studies are needed to elucidate the complex epidemiology of influenza B and its relationship with influenza A. In the subtropical setting of Okinawa, epidemics of influenza B infection occur from March to July following the influenza A epidemic, and primarily affect school-age children. These findings help to define unknown aspects of influenza B and can inform healthcare decisions for patients located outside temperate regions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The authors {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the web and an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) phone service as vehi-cles in population-based infectious disease surveillance. Fourteen thousand subjects {{were randomly selected from}} the Swedish population register and asked to prospectively report all respiratory tract infections, including <b>Influenza-like</b> Illness (ILI—clinical <b>symptoms</b> indicative of influenza but no laboratory confirmation), immediately as they occurred during a 36 -week period starting October 2007. Participants were classified as belonging to the web or IVR group based on their choice of technology for initial reg-istration. In all, 1, 297 individuals registered via IVR while 2, 044 chose the web. The latter were more often young and well-educated than those registered via IVR. Overall, 52 % of the participants reported at least one infection episode. The risk of an infectious disease report was 14 % (95 % CI: 6, 22 %) higher in the web group than in the IVR group. For ILI the excess was 27 % (95 % CI: 11, 47 %). After adjust-ments for socio-demographic factors, statistically non-sig-nificant excesses of 1 and 8 % remained, indicating trivial differences potentially attributable to the two reporting techniques.

We investigated a 1996 outbreak of infection with influenza A at a residential facility for persons with AIDS. We interviewed 118 residents and employees, reviewed 65 resident medical records, and collected serum samples for measurement of influenza antibody titers. After controlling for history of smoking, influenza vaccination, and resident or employee status, in a multivariate model, HIV infection was not statistically associated with <b>influenza-like</b> illness (ILI). <b>Symptoms</b> and duration of ILI were similar for most HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons. However, 8 (21. 1 %) of 38 HIV-infected persons with ILI (vs. none of 15 HIV-uninfected persons) were either hospitalized, evaluated in an emergency room, or had ILI lasting ≥ 14 days (P =. 06).

40|$|Background: Epidemic {{models are}} being {{extensively}} used {{to understand the}} main pathways of spread of infectious diseases, and thus to assess control methods. Schools are well known to represent hot spots for epidemic spread; hence, understanding typical patterns of infection transmission within schools is crucial for designing adequate control strategies. The attention {{that was given to}} the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 pdm 09 flu pandemic has made it possible to collect detailed data on the occurrence of <b>influenza-like</b> illness (ILI) <b>symptoms</b> in two primary schools of Trento, Italy. Results: The data collected in the two schools were used to calibrate a discrete-time SIR model, which was designed to estimate the probabilities of influenza transmission within the classes, grades and schools using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We found that the virus was mainly transmitted within class, with lower levels of transmission between students in the same grade and even lower, though not significantly so, among different grades within the schools. We estimated median values of R 0 from the epidemic curves in the two schools of 1. 16 and 1. 40; on the other hand, we estimated the average number of students infected by the first school case to be 0. 85 and 1. 09 in the two schools. Conclusions: The discrepancy between the values of R 0 estimated from the epidemic curve or from the within-school transmission probabilities suggests that household and community transmission {{played an important role in}} sustaining the school epidemics. The high probability of infection between students in the same class confirms that targeting within-class transmission is key to controlling the spread of influenza in school settings and, as a consequence, in the general population...|$|R
40|$|Background: Social {{networks}} are increasingly recognized as important points of intervention, yet relatively few intervention studies of respiratory infection transmission have utilized a network design. Here {{we describe the}} design, methods, and social network structure of a randomized intervention for isolating respiratory infection cases in a university setting over a 10 -week period. Methodology/principal findings: 590 students in six residence halls enrolled in the eX-FLU study during a chain-referral recruitment process from September 2012 –January 2013. Of these, 262 joined as “seed” participants, who nominated their social contacts to join the study, of which 328 “nominees” enrolled. Participants were cluster-randomized by 117 residence halls. Participants {{were asked to respond}} to weekly surveys on health behaviors, social interactions, and <b>influenza-like</b> illness (ILI) <b>symptoms.</b> Participants were randomized to either a 3 -Day dorm room isolation intervention or a control group (no isolation) upon illness onset. ILI cases reported on their isolation behavior during illness and provided throat and nasal swab specimens at onset, day-three, and day-six of illness. A subsample of individuals (N =  103) participated in a sub-study using a novel smartphone application, iEpi, which collected sensor and contextually-dependent survey data on social interactions. Within the social network, participants were significantly positively assortative by intervention group, enrollment type, residence hall, iEpi participation, age, gender, race, and alcohol use (all P <  0. 002). Conclusions/significance: We identified a feasible study design for testing the impact of isolation from social networks in a university setting. These data provide an unparalleled opportunity to address questions about isolation and infection transmission, as well as insights into social networks and behaviors among college-aged students. Several important lessons were learned over the course of this project, including feasible isolation durations, the need for extensive organizational efforts, as well as the need for specialized programmers and server space for managing survey and smartphone data...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To update a 2005 Cochrane {{review that}} {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of influenza, the transmission of influenza, and complications from influenza in healthy adults, and to estimate the frequency of adverse effects. Search strategy: An updated search of the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group’s specialised register, Medline (1950 -Aug 2009), Embase (1980 -Aug 2009), and post-marketing pharmacovigilance data and comparative safety cohorts. Selection criteria: Randomised placebo controlled studies of neuraminidase inhibitors in otherwise healthy adults exposed to naturally occurring influenza. Main outcome measures: Duration and incidence of symptoms; incidence of lower respiratory tract infections, or their proxies; and adverse events. Data extraction: Two reviewers applied inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Data analysis: Comparisons were structured into prophylaxis, treatment, and adverse events, with further subdivision by outcome and dose. Results: 20 trials were included: four on prophylaxis, 12 on treatment, and four on postexposure prophylaxis. For prophylaxis, neuraminidase inhibitors had no effect against influenza-like illness or asymptomatic influenza. The efficacy of oral oseltamivir against symptomatic laboratory confirmed influenza was 61 % (risk ratio 0. 39, 95 % confidence interval 0. 18 to 0. 85) at 75 mg daily and 73 % (0. 27, 0. 11 to 0. 67) at 150 mg daily. Inhaled zanamivir 10 mg daily was 62 % efficacious (0. 38, 0. 17 to 0. 85). Oseltamivir for postexposure prophylaxis had an efficacy of 58 % (95 % confidence interval 15 % to 79 %) and 84 % (49 % to 95 %) in two trials of households. Zanamivir performed similarly. The hazard ratios for time to alleviation of <b>influenza-like</b> illness <b>symptoms</b> were in favour of treatment: 1. 20 (95 % confidence interval 1. 06 to 1. 35) for oseltamivir and 1. 24 (1. 13 to 1. 36) for zanamivir. Eight unpublished studies on complications were ineligible and therefore excluded. The remaining evidence suggests oseltamivir did not reduce influenza related lower respiratory tract complications (risk ratio 0. 55, 95 % confidence interval 0. 22 to 1. 35). From trial evidence, oseltamivir induced nausea (odds ratio 1. 79, 95 % confidence interval 1. 10 to 2. 93). Evidence of rarer adverse events from pharmacovigilance was of poor quality or possibly under-reported. Conclusion: Neuraminidase inhibitors have modest effectiveness against the symptoms of influenza in otherwise healthy adults. The drugs are effective postexposure against laboratory confirmed influenza, {{but this is a}} small component of influenza-like illness, so for this outcome neuraminidase inhibitors are not effective. Neuraminidase inhibitors might be regarded as optional for reducing the symptoms of seasonal influenza. Paucity of good data has undermined previous findings for oseltamivir’s prevention of complications from influenza. Independent randomised trials to resolve these uncertainties are needed...|$|R
50|$|Sofosbuvir used {{alone and}} in {{combination}} with other drugs such as ribavirin with or without a peginterferon has a good safety profile. Common side effects are fatigue, headache, nausea, rash, irritability, dizziness, back pain, and anemia. Most side effects are significantly more common in interferon-containing regimens as compared to interferon-free ones. For example, fatigue and headache are nearly cut in half, <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms</b> are reduced to 3-6% as compared to 16-18%, and neutropenia is almost absent in interferon-free treatment.|$|E
50|$|For example, Bacillus anthracis is {{considered}} an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy spores, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms</b> and progresses to a lethal hemorrhagic mediastinitis within 3-7 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients. Finally, friendly personnel can be protected with suitable antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|In June 2011, {{another child}} survived {{infection}} with rabies without receiving the vaccine before showing symptoms. Precious Reynolds, an eight-year-old girl from Willow Creek, California, contracted {{the disease in}} April 2011, but did not receive medical care until mid-May, after her grandmother {{took her to the}} doctor because of <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms</b> that grew so serious, her grandmother said they resembled polio. The hospital said doctors followed the protocol established for Giese. Reynolds was placed in a drug-induced coma and received antiviral medications. She survived after spending two weeks in intensive care undergoing the treatments.|$|E
40|$|Background Several {{aggregate}} data meta-analyses have provided {{estimates of the}} effectiveness of influenza vaccination in community-dwelling elderly people. However, these studies ignored the effects of patient-level confounders such as sex, age, and chronic diseases that could bias effectiveness estimates. We aimed to assess the confounder-adjusted effectiveness of influenza vaccines on laboratory-confirmed influenza among elderly people by conducting a global individual participant data meta-analysis. Methods In this individual participant data meta-analysis, we considered studies included in a previously conducted {{aggregate data}} meta-analysis that included test-negative design case-control studies published up to July 13, 2014. We contacted all authors of the included studies on Dec 1, 2014, to request individual participant data. Patients were excluded if their unique identifier was missing, their vaccination status was unknown, their outcome status was unknown, or they had had suspected influenza infection more than once in the same influenza season. Cases were patients with <b>influenza-like</b> illness <b>symptoms</b> who tested positive for at least one of A H 1 N 1, A H 1 N 1 pdm 09, A H 3 N 2, or B viruses; controls were patients with infl uenza-like illness symptoms who tested negative for these virus types or subtypes. Influenza vaccine effectiveness against overall and subtype-specific laboratory-confirmed influenza were the primary and secondary outcomes. We used a generalised linear mixed model to calculate adjusted vaccine effectiveness according to vaccine match to the circulating strains of influenza virus and intensity of the virus activity (epidemic or non-epidemic). Vaccine effectiveness was defined as the relative reduction in risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza in vaccinated patients compared with unvaccinated patients. We did subgroup analyses to estimate vaccine effectiveness according to hemisphere, age category, and health status. Findings We received 23 of the 53 datasets included in the aggregate data meta-analysis. Furthermore, six additional datasets were provided by data collaborators, which resulted in individual participant data for a total of 5210 participants. A total of 4975 patients had the required data for analysis. Of these, 3146 (63 %) were controls and 1829 (37 %) were cases. Influenza vaccination was significantly effective during epidemic seasons irrespective of vaccine match status (matched adjusted vaccine effectiveness 44. 38 %, 95 % CI 22. 63 - 60. 01; mismatched adjusted vaccine effectiveness 20. 00 %, 95 % CI 3. 46 - 33. 68; analyses in the imputed dataset). Seasonal influenza vaccination did not show significant effectiveness during non-epidemic seasons. We found substantial variation in vaccine effectiveness across virus types and subtypes, with the highest estimate for A H 1 N 1 pdm 09 (53. 19 %, 10. 25 - 75. 58) and the lowest estimate for B virus types (- 1. 52 %, - 39. 58 to 26. 16). Although we observed no significant differences between subgroups in each category (hemisphere, age, and health status), influenza vaccination showed a protective effect among elderly people with cardiovascular disease, lung disease, or aged 75 years and younger. Interpretation Influenza vaccination is moderately effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza in elderly people during epidemic seasons. More research is needed to investigate factors affecting vaccine protection (eg, brand-specific or type-specific vaccine effectiveness and repeated annual vaccination) in elderly people...|$|R
40|$|Background: Digital traces {{left on the}} Internet by web users, if {{properly}} aggregated and analyzed, {{can represent}} a huge information dataset able to inform syndromic surveillance systems in real time with data collected directly from individuals. Since people use everyday language rather than medical jargon (e. g. runny nose vs. respiratory distress), knowledge of patients' terminology {{is essential for the}} mining of health related conversations on social networks. Objectives: In this paper we present a methodology for early detection and analysis of epidemics based on mining Twitter messages. In order to reliably trace messages of patients that actually complain of a disease, first, we learn a model of naïve medical language, second, we adopt a symptom-driven, rather than disease-driven, keyword analysis. This approach represents a major innovation compared to previous published work in the field. Method: We first developed an algorithm to automatically learn a variety of expressions that people use to describe their health conditions, thus improving our ability to detect health-related "concepts" expressed in non-medical terms and, in the end, producing a larger body of evidence. We then implemented a Twitter monitoring instrument to finely analyze the presence and combinations of symptoms in tweets. Results: We first evaluate the algorithm's performance on an available dataset of diverse medical condition synonyms, then, we assess its utility in a case study of five common syndromes for surveillance purposes. We show that, by exploiting physicians' knowledge on symptoms positively or negatively related to a given disease, as well as the correspondence between patients' "naïve" terminology and medical jargon, not only can we analyze large volumes of Twitter messages related to that disease, but we can also mine micro-blogs with complex queries, performing fine-grained tweets classification (e. g. those reporting <b>influenza-like</b> illness (ILI) <b>symptoms</b> vs. common cold or allergy). Conclusions: Our approach yields a very high level of correlation with flu trends derived from traditional surveillance systems. Compared with Google Flu, another popular tool based on query search volumes, our method is more flexible and less sensitive to changes in web search behaviors. © 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Background: Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis is a fatal disease {{for which no}} effective treatment exists. We assessed whether treatment with interferon gamma- 1 b improved survival compared with placebo in patients with idiopathic {{pulmonary fibrosis}} and mild-to-moderate impairment of pulmonary function. Methods: 826 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were enrolled from 81 centres in seven European countries, the USA, and Canada. Patients were randomly assigned (double-blind) in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive 200 μg interferon gamma- 1 b (n= 551) or equivalent placebo (n= 275) subcutaneously, three times per week. Eligible patients were aged 40 - 79 years, had been diagnosed in the past 48 months, had a forced vital capacity of 55 - 90 % of the predicted value, and a haemoglobin-corrected carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of 35 - 90 % of the predicted value. The primary endpoint was overall survival time from randomisation measured at the second interim analysis, when the proportion of deaths had reached 75 % of those expected by the study conclusion. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00075998. Findings: At the second interim analysis, the hazard ratio for mortality in patients on interferon gamma- 1 b showed absence of minimum benefit compared with placebo (1 · 15, 95 % CI 0 · 77 - 1 · 71, p= 0 · 497), and indicated that the study should be stopped. After a median duration of 64 weeks (IQR 41 - 84) on treatment, 80 (15 %) patients on interferon gamma- 1 b and 35 (13 %) on placebo had died. Almost all patients reported at least one adverse event, and more patients on interferon gamma- 1 b group had constitutional signs and <b>symptoms</b> (<b>influenza-like</b> illness, fatigue, fever, and chills) than did those on placebo. Occurrence of serious adverse events (eg, pneumonia, respiratory failure) was similar for both treatment groups. Treatment adherence was good and few patients discontinued treatment prematurely in either group. Interpretation: We cannot recommend treatment with interferon gamma- 1 b since the drug did not improve survival for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which refutes previous findings from subgroup analyses of survival in studies of patients with mild-to-moderate physiological impairment of pulmonary function.
