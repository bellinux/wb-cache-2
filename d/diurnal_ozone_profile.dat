Here, we derive a monthly climatology of the daily ozone cycle from 17 years of GROMOS observation. We present the <b>diurnal</b> <b>ozone</b> variation of the stratosphere and mesosphere. Characterizing the diurnal cycle of stratospheric ozone is important for correct trend estimates {{of the ozone layer}} derived from satellite observations. The <b>diurnal</b> <b>ozone</b> cycle from GROMOS is compared to two models: the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and the Hamburg Model of Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA). Generally, observation and models show a good agreement: in the lower mesosphere, daytime ozone is for both GROMOS and models around 25 % less than midnight ozone. In the stratosphere, ozone reaches its maximum in the afternoon showing values several percent larger than the midnight value. Further, GROMOS and models indicate a seasonal behaviour of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>ozone</b> variations in the stratosphere with a larger afternoon maximum during daytime in summer than in winter. Using the 17 years of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> from GROMOS, we find strong interannual variations in the <b>diurnal</b> <b>ozone</b> cycle for both the stratosphere and the mesosphere. Interannual variability in temperature, atmospheric circulation and composition may explain the observed interannual variability of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>ozone</b> cycle above Bern...|$|R

CO 2 exchange rate (CER), stomatal conductance (gs), and total leaf nitrogen of current year foliage were measured at 1 -month intervals. P. ponderosa was the most adversely affected by ozone, based on reductions in mid- and late season CER under saturating light (1. 18 vs. 2. 17 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1), lower light compensation point (43 vs. 33 µmol quanta m- 2 s- 1), and lower CER at a given gs value. P. menziesii showed reduced CER and higher gs {{by the end of}} the experimental ozone exposure. A. concolor and P. engelmannii showed no reduction in CO 2 uptake and no clear effects of ozone exposure on gs. Adverse ozone effects on biomass or growth in the year of exposure were seen for A. lasiocarpa and P. ponderosa, whereas A. concolor, P. engelmanii and P. menziesii showed adverse effects only in the year after exposure. Few consistent patterns in which plant component was affected were found, either in the year of exposure or the year after exposure.

Here, we derive a monthly climatology of the daily ozone cycle from 17 yr of GROMOS observation. We present the <b>diurnal</b> <b>ozone</b> variation of the stratosphere and mesosphere. Characterizing the diurnal cycle of stratospheric ozone is important for correct trend estimates {{of the ozone layer}} derived from satellite observations. The <b>diurnal</b> <b>ozone</b> cycle from GROMOS is compared to two models: The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and the Hamburg Model of Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA). Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (Aura/MLS) ozone data, from night- and daytime overpasses over Bern, have also been included in the comparison. Generally, observation and models show good qualitative agreement: in the lower mesosphere, daytime ozone is for both GROMOS and models around 25 % less than nighttime ozone (reference is 22 : 30 – 01 : 30). In the stratosphere, ozone reaches its maximum in the afternoon showing values several percent larger than the midnight value. It is important that <b>diurnal</b> <b>ozone</b> variations of this order are taken into account when merging different data sets for the derivation of long-term ozone trends in the stratosphere. Further, GROMOS and models indicate a seasonal behavior of daily ozone variations in the stratosphere with a larger afternoon maximum during daytime in summer than in winter. At 0. 35 hPa, observations from GROMOS and Aura/MLS show a seasonal pattern in <b>diurnal</b> <b>ozone</b> variations with larger relative amplitudes during daytime in winter (− 25 ± 5 %) than in summer (− 18 ± 4 %) (compared to mean values around midnight). For the first time, a time series of the <b>diurnal</b> variations in <b>ozone</b> is presented: 17 yr of GROMOS data show strong interannual variations in the <b>diurnal</b> <b>ozone</b> cycle for both the stratosphere and the mesosphere. There are some indications that strong temperature tides can suppress the diurnal variation of stratospheric ozone via the anticorrelation of temperature and ozone.

The instruments GROMOS-C and OZORAM have been located at the AWIPEV research base at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard (79 ° N, 12 ° E) and gathered a comprehensive time series of middle atmospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> with a high time resolution. An intercomparison was performed with EOS MLS and ozone sonde measurements and simulations with SD-WACCM.

Throughout the year the insolation in the Arctic changes drastically from polar night to polar day. Accordingly, the seasonal variations in the <b>diurnal</b> <b>ozone</b> cycle are large. In the stratosphere we found a diurnal cycle throughout the whole period of polar day with the largest amplitude in April. In the mesosphere a diurnal cycle was detected in spring and fall.

40|$|We {{present a}} method to derive the site {{atmospheric}} state best estimate (SASBE) of the <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> combining brightness temperature spectra around the 142 GHz absorption line of ozone measured by the microwave radiometer SOMORA and <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> measured by the radiosonde (RS). The SASBE <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> is obtained using the radiosonde <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> as a priori information in an optimal estimation retrieval of the SOMORA radiometer. The resulting <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> ranges from ground up to 65 km altitude and makes optimal use of the available information at each altitude. The high vertical resolution of the radiosonde profile can be conserved and {{the uncertainty of the}} SASBE is well defined at each altitude. A SASBE <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> dataset has been generated for Payerne, Switzerland, with a temporal resolution of 3 profiles a week for the time period ranging from 2011 to 2013. The relative difference of the SASBE <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> to the AURA/MLS <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> lies between − 3 to 6 % over the vertical range of 20 – 65 km. Above 20 km, the agreement between the SASBE and AURA/MLS <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> is better than the agreement between the operational SOMORA ozone data set and AURA/MLS. Below 20 km the SASBE ozone data are identical to the radiosonde measurements.

40|$|Climatological <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> {{data are}} widely used as a-priori {{information}} for total ozone using DOAS type retrievals {{as well as for}} <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> retrieval using optimal estimation, for data assimilation or evaluation of 3 -D chemistry-transport models {{and a lot of other}} applications in atmospheric sciences and remote sensing. For most applications it is important that the climatology represents not only long term mean values but also the links between ozone and dynamic input parameters. These dynamic input parameters should be easily accessible from auxiliary datasets or easily measureable, and obviously should have a high correlation with <b>ozone.</b> For <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> these parameters are mainly total ozone column and temperature profile data. This was the outcome of a user consultation carried out in the framework of developing a new, dynamic <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology. The new <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology is based on the Neural Network Ozone Retrieval System (NNORSY) widely used for <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> retrieval from UV and IR satellite sounder data. NNORSY allows implicit modelling of any non-linear correspondence between input parameters (predictors) and <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> target vector. This paper presents the approach, setup and validation of a new family of <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatologies with static as well as dynamic input parameters (total <b>ozone</b> and temperature <b>profile).</b> The neural network training relies on <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> measurement data of well known quality provided by ground based (ozonesondes) and satellite based (SAGE II, HALOE, and POAM-III) measurements over the years 1995 – 2007.

In this study, characteristics of tropospheric ozone over the South African Highveld are investigated using the ozonesonde data collected at Irene weather station (25. 9 °S, 28. 2 °E, and 1523 m asl) for the period 1990 to 1993 and 1999 to 2003. It was found that synoptic systems have an effect on the vertical distribution of tropospheric ozone. Ozone stratification appeared during anticyclonic conditions as displayed by a continental high <b>ozone</b> <b>profile.</b> During the ridging high, low ozone concentrations are observed with a strong ozone gradient between 10 and 12 km.

40|$|In {{this study}} we present the {{validation}} of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> {{from a number of}} Solar Back Scattered Ultra Violet (SBUV) and SBUV/ 2 instruments that were recently reprocessed using an updated (Version 8. 6) algorithm. The SBUV dataset provides the longest available record of global <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles,</b> spanning a 41 -year period from 1970 to 2011 (except a 5 -year gap in the 1970 s) and includes <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> records obtained from the Nimbus- 4 BUV and Nimbus- 7 SBUV instruments, and a series of SBUV(/ 2) instruments launched on NOAA operational satellites (NOAA 09, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19). Although modifications in instrument design were made in the evolution from the BUV instrument to the modern SBUV(/ 2) model, the basic principles of the measurement technique and retrieval algorithm remain the same. The long term SBUV data record allows us to create a consistent, calibrated dataset of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> {{that can be used for}} climate studies and trend analyses. In particular, we focus on estimating the various sources of error in the SBUV <b>profile</b> <b>ozone</b> retrievals using independent observations and analysis of the algorithm itself. For the first time we include in the metadata a quantitative estimate of the smoothing error, defined as the error due to profile variability that the SBUV observing system cannot inherently measure. The magnitude of the smoothing error varies with altitude, latitude, season and solar zenith angle. Between 10 and 1 hPa the smoothing errors for the SBUV monthly zonal mean retrievals are of the order of 1 %, but start to increase above and below this layer. The largest smoothing errors, as large as 15 - 20 %, were detected in in the troposphere. The SBUV averaging kernels, provided with the <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> in version 8. 6, help to eliminate the smoothing effect when comparing the SBUV profiles with high vertical resolution measurements, and make it convenient to use the SBUV <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> for data assimilation and model validation purposes. The smoothing error can also be minimized by combining layers of data, and we will discuss recommendations for this approach as well. The SBUV <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> have been intensively validated against satellite profile measurements obtained from the Microwave Limb Sounders (MLS) (on board the UARS and AURA satellites), Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS). Also, we compare coincident and collocated SBUV ozone retrievals with observations made by ground-based instruments, such as microwave spectrometers, lidars, Umkehr instruments and balloon-borne ozonosondes. Finally, we compare the SBUV <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> with output from the NASA GSFC GEOS-CCM model. In the stratosphere between 25 and 1 hPa the mean biases and standard deviations are within 5 % for monthly mean <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> Above and below this layer the vertical resolution of the SBUV algorithm decreases and the effects of vertical smoothing should be taken into account. Though the SBUV algorithm has a coarser vertical resolution in the lower stratosphere and troposphere, it is capable of precisely estimating the integrated ozone column between the surface and 25 hPa. The time series of the tropospheric - lower stratospheric ozone column derived from SBUV agrees within 5 % with the corresponding values observed by an ensemble of ozone sonde stations in North Hemisphere. Drift of the ozone time series obtained from each SBUV(/ 2) instrument relative to ground based and satellite measurements are evaluated and some features of individual SBUV(l 2) instruments are discussed. In addition to evaluating individual instruments against independent observations, we also focus on the instrument to instrument consistency in the series. Overall, Version 8. 6 <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained from two different SBUV(l 2) instruments compare within a couple of percent during overlap periods and are consistently varying in time, with some exceptions. Some of the noted discrepancies might bssociated with <b>ozone</b> <b>diurnal</b> variations, since the difference in the local time of the observations for a pair of SBUV(l 2) instruments could be several hours. Other issues include the potential short-term drift in measurements as the instrument orbit drifts, and measurements are obtained at high solar zenith angles (> 85).

40|$|The {{principle}} {{of a new}} inversion technique which uses multiple wavelength-solar UV radiation satellite measurements for determining vertical <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> is described, and examples of computer simulations for 280, 300, 320, and 340 nm are discussed. Weighting functions corresponding to {{the sensitivity of the}} limb radiance to the relative ozone density at each altitude are the basis for the inversion equation, which is then solved by an iteration technique. The use of multiple wavelengths can provide more information of higher accuracy over a wider height range than those profiles recovered at a single wavelength. It is indicated that an effective range of altitude of approximately 20 - 70 km with a vertical resolution of 1 - 2 km is feasible for determining <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> with an inferred profile error about three to four times larger than the measurement error within that altitude region. <b>Ozone</b> <b>profile</b> accuracy of the highest altitude region may be improved using wavelengths down to 260 nm, and inferred <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> above 70 km are possible, but with a larger error...|$|R

The Neural Network Ozone Retrieval System (NNORSY) was developed at the Center for Solar energy and Hydrogen Research (ZSW) for retrieval of total ozone columns and/or <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> and applied on several satellite instruments, e. g. the TOVS (TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder) and GOME (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment). Besides three look-up-table climatologies (LUTs) a dynamical software climatology based on neural network technique was developed (NN).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} the smoothness of vertical <b>profiles</b> of <b>ozone</b> concentrations. We describe the smoothness of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> via a characteristic {{scale of the}} profile fluctuations. The characteristic scale was computed for 11 -years (1989 - 1999) ozone sonde data at Sodankylä. Mean values of the characteristic scale were determined. They are ~ 1 km in the troposphere and ~ 1. 4 km in the lower stratosphere (up to 25 km). Only slight seasonal variations of these parameters are observed. The information about smoothness of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> is needed both in the instrumental design for defining the vertical resolution requirements and {{in the development of}} inversion algorithms from remote sensing measurements, in order to obtain the best accuracy in retrieved <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> and sufficient resolution...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} and applies a {{new technique}} for retrieving diurnal variability in tropospheric ozone vertical distribution using ground-based measurements of ultraviolet sky radiances. The measured radiances are obtained by a polarization-insensitive modified Brewer double spectrometer located at Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA. Results demonstrate that the Brewer angular (0 - 72 deg viewing zenith angle) and spectral (303 - 320 nm) measurements of sky radiance in the solar principal plane provide sufficient information to derive tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>diurnal</b> variability. In addition, the Brewer measurements provide stratospheric ozone vertical distributions at least twice per day near sunrise and sunset. Frequent measurements of total column ozone amounts from direct-sun observations are used as constraints in the retrieval. The vertical <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> resolution is shown in terms of averaging kernels to yield at least four points in the troposphere-low stratosphere, including good information in Umkehr layer 0 (0 - 5 km). The focus {{of this paper is}} on the derivation of stratospheric and tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> using both simulated and measured radiances. We briefly discuss the necessary modifications of the Brewer spectrometer that were used to eliminate instrumental polarization sensitivity so that accurate sky radiances can be obtained in the presence of strong Rayleigh scattering and aerosols. The results demonstrate that including a site-specific and time-dependent aerosol correction, based on Brewer direct-sun observations of aerosol optical thickness, is critical to minimize the sky radiance residuals as a function of observing angle in the optimal estimation inversion algorithm and improve the accuracy of the retrieved <b>ozone</b> <b>profile...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a HARMonized dataset of <b>OZone</b> <b>profiles</b> (HARMOZ) based on limb and {{occultation}} measurements from Envisat (GOMOS, MIPAS and SCIAMACHY), Odin (OSIRIS, SMR) and SCISAT (ACE-FTS) satellite instruments. These measurements provide high-vertical-resolution <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> covering the altitude range from the upper troposphere up to the mesosphere in years 2001 - 2012. HARMOZ has been created {{in the framework of}} European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative project. The harmonized dataset consists of original retrieved <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> from each instrument, which are screened for invalid data by the instrument teams. While the original <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> are presented in different units and on different vertical grids, the harmonized dataset is given on a common pressure grid in netcdf format. The pressure grid corresponds to vertical sampling of ~ 1 km below 20 km and 2 - 3 km above 20 km. The vertical range of the <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> is specific for each instrument, thus all information contained in the original data is preserved. Provided altitude and temperature profiles allow the representation of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> in number density or mixing ratio on a pressure or altitude vertical grids. Geolocation, uncertainty estimates and vertical resolution are provided for each profile. For each instrument, optional parameters, which might be related to the data quality, are also included. For convenience of users, tables of biases between each pair of instruments for each month, as well as bias uncertainties, are provided. These tables characterize the data consistency and can be used in various bias and drift analyses, which are needed, for instance, for combining several datasets to obtain a long-term climate dataset. This user-friendly dataset can be interesting and useful for various analyses and applications, such as data merging, data validation, assimilation and scientific research.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{modeling}} of altitude-dependent patterns of ozone variations over time. Umkehr <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> (quarter of Umkehr layer) from 1978 to 2011 are investigated at two locations: Boulder (USA) and Arosa (Switzerland). The study consists of two statistical stages. First we approximate <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> employing an appropriate basis. To capture primary modes of ozone variations without losing essential information, a functional principal component analysis is performed. It penalizes roughness of the function and smooths excessive variations {{in the shape of the}} <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> As a result, data-driven basis functions (empirical basis functions) are obtained. The coefficients (principal component scores) corresponding to the empirical basis functions represent dominant temporal evolution in the shape of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> We use those time series coefficients in the second statistical step to reveal the important sources of the patterns and variations in the profiles. We estimate the effects of covariates – month, year (trend), quasi-biennial oscillation, the solar cycle, the Arctic oscillation, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation cycle and the Eliassen–Palm flux – on the principal component scores of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> using additive mixed effects models. The effects are represented as smooth functions and the smooth functions are estimated by penalized regression splines. We also impose a heteroscedastic error structure that reflects the observed seasonality in the errors. The more complex error structure enables us to provide more accurate estimates of influences and trends, together with enhanced uncertainty quantification. Also, we are able to capture fine variations in the time evolution of the profiles, such as the semi-annual oscillation. We conclude by showing the trends by altitude over Boulder and Arosa, as well as for total column ozone. There are great variations in the trends across altitudes, which highlights the benefits of modeling <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R
