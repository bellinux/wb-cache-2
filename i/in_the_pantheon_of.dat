5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheon</b> <b>of</b> Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

50|$|Fields was a forward-looking, philanthropic and multi-talented woman, who {{encouraged}} {{the talents of}} others even as she followed {{the good of the}} intellect. Although Fields often turns up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheons</b> <b>of</b> 19th century poetry, it is for her short sympathetic biographies that she is now remembered.|$|R

25|$|Bode, {{despite all}} the high distinctions he received, both from Academia and Government, did not rest on his laurels.

25|$|In 1609, Annibale {{died and}} was buried, {{according}} to his wish, near Raphael <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pantheon</b> <b>of</b> Rome. It {{is a measure of}} his achievement that artists as diverse as Bernini, Poussin, and Rubens praised his work. Many of his assistants or pupils in projects at the Palazzo Farnese and Herrera Chapel would become among the pre-eminent artists of the next decades, including Domenichino, Francesco Albani, Giovanni Lanfranco, Domenico Viola, Guido Reni, Sisto Badalocchio, and others.|$|E

500|$|Like many Chicago blues harp players, Butterfield {{approached}} the instrument like a horn, preferring single notes to chords, {{and used it}} for soloing. His style {{has been described as}} [...] "always intense, understated, concise, and serious", and he was [...] "known for purity and intensity of his tone, his sustained breath control, and his unique ability to bend notes to his will". In his choice of notes he has been compared to Big Walter Horton, but he was never seen as an imitator of any particular harp player. [...] Rather, he developed [...] "a style original and powerful enough to place him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheon</b> <b>of</b> true blues greats".|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the {{publication}} of the final volume, Phipps' work had established for itself a place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheon</b> <b>of</b> Napoleonic literature. It [...] "will always be regarded as a valuable source," [...] well-known to students of the Napoleonic era, and the last volume, critics maintained, was [...] "as interesting as its predecessors." [...] Not only did Phipps achieve his goal of creating a record of the development of the marshals, but his volumes have become a useful history of the progress of the wars themselves, from 1792 to 1799. The true value of the first volume, and indeed the subsequent four, lies in its repeated use as a reference work.|$|E
500|$|Maria Amélia became {{engaged to}} Archduke Maximilian of Austria in early 1852, {{but before the}} {{marriage}} could take place she contracted tuberculosis, and {{was taken to the}} town of Funchal on the Portuguese island of Madeira.

500|$|According to IGN's Leif Johnson, 1994 [...] "was {{the year}} of games like Doom and Mortal Kombat II". Over the {{following}} years, multiple publications acclaimed Mortal Kombat II {{as one of the}} best video games ever. It was ranked as the 97th top game of all time by the staff of Game Informer in 2001, as the 38th most important video game of all time by the staff of GamePro in 2007, and as the 32nd best video game of all time by The Boston Phoenix in 2010. Featuring it in their 2003 video game hall of fame series, the staff of GameSpot wrote: [...] "Mortal Kombat II was so much better, as a sequel, than it had to be that it absolutely deserves a place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheon</b> <b>of</b> all-time classics." ...|$|E
500|$|The media {{focused on}} Häkkinen {{overtaking}} Michael Schumacher {{for the lead}} on lap 41, and after the race Häkkinen went to Schumacher in the parc fermé and {{told him not to}} make a move like that again. Zonta later said that although he was unaware of Häkkinen's presence, he saw Schumacher in his mirrors. Derick Allsop of The Independent described the impact the move might have on Häkkinen's career: [...] "Perhaps, he [...] will be recognised as a driver worthy of a place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheon</b> <b>of</b> the sport's heroes." [...] According to McLaren team principal Ron Dennis, [...] "His overtaking manoeuvre I'm sure will go down {{as one of the greatest}} in Formula One history", and in February 2001 Häkkinen's move was chosen by more than 60 Formula One historians as the MasterCard Priceless Moment of the 2000 F1 season.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} on the RAAF in November 1939, Flight magazine described Henry Petre and Eric Harrison as [...] "the fathers of military aviation in Australia". Though Harrison, through his longer association with Australian service flying as {{a founding member}} of the Royal Australian Air Force in 1921 and his career up until the end of World WarII, was generally regarded as the [...] "Father of the RAAF" [...] until Air Marshal Richard Williams assumed that mantle, Douglas Gillison considered Petre [...] "equally entitled" [...] to such an accolade. In his volume on the Air Force for The Australian Centenary History of Defence in 2001, Alan Stephens noted that Petre made [...] "the greater contribution to the establishment of Point Cook and the Central Flying School", concluding that [...] "perhaps any judgement would not only be moot but also gratuitous, as by circumstance and achievement both men properly belong <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheon</b> <b>of</b> the RAAF".|$|E
50|$|Fernando Peñalver (1765-1837), was a Venezuelan {{independence}} {{leader and}} {{hero of the}} Venezuelan War of Independence. He was the first governor of the Province of Carabobo (1824-1827). He is buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Pantheon</b> <b>of</b> Venezuela.|$|R
25|$|He {{is known}} for his prosaic use of metaphors, his {{brilliant}} use of historical imagery, and his aesthetic perfectionism. These attributes, amongst others, have assured him an enduring place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literary <b>pantheon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western World.|$|R

500|$|Despite {{his accomplishments}} in {{overseeing}} {{the training of}} every student pilot {{who served in the}} Australian Flying Corps during World WarI, Eric Harrison received no decorations or other official recognition, prompting Group Captain Mark Lax, at the 1999 RAAF History Conference, to describe him as [...] "perhaps the unluckiest of the entire AFC... an unsung hero". He was, however, generally considered to be the [...] "Father of the RAAF" [...] until the title eventually settled on Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams. Harrison's early technical expertise, long association with Australian military aviation as a founder member of the AFC and the RAAF, and [...] "more assertive" [...] personality tended to overshadow the contributions of Henry Petre, whom historian Douglas Gillison considered [...] "equally entitled" [...] to such an accolade. Reviewing the contributions of Petre and Harrison in his volume of The Australian Centenary History of Defence in 2001, Alan Stephens concluded that [...] "perhaps any judgement would not only be moot but also gratuitous, as by circumstance and achievement both men properly belong <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheon</b> <b>of</b> the RAAF".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive critical {{reviews from}} the press. Matt Zoller Seitz from The Star-Ledger gave an overwhelmingly positive review of [...] "Triangle". Applauding Carter's risky and audacious direction, {{he noted that}} [...] "there has never been an hour of TV that looks or moves like 'Triangle'". He argued that the 1939 scene where Mulder and [...] "Scully" [...] cross paths with present-Scully was [...] "the greatest minute of TV this year". Seitz also compared the episode to three-dimensional video games, like Doom, Quake, and Castle Wolfenstein, citing the episode's [...] "gloomy corridors" [...] and [...] "nightmarish cartoon Nazis". Michael Liedtke and George Avalos from The Charlotte Observer predicted that [...] "'Triangle' seems destined to take its rightful place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheon</b> <b>of</b> greatest 'X-Files' episodes". Enjoying the plethora of Wizard of Oz references, the two parodied a portion of [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] in their column. Not all reviewers were so positive; for Alan Sepinwall, [...] "Triangle" [...] was the episode [...] "that {{turned out to be}} a dream", making it [...] "technically impressive but dramatically murky".|$|E
500|$|Several collaborations between Rakoto Frah {{and other}} {{international}} artists have been recorded. Rakoto Frah is featured on tracks recorded with Manu Dibango, jazz artists David Lindley and Henry Keiser, Kassav', and Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whom he met while performing in India. As a musician who played by ear, he would join an ongoing performance by listening carefully to determine the key of the song. The American composer and jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman described Rakoto Frah as having [...] "some of the best phrasing of any musician in the world". He was also cited as a key influence by Ian Anderson, the flutist and leader of 1970s British rock group Jethro Tull. In the liner notes for the 1991 compilation A World Out of Time, producers David Lindley and Henry Kaiser expressed their admiration for the artist, stating: [...] "He {{is one of the}} most amazing master musicians and individuals that we have ever met. His mastery of the sodina is on a level that you could only compare to great, western instrumental masters like John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Billy Pigg or Miles Davis. Rakoto Frah certainly seems to know mysterious things about the phrasing of melodies that nobody else knows." [...] Contemporary Malagasy artists performing in diverse genres ranging from heavy metal and hip hop to jazz and the traditional mangaliba have cited the sodina master as an inspiration and legend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheon</b> <b>of</b> Malagasy cultural figures.|$|E

25|$|Before Christianization, the Gaelic Irish were polytheistic or pagan. They {{had many}} gods and goddesses, which {{generally}} have parallels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheons</b> <b>of</b> other European nations. Two groups of supernatural beings who appear throughout Irish mythology—the Tuatha Dé Danann and Fomorians—are believed to represent <b>the</b> Gaelic <b>pantheon.</b> They were also animists, believing that {{all aspects of}} the natural world contained spirits, and that these spirits could be communicated with. Burial practices—which included burying food, weapons, and ornaments with the dead—suggest a belief in life after death. Some have equated this afterlife with the Otherworld realms known as Magh Meall and Tír na nÓg in Irish mythology. There were four main religious festivals each year, marking the traditional four divisions of the year – Samhain, Imbolc, Bealtaine and Lughnasadh.|$|R
2500|$|By the 19th century, {{an influx}} of enslaved Africans from other regions had relegated Watermama to a {{position}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantheon</b> <b>of</b> the deities of the Surinamese Winti religion. When Winti was outlawed in the 1970s, her religious practices [...] lost some of their importance in Suriname. Furthermore, a relative lack of freedom compared to their African brethren prevented the homogenisation that occurred with the Mami Wata cult across the Atlantic.|$|E
