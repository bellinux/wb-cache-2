40|$|Warfare {{is often}} {{thought of as the}} antithesis of Coasean {{bargaining}} over entitlements because armed conflicts consume real resources whose destruction could be avoided by negotiated solutions. We argue that fighting and negotiating are not mutually exclusive methods of resolving disputes between nations [...] there can often be a useful role for bargaining between a state and agents of its enemy, even when armed conflict has broken out between opposing states. We evaluate the efficacy and normative desirability of selectively substituting "bribes" for "bombs" as a means of warfare. We show how inter-country disparities in wealth, differences in military strength, the organization of the bribing and recipient forces, uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, and communications technology can contribute to the efficacy of bribes. We discuss methods for enforcing bargains struck between opposing forces, a key problem in structuring bribes. We also examine the legal status of bribe agreements, under both international and US law.

50|$|Political {{corruption}} {{is a large}} concern in Spain. Political {{corruption is}} defined as the action or inaction of one or more real persons managing public resources for their own or a third party's benefit to the detriment of all the citizens they should serve and benefit. Transparency International Global Corruption Barometer 2013 shows that the surveyed households consider political parties, Parliament and the judiciary the most corrupt institutions. However, the occurrence of petty corruption is rare in Spain, according to the Barometer 2013. Several other sources, including World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014 and Ernst & Young Fraud Survey 2013, show that bribery and corrupt practises are widespread in businesses in Spain.

5000|$|More specifically, the OECD Convention {{requires}} that bribery of foreign public officials be punishable, by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties {{comparable to those}} applicable to their own public officials.

Furthermore, countries must facilitate mutual legal assistance and cannot invoke [...] "bank secrecy" [...] to deny mutual legal assistance.

50|$|The {{results of}} these reports and {{perception}} surveys suggest that whilst there is instances of corruption within Luxembourg, the country's assessment by the European Union suggests that mechanisms exist to combat these instances and promote ethical behaviour {{on the part of}} public officials. Whilst Luxembourg lacks a specific anti corruption strategy, soft law instruments such as the quasi-legal instruments of organisations like the European Union, inform judicial bodies and government officials when prosecuting. In recent years, their Anti Corruption framework has had a particular focus on efficient control of public institutions such as police and government bodies to avoid anti corrupt behaviours in these sectors. Criminal law was last amended in 2011 to accommodate anti-corruption legislation, although the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) recommended in August 2014 that more reform needed to implemented to modify their criminal policy framework (due to gaps in legislation regarding <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery</b> offences). Positively, an inter-ministerial committee, the Corruption Prevention Committee, was established in 2007 and meets annually, which shows a conscious effort on behalf of the country to keep anti corruption mechanisms on the forefront. A hotline has also been established which is run by Transparency International in Luxembourg. This hotline is an avenue for members of the public to submit claims of corruption and is a useful anti corruption mechanism employed by Luxembourg.|$|E

40|$|<b>Foreign</b> <b>bribery</b> - {{the payment}} of bribes across borders - poses a classic {{collective}} action problem in theory. A firm may extract benefits through {{the payment of}} bribes to foreign public officials without its own country bearing the associated costs of governmental corruption, and hence while eliminating <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery</b> {{may be in the}} best interests of all who are engaged with the global economy, there are few obvious incentives for any one national government to be the first to take action. Over the last two decades, however, an unprecedented degree of multilateral cooperation on the issue of <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery</b> has been achieved. In particular, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been a key institutional locus of activity, serving as the coordinating body for the monitoring and enforcement of a comprehensive anti-bribery convention that was adopted in 1997. This convention appears to have been largely successful at least in terms of spurring legislative change: all OECD member countries as well as several nonmember nations have since adopted laws that explicitly criminalize the act of bribing foreign public officials, and the capacity of the state to monitor, detect, and prosecute the offense of <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery</b> has ostensibly been enhanced. Given the potential for collective action problems to develop, it is thus important to ask whether the legislative action that has been taken thus far is meaningful in any measurable sense. I answer this question by constructing an original measure of the strictness of <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery</b> legislation, which I then employ as the main independent variable in an empirical study of export data, utilizing both difference-in-difference estimators and regression analysis. The results of my analysis provide support for the hypothesis that the enactment of stricter <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery</b> legislation amongst the countries party to the OECD convention has reduced exports to more corrupt countries more so than it has exports to less corrupt countries. These findings are robust to a variety of sensitivity tests, and I thus conclude that the OECD's multilateral anti-bribery initiatives have indeed had a meaningful impact on business decisions in the international economy. by Kevin Lim.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how criminalizing {{the act of}} bribing a foreign public official affects international trade flows using a watershed global anti-corruption initiative – the 1997 OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. This multilateral agreement criminalized <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery</b> (previously illegal only for U. S. firms) in countries that represent over 75 % of world exports. I exploit temporal variation {{in the implementation of}} the Convention along with variation in the level of corruption of importing countries to quantify the effects of the Convention on bilateral exports. In contrast to previous work on U. S. efforts to criminalize <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery,</b> I use a large panel of exporters and importers to control for a broad range of confounding global and national trends and shocks. I find that, on average, the Convention caused a reduction in bilateral exports from signatory countries to high corruption importing countries relative to low corruption importing countries. In particular, we observe a 5. 6 % relative decline in bilateral exports to importing countries that lie one standard deviation lower on the Worldwide Governance Indicators index of corruption. This suggests that by creating large penalties for <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery,</b> the Convention indirectly increased transaction costs between importing countries with high levels of corruption and exporting countries that criminalized <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery.</b> The Convention may have induced OECD firms to divert their exports to less corrupt countries; while at the same time, non-OECD firms that are not bound by the Convention may have increased their exports to corrupt countries. I also find evidence that the effects of the Convention differed across product categories...|$|E
40|$|Local and {{international}} {{public opinion polls}} suggest that Australia is a low-risk country in terms of corruption. This article challenges this reputation contending that the relative invisibility of corruption in Australia {{is the result of}} low levels of enforcement of existing laws, and the political failure to implement a co-ordinated national strategy against corruption. As a result, Australia has become increasingly vulnerable to corrupt overseas politicians seeking a safe haven for their illicit assets. These enforcement vulnerabilities extend also to cases of <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery</b> perpetrated offshore by Australian corporations, employees and agents. Enforcement of <b>foreign</b> <b>bribery</b> offences in Australia, unlike the equivalent United Kingdom offences, is hampered by an overly broad defence which excuses "facilitation payments" that otherwise would constitute acts of bribery.

40|$|Bribery in {{overseas}} {{markets is}} a major concern for U. S. foreign policy. In the 1970 s, after allegations of corruption abroad, the U. S. Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA outlines civil and criminal sanctions for corporations that seek to bribe “foreign officials. ” It also inspired responses from other states, including the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act, enacted in 2010. For decades, the federal government enforced the FCPA only sporadically. Since the turn of the twenty-first century, however, increased prosecutions under the FCPA by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission led to a corresponding increase in criticism of the statute. Responding to these critiques in November 2012, the two agencies co-authored a FCPA guideline.
