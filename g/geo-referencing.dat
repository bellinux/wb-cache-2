50|$|Modern GIS {{technologies}} use digital information, {{for which}} various digitized data creation methods are used. The most common method of data creation is digitization, where a hard copy map or survey plan is transferred into a digital medium {{through the use}} of a CAD program, and <b>geo-referencing</b> capabilities. With the wide availability of ortho-rectified imagery (from satellites, aircraft, Helikites and UAVs), heads-up digitizing is becoming the main avenue through which geographic data is extracted.

5000|$|Here Geospatial Intelligence, or the {{frequently}} used term GEOINT, is an intelligence discipline comprising the exploitation {{and analysis of}} geospatial data and information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features (both natural and constructed) and geographically referenced activities on the Earth. Geospatial Intelligence data sources include imagery and mapping data, whether collected by commercial satellite, government satellite, aircraft (such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles [...] or reconnaissance aircraft), or by other means, such as maps and commercial databases, census information, GPS waypoints, utility schematics, or any discrete data that have locations on earth. There is growing recognition that human geography, socio-cultural intelligence, {{and other aspects of}} the human domain are a critical domain of GEOINT data due to the now pervasive <b>geo-referencing</b> of demographic, ethnographic, and political stability data. There is an emerging recognition that [...] "this legal definition paints with a broad brushstroke an idea of the width and depth of GEOINT" [...] and “GEOINT must evolve even further to integrate forms of intelligence and information beyond the traditional sources of geospatial information and imagery, and must move from an emphasis on data and analysis to an emphasis on knowledge.” ...|$|E
50|$|For {{visualization}} on {{a modern}} computer screen the polar coordinates {{have to be}} converted into Cartesian coordinates. This process called radar scan conversion is presented with more detail in the next section.The second problem to solve arises {{from the fact that}} a radar system is placed in the real world and measures real world echo positions. These echoes have to be displayed together with other real world data like object positions, vector maps and satellite images in a consistent way. All this information refers to the curved earth surface but is dis-played on a flat computer display. Building a link from real world earth positions to dis-play pixels is commonly called geographical referencing or in short geo-referencing.Part of the <b>geo-referencing</b> process is to map the 3D earth surface onto a 2D display. This process of a geographical projection can be performed in many ways, but different data sources have their own ‘natural’ projection. E.g. Cartesian radar video data from a radar source on the earth surface are geo-referenced by a so-called radar projection. When using this radar projection the Cartesian radar video pixels can directly displayed on a computer screen (only being linearly transformed according to the current position on the screen and e.g. the current zoom level).A problem now arises if e.g. also a satellite map shall be shown together with the radar video data. The ‘natural’ geographical projection of a satellite image would be a satellite projection which depends on the satellite orbit, position and further parameters. Now either the satellite image has to be reprojected to a radar projection or the radar video has to use the satellite projection. This geographical re-projection is also called geographical warping or Geo Warping where each image pixel has to be transformed from one projection into another.This article describes in further detail the Geo Warping of radar video images in real time. It will also show that radar video Geo Warping is done most efficiently when it is integrated with the radar scan conversion process.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-user mobile system to visualize environmental processes. Two main modules define the system’s architecture, a <b>geo-referenced</b> model and an Augmented Reality (AR) composition module. The <b>geo-referenced</b> model {{is applied to}} the visualization of water quality, in rivers or lakes, but other models can be used allowing the visualization of different environmental processes. The AR composition module is the client side of this architecture, allowing users to visualize and interact with the <b>geo-referenced</b> model via two different views. The first view, a 2 D computer animation, enables the interaction with the <b>geo-referenced</b> model by adding or removing pollutant agents to the simulation. The second view, AR view, enables users to visualize the simulation over real images. Thus, it is possible to observe the evolution of the model {{in the vicinity of the}} users, superimposed over the view of the real environment. Interacting with the model requires the knowledge of several distinct parameters. Therefore, several templates were defined to represent different agents. These template...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{language}} place descriptions {{in everyday}} communication provide {{a rich source}} of spatial knowledge about places. An important step to utilize such knowledge in information systems is <b>geo-referencing</b> all the places referred to in these descriptions. Current techniques for <b>geo-referencing</b> places from text documents are using place name recognition and disambiguation; however, place descriptions often contain place references that are not known by gazetteers, or that are expressed in other, more flexible ways. Hence, the approach for <b>geo-referencing</b> presented in this paper starts from a place graph that contains the place references as well as spatial relationships extracted from place descriptions. Spatial relationships are used to constrain the locations of places and allow the later best-matching process for <b>geo-referencing.</b> The novel <b>geo-referencing</b> process results in higher precision and recall compared to state-of-art toponym resolution approaches on several tested place description datasets.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} data is in great {{demand for the}} various applications. In order to represent 3 D space in details, it is indispensable to acquire 3 D shape and texture together efficiently. However, there still lack a reliable, quick, cheap and handy method of acquiring three {{dimensional data}} of objects at higher resolution and accuracy in outdoor and moving environments. In this research, we propose {{a combination of a}} digital camera and a small (cheap) laser scanner with inexpensive IMU and GPS for an unmanned helicopter. Direct <b>geo-referencing</b> is achieved automatically using all the sensors without any ground control points. After the accurate trajectory of the platform with attitude changes are determined through the direct <b>geo-referencing,</b> 3 D shape of objects is determined by laser scanner as 3 D point cloud data, while texture is acquired by CCD sensor from the same platform simultaneously. A method of direct <b>geo-referencing</b> of range data and CCD images by integrating multi sensors for constructing digital surface model are focused. While measuring, an unmanned helicopter is continuously changing its position and attitude with respect to time. For direct <b>geo-referencing,</b> IMU measures the movement of the platform. IMU has a rising quality, but it is still affected by systematic errors. Through Kalman filter operation, an optimal estimate of the sensor position and attitude are determined from GPS and IMU. Meanwhile, <b>geo-referencing</b> of CCD image is determined by bundle block adjustment. GPS and IMU allow automatic setting of tie-points and they reduce the number of tie-points and searching time of tie-points by limiting of searching area. The result of bundle block adjustment aids Kalman filter. IMU are initialized for Kalman filter using the result of bundle block adjustment. That is, after every bundle block adjustment, IMU and its error are complemented. <b>Geo-referencing</b> of laser range data i...|$|E

While understanding high-level user intentions in accessing the Web, such as informational, navigational, and transactional, is useful, a finer-level classification of user interests would further help adapting mobile search results to user intensions. Our research focuses on understanding what aspects of <b>geo-referenced</b> entities are mentioned in user queries {{in an attempt to}} create a model for user intents in <b>geo-referenced</b> Web searching.

We provide insights regarding the aggregate versus individual-item requirements in browsing digital <b>geo-referenced</b> material...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} derive the {{three-dimensional}} camera position from the monocular camera vision, a <b>geo-reference</b> database is needed. Floor {{plan is a}} ubiquitous <b>geo-reference</b> database that every building refers to it during construction and facility maintenance. Comparing with other popular <b>geo-reference</b> database such as geo-tagged photos, the generation, update and maintenance of floor plan database does not require costly and time consuming survey tasks. In vision based methods, the camera needs special attention. In contrast to other sensors, vision sensors typically yield vast information that needs complex strategies to permit use in real-time and on computationally con-strained platforms.
