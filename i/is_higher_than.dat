5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} value of serum PCT levels for {{assessing}} the inflammatory response and RAS activation degree in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Methods: A total of 76 patients with acute pancreatitis who were treated in our hospital between May 2013 and April 2016 were collected, and 50 patients with pure diarrhea who received infusion treatment in our hospital {{during the same period}} were selected as the control group. Serum PCT levels of both groups were detected, and the observation group were further divided into high PCT group and low PCT group (n= 38) according to the median of PCT levels. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine serum levels of pro-inflammatory factors, anti-inflammatory factors and RAS indexes. Results: Serum PCT level of observation group <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> that of control group; serum pro-inflammatory factors IL- 1 β, IL- 6, CRP and TNF-α levels of high PCT group and low PCT group <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those of control group, anti-inflammatory factors IL- 4, IL- 10 and IL- 13 levels <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those of control group, and RAS indexes AngⅡ, RA and ALD levels <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those of control group; serum pro-inflammatory factors IL- 1 β, IL- 6, CRP and TNF-α levels of <b>high</b> PCT group <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those of low PCT group, anti-inflammatory factors IL- 4, IL- 10 and IL- 13 levels <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those of low PCT group, and the RAS indexes AngⅡ, RA and ALD levels <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those of low PCT group.

NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules, resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.
