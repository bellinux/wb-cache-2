Some claimed that much of the evidence against him could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free Gordon from prison and clear his name. The case featured prominently in the book No Smoke: The Shocking Truth About British Justice which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder.|$|E

Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as {{this is the only way}} they can determine if the drug is working.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, a New York socialite named Mary Phelps Jacob {{created the}} first modern {{brassiere}} by tying two handkerchiefs together with ribbon.

By 1914, Jacob had a patent for her design and was marketing it throughout the US.

25|$|The {{first edition}} of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, {{published}} in 1822, consisted of 200 copies only.

In that way he awoke among his public a desire for more reading-matter of this nature. These stories and poems were in fact something entirely different from what the readers were used to, not only as to what language they were witten in, but also and especially concerning their informal style. The copies of the booklet often were shared around through entire networks of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends,</b> <b>and</b> not seldom the stories and poems were transcribed by hand before the booklet was given back or passed on.|$|E

Hulsker called this a simple tragedy for van Gogh. Likewise, a long-standing family friend, Hermanus Tersteeg, an influential art dealer who taught Vincent and his brother Theo a great deal about art and literature, and who gave Vincent his first set of art supplies when he decided to become an artist, although he was always somewhat equivocal in his support, abruptly withdrew at the same time.|$|E

Parang festivities typically involve dancing and there are two primary dance styles, the slower castillian waltz and a quicker gavilan style.|$|E
