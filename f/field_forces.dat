5|$|McNair had {{established}} Army Ground Forces headquarters at the Army War College campus, where Devers lived, but Stilwell had moved the headquarters into the Pentagon. Eisenhower, {{as the new}} Chief of Staff of the Army, decided that the Army Ground Forces headquarters should be co-located with the Army Air Forces' Tactical Air Command, so it was moved to Fort Monroe, Virginia, not far from Langley Field. Devers opened his headquarters there on 1 October 1946. Further reorganization occurred on 10 March 1948, when Army Ground Forces was renamed Army <b>Field</b> <b>Forces.</b> Control of the armies {{was transferred to the}} Department of the Army, and Army <b>Field</b> <b>Forces</b> was reduced to a coordinating staff agency.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic <b>field</b> <b>forces</b> the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter {{can be thought of as}} a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E

25|$|On the Royalist side, the {{campaign}} of 1645 opened in the west, where Charles II, the young prince of Wales was sent with Hyde (later, Earl of Clarendon), Hopton, and others as his advisers. General (Lord) Goring, however, now {{in command of the}} Royalist <b>field</b> <b>forces</b> in this quarter, was truculent, insubordinate and dissolute. On the rare occasions when he did his duty, however, he did display a certain degree of skill and leadership, and the influence of the prince's counsellors was but small.|$|E
25|$|Prince Edward's brother John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster assumed {{leadership}} of the English in France. Despite further chevauchées, destroying the countryside and the productivity of the land, his efforts were strategically ineffective. The French commander, Bertrand Du Guesclin adopted Fabian tactics in avoiding major English <b>field</b> <b>forces</b> while capturing towns, including Poitiers and Bergerac. In a further strategic blow, English dominance at sea was reversed by the disastrous defeat at the Battle of La Rochelle, undermining English seaborne trade and allowing Gascony to be threatened.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{commanded}} the <b>field</b> <b>forces</b> in the Second Seminole War and the Creek War in 1836. Scott was recalled to Washington {{due to the}} highly politicized nature of the tactics he employed and the huge expenditures incurred in policing the frontier, compounded by controversies between regular army and local militia officers. Brigadier General Edmund Meredith Shackelford was appointed commander in the area by President Jackson until Brigadier General Thomas Jesup could arrive. A court of inquiry later cleared Scott of wrongdoing in the Seminole and Creek operations.|$|E

25|$|The army's war {{strategy}} and fighting tactics generally remained fairly constant throughout the imperial era. The infantry battalions, {{supported by the}} cavalry and elephantry, engaged the enemy in the open battlefield. The arrival of European firearms {{did not lead to}} any major changes in battle techniques or transform traditional ideas of combat. Rather, the new weapons were used to reinforce traditional ways of fighting with the dominant weaponry still the war elephants, pikes, swords and spears. In contrast to European-style drill and tactical co-ordination, Burmese <b>field</b> <b>forces</b> generally fought in small groups under individual leaders.|$|E
25|$|Within {{approximately}} ± 20 {{degrees of}} the magnetic equator, is the equatorial anomaly. It is the occurrence of a trough in the ionization in the F2 layer at the equator and crests at about 17 degrees in magnetic latitude. The Earth's magnetic field lines are horizontal at the magnetic equator. Solar heating and tidal oscillations in the lower ionosphere move plasma up and across the magnetic field lines. This sets up a sheet of electric current in the E region which, with the horizontal magnetic <b>field,</b> <b>forces</b> ionization up into the F layer, concentrating at ± 20 degrees from the magnetic equator. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} equatorial fountain.|$|E
25|$|In April 1967 MACSOG {{was ordered}} to {{commence}} Operation DANIEL BOONE, a cross-border recon effort in Cambodia. Both SOG and the 5th Special Forces Group had been preparing for just such an eventuality. The 5th had {{gone so far as}} to create Projects B-56 Sigma and B-50 Omega, units based on SOG's SHINING BRASS organization, which had been conducting in-country recon efforts on behalf of the <b>Field</b> <b>Forces,</b> awaiting authorization to begin the Cambodian operations. A turf war now raged between the 5th and SOG over missions and manpower. The Joint Chiefs decided in favor of MACSOG, since it already successfully conducted covert cross-border operations. Operational control of Sigma and Omega was eventually handed over to SOG.|$|E

25|$|The main {{responsibility}} for AA defence of the United Kingdom was entrusted to the part-time Territorial Army, which developed a large-scale organisation under Anti-Aircraft Command before {{the outbreak of}} World War II. The Regulars of 1st Air Defence Brigade (later 1st AA Brigade) were to provide AA cover for <b>field</b> <b>forces,</b> initially for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) that would go overseas on the outbreak of war. In 1938 {{it was decided that}} all coastal and AA searchlights, which operated alongside the Royal Artillery (RA), would become the responsibility of that corps; however, the transfers had not been completed when war was declared in September 1939. A 2nd AA Battalion, RE, was organised at Blackdown in 1936, but this was disbanded in September 1938 and replaced by 2nd Searchlight Regiment, RA.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the German {{invasion}} of Belgium, some construction was taking place at the fort. The main fort was accessible by workers' excavations, compromising security and protection. On 12 May 1940 the Germans attacked, having already captured Eben-Emael the previous day. The German commander, General Fedor von Bock, demanded the surrender of Battice and Tancrémont on 20–21 May after the German capture of Aubin-Neufchâteau had resulted in significant casualties on both sides. Battice complied on 22 May, but Tancrémont refused. The Germans therefore bypassed Tancrémont. The fort held out through the capitulation of the Belgian field army, Captain Devos believing that the surrender applied only to <b>field</b> <b>forces.</b> Devos eventually obtained written confirmation of the general surrender order signed by General Spang and surrendered the fort the day after the general capitulation, on 29 May 1940. The garrison was sent by the Germans to labor in Silesia.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Fort Fisher, {{the port city of}} Wilmington was sealed to any further {{blockade}} runners; the Confederates had no remaining major ports along the Atlantic seaboard. Confederate forces evacuated the other defensive works near the mouth of the Cape Fear River; they were forced to disable and abandon the heavy artillery since they lacked the means to move them upriver. While the Confederate defeat at Fort Fisher the previous month affected morale somewhat and led to an increase in desertion, the remaining soldiers also reported that morale remained high. General Braxton Bragg commanded the defenses of Wilmington; his <b>field</b> <b>forces</b> consisted of General Robert F. Hoke's division from the Army of Northern Virginia and some heavy artillery men and home guard. Hoke commanded three of his brigades {{on the east side of}} the Cape Fear River, along Sugar Loaf north of Fort Fisher; Hoke's fourth brigade occupied Fort Anderson on the west side of the river. Bragg remained in Wilmington in order to remove a stockpile of government stores and also to prevent the Union forces on the coast from reinforcing Major General William T. Sherman's army.|$|E
