5|$|The badnjak ceremony, {{originally}} performed {{only within}} the family, became a more public celebration. A custom developed before WorldWarI in the Kingdom of Serbia to lay the badnjak on a fire built in military barracks, so that the soldiers stationed there over Christmas could share <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> atmosphere. In the succeeding Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the military badnjak ceremony was standardized in army service regulations. On Christmas Eve, {{under the command of}} a specially appointed officer, the representatives of military units of a garrison formed a festive procession on horses, accompanied with music. Members of citizens' associations and other civilians of the garrison town usually joined the procession as it proceeded to the nearest wood to collect the badnjak. They felled a set number of trees, dedicated respectively to the Royal Palace, the military command of the town, the respective commands of units of the garrison, its oldest officer, and its officers' assembly house. The procession brought the trees to the barracks, in whose yard an open fire was built. The garrison commander then placed the trees ceremonially on the fire, and gave an appropriate address.|$|E

Cal played without two of the highest performing receivers in the NCAA, however, their loss was attributed in many press reports to the Bears' disappointment over being denied their first Rose Bowl appearance in 45 years.|$|E
25|$|In the 2006 season, the Aggies again rebounded under Franchione, {{posting a}} 9–3 regular season record that {{included}} Franchione's first win over rival Texas. The 9–3 record also marked the most wins for A since 1998. However, in that season's Oklahoma game, which ESPN's College GameDay visited, Franchione was criticized by fans {{for making a}} field goal call with 3:28 left in the game. The 18th-ranked Sooners ended up defeating the 21st-ranked Aggies, 17-16. In the postseason, the Aggies faced 20th-ranked California <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holiday</b> Bowl and lost 45-10.|$|E

Cal also became bowl-eligible again and accepted a bid to play Texas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holiday</b> Bowl, while the Longhorns and Golden Bears have not met since 1970 in Austin, there was recent history invoking the two teams because of the 2004 Rose Bowl controversy.

25|$|Controversy also {{arose in}} {{selecting}} the second at-large {{team of the}} BCS after Utah. California expected to get the invitation, having been ranked fourth by the BCS entering {{the last week of}} the regular season. Texas, which had been left out of the BCS the previous season, was ranked fifth. Both teams finished with 10-1 records, but the Longhorns received a boost of support from poll voters in the final regular season rankings to overtake Cal and move into the fourth position, which ensured they would also receive the final at-large bid. Texas coach Mack Brown was criticized for publicly politicking voters to put Texas ahead of California, and Cal coach Jeff Tedford called for coaches' votes to be made public. Texas went on to defeat Michigan in the Rose Bowl, while California lost to Texas Tech <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holiday</b> Bowl. Much of the pre-bowl criticisms of Texas being given the spot vs. Michigan evaporated when the Longhorns and Wolverines produced an instant classic game that was marked by a breakthrough performance by Vince Young and a Texas FG as time expired to give them a 38-37 victory.|$|E
25|$|In the 2005 season, Peterson's {{playing time}} was limited by a broken foot. He injured his ankle {{in the first}} Big 12 Conference {{game of the season}} against Kansas State.

His 2005 season was also notable for a career-long 84-yard touchdown run against Oklahoma State. Oklahoma finished the season with an 8–4 record, the worst season since 1999. They finished third in the Big 12 behind the Texas Longhorns and the Texas Tech Red Raiders. The Sooners would represent the Big 12 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holiday</b> Bowl, where they defeated the #6 Oregon Ducks, 17–14. On July 11, 2007, the NCAA announced the Sooners would have to vacate all victories from the 2005 season, including the bowl game, due to NCAA violations; however, the decision was partially overturned in February 2008, and the NCAA reinstated the Sooners' 8–4 record from the season. Upon the conclusion of the season, he was named a member of the All-Big 12 Conference team.|$|E

25|$|Nebraska's {{first season}} in the Big Ten Conference was {{moderately}} successful, placing third in the Legends Division and finishing {{the season with a}} 9–4 record. There was more success in 2012 as the Cornhuskers went undefeated at home {{for the first time since}} 2001 and won the Legends Division. However, they lost the Big Ten Championship game to Wisconsin and the Capital One Bowl to #6 Georgia, ending the season with a 10–4 record. 2013 saw Nebraska tie for second place in the Legends Division and wrap up a 9–4 season with a win over #23 Georgia in the Gator Bowl. In 2014, the Cornhuskers put up a regular season record of 9–3, tying for second place in the newly organized West Division. Pelini was fired the day after the regular season ended. At the time he was fired, the university reportedly still owed Pelini $7.65 million according to the terms of his contract. Pelini exited the Nebraska football program with a 67–27 record (.713), winning at least 9 games each season, although the Cornhuskers never won a conference title under Pelini. Shortly thereafter, Nebraska hired Oregon State University coach Mike Riley as the team's new head coach. The Cornhuskers concluded the 2014 season under interim head coach Barney Cotton, losing to #24 USC <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holiday</b> Bowl and finishing with a 9–4 record, marking Nebraska's seventh consecutive four-loss season.|$|E
25|$|Other {{teams have}} won the {{national}} championship despite playing presumably weaker schedules than other championship contenders. The BYU Cougars ended the 1984 season as the only undefeated and untied team in the nation, and the nine-time defending champions of the Western Athletic Conference. The Cougars opened {{the season with a}} 20–14 victory over No. 3 Pittsburgh, and won the Holiday Bowl against a 6–5 Michigan team that had been ranked as high as No. 2 that season. As the No. 4 ranked team {{at the end of the}} regular season, Washington were offered a slot against BYU <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holiday</b> Bowl; Washington declined, preferring instead to play in the more lucrative Orange Bowl where they beat No. 2 Oklahoma to complete a Pac-10 sweep of New Year's Day bowls (with USC winning the Rose Bowl and UCLA winning the Fiesta Bowl). Washington (11–1) was voted No. 2 following the bowl season with their only blemish a late season loss at Pac-10 champ USC. Coupled with winning its last 11 games in 1983, BYU finished the 1984 season with a 24-game winning streak. Several coaches and reporters claimed that BYU had not played a legitimate schedule and should not be recognized as national champion. Not only was Pittsburgh the only ranked team the Cougars faced all season, but at the time BYU played in the mid-major WAC. Nonetheless, BYU was a near-unanimous choice as national champion in final polls.|$|E
