Depending on the model, {{from one to}} 18 <b>display</b> <b>stations</b> and from three to 12 printers could be attached.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM 3161/3163 ASCII <b>Display</b> <b>Stations</b> became {{available}} in 1985 and featured: ...|$|R
50|$|For over 100 years, <b>display</b> <b>stations</b> were {{established}} at yacht clubs, marinas, and Coast Guard stations to hoist flags, pennants and colored lights to warn mariners of storms at sea. The <b>display</b> <b>stations</b> were individually notified by the National Weather Service {{to raise the}} signals and again to lower them when the hazards passed. The National Weather Service paid for the visual signals; however, the <b>display</b> <b>stations</b> were operated by other agencies or volunteers. Although the Coastal Warning Display program has been formally discontinued, U.S. Coast Guard and other stations may continue to display warning signals without the direct participation of the National Weather Service.|$|R
50|$|The 3196 <b>Display</b> <b>Station</b> is {{a member}} of the 5250 Information Display System, and can be used with the S/36, S/38, or AS/400 locally {{attached}} or remotely attached via the 5294 or 5394 Remote Control Unit. A low-profile typewriter keyboard permits the operator to enter, display, and manipulate data on a 12-inch monochrome screen. The 3196 <b>display</b> <b>station</b> performs all the basic functions as the 5291-2 plus a number of additional functions. Capable of displaying up to 1,920 characters with 24 lines of 80 characters each, the 3196 also displays a 25th line containing an operator information area. The 3196 is compatible with the 5291 Model 2 <b>Display</b> <b>Station</b> and applications written for that product will operate on the 3196.|$|E

40|$|A {{low cost}} virtual reality system that generates corner {{projection}} using three PlayStation 2 is presented. Two <b>display</b> <b>stations</b> each connected to one projector {{is used to}} provide panoramic view of the VR scene. A control station receives user input and broadcasts the instruction to the two <b>display</b> <b>stations</b> in order to update their respective camera positions and orientations. A demo application which immerses the user inside a glider flying through a night city has also been implemented. We report the performance of our system using random primitives. The benchmark revealed a gradual decline in frame rate in response to polygon counts in the scene. Polygon rate in our system remained near constant and does not vary with the polygon count on the screen. The results indicated for our system, a polygon count of 3540 on the screen with a refresh rate of 24 fps is optimum in an interactive environment. Investigation {{on the relationship between}} roundtrip time and scene complexity revealed a significant positive correlation of (0. 966). This suggests system response to user command can be delayed in a complex virtual environment...|$|R
50|$|Special CAM-D {{receivers}} {{provide the}} benefit of better frequency response and a slow auxiliary data channel for <b>display</b> of <b>station</b> ID, programming titles, etc.|$|R
50|$|Some {{pioneering}} {{storage tube}} displays were MIT Project MAC's ARDS (Advanced Remote <b>Display</b> <b>Station),</b> the Computek 400 Series Display terminals (a commercial derivative), which both used a Tektronix type 611 storage display unit, and Tektronix's 4014 terminal, the latter becoming {{a de facto}} computer terminal standard some time after its introduction (later being emulated by other systems due to this status).|$|E
50|$|The System/34 sign on {{looked like}} this: * SIGN ON W1 * USER ID......... ________ * PASSWORD........ ____ * MENU (OPTIONAL). ______ * LIBRARY......... ________ The PROF ("Profile") {{procedure}} {{was used to}} work with User IDs and passwords. The user profile contains a 1-to-8 character alphanumeric User ID, a 4 character alphanumeric password, a code for the user's security rating—M (Master Security Officer), S (Security Officer), O (System Operator), C (Subconsole Operator), or D (<b>Display</b> <b>Station</b> Operator) -- {{and a number of}} other default settings.|$|E
5000|$|... 5251 <b>Display</b> <b>Station.</b> The {{monochrome}} text-only display can {{be either}} 960 characters, formatted as 12 lines of 80 characters, or 1920 characters as 24 lines of 80 characters. Upper and lower case is standard. Text attributes consist of blink, high intensity, reverse video, non-display, underscore, and a unique column separator that causes the field to be preceded and followed by a vertical bar. 5251 and 5252 input format control attributes are optimized for data entry applications and offer significant enhancements over previous 3270 terminals.|$|E
5|$|SMRT first {{attempted}} {{to install a}} passenger information system SMRTime on trains using LCD displays in 1999; these have since been removed. In November 2006 the doors of three cars (carriage number 3006, 1006 and 2006) were installed with a dynamic, in-train system <b>displaying</b> <b>station</b> information for testing; these are similar to ones used by Hong Kong's MTR. An initial prototype of STARIS based upon the existing Automatic Transit Info System was developed in-house; this was removed {{before the end of}} the year without entering service.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, a {{pilot scheme}} was {{launched}} in 2003 to bring several National Rail local services, mainly in South London operated by Connex South Eastern, Southern and South West Trains under the ON – Overground Network brand. TfL introduced consistent information <b>displays,</b> <b>station</b> signage and maps on the selected routes in South London. Although this pilot was primarily an exercise in branding, some service improvements were introduced, {{and it was the}} first instance of the newly created TfL having a visible influence over National Rail services. The pilot scheme was later dropped.|$|R
