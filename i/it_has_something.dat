25|$|His basic {{approach}} was to combine several fundamental constants {{in order to}} produce a dimensionless number. In many cases these would result in numbers close to 1040, its square, or its square root. He was convinced that the mass of the proton and the charge of the electron were a natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe and that their values were not accidental. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, Paul Dirac, also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the Dirac large numbers hypothesis, and some scientists even today believe <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to it.|$|E
25|$|By April 1954, {{the track}} {{had grown to}} 2.23 miles in length and {{within a year of}} the opening meeting had grown again, to 2.761 miles. On Easter 1975, another circuit layout, {{measuring}} 1.654 miles, came into use. Oulton Park is unique amongst the new post-World War II circuits in that it is a true road circuit whilst its contemporaries were, with one exception, converted airfields (the exception being the short-lived Blandford). <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> in common with Mallory Park in that it can trace its history back a very long way (possibly as far as Roman times) and is mentioned in the Doomsday Book as ‘Aleton’.|$|E
500|$|The Margaritaville blender itself {{served as}} a metaphor for {{consumerism}} and the tendency of Americans to buy luxuries that they do not need. Stone said, [...] "We didn't want to make an episode where it was like, 'Oh, those Wall Street guys took our money.' It {{was one of those things}} where we all screwed up and nobody really knows what's going on, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to do with buying shit like Margaritavilles." [...] The Margaritaville also serves {{as a metaphor for}} the housing bubble. Parker himself actually owns a Margaritaville, of which he said, [...] "It's pretty stupid because it really is just a blender".|$|E
60|$|No, no, {{it was not}} lack {{of enthusiasm}} that killed the Whirlwind Campaign in Mariposa. <b>It</b> must <b>have</b> been <b>something</b> else. I don't just {{know what it was}} but I think <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to do with the financial, the {{book-keeping}} side of the thing.|$|R

500|$|Emma Thomas has co-produced all of {{his films}} (including Memento, in which she is {{credited}} as an associate producer). He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: [...] "I've always suspected that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> {{to do with the}} fact that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow able to look at my ideas and flip them around in a way that's just a little bit more twisted and interesting. It's great to be able to work with him like that". When working on separate projects the brothers always consult each other.|$|E
500|$|Degrassi: The Next Generation {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} about its first season. Based on the pilot episode, Stephanie McGrath of Canoe.ca's AllPop acknowledged Miriam McDonald's portrayal of Emma Nelson as [...] "stellar acting abilities in a super creepy storyline ... high on tension, low on cheese [...] top-notch". She criticized the reunion sub-plot, though, {{saying it was}} marred by [...] "wooden, stilted and over-rehearsed acting; the young actors actually showed up their classic Degrassi counter-parts in the pilot episode. Their acting was solid, believable and age-appropriate [...] demonstrates that the creative forces behind The Next Generation haven't lost touch with teens yet ... One installment of Degrassi: The Next Generation is worth 20 episodes of Dawson's Creek". Towards {{the end of the}} season, the Canadian issue of TV Guide summed up the run as [...] "Not just Canadian TV - It's great Canadian TV! Degrassi offers a gritty look into the lives of real teens complete with acne and bad dye jobs. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> for everyone because we've all been there." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the play}} was {{performed}} earlier in Philadelphia, the February 10, 1949 Broadway opening is considered the debut and [...] on February 11, Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times said the following: [...] "Mr. Cobb's tragic portrait of the defeated salesman is acting of the first rank. Although it is familiar and folksy in the details, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> of the grand manner in the big size and the deep tone." [...] While reviewing a touring production of Death of a Salesman, Los Angeles Times critic Laurie Winer described Loman as [...] "...the saddest, self-centeredest soul in American drama, a character who will continue to haunt the landscape {{as long as there}} are fathers and sons." [...] United Press International critic Rick Du Brow described Loman as [...] "...the aging failure of a salesman who has wasted his life by living in a world of delusions and shallow values..." [...] Willie is described as a [...] "suffering[...] [...]middle-aged man at the end of his emotional rope". Lowry described the production as depicting [...] "the end of a man when his dream world is shattered".|$|E

2500|$|Those {{who claim}} it has {{symbolic}} meaning cannot explain {{what it would}} have meant. Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum notes that [...] "the engraving is at the point in the cave where the cave's orientation changes by 90 degrees" [...] and speculates whether the scratches were related to the location: [...] "It's almost like Clapham Junction, like it's showing an intersection. I'm speculating, but it does make you wonder whether <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to do with mapping, or saying: 'This is where you are'." [...] Francesco d'Errico, the director of research at CRNS, comments: [...] "It's in a fixed location so, for example, it could be something to indicate to other Neanderthals visiting the cave that somebody was already using it, or that there was a group that owned that cave." [...] Harrold Dibble comments that [...] "It takes more than a few scratches—deliberate or not—to identify symbolic behaviour on the part of Neanderthals." ...|$|E

5000|$|Unsure of his abilities, {{and often}} incompetent, Jack can't {{figure out why}} he keeps getting promoted. Could <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> {{to do with his}} father (George Coe) being an {{influential}} (but corrupt) Senator? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I can {{see that}} <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>{{something}}</b> to do with football, so we'll leave it at that. I suppose it's something like our quarter-back. And what's an international?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, not exactly. But Mrs Hearn {{said she}} could {{understand}} there had been words {{between her and the}} squire. It couldn't be anything else, you know. Probably <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to do with that man, Crosbie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Archer can {{certainly}} {{have nothing but}} sympathy for a family to which you belong," [...] Mr. Osmond answered, with a laugh which, though <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> of a mocking ring, had also a finer patience.|$|R
6000|$|... "All men can try {{to carry}} out orders, Roger, {{but it is not}} all who can do it with intelligence. Doubtless, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to do with the book {{learning}} that you have, and in which you were his instructor." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A death's-head!" [...] echoed Legrand--"Oh--yes--well, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> of that {{appearance}} upon paper, no doubt.

50|$|The name’s {{meaning is}} unclear. Could <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> {{to do with}} an early settler named “Wind”, or does the community’s Wendish past yield the name? The leaping {{greyhound}} (a Wendish symbol) in the coat of arms might offer a clue.|$|R

6000|$|... (1 P. 126.) The {{growing up}} of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal, [...] had, at first, some little {{influence}} upon me, and began to affect me [...] with seriousness, as long as I thought <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> miraculous in [...] it, &c.|$|R
