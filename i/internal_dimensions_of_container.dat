50|$|ISO 668 - Series 1 freight {{containers}} — Classification, {{dimensions and}} ratings is an ISO international standard which classifies intermodal freight shipping containers and standardises {{their size and}} weight specifications. Introduced in 1968, ISO 668 regulates both external and <b>internal</b> <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers,</b> {{as well as the}} minimum door opening size, where applicable. It also specifies the associated gross weight ratings, and requirements for load transfer areas in the base structures <b>of</b> <b>containers,</b> since amendment 1 of 2005.|$|R
5000|$|A {{false bottom}} is an {{internal}} partition in a container, typically {{at the bottom}} of a drawer, suitcase or similar item, enabling the concealment of objects from a cursory examination of the item's contents.
