40|$|A spectroscopic {{ellipsometer}} was {{integrated in}} a vertical furnace for {{measurement and control}} during chemical vapor deposition and thermal oxidation processes. The major goal of this activity was to adapt the ellipsometer arrangement to the furnace geometry with a minimum impact on the <b>furnace</b> process <b>performance.</b> Modifications in the furnace geometry were restricted as far as possible, {{to show that a}} fast integration in existing industrial equipment with minor costs can be done. This aim led to a novel beam-guiding system. This setup has been used for the in situ characterization of polysilicon formation, inside the vertical furnace during high temperature processes. The polysilicon-on-oxide structures were modeled using the Bruggeman effective-medium approximation (B-EMA). The crystallization process of amorphous silicon layers during annealing at 600 °C has been monitored. Layer thickness and the degree of crystallinity can be obtained simultaneously.

40|$|TEMCO {{has been}} {{producing}} manganese ferroalloys in submerged arc electric furnaces for over 40 years. The furnace linings all along {{have been of}} conventional insulation type until 2001 when a freeze lining of UCAR concept was installed for a 20 MW Furnace. Continuous improvement of <b>furnace</b> lining <b>performance</b> has been a key component in improving the business competitiveness of TEMCO. The expected minimum campaign life of the freeze lining is fifteen years {{as compared to the}} ten years of the conventional linings. The success of the freeze lining is very critical to the quanta and direction of heat flow through the lining that control the freeze protection. Under freeze protection can lead to reduced lining life and over freeze protection, on the other hand, can lead to operating difficulties and loss of smelting efficiency. It was, therefore, necessary to develop a computer based system to monitor and control the freeze protection.

40|$|A typical {{flour milling}} {{process is a}} very linear {{operation}} that is almost entirely void of recycled streams where separate fractions from each operation go ahead as new streams to the next operation. In some cases, there are opportunities for combining some streams, for recycling particles that have been insufficiently broken {{to go back to}} the same roller mill. This study introduces this recycle concept in flour milling process at second break system. The recycle grinding assessment was made using a Satake STR- 100 test roller mill. The recycle process was started after the second break system and the number of recycle grinding was up to 7 regrinds. The particle size distribution and ash analysis were produced to describe the behaviour of the recycle grinding performance.

40|$|Halogen lamp {{annealing}} (Heatpulse 210 T) {{has been}} successfully applied to combine the following tasks in a single step: the reflow of LPCVD PSG layers, the recrystallization of doped poly-Si interconnections, the formation of shallow n~-junctions using the same poly-Si as diffusion source. Recrystalllzed in situ P-doped poly-Si layers had a resistivity of 0. 6 - 0. 8 mt~-cm, as low as the best reported values obtained on after-doped samples. An FTIR analysis of the PSG layers revealed structural changes leading to continuous modification of their optical properties during the annealing step it-self, which, consequently, determines their annealing efficiency. Obtained results can contradict expectations {{on the basis of}} well-established <b>furnace</b> annealing <b>performance</b> of the structures. In particular, the P-concentration dependence of the PSG reflow can be dominated by the above effects, and recrystallization f poly-Si can also depend on the PSG coating on the top. Hence, {{there is a need for}} empirical determination of lamp annealing properties on each signifi-cantly different layer structure. As the last high temperature step in device processing, the reflow is expected to influence or determine the final phosphosilicate glass (PSG) step profile across sharp interconnection or oxide edges, the impurity pro...|$|R

The effects of burner geometry, equivalence ratio, and preheat temperature and fuel firing rate on fuel burn-up have been investigated. The one-dimensional models for straight-through and single-ended recuperative radiant tubes have been validated using available experimental data. Thermal system {{models have been}} developed for the continuous and batch indirectly fired (radiant tube) furnaces to identify opportunities for fuel savings and enhanced productivity. Extensive parametric investigations were performed {{to examine the effects of}} load and refractory emissivities, load throughput rate and thickness on the thermal <b>performance</b> of the <b>furnaces.</b> Batch and continuous direct-fired furnace thermal system models were developed to analyze the effect of various design and operation parameters on the <b>furnace</b> thermal <b>performance.</b> An attempt was made to validate the batch furnace model by using experimental data from a small experimental furnace. Due to the size of the furnace, the two-dimensional heat conduction effects near the corners and edges of the furnace walls were significant. Since these effects were neglected in the system model, which is intended to simulate a large industrial furnace, the validation was unsuccessful.

40|$|The {{muffle furnace}} main {{purpose is to}} anneal the rough sponge iron powder transported through it, which is done by burning natural gas. Heat is absorbed by the muffle and is {{transferred}} to the bed of sponge iron powder. In {{order to reduce the}} consumptions of fossil fuel, some companies of the industry aims to exchange the natural gas in their muffle furnace’s burners to syngas, produced from biomass. This will however affect the <b>performance</b> of the <b>furnace</b> in the heating aspect. For this work, it is assumed that the effect will be negative. Thus the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate how to compensate the loss of effect from the burners, by examining which other parameters have influence on the <b>furnace</b> heating <b>performance</b> of the sponge iron powder transported through the furnace. The investigation is executed by simulating a 1 meter of the furnace in COMSOL multiphysics for 10 min, not including the combustion chambers. The investigated parameters are the packing degree of the powder, surface emissivity of the muffle, process gas velocity, conveyor belt velocity and the heat transfer rate coefficient to muffle from the combustion chambers. Alas, the process gas velocity and conveyor belt velocity only have minor influence on the final result, according to this simulation. However, the simulation exhibited that the surface emissivity of the muffle and the packing degree of the powder has great impact on the heating of the powder and could compensate some of the lost effect from the burners. This could be obtained by using an unpolished and oxidized muffle surface, and use densely packed powder sample...|$|R
