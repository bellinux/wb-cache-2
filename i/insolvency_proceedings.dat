2500|$|The {{definition}} of restructuring is quite technical but is essentially intended {{to respond to}} circumstances where a reference entity, {{as a result of}} the deterioration of its credit, negotiates changes in the terms in its debt with its creditors as an alternative to formal <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> (i.e. the debt is restructured). [...] During the 2012 Greek sovereign debt crisis, one important issue was whether the restructuring would trigger Credit default swap (CDS) payments. [...] European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund negotiators avoided these triggers as they could have jeopardized the stability of major European banks who had been protection writers. [...] An alternative could have been to create new CDS which clearly would pay in the event of debt restructuring. The market would have paid the spread between these and old (potentially more ambiguous) CDS. This practice is far more typical in jurisdictions that do not provide protective status to insolvent debtors similar to that provided by Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. [...] In particular, concerns arising out of Conseco's restructuring in 2000 led to the credit event's removal from North American high yield trades.|$|E

The fact that two different organs, one professional and one juridical have been conducting pre-bankruptcy settlement proceedings in different stages gives rise to different questions in relation to the right to a fair trial and access to courts as guaranteed by the European Convention for Protection of Human Rights and its related case law. In particular, we shall discuss whether PBS committees constituted “tribunals” in the Conventional context and whether European Convention allows the prior intervention of professional bodies in disputes over civil rights and obligations.

Firstly, the theoretical part of the thesis provides explanations for technical jargon in relation to <b>insolvency</b> and subsequent <b>proceedings</b> in relation to entities that went bankrupt.

Finally, the last theoretical chapter addresses the advantages and limitations of the particular financial ratios and analysis that is used in the subsequent practical part of the thesis. The goal of the practical part of the thesis was to determine the ability of the analysed financial ratios to provide reliable information to shareholders and third parties to assess company health, and also scrutinise potential limitations.

Nuosekliai atliekama analizė, straipsnio pabaigoje pateikiamos pagrindinės išvados bei rekomendacija. Straipsnyje identifikuojama, kad Europos Sąjungos teisė nereglamentuoja įmonės nemokumo sampratos, tačiau nustato būtinumą visoms Europos Sąjungos (toliau - ES) šalims laikytis universalumo principo. Taip pat yra atskleidžiami bankroto bylos pagal Europos Sąjungos ir Lietuvos Respublikos teisę iškėlimo tikslai, kad bankroto byla negali būti keliama įmonėms, kurios patiria laikinus finansinius sunkumus, o prioritetas turi būti teikiamas įmonės išsaugojimui. Išanalizuojama ir įvertinama įmonės nemokumo samprata ir jos įvertinimo kriterijai Lietuvos Respublikos įmonių bankroto įstatyme ir teismų praktikoje. Šiame straipsnyje remiantis Lietuvos Respublikos įmonių bankroto įstatymu ir atlikta Lietuvos teismų praktikos analize, apibrėžiamas nemokumo kriterijus, kaip savarankiškas bankroto bylos iškėlimo pagrindas ir atsiribojama nuo kitų šiame įstatyme reglamentuojamų trijų kriterijų gilesnės analizės. Taip pat yra apibrėžiama laikinų finansinių sunkumų turinčios įmonės samprata. Atskleidžiama įmonės nemokumo samprata ir taikomi įvertinimo metodai ekonomikos moksle.

Company {{insolvency}} and {{bankruptcy legislation}} {{is based on}} the discipline of economics, under such circumstances the law itself and any act, norms, provisions falling under the law are subject to micro economic problems arising in companies. Under such circumstances law has to serve economy while making reasonable decisions regarding company financial status (solvency). Unfortunately, only recently Lithuanian legal doctrine has given it a thought of using economic analysis of law. In general bankruptcies of companies cause consequences such as – loss of productivity capacity which eventually causes overall loss of national competitiveness, unpaid national taxes to many different government bodies and other institutions, unsatisfied claims of other creditors, also social problems such as growing unemployment, decline in living conditions, unsatisfied and insecure residents about country’s economy, government and their own future. According to Lithuanian Republic Department of Enterprise Bankruptcy Management under the Ministry of Economy conducted study on bankruptcies for the period between January 1 st, 1993 and March 31 st, 2014 total number of declared bankruptcies for companies is 14 912. Significant 70 % of companies that went bankrupt were in business for more than 5 years. All of collected experience in technologies, optimized processes, workplaces etc. is most likely lost with bankruptcies of such developed companies. In the article the economic analysis of law, comparative analysis, systematic analysis, logical analysis, document analysis, analytical-critical analysis, linguistic analysis methods were used to support the answer to legal question of whether insolvency evaluation criteria in Lithuanian Republic Enterprise Bankruptcy Law ensure that bankruptcy procedures would not be initiated for companies with temporary financial issues. Part one of the article states that European Union Law does not regulate company insolvency concept, but does obligate all Union countries to follow principle of universality. Proper evaluation of company’s absolute insolvency and bankruptcy initiation decision are extremely important steps in decision-making process so that bankruptcies would not be initiated to companies, which only have short-term financial difficulties. Although in 2004 Lithuania joined European Union, which does have directly applicable European Council regulation of 2000, May 29 th (EB) Nr. 1346 / 2000 regarding enterprise bankruptcy policy, since then not in any other Act or regulation of the Union have been clearly stated or added regarding regulation (evaluation) of company <b>insolvency,</b> bankruptcy evaluation <b>proceedings,</b> which leaves an open area for each Union country to freely compose their own proceedings within boundaries of principle of universality. Part two of the article is intended to identify the issues of Case law in Lithuanian court system in the area of initiated enterprise bankruptcy proceedings, whereas at bankruptcy initiation proceedings interests of creditors are prioritized and balance of interests of all other involved parties is mostly excluded from bankruptcy initiation evaluation conditions. Even though courts are trying to amend, guide faulty legislation through Case law, but from legislative perspective such actions are not fully legitimate. In part three company insolvency concept in Lithuanian Enterprise bankruptcy law and in Case law is analyzed, compared and evaluated with assistance of economic disciplinary theoretical and practical methods. In Lithuanian Enterprise bankruptcy law there is only a single ratio according to which courts make their verdict regarding <b>proceedings</b> of companies’ <b>insolvency</b> – overdue liabilities to assets ratio. Despite that there is no clear detailed proceeding of solvency evaluation in Lithuanian law whatsoever, in Case law it is stated that case by case basis additional requirements, regulations, proceedings or rules shall be evaluated regardless of current sole indicating company insolvency datum, which is ratio of overdue liabilities to assets. Under such circumstances courts have to look back at Case law which is formulated by subjective opinions of judges from past cases, and that leads to irregular and with discrepancies from economic theories and practices evaluation of companies’ insolvency. As specialists of economic field state that a single ratio of one aspect does not reflect company’s true solvency status, analysis of company insolvency is a complex process of using different financial ratios from company’s financial data. In order to determine company’s financial status economists mostly suggest to use at least ten financial ratio indicators. In order to correct such unsound and unbalanced evaluation of companies’ insolvency, clear regulations have to be stated in Lithuanian Enterprise bankruptcy law for it to have financially and legally correct and just companies’ insolvency evaluation. In the end of the article after all the analysis, in the last part reasoned recommendation is stated to initiate amendment of Lithuanian Enterprise bankruptcy law...|$|R
