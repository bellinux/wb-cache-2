On 24 November 1941, two German pilots, held at POW Camp No 15 at Shap in a former hotel and now again the Shap Wells Hotel, escaped with flying jackets over their Luftwaffe uniforms and carrying <b>forged</b> <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> that purported them to be Dutch airmen attached to the RAF.|$|R
50|$|Utopia was a {{darknet market}} similar to The Silk Road that {{facilitated}} sale of illegal {{items such as}} narcotics, firearms, stolen bank account information and <b>forged</b> <b>identity</b> <b>documents.</b> Utopia was based on Black Market Reloaded. It was launched on 3 February 2014 only {{to be shut down}} by Dutch police 8 days later. Undercover agents were able to buy large amounts of ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine. 900 Bitcoin (then worth approximately £270,000) were seized.|$|R

50|$|Adolfo Kaminsky (or Adolphe; born 1 October 1925) is {{a former}} member of the French Resistance, specializing in the forgery of <b>identity</b> <b>documents.</b> During World War II, he forged papers that saved the lives of more than 14,000 Jews. He later went on to assist Jewish {{immigration}} to the British Mandate for Palestine and then to <b>forge</b> <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> for the National Liberation Front and French draft dodgers during the Algerian War (1954-62). He forged papers for thirty years for different activist groups, mainly national liberation fronts, without ever claiming payment for it.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the war he}} {{got hold}} of a {{printing}} press which he installed in the cellar of a house vacated by {{a friend who had}} sought refuge from the bombing by moving to the Thuringian countryside after her husband was killed in the war. [...] Under the wartime conditions of the time, people who did not officially exist had no access to food rations. By producing high quality <b>forged</b> <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> and food coupons Oskar Huth enabled many people who, officially, did not exist (often because they were Jewish), to eat.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1941 Rachel became {{engaged to}} the {{architect}} Marcel (Moshe) Hertz. In July 1942, Marcel's family was called up for forced {{work in the}} East. They, including Rachel and her mother, were invited by Martha Nagtegaal a former employee of the Hertz family, to be hidden by {{different parts of the}} Nagtegaal family. In March 1943 Martha obtained <b>forged</b> <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> and ration stamps for them. From that time, 1943-1945, Rachel was involved in the Dutch Resistance, and so was her fiancé, Marcel, who went by the fictitious name of Rienus van Elck.|$|R

50|$|On June 30, 1963, in the Ciaculli {{quarter of}} Palermo, {{a police officer}} notices a parked Alfa Giulietta. Unaware that the car is packed with explosives, an officer opens the boot which {{triggers}} the bomb inside which kills seven people. This leads to many arrests, with many other mafiosi, including the Corleonesi, going into hiding. Maino refuses to do so, preferring to stay in Palermo with his girlfriend. While fleeing from Corleone, Totò and Calogero are stopped by a police patrol. Calogero manages to escape but Totò is arrested; he attempts to provide <b>forged</b> <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> but these fail when he is recognized by Biagio.|$|R
5000|$|Help in {{the forms}} of money, food, and {{medicines}} was organised by Żegota for the Jews in several forced labour camps in Poland as well. [...] Financial aid as well as <b>forged</b> <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> was procured for those hiding on the [...] "Aryan side". The escape of Jews from ghettos, camps, and deportation trains occurred mostly spontaneously through personal contacts, {{and most of the}} help that was extended to Jews in the country was similarly personal in nature. Because Jews in hiding preferred to remain well-concealed, Żegota had trouble finding them. Its activities therefore did not develop on a larger scale until late in 1943.|$|R

A 25-year-old man at the party who had <b>forged</b> <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did not think that he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|R
50|$|Level 3 Security (L3S) FORENSIC Data—Level 3 Security {{offers the}} {{security}} and integrity of information from the surface level by sight down to the infinitely complex and specialized L3S FORENSIC level. Essentially, L3S will provide as many security levels as needed for any situation by catering to visual inspection of documents as well as L3S FORENSIC checks on identity and security information not readily attainable or viewable unless accessed by FORENSIC tools with the correct levels of authorised access. The ability to apply multiple sub-levels of security is {{made possible by the}} concept of centralised (as opposed to localised) and dynamic identity data management by which centralised and forensic security controls can be applied on top of the localised and limited security applications onto an <b>identity</b> <b>document.</b> Tampered and <b>forged</b> <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> are exposed when centrally retrieved original data of the True Identity reveals discrepancies on the document as well as any latest real-time updated information such as current statuses of a person's identity profile.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were many}} methods {{employed}} by Vietnamese citizens {{to leave the}} country. Most were secret and done at night; some involved the bribing of top government officials. [...] Some people bought places in large boats that held up to several hundred passengers. Others boarded fishing boats (fishing being a common occupation in Vietnam) and left that way. One method used involved middle-class refugees from Saigon, armed with <b>forged</b> <b>identity</b> <b>documents,</b> traveling approximately 1,100 km to Danang by road. On arrival, they would take refuge {{for up to two}} days in safe houses while waiting for fishing junks and trawlers to take small groups into international waters. Planning for such a trip took many months and even years. Although these attempts often caused a depletion of resources, people usually had several false starts before they managed to escape.|$|R
25|$|Heinz Heydrich was an Obersturmführer (lieutenant), {{journalist}} {{and publisher of}} the soldiers' newspaper, Die Panzerfaust. He was at first a fervent admirer of Hitler. But before Reinhard Heydrich’s State funeral in Berlin in June 1942, Heinz Heydrich had been given a large packet containing his brother’s files, released from his strongbox at Gestapo Headquarters, 8 Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse, Berlin. Heinz had shut himself away in his room with the papers. Next morning his wife noticed that her husband had sat up all night burning the documents from the package. Heinz, on leave from the front, could not be engaged in conversation, his wife remembered; he seemed to be elsewhere mentally, and like stone. The files in the package were probably Reinhard Heydrich’s personal files, from which Heinz Heydrich understood {{for the first time in}} all its enormity the systematic extermination of the Jews, the so-called Final Solution. Thereafter, Heinz Heydrich helped many Jews escape by <b>forging</b> <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> and printing them on Die Panzerfaust presses.|$|R
5000|$|Convicted Croatian war {{criminal}} and Holocaust perpetrator Andrija Artukovic apparently lived in Rathgar for {{some period of}} time following the Second World War, after fleeing justice via a ratline, and was possibly aided by anti-British sentiment in Ireland. He entered Ireland with a false Swiss passport under the assumed name [...] "Alois Anich". He left for the United States with a <b>forged</b> Irish <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> and lived in California, but was eventually deported to Yugoslavia after decades of legal wrangling.|$|R

He {{was responsible for}} <b>forging</b> hundreds of <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> to help other Jews survive during this time. He worked closely {{with members of the}} Confessing Church, including Franz Kaufmann and Helene Jacobs. He ultimately escaped from Berlin to Switzerland by bicycle in 1943, where he remained until his death.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} false <b>identity</b> and travel <b>documents</b> in organized crime represent a serious and evolving threat. However, a case-by-case perspective, thus suffering from linkage blindness and a limited analysis capacity, essentially drives the present-day fight against this criminal problem. To assist in overcoming these limitations, a process model was developed using a forensic perspective. It guides the systematic analysis and management of seized false documents to generate forensic intelligence that supports strategic and tactical decision-making in an intelligence-led policing approach. The model is articulated on a three-level architecture that aims to assist in detecting and following-up on general trends, production methods and links between cases or series. Using analyses of a large dataset of counterfeit and <b>forged</b> <b>identity</b> and travel <b>documents,</b> {{it is possible to}} illustrate the model, its three levels and their contribution. Examples will point out how the proposed approach assists in detecting emerging trends, in evaluating the black market's degree of structure, in uncovering criminal networks, in monitoring the quality of false documents, and in identifying their weaknesses to orient the conception of more secured travel and <b>identity</b> <b>documents.</b> The process model proposed is thought to have a general application in forensic science and can readily be transposed to other fields of study...|$|R

50|$|Historically in Sweden, it was {{the banks}} and the Swedish postal service that first saw a need that people should have <b>{{identity}}</b> <b>documents.</b> They issued <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> for anyone. To prove the identity for this, relative simple routines were used, like having bank account documents, driver’s licence or passport, being recognised by the bank staff or bringing a friend with an <b>identity</b> <b>document.</b> These routines were used for decades from the 1960s until the 21st century although the security routines were strengthened during the time. Swedish passports were banned as an <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> during several years because they were relatively easy to forge, and allowed again after they were made more secure in 1998. The driver's licences had enough security {{to be accepted by}} the banks and became the most commonly used <b>identity</b> <b>document.</b>|$|R

40|$|Under the {{influence}} of intelligence-led policing models, crime analysis methods have known of important developments in recent years. Applications have been proposed in several fields of forensic science to exploit and manage various types of material evidence in a systematic and more efficient way. However, nothing has been suggested {{so far in the}} field of false <b>identity</b> <b>documents.</b> This study seeks to fill this gap by proposing a simple and general method for profiling false <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> which aims to establish links based on their visual forensic characteristics. A sample of more than 200 false <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> including French stolen blank passports, counterfeited driving licenses from Iraq and falsified Bulgarian driving licenses was gathered from nine Swiss police departments and integrated into an ad hoc developed database called ProfID. Links detected automatically and systematically through this database were exploited and analyzed to produce strategic and tactical intelligence useful to the fight against <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> fraud. The profiling and intelligence process established for these three types of false <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> has confirmed its efficiency, more than 30 % of <b>documents</b> being linked. <b>Identity</b> <b>document</b> fraud appears as a structured and interregional criminality, against which material and forensic links detected between false <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> might serve as a tool for investigation...|$|R
