5|$|The rest of {{the year}} (late summer and fall), {{walruses}} tend to form massive aggregations {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The migration between the ice and the beach can be long-distance and dramatic. <b>In</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> and summer, for example, several hundred thousand Pacific walruses migrate from the Bering Sea into the Chukchi Sea through the relatively narrow Bering Strait.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndicated}} Millionaire also conducts open casting {{calls in}} various locations across the United States {{to search for}} potential contestants. These are held <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> or early summer, with all dates and locations posted on the show's official website. The producers make no guarantee on how many applicants will be tested at each particular venue; however, the show will not test any more than 2,500 individuals per audition day.|$|E
5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring,</b> and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop directly onto the female to mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two are distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E
5|$|Bulbs are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E
5|$|Leo {{tried to}} gain {{the support of the}} Holy See against Bohemond, {{promising}} to unite the Armenian Church with Rome. Pope Innocent III sent Cardinal Soffred Gaetani to Antioch <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> 1203. Bohemond declined to meet the papal legate, stating that the patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem had excommunicated him for his debate with the Hospitallers. Gaetani mediated a reconciliation between Bohemond and the Hospitallers, but Bohemond insisted that the papal legate could not be mentioned in the agreement, because the Holy See could not make a judgement about feudal rights in the principality.|$|E

5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and {{winter in the}} open ocean of the cold {{northern}} seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas {{at the start of}} the breeding season <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring.</b> It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and makes its way at night to the sea. It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.|$|E
5|$|The novel's delayed {{publication}} was {{a result}} of Balzac's active social life. He spent many nights dining at the homes of friends, including novelist Eugène Sue and his mistress Olympe Pélissier, as well as the feminist writer George Sand and her lover Jules Sandeau. Balzac and Pélissier had a brief affair, and she became the first lover with whom he appeared in public. Eventually he removed himself from Paris by staying with friends in the suburbs, where he committed himself to finishing the work. <b>In</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> he allowed Sand to read a nearly-finished manuscript; she enjoyed it and predicted it would do well.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers bloom {{from early}} May to late September {{but most are}} gone by late August. Moisture from snow-melt along with some {{rainfall}} <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> kick-starts the germination of annual plants, including wildflowers. Most of these plants complete their entire life cycle in the few months each year that moisture levels are good. The onset of summer decreases the number of wildflowers and by autumn only the tiny yellow flowers of sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain. Some wildflowers that grow {{in the area are}} the arrow-leaved balsamroot, bitterroot, blazingstar, desert parsley, dwarf monkeyflower, paintbrush, scorpionweed, scabland penstemon and the wild onion.|$|E

5|$|After his {{tours of}} duty in New York and France, Juskalian volunteered to fight in Vietnam <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> of 1963. He arrived in Saigon in August 1963 and took up a posting as deputy senior advisor to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam's IV Corps {{stationed}} in the Mekong Delta. After six months, Jukalian {{was assigned to the}} headquarters of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) to serve as the MACV inspector general under General William Westmoreland, the MACV commander. As part of his duties, he traveled throughout South Vietnam on inspection visits to many military installations. In the transient officers quarters at Danang, he found an ashtray from George Mardikian's Omar Khayyam restaurant in San Francisco and kept it as a souvenir {{for the rest of his}} life. For his service in the Vietnam War, Juskalian was awarded an Air Medal and a Bronze Star.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a chance {{encounter}} <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> 1968, according to some accounts, drummer Dennis Wilson was driving through Malibu when he picked up two hitchhiking women of the Manson Family, Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey, and brought them to his house in Pacific Palisades for a few hours. Returning home in the morning of the following day from a night time recording session with The Beach Boys, Wilson was unexpectedly greeted in the driveway of the residence by the Family's leader, Charles Manson. At first, Wilson was frightened by Manson, but Manson assured him he came with no intent to harm Wilson and began kissing his shoes. The two struck a friendship and, over the next few months, members of the Manson Familymostly women who were treated as servantswere housed at Wilson's Sunset Boulevard household, reportedly costing him approximately $100,000 (U.S.).|$|E
5|$|Bambi is a {{roe deer}} fawn {{born in a}} thicket to a young doe <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> one year. Over {{the course of the}} summer, his mother teaches him about the various {{inhabitants}} of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.|$|E

5|$|Blacknose sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and in turn}} fall prey to larger sharks. Like other members of their family, they exhibit a viviparous mode of reproduction in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection. The females give birth to three to six young <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> or early summer, either annually or biennually, after a gestation period of eight to 11 months. This species is not known to attack humans, though {{it has been documented}} performing a threat display towards divers. It is of moderate commercial and recreational importance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened. In 2009, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the populations of the blacknose shark off the United States are being overfished, and proposed new conservation measures.|$|E
5|$|Faced with Shapur's third campaign, the Roman emperor Valerian marched {{against the}} Persian monarch but was {{defeated}} near Edessa <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> 260 and {{taken as a}} prisoner. The Persian emperor then ravaged Cappadocia, Cilicia and claimed to have captured Antioch, the metropolis of Syria. Taking advantage of the situation, Fulvius Macrianus, {{the commander of the}} imperial treasury, declared his sons Quietus and Macrianus Minor as joint emperors in August 260 opposing Valerian's son Gallienus. Fulvius Macrianus took Antioch as his center and organized the resistance against Shapur; he dispatched Balista, his praetorian prefect, to Anatolia. Shapur was defeated in the region of Sebaste at Pompeiopolis prompting the Persians to evacuate Cilicia while Balista went back to Antioch. Balista's victory was only partial, as Shapur withdrew east of Cilicia where the marauding Persian units continued to occupy the area, while a Persian force took advantage of Balista's return to Syria and headed further west in Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|In the Near East, Philip's brother Priscus' tax {{collection}} methods provoked the revolt of Jotapianus. At the same time, Silbannacus started a rebellion in the Rhenish provinces. He faced a third rebellion in 248 when the legions {{he had used}} in successful campaigns against the Carpi on the Danubian frontier revolted and proclaimed an officer named Pacatianus emperor. All three rebellions were suppressed quickly. In 249, to restore order after the defeat of Pacatianus, Philip gave Senator Decius, {{a native of the}} region, command of the Danubian armies. <b>In</b> <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> 249, the armies proclaimed Decius emperor. The civil war that followed ended in a battle outside Verona. Decius emerged victorious, and Philip either died or was assassinated. When news of Philip's death reached Rome, the Praetorian Guard murdered his son and successor Marcus Julius Severus Philippus.|$|E
