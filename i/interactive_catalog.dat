40|$|For my thesis, I have {{developed}} a sales promotional package utilizing print and interactive media. Because technology is rapidly changing, I utilized multimedia and print media, by merging them into one project. For this interactive/print project, I created a marketing sales package that markets handcrafted jewelry to wholesale buyers. The two media interact as a buying source that is easily and inexpensively sent to the buyers. This service is very unique, and also provides buyers with alternatives to buying and viewing at the annual shows. The user can purchase wholesale handcrafted jewelry from their office or home without having to travel. In addition, BEYOND TRADITIONS, {{the name of the}} company, provides the crafters with a broader base market to sell their jewelry collections. The package contains a publication made up of portraits of different artists, along with a brief summary of the artist 2 ̆ 7 s background and jewelry samples. It will be used as a reference tool for the buyer. A computer flop py disk is enclosed, and contains an animation as an introduction, along with sections to display each artist 2 ̆ 7 s jewelry collection, prices for the craft goods and an ordering form that can be printed out and faxed back to BEYOND TRADITIONS. By reviewing the information in the <b>interactive</b> <b>catalog,</b> in combination with the brochure, the wholesale buyer will have a total reference of the finished artist 2 ̆ 7 s work. This service is provided by BEYOND TRADITIONS, who will develop the brochure and <b>interactive</b> <b>catalog</b> on a quarterly basis.

40|$|Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are {{characterized}} by emission of radiation over more than 10 orders of magnitude in frequency. Therefore, the execution of extensive surveys of the sky, with different types of detectors, is providing the attractive possibility to identify and to investigate the properties of AGNs on very large statistical samples. Thanks to the large spectroscopic surveys that allow detailed investigation {{of many of these}} sources, we have the opportunity to place new constraints on the nature and evolution of AGNs and to investigate their relations with the host systems. In this contribution we present the results that can be obtained by using a new <b>interactive</b> <b>catalog</b> that we developed to investigate the range of AGN spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We present simple SED models based on data collected in the catalog and discuss their relations with optical spectra obtained by follow up observations. We compare our findings with the expectations based on the AGN Unification Model, and we discuss the perspectives of multi-wavelength approaches to address AGN related processes such as black hole accretion and acceleration of relativistic jets...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of a vast class of deterministic derived measures, defined as transformations of simple multinomial mutifractals via fractal interpolating funcionts, is reviewed (Puente, 1992, 1994). This fractal-multifractal model (FM) is conceptually simple and the rules for constructing a fractal interpolating function and a parent multifractal measure are easy to describe, and that alternative derived measures may be found by continuously varying the surrogate parameters of the fractal interpolating function and the parent (multinomial) measure. However, unfortunately there is no simple analytical formula that gives either {{the values of the}} measure or its most common statistics, in terms of these parameters. This implies that the inverse problem for a given data set cannot be addressed analytically, but requires a numerical scheme. Given the irregular nature of the data sets to be fitted, a two-step optimization procedure was considered. During the first stage of the research, an <b>interactive</b> <b>catalog</b> of the patterns that may be generated via the fractal-multifractal procedure was built, so that its members could be suitable initial conditions for an optimization algorithm developed in order to find the surrogate (fractal-multifractal) parameters of a given time series automatically. Alternative ``distances' ' (i. e. sum of squared deviations, sum of absolute deviations, Hutchinson metric, Barnsley (1988)) were tried to measure deviations between actual and modeled records. Given the nature of the optimization problem, procedures developed included as searching methods: (i) the multidimensional simplex method (e. g. Press et al., 1989), (ii) simulated annealing (e. g. Otten and van Ginneken, 1989), and (iii) genetic algorithms (Duan et al., 1992). The first method was generally used to find ``rough' ' parameter estimates (starting the procedure using parameter values obtained via the cataloguing exercise), while the others were employed in order to fine-tune the ``best'' surrogate parameters...|$|E
40|$|RIT has no {{complete}} {{visual and}} /or factual catalog {{of the pieces}} of art presently displayed in public areas. Many pieces of work on campus are {{in desperate need of}} repair as well as plaques to identify the work. Visions, the only known bound record of a selection of artwork on the Henrietta campus, was produced by the RIT Communications Office in 1975. The Archives in Wallace Memorial Library have a small collection of slides of various artworks, however, many works of art are currently missing. Several valuable pieces of work were lost in the move from the city campus to Henrietta, and some pieces have yet to be removed from storage in Physical Plant. RIT is not fully aware of what is currently located in public areas. This <b>interactive</b> <b>catalog</b> will create a complete visual and factual catalog of the artwork located in public areas on the RIT Henrietta campus. Being interac tive, this catalog will include full-color images, sound, QuickTime movie clips and text about the piece of work, its location on campus, the artist, as well as any other relevant information that can be gathered on the work. The catalog will be user-friendly so that anyone with little or no computer experience will have no trouble operating the program. Information on the artwork along with a full-color image of the piece will be displayed on each card. This interactive archival catalog will be simple for anyone to use. People with or without computer skills or experience with multimedia applications should discover that this catalog is a faster and more entertaining way to retrieve data. This thesis will investigate past, present and future storage meth ods for information. In addition, this project will research how effective interac tive archival storage is. Upon completion, the Interactive Archival Catalog will be tested by thirty students from the School of Fine and Applied Arts, the College of Photographic Arts and Sciences, and the School for Printing Management and Sciences. The students will be asked to play with the catalog for at least ten minutes and then answer some questions about it. The questions and responses can be found in Chapter 6, page 35. All comments and suggestions were noted and changes that needed to be made were corrected. The purpose of this catalog is to introduce the RIT community to the art work present on campus. Implementing interactive multimedia makes the data search experience an enjoyable and interesting one. If the catalog is successful, people will develop an appreciation of the artwork on this campus as well as an interest in interactive data storage and retrieval systems...|$|E

40|$|The collection, evaluation, and {{organization}} of spatial information is instrumental to the successful development and execution of planning policies and management programs. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide the technology to integrate varying informational needs into a single relational database for ease in data retrieval and analysis. The use of a GIS by the Tillamook Bay National Estuary Project (TBNEP) has developed out of {{a need for more}} efficient utilization of large quantities of spatial information for watershed analysis, ecological modeling, educational and managerial purposes. An inventory of 161 GIS data layers has been completed. A metadata catalog that defines the available entities, attributes, and associated domain values of these geographic coverages was constructed. The catalog allows the user to identify mapped features and associated metadata information available for these features, in addition to the quality, definitions, and other characteristics of the data in an interactive environment. A potential user is able to peruse the metadata information and render an informed judgment about the fitness of the data for the projected use. This <b>interactive</b> metadata <b>catalog</b> is used to advise system users of the content, characteristics, quality and availability of GIS coverages, while providing information {{that can be used to}} assess potential problems or limitations inherent in the GIS database...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} {{a new set of}} {{interaction}} techniques for the digital library as a solution to the focus versus context problem where a small focus (a page of information) competes for limited screen space with a large context (the collection of information). Our solution provides for 3 D focus+context (F+C) interactive visualization in virtual reality (VR). We have designed information-rich 3 D worlds enhanced by lightweight interactions where users can navigate and interact with a specific datum (focus) in relation to the complete data set (context). To demonstrate feasibility and functionality, we have built three high-fidelity prototypes in desktopVR, expandable to portable immersive VR, populated with 3 D data artifacts extrapolated from actual image collections in the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University (Perseus).
