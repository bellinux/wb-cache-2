5|$|By 1943, the {{war effort}} had a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on many rosters. The Red Wings lost nine players and the Maple Leafs lost six to the military. The Rangers lost ten players {{and had to be}} persuaded by the other teams not to suspend operations. In contrast, the Canadiens lost only one key player in Ken Reardon. Young phenom Maurice Richard tried to enlist, but was turned down due to his medical history. Canadiens General Manager Tommy Gorman {{reportedly}} ensured his players obtained jobs in key wartime industries to avoid conscription.|$|E
5|$|The Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and Annie's {{death at}} the age of ten had a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly {{attentive}} to his children. Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from inbreeding due to the close family ties he shared with his wife and cousin, Emma Wedgwood. He examined this topic in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of crossing amongst many organisms. Despite his fears, most of the surviving children and many of their descendants went on to have distinguished careers (see Darwin-Wedgwood family).|$|E
5|$|The {{coalition}} army {{then proceeded}} to Amyclae, from whence they plundered the surrounding countryside. Lucius Quinctius, meanwhile, received the voluntary surrender of several coastal towns in Laconia. The allies then advanced on the largest city in the area, Sparta's port and naval arsenal at Gythium. As the land forces began to invest the city, the allied navy arrived. The sailors from the three fleets set to construct siege engines within a few days. Though these machines had a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on the city walls, the garrison successfully held out.|$|E

They were broadcast on 9, 11 and 15 December. The last two messages were delivered as replies to the messages from Major General Rao Farman Ali and Lieutenant General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi. These messages from the Pakistani commanders to their troops were to have a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on their side, subsequently leading to their defeat. They convinced the troops of the pointlessness of further resistance.|$|E

Tyler was unhurt, having remained safely below deck, {{but a number}} of others were killed instantly, including his crucial cabinet members, Gilmer and Upshur. Also killed or mortally wounded were Virgil Maxcy of Maryland, Rep. David Gardiner of New York, Commodore Beverley Kennon, Chief of Construction of the United States Navy, and Armistead, Tyler's black slave and body servant. The death of David Gardiner had a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on his daughter, Julia, who fainted and was carried to safety by the president himself. Julia later recovered from her grief and married Tyler.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain and France {{had been}} at war {{for more than two}} years by April 1795, and British {{dominance}} at sea was well established, with the Royal Navy maintaining substantial blockade fleets off all of the principal French naval ports. The biggest port on the French Atlantic coast was at Brest in Brittany, from which French raiders could attack British shipping in the English Channel and Western Atlantic. The most efficient commerce raiders were frigates, light and fast warships that could strike rapidly and with <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> if left unopposed. One of the major roles of the British blockade squadrons was the detection and elimination of French frigates as they emerged from their bases.|$|E

5|$|Habitats {{change over}} time. This {{may be due}} to a violent event such as the {{eruption}} of a volcano, an earthquake, a tsunami, a wildfire or a change in oceanic currents; or the change may be more gradual over millennia with alterations in the climate, as ice sheets and glaciers advance and retreat, and as different weather patterns bring changes of precipitation and solar radiation. Other changes come {{as a direct result of}} human activities; deforestation, the ploughing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. The introduction of alien species can have a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on native wildlife, through increased predation, through competition for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the native species have no immunity.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Cariappa was {{the first}} of two Indians {{selected}} to undergo training at the Imperial Defence College, at Camberly, in the UK, to attend the higher command courses. With the experience he had gained at the Imperial Defence College, Cariappa felt that dividing the Indian Army during the partition would have a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on both sides. He explained to the hierarchy that without the help of British officers, there was a risk of inexperienced Indian officers taking over higher commands. But his concern was not addressed. During the disquieting period of partition he handled the division of the Army and sharing of its assets between the two new nations as the officer in charge.|$|E
5|$|In the First World War, {{horses were}} used in combat for cavalry charges, and they {{remained}} the best means for moving scouts, messengers, supply wagons, ambulances, and artillery quickly on the battlefield; the horse could refuel itself to some extent by grazing, and could cope with terrain which was beyond machines of the time. However, this war had a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on the British horse population. As thousands of animals were drafted for the war effort, some breeds were so reduced in number {{that they were in}} danger of disappearing. Many breeds were saved by the dedicated efforts of a few breeders who formed breed societies, tracking down remaining animals and registering them.|$|E

5|$|Several {{types of}} {{ammunition}} were available, each for different uses: round shot (cannonballs) against ship hulls, chain shot against masts and rigging, and canister shot (wooden cylinders filled with metal balls or fragments), {{which had a}} <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on tightly packed groups of men. For boarding actions Kronan was equipped with 130 muskets and 80 matchlock or flintlock pistols. For close combat there were 250 pikes, 200 boarding axes and 180 swords. During the excavations, large-caliber firearms were found – hakebössor, similar to blunderbusses; they were equipped with a small catch underneath the barrel which allowed them to be hooked over a railing {{to allow it to}} absorb the recoil of the charges. One hakebössa was still loaded with a small canister containing 20 lead balls that would have been used to clear enemy decks before boarding.|$|E
5|$|She, {{along with}} the {{remaining}} members of the Imperial Family, was sent into exile after a coup d'état staged by a clique of army officers in 1889. Being cast from her beloved adopted land had a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on Teresa Cristina's spirit and health. Grieving and ill, she died of respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest {{little more than a}} month after the monarchy's collapse. She was greatly loved by her subjects, both during her lifetime and afterwards. She was even respected by the Republicans who overthrew the Empire. Despite having had no direct impact on Brazil's political history, Teresa Cristina is well regarded by historians not only for her character and irreproachable behavior, but also for her sponsorship of Brazilian culture.|$|E
5|$|The century {{following}} 1750 {{was time}} of significant change. New forms of transport, industry and agriculture brought sweeping changes, {{and an end}} to traditional ways of life that had endured for centuries. The aftermath of the Battle of Culloden {{marked the beginning of the}} end for the clan system and whilst there were marked improvements in living standards for some, these transformations came at a cost for others. In the early 19th century Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on Arran's population. Whole villages were removed and the Gaelic culture of the island dealt a terminal blow. A memorial to this early form of ethnic cleansing has been constructed on the shore at Lamlash, paid for by a Canadian descendant of the emigrants.|$|E

5|$|There {{are various}} {{important}} prehistoric structures, {{many of which}} pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors. In the historic period the earliest known settlers were Picts {{to the north and}} Gaels in the southern kingdom of Dál Riada prior to the islands becoming part of the Suðreyjar kingdom of the Norse, who ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Control of the islands was then held by various clan chiefs, principally the MacLeans, MacLeods and MacDonalds. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on many communities and it is only in recent years that population levels have ceased to decline.|$|E

5|$|Director Sean Penn's The Pledge (2001), though {{adapted from}} a very self-reflexive novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, plays noir {{comparatively}} straight, to <b>devastating</b> <b>effect.</b> Screenwriter David Ayer updated the classic noir bad-cop tale, typified by Shield for Murder (1954) and Rogue Cop (1954), with his scripts for Training Day (2001) and, adapting a story by James Ellroy, Dark Blue (2002); he later wrote and directed the even darker Harsh Times (2006). Michael Mann's Collateral (2004) features a performance by Tom Cruise as an assassin in the lineage of Le Samouraï. The torments of The Machinist (2004), directed by Brad Anderson, evoke both Fight Club and Memento. In 2005, Shane Black directed Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, basing his screenplay in part on a crime novel by Brett Halliday, who published his first stories back in the 1920s. The film plays with an awareness not only of classic noir but also of neo-noir reflexivity itself.|$|E

5|$|The fauna of Puerto Rico {{has been}} {{subjected}} to human influence since the arrival of the Ortoiroid, Puerto Rico's first settlers, approximately 4,000 years ago. The native fauna was used by the island's indigenous population as a source of food, while others were used for skins and trade. Significant declines in the populations and diversity of the islands fauna are believed to have begun after the arrival of European settlers in the sixteenth century. Habitat destruction, primarily as a result of forest clearing for sugar cane plantations, had a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on Puerto Rican fauna during {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century. Furthermore, human-introduced species such as rats, cats, the small Asian mongoose, and the cane toad have had a profound effect on the native fauna of Puerto Rico. Rats on Monito Island are believed to be a limiting factor on the abundance of the endemic Monito gecko, feral cats on Mona Island have been documented attacking common ground doves and endemic reptiles, and have been associated with the reduction of Mona ground iguana juveniles, and mongooses have been documented preying on Puerto Rican parrot fledgings.|$|E
5|$|With the Byzantines defeated, the {{authority}} of Ivan Asen III was shaken. He and his wife Irene secretly fled Tarnovo taking the Byzantine imperial insignia, kept in the treasury since the Bulgarian victory {{in the battle of}} Tryavna in 1190. Michael VIII was infuriated with the cowardliness of the couple and refused to grant them an audience for days. In Tarnovo, the nobility refused to open the gates to Ivaylo and instead elected for emperor George Terter, which had <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on the rebels. Despite the military successes, neither was the Mongol threat dealt with, nor was Ivaylo capable to secure the support of the Bulgarian nobility and unify the country against the overwhelming forces of the Mongols and the Byzantines. As a result, Ivaylo's followers, disillusioned with the endless wars without prospects for peace, began to abandon his cause. With diminished support, in 1280 Ivaylo crossed the Danube with a few loyal associates, including Kasim beg, to seek aid from Nogai Khan.|$|E
5|$|Late on {{the evening}} of 17/18 February the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army {{launched}} an assault on FSB Andersen. The first attack was preceded by a heavy rocket and mortar barrage {{in the early hours of}} the morning, followed by two waves of infantry each of company size. The attack focused on the south-west of the perimeter manned by 3 RAR's echelon and mortar platoon, as well as an American medium artillery battery. The perimeter wire was subsequently breached, but the attack was repulsed by mortar counter-battery fire, Claymore mines and the heavy weight of machine-gun fire from armoured personnel carriers and the American gunners. The communist barrage had had a <b>devastating</b> <b>effect,</b> falling among the American and New Zealand gun positions, the mortar lines and the battalion echelon, as well as scoring a direct hit on an Australian engineer standing patrol. A second attack shortly after, this time from the north, was repelled by small-arms fire from the forward Australian pits. Total Viet Cong casualties were unknown, although four bodies were found on the wire at dawn, while numerous bloodstains and bandages were found during a later sweep of the perimeter and a suspected mortar base-plate location. Seven Australians and one American were killed, while 22 Australians and three Americans were wounded.|$|E
