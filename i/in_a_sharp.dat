5|$|During the infection, {{rotavirus}} produces mRNA {{for both}} protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus {{as early as}} two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought {{to be made by}} two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.|$|E
5|$|Resident: These are {{the most}} {{commonly}} sighted of the three populations in the coastal waters of the northeast Pacific. Residents' diets consist primarily of fish and sometimes squid, and they live in complex and cohesive family groups called pods. Female residents characteristically have rounded dorsal fin tips that terminate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> corner. They visit the same areas consistently. British Columbia and Washington resident populations are amongst the most intensively studied marine mammals anywhere in the world. Researchers have identified and named over 300 killer whales over the past 30 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{bills of}} bee-eaters are curved, long and end <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> point. The bill can bite strongly, {{particularly}} at the tip, and it {{is used as a}} pair of forceps with which to snatch insects from the air and crush smaller prey. The short legs have weak feet, and when it is moving on the ground a bee-eater's gait is barely more than a shuffle. The feet have sharp claws used for perching on vertical surfaces and also for nest excavation.|$|E
5|$|The spores of R.virescens are {{elliptical}} or ellipsoid with warts, translucent (hyaline), {{and produce}} a white, pale or pale yellow spore print; the spore dimensions are 6–9 by 5–7µm. A partial reticulum (net-like pattern of ridges) interconnects the warts. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped and have dimensions of 24–33 by 6–7.5µm; they are colorless, and each hold from two to four spores. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are 40–85 by 6–8µm and end abruptly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> point.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999, President Fernando de la Rúa took office, seeking {{assistance}} from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets, as reflected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, The de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to {{the complete loss of}} market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.|$|E

5|$|Leccinum manzanitae {{mushroom}} {{produce a}} cinnamon-brown spore print. Spores are 13–17 by 4–5.5µm, somewhat elliptical to cylindrical, and tapered on each end (fusoid); their walls are smooth and moderately thick. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 27–32 by 6–9µm, club-shaped to pear-shaped (pyriform) and four-spored. The cystidia are 23–32 by 4–6µm, fusoid to club-shaped with narrow, elongated apices. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe surface) are thin-walled, club-shaped to somewhat fusoid, and sometimes end <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> point; they measure 35–45 by 9–14µm. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae of Leccinum manzanitae. The hyphae of the cap cuticle {{are arranged in}} the form of a trichoderm (wherein the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, perpendicular to the cap surface).|$|E
5|$|McCarthy's {{committee}} {{then began}} {{an investigation into}} the United States Army. This began at the Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the Army researchers, but ultimately nothing came of this investigation. McCarthy next {{turned his attention to the}} case of a U.S. Army dentist who had been promoted to the rank of major despite having refused to answer questions on an Army loyalty review form. McCarthy's handling of this investigation, including a series of insults directed at a brigadier general, led to the Army-McCarthy hearings, with the Army and McCarthy trading charges and counter-charges for 36 days before a nationwide television audience. While the official outcome of the hearings was inconclusive, this exposure of McCarthy to the American public resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> decline in his popularity. In less than a year, McCarthy was censured by the Senate and his position as a prominent force in anti-communism was essentially ended.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on 27 October the Middlesex {{continued}} the brigade's advance, and was involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> {{fight in the}} hills west of the river {{near the village of}} Yongsong-ni, killing 35 North Koreans and capturing 80 prisoners, while American aircraft destroyed 10 North Korean T-34 tanks and two SU-76 self-propelled guns. The following day the Argylls took over as the lead battalion. Intelligence indicated that the British and Australians were facing the North Korean 17th Tank Brigade, equipped with 20 tanks, and although the North Koreans had suffered heavy casualties during the previous fighting on the Taeryong River, Coad was now forced to adopt more cautious tactics as a result, advancing in shorter bounds and clearing high points en route. With the war considered all but over the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade continued to pursue the North Koreans towards Chongju over the next three days; however, the advance increasingly encountered strong resistance from North Korean infantry dug-in with tanks and self-propelled guns in support as they approached the Yalu River on the Manchurian border.|$|E

5|$|North Koreans {{had also}} {{approached}} Yongsan from the south. The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> fight. In this action, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself. He mounted a tank, operated its exposed turret machine gun, and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven North Korean machine guns. Turner and this tank came under heavy North Korean fire which shot away the tank's periscope and antennae and scored more than 50 hits on it. Turner, although wounded, {{remained on the}} tank until he was killed. That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south.|$|E
5|$|Paris's {{manufacturing}} {{is mostly}} focused in its suburbs, {{and the city}} itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers, {{most of which are}} in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades. Paris region manufacturing specialises in transportation, mainly automobiles, aircraft and trains, but this is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> decline: Paris proper manufacturing jobs dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010, and the Paris region lost 48 percent during the same period. Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region. The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000. Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants (this department alone employs 33,000), but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen assembly plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Thompson again {{appeared in}} all of the Bruins' 44games, posting three shutouts and a 2.19goals-against average. The league changed its rules on forward passing, which resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> increase in goalscoring. Boston won all but six games, finishing with a 38–5–1 record, the best winning percentage for any team in a season. Surrendering only 98 goals, Thompson bested Chicago goaltender Charlie Gardiner to win the first of his four Vezina Trophies. The Vezina Trophy is awarded to the league's top goaltender, which was determined prior to the 1981–82 season by number of goals surrendered by goaltenders who had played a minimum number of games. In the playoffs, however, they suffered their first two-game losing streak, as they were swept 2–0 by the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup finals. Earlier in the playoffs, Thompson's winning streak of seven playoff games was snapped; it remains, as of 2014, the longest playoff winning streak to start a career.|$|E

5|$|Virgil C Aldrich {{reviewed}} the book alongside Religion and the Modern Mind and The Gate of Silence, also by Stace {{and published in}} 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a Hume or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because {{it is difficult to}} determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.|$|E
