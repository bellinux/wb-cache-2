5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> fidelity since the tape speed was double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E

5|$|In 215 Caracalla {{introduced}} the antoninianus, a coin intended {{to serve as}} a double denarius. This new currency, however, had a silver purity of about 52% for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual size ratio of 1antoninianus to 1.5denarii. This in effect made the antoninianus equal to about 1.5denarii. The reduced silver purity of the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> silver content, making the inflation problem caused by the earlier devaluation of the denarii worse than it had been before.|$|E
5|$|Mup {{genes from}} other mammals also encode {{allergenic}} proteins, for example Feld4 is primarily {{produced in the}} submandibular salivary gland and is deposited onto dander as the cat grooms itself. A study found that 63% of cat allergic people have antibodies against the protein. Most <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> titres of antibodies against Feld4 than against Feld1, another prominent cat allergen. Likewise, Equc1 (Equus caballus allergen 1) is the protein product of a horse Mup gene that {{is found in the}} liver, sublingual and submaxillary salivary glands. It is responsible for about 80% of the antibody response in patients who are chronically exposed to horse allergens.|$|E
5|$|Rossi, {{who started}} from pole position, was {{overtaken}} by Maricello {{at the start}} of the first lap. He had a small lead which was reduced because he was using super soft tyres which <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> degradation levels, allowing Rossi and Vandoorne to draw closer. Rossi gained the lead after Maricello made a pit stop for new tyres. Vandoorne became the new leader after getting ahead of Rossi when both drivers made pit stops, and maintained it to win the event. In the second race, Marciello started from the pole position but lost the lead to Stanaway after making a slow getaway from his starting position. The event was processional with few overtaking manoeuvres occurring and Stanaway remained the leader for the rest of the race to clinch the victory.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the Blue Cross Foundation {{found that}} there are four types of {{communities}} that can be identified based on their risk of uninsurance: entrenched-risk, unexpected-risk, resilient, and low-risk. Entrenched-risk communities are communities that <b>have</b> a <b>high</b> concentration of foreign-born denizens, and therefore {{are less likely to}} be eligible for Medicare. Unexpected-risk communities <b>have</b> <b>high</b> uninsurance but were not expected to based on their geographical locations, like Cape Cod or Boston. Resilient communities are communities that were expected to <b>have</b> <b>high</b> uninsurance but did not, like Worcester and north and south of Boston. Finally, low-risk communities are communities are communities that <b>have</b> <b>high</b> rate of insurance and were expected to <b>have</b> <b>high</b> rates of insurance based on their characteristics.|$|R

5|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} at between 1–3 years. Most Eurasian sparrowhawks {{stay on the}} same territory for one breeding season, though others keep the same one for up to eight years. A change of mate usually triggers the change in territory. Older birds tend {{to stay in the}} same territory; failed breeding attempts make a move more likely. The birds which kept the same territories <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> nest success, though it did not increase between years; females which moved experienced more success the year after changing territory.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{locomotives}} of {{the first}} production batch were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works, and all were completed by December 1929. The production locomotives had a slightly different profile to the K class rebuilds and featured left-hand drive to improve the visibility of signals from the driver's side of the footplate. They also <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> running plates {{along the sides of}} the boiler than the rebuilds, which required smaller wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving wheels. Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers, as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets did {{not simply}} {{replicate}} the Vickers 6-Ton. However, like its British counterpart, the T-26 mod. 1931 had a twin-turreted configuration and {{was designed to}} carry two machine guns, mounting one in each turret. A major difference was that the Soviet T-26 mod. 1931 <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> turrets (with an observation slit) than the British 6-Ton. Soviet turrets had a round firing port for the DT tank machine gun, {{as opposed to the}} rectangular ports used by the original British design for the Vickers machine gun.

5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losing}} {{and the poor}} attendance, the Buccaneers {{were one of the}} NFL's most {{profitable}} teams for most of Culverhouse's ownership.

The team attributed their low salaries to the players' youth, stating that it was the coaches who had made the decision to use younger players, who drew lower salaries than veterans. This contributed to the perception that Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team, although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners, while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest-paid NFL head coaches. He also offered Bill Parcells $6.5 million to coach the team, offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five-year, $7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie, paid Keith McCants an NFL-record $2.5 million signing bonus, and paid Steve Young $6 million in salary, plus another $1 million for the buyout of his USFL contract.|$|E
