The consortium has rarely commented upon the profitability of the bridge, but during the structure's 10th anniversary, {{it was revealed that}} there had been a 30% cost overrun in construction ($330 million), The consortium is forced to cover this out of toll revenue since the federal government ferry subsidy is used to pay for the original tendered price ($1 billion). Operating costs for the bridge have also proven expensive, with warranty repairs for asphalt adherence and the complete replacement of all bridge deck lighting cutting into profits. Toll revenues have fallen over 30% since the bridge opened, largely because of declining tourism traffic and domestic travel and currently range from $25 to $30 million annually. After expenses in 2003, the consortium received a year-end dividend of $2.6 million.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, when Russian Federation {{experienced}} a severe financial crisis, its military expenditure {{in real terms}} reached its lowest point— barely one-quarter of the USSR's in 1991, and two-fifths {{of the level of}} 1992, the first year of Russia's independent existence. However, since the rise to power of Vladimir Putin and the exposure of the poor state of preparedness amongst Russia's armed forces in the Chechen Wars and the 2008 invasion of Georgian territories (e.g., South Ossetia), Russian military spending has rapidly increased, particularly after the 2008 Russian military reform. According to SIPRI, Russian military spending in real terms in 2012 was the highest it has been since Russian Federation's re-emergence as an independent nation, but is still far lower than the estimated military expenditure of the USSR in 1990 - its final full year of existence (US$291 billion at 2012 prices). The budget expanded from 1998 until 2015, but economic problems including a sharp decline in the oil price mean it will be cut by 5.3% in 2016 despite analysts saying that large <b>increases</b> <b>are</b> required to fund the current equipment plans and accommodate high rates of inflation; the navy may be the most likely victim of cuts.|$|E
25|$|More than 6000 {{occupational}} schemes were {{in place}} in the UK in 2015, of which over 5000 were in deficit. The total shortfall of the schemes was over 360 billion pounds as of February 2015. A large number of UK employers offer their employees access to a defined benefit occupational pension scheme, often based on final salary. In such an arrangement, the employee was typically promised a pension of a fixed proportion of their salary in the period leading up to retirement. The proportion would depend on the number of years of service with the employer. Post retirement <b>increases</b> <b>are</b> typically partly discretionary. The amounts payable are restricted by taxation rules, the maximum being typically either a pension of one-sixtieth of final salary for each year of membership or a pension of one-eightieth of their salary per year of membership plus a tax free lump sum of three-eightieths. With increases in longevity and reductions in interest rates, such arrangements were becoming progressively unaffordable. So following a review by a Pensions Commission, to get a given income, the length it is necessary to pay into a pension in the public sector is linked to longevity.|$|E

25|$|By 1994 some 6 {{million people}} were {{receiving}} television broadcasts via satellite, and the number was expected to increase rapidly {{throughout the rest of}} the decade. Cable television was even more prolific, with an estimated 12 to 15 million subscribers in 1994. Besides Doordarshan, Zee TV—an independent station broadcasting from Mumbai since 1992—uses satellite transmissions. In fact, because Doordarshan is the only network that is permitted to broadcast television signals domestically, Zee TV and other entrepreneurs broadcast their Indian-made videotapes via foreign transmitters. Other networks joining the fray are Cable News Network (1990); Asia Television Network (1991); Hong Kong-based Star TV (1991); Jain TV, near Bombay (1994); EL TV, a spin-off of Zee TV in Bombay (1994); HTV, an affiliate of the Hindustan Times in New Delhi (1994); and Sun TV, a Tamil language service in Chennai (1994). In a communications breakthrough in July 1995, Doordarshan agreed, for a US$1.5 million annual fee and 50 percent of advertising revenue when it exceeds US$1.5 million, to allow CNN to broadcast twenty-four hours a day via an Indian satellite. regional, and local service.
