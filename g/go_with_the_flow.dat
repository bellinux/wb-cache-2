500|$|After Singer {{completed}} {{the three major}} productions X-Men (2000), X2 (2003) and Superman Returns (2006), he sought a smaller project before embarking upon the eventually aborted sequel to Superman Returns. Singer and McQuarrie had often made World War II films in their backyards {{while growing up in}} New Jersey, and Singer had later dealt with Nazi subject matter in Apt Pupil and X-Men. Singer first learned of the plot in the early 1980s when his mother visited Bonn and met Freya von Moltke, widow of Helmuth von Moltke, a founder of the Kreisau Circle resistance group. After learning of McQuarrie and Alexander's screenplay and signing on to direct, Singer read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer to gain deeper understanding of Nazi Germany's political landscape, and also met with one of Hitler's bodyguards, Rochus Misch, who was the last person to leave the bunker where Hitler committed suicide. The creative team acknowledged the ambiguity over the enigmatic von Stauffenberg's true motivation, but Singer and McQuarrie judged him to be a man of ethics just from what he did. Though McQuarrie sought for Valkyrie to be similar to Conspiracy, Singer had bigger ambitions for the film, wanting it to be more than [...] "old men in rooms, talking". Singer looked back on his decision, saying, [...] "The true story had all the makings of a classic assassination thriller.... I knew if I could keep the audience with [...] Stauffenberg, with his mission, they would <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> and be less inclined to start hypothesising on things from history." ...|$|E

30|$|For {{information}} on Takatsukasa’s life, I {{draw upon the}} autobiographies that she wrote and dictated in recent years – these appear in book-length form in <b>the</b> aforementioned <b>Going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flow</b> and in abbreviated form {{in the introduction to}} Living Life in Gratitude (Okagesama no inochi o ikiru, 2011). 3 Takatsukasa’s life story presented in these works is rich and multifaceted, and like all biographies, it is difficult to distill into salient points or provide a singular, overarching narrative. Although these texts offer many points of possible analysis, I have focused on Takatsukasa’s path to Buddhism, the representations of nuns in Japanese media, her training as a nun and scholar, and her scholarly works. I have not overwritten Takatsukasa’s interpretation of these events; however, I have added some scholarly analysis where necessary. Additionally, I limit my discussion to Takatsukasa’s life until 1979. Though seemingly arbitrary, 1979 provides a natural break in her narrative because in that year a fire destroyed much of Daihongan. This caused Takatsukasa to shift her focus from scholarship to engagement in the community.|$|R
