40|$|Urea cycle {{disorders}} are {{a group of}} inborn errors of hepatic metabolism that result in often life-threatening hyperammonemia and hyperglutaminemia. Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of partial deficiencies during asymptomatic periods is difficult, and correlation of phenotypic severity with either genotype and/or in vitro enzyme activity is often imprecise. We hypothesized that stable isotopically determined in vivo rates of total body urea synthesis and urea cycle-specific nitrogen flux would correlate with both phenotypic severity and carrier status in patients {{with a variety of}} different <b>enzymatic</b> <b>deficiencies</b> of the urea cycle. We studied control subjects, patients, and their relatives with different <b>enzymatic</b> <b>deficiencies</b> affecting the urea cycle while consuming a low protein diet. On a separate occasion the subjects either received a higher protein intake or were treated with an alternative route medication sodium phenylacetate/benzoate (Ucephan), or oral arginine supplementation. Total urea synthesis from all nitrogen sources was determined from [18 O]urea labeling, and the utilization of peripheral nitrogen was estimated from the relative isotopic enrichments of [15 N]urea and [15 N]glutamine during i. v. co-infusions of [5 -(amide) 15 N]glutamine and [18 O]urea. The ratio of the isotopic enrichments of 15 N-urea/ 15 N-glutamine distinguished normal control subjects (ratio = 0. 42 ± 0. 06) from urea cycle patients with late (0. 17 ± 0. 03) and neonatal (0. 003 ± 0. 007) presentations irrespective of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>deficiency.</b> This index of urea cycle activity also distinguished asymptomatic heterozygous carriers of argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency (0. 22 ± 0. 03), argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (0. 35 ± 0. 11), and partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (0. 26 ± 0. 06) from normal controls. Administration of Ucephan lowered, and arginine increased, urea synthesis to the degree predicted from their respective rates of metabolism. The 15 N-urea/ 15 N-glutamine ratio is a sensitive index of in vivo urea cycle activity and correlates with clinical severity. Urea synthesis is altered by alternative route medications and arginine supplementation to the degree that is to be expected from theory.

40|$|The {{alterations}} of deoxyribonuclease DNase {{activity in}} cancer cells were {{the basis of}} the utilization of mixed vitamins C and K 3 in a nontoxic, adjuvant cancer therapy. In order to localize exactly the altered activities of DNase in cancer cells, histochemical methods were utilized. The deficiency of alkaline and acid DNase activity appeared to be characteristic for non-necrotic cells of malignant human and animal tumors. This <b>enzymatic</b> <b>deficiency</b> appeared in experimental carcinogenesis before the phenotypic signs of malignancy. Tumor promoters directly reduced the activity of both DNases. The incidence of spontaneous malignant human and animal tumors appeared to be inversely proportional to the intensity of the activity of both DNases in normal cells and tissues from which these tumors were derived. The fact that alkaline and acid DNase activity was reactivated during the spontaneous and therapeutically induced necrosis of cancer cells suggests that this <b>enzymatic</b> <b>deficiency</b> of DNase activity in cancer cells was due to the action of specific inhibitors of DNases. Characteristic variations of serum alkaline DNase activity in positive responders to therapy, examined in more than 800 cancer-bearing patients, may be the basis {{for the development of a}} useful test for therapeutic prognosis and for monitoring of cancer bearing patients. Acid DNase was selectively reactivated in malignant tumor cells by vitamin C (sodium ascorbate), whereas alkaline DNase was reactivated by vitamin K 3. Joint vitamin C and K 3 administration produced in vitro and in vivo tumor growth inhibition, potentiation and sensitization of chemo- and/or radiotherapy and a decrease in the number of metastases in animals with experimental tumors.
