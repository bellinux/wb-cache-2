5|$|The move 6.Nf3 {{controls}} the e5-square {{in order to}} prepare the push f4–f5. Unlike after 5...Nec6, White does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> 6...Bc5?!, which encounters difficulties after 7.f5! Nh4 8.Ng5!, when the black knight is already {{in danger of being}} lost to Qd1–g4 or Qd1–h5. Instead Black must react quickly with 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 when he can adopt a normal setup with d6/0-0/Nc6/b6 or act boldly with 7...Qf6 threatening both the Nc3 and the f4-pawn. One point in favour of 7...Qf6 is that after 8.e5 Qb6 the black queen prevents White from castling short and is well placed if White castles long.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{all other}} Panthera species, jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, jaguar attacks {{appear to be}} on the rise with {{increased}} human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations. Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers. In addition, it appears that attacks on humans had been more common in the past, at least after Conquistadors arrived in the Americas, {{to the extent that the}} jaguar had a fearsome reputation in the Americas, akin to the lion and tiger in the Old World. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the capybara, not the human, and Charles Darwin reported a saying of Native Americans that people would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> the jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.|$|E
25|$|Bull {{sharks are}} apex predators and seldom <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> being {{attacked}} by other animals. Humans are their biggest threat. Larger sharks, such as the tiger shark and great white shark, may attack them. Crocodiles may {{be a threat to}} bull sharks in rivers. Saltwater crocodiles have been observed preying on bull sharks in the rivers and estuaries of Northern Australia, and a Nile crocodile was reported as consuming a bull shark in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson was {{describing}} to the Baptists that the United States Bill of Rights prevents {{the establishment of}} a national church, and in so doing they did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> government interference in their right to expressions of religious conscience. The Bill of Rights was one of the earliest examples in the world of complete religious freedom (adopted in 1791, only preceded by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789).|$|E
2500|$|Some critics {{point to}} a 2009 {{statement}} made at the Florida State Capitol as evidence he is stirring up Muslims to intimidate the government. Supporters of Bedier say that critics are taking words out of context. In his speech, Bedier quoted a statement attributed to Thomas Jefferson. [...] "When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny." [...] His remaining speech encouraged the Muslims and other minorities present, {{to be actively involved}} in the political process so they would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> the government, but the government would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> them.|$|E

In [...] Jacob blessed Joseph's descendants to grow like fishes. Rabbi Jose son of Rabbi Hanina interpreted that just the eye cannot see fish in the sea that are covered by water, so the evil eye would have no power to reach Joseph's descendants.|$|E

2500|$|In 2016, Price {{criticized the}} Obama administration's {{directive}} that allowed transgender {{students to use}} restrooms corresponding with their gender identity. On Facebook, Price wrote, [...] "It is absurd {{that we need a}} 'federal restroom policy' for our nation’s schools. This is yet another abuse and overreach of power by the #Obama Administration, and a clear invasion of privacy. Schools should not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> retaliation for failure to comply." ...|$|E

[...] He said that, were such a bill passed, public businesses could no longer separate locker rooms and bathrooms by gender, which he claimed would lead to a situation where, [...] "every woman and little girl will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> that a predator, bisexual, cross-dresser or even a homosexual or heterosexual male might walk in and relieve himself in their presence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Within the Assembly, the {{republicans}} were gaining {{at the expense of}} the constitutional monarchists, but they were also divided into several factions, with Thiers usually among the moderate republicans while Leon Gambetta lead the far left. The right was also divided into factions, some wishing a constitutional monarchy under the Orleanist Count of Paris, others under the Bourbon Count of Chambord. It was a very unstable mixture. Early in his Presidency, Thiers declared, [...] "In general, the country is wise, but the political parties are not. It is these, and only these, that we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear.</b> It is only these which we have to guard against." [...] Thiers wrote late in his memoirs that he would have preferred a constitutional monarchy, but he knew it was impossible at that moment, given the strong majority of republicans, and supporting a monarchy would have been [...] "a violation of my duties toward France; [...] I had as my mission to pacify and to prevent the conflicts of parties." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cardinal de Talleyrand was at {{the height}} of his {{influence}} and power. In September 1362, after the death of Pope Innocent VI, the College of Cardinals was divided (according to Jean Froissart) into two factions, one supporting Guy of Boulogne and the other Hélie de Talleyrand. The two competitors were strong enough to ensure that the other could not be elected with the two-thirds majority required by Canon Law. In the end, the Cardinals had to go outside the College of Cardinals, and a compromise candidate was elected, Abbot Guillaume Grimoald of S. Vincent in Marseille, who was Legate of the Apostolic See in the Kingdom of Sicily, and was not present at the Conclave. He was not even a cardinal. The decision was taken perhaps on September 28, but it was not made public until the day after the arrival of Abbot Grimoald in Avignon, 31 October. [...] After he had accepted election, Grimoald was proclaimed Pope Urban V. [...] Shortly after the election, Cardinal Talleyrand is said to have remarked to one of his familiars, [...] "Now we have a pope. We honored other ones out of duty, but this one we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> and revere, because he is powerful in word and deed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Papen {{arrived in}} Turkey on 27 April 1939, {{just after the}} signing of an Anglo-Turkish {{declaration}} of friendship, and met with Saracoğlu later that day. Speaking in French (the common language of diplomacy) Saracoğlu told Papen bluntly that the Turks regarded the Italian claim that the entire Mediterranean was Mare Nostrum ("Our Sea") as a threat, which led Papen {{to say that the}} Turks did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> the Italians just {{as long as they were}} Germany's friends, leading an insulted Saracoğlu to reply that the Turks depended upon the friendship of no-one for their security. Saracoğlu rejected Papen's suggestion of an Italo-Turkish friendship pact, saying such a treaty [...] "would displease Turkey enormously". Saracoğlu also told Papen that Germany's efforts to make the Balkans its sphere of influence both politically and economically were regarded as a threat and wanted to know if the Reich was prepared to go further, leading Papen to say [...] "Jamais d'la vie!" [...] ("I wouldn't dream of it!"), leading [...] Saracoğlu [...] to retort if that was the case, then the Germans could sleep quietly in their beds. Papen found the blunt, plain-speaking, no-nonsense Saracoğlu a difficult man to deal with and left his meeting [...] "visibly disconcerted".|$|E
