40|$|In South Africa {{a postal}} code is a four-digit number that {{represents}} a certain area in the country. Each area is serviced by specific post offices, <b>postal</b> agencies, <b>postal</b> <b>depots</b> or mail collection points. Postal codes might not receive {{a lot of attention}} in daily life, although we use them without even thinking. They are important as spatial units for storing and mapping certain kinds of thematic data such as geodemographic and lifestyle data for business purposes. Postal codes can be used as basic spatial data units in geographic information systems. They are part of the group of spatial units – along with administrative boundaries, place name boundaries, police districts, and enumeration areas- that form ‘area footprints’, making them receptacles for information. Without these, thematic data cannot be mapped. Therefore, spatial postcode creation and preserving previous versions is crucial...|$|R
