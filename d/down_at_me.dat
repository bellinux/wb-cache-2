2500|$|On October 23, 2012, T.I. held an NYC {{listening}} session, {{during which}} he described {{the inspiration for the}} album: [...] "I've learned that one thing about my life that is certain is trouble...Be that as it may, I shall embrace that fact and not evade it. We all have faults. Before I let you stand on your high horse and point a finger back <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> I'm {{going to give you a}} big, stiff 'Fuck you.'" [...] On Power 105's The Breakfast Club, T.I. hinted that Trouble Man could be his last album, explaining that he wanted to quit rapping, believing that it is not how it once was: ...|$|E
60|$|I gave a {{start of}} surprise. Minnie looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> half maliciously.|$|E
60|$|The matrimonial mishap looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with almost}} canine {{intelligence}} in his face.|$|E
60|$|The hansom pursued an aimless way {{for several}} minutes, then {{came to a}} puzzled stop. The {{aperture}} above my head was uncovered, and the cabman peered <b>down</b> perplexedly <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|Madame Fosco took a {{book from}} the table, sat <b>down,</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> with the steady vindictive malice {{of a woman who}} never forgot and never forgave.|$|R
60|$|And she sat <b>down</b> {{opposite}} <b>me</b> <b>at</b> {{the foot}} of the bed, and drew the blanket close round her with a shiver.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like {{a father}} gazing tenderly at the wayward child.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly I looked up. Nettie {{had come}} back and stood looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|The priest looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{a puzzled}} {{expression}} in his brown eyes.|$|E
6000|$|The men at {{the back}} {{suddenly}} laughed, glad to turn the joke against the forward girovago. He looked <b>down</b> his nose <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> But seeing I was laughing without malice, he leaned {{to me and said}} softly, secretly: ...|$|R
60|$|The two Hawaiians {{approached}} {{on tiptoe}} to my side. My heart beat hard, but I gave no token. I lay {{as still as}} death, and breathed heavily. I felt rather than heard them stoop <b>down</b> and look <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said I [...] "I {{can afford}} to waste my breath." [...] I pointed to a chair, and he sat <b>down</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I can {{remember}} a time when my lady very much neglected you," [...] said I.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Bowater looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{listening}} to this high-piped recitative with an unusual inquisitiveness.|$|E
60|$|He gazed rather arrogantly <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It always irritated me to {{be looked}} down at that way.|$|E
60|$|I sat down, rather uncomfortably, but Nick took a {{stand and}} stood staring <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with folded arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Back-fire!" [...] exclaimed Dick, {{slamming}} {{the table with}} his big fist. Then he settled <b>down</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Hiram looked <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Jim looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and not one of}} them said a word for what seemed a long time. It brought the blood to my face. But for all my embarrassment it was sweet praise. At last Dick broke the silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Lord! I hadn't {{thought of}} that. Can {{you put a}} few things in a bag when she isn't looking, and sneak them <b>down</b> to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the St. Aurea?" ...|$|R
60|$|She was so near me that I {{could have}} touched her. A {{weakness}} seized me, and speech was {{farther away than}} ever. She moved, she sat <b>down</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and the kind of}} mocking smile came into her eyes that I knew was the forerunner of raillery.|$|R
60|$|We {{said good-bye}} {{at the club}} front door. He smiled <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> benevolently {{from the top of}} the steps.|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped in}} front of my chair, and stood looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with an {{expression}} in which I read a contemptuous amazement.|$|E
60|$|He {{jumped to}} his feet with a cry, and stood glaring <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a gleam in his eyes which was {{positively}} murderous.|$|E
6000|$|She {{took the}} {{instrument}} into her hand. What passed {{between her and}} the person at the other end I had, of course, no means of telling. All I know was that she said, at short intervals,--"Yes! No! Yes! I promise!" [...] Then she laid the instrument <b>down</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would n't}} for the world, with my hair all {{tumbling}} <b>down.</b> Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> till I 'm respectable, and don't tell any one how I 've been acting. I think I must be a little crazy to-night," [...] said Polly, gathering up her rescued finery and preparing to go and find Fan.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{took the}} volume {{from her and}} sat <b>down</b> Maude shot <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a swift look of surprise. Even Matthew glanced <b>at</b> <b>me</b> curiously; and in his glance I had, as it were, a sudden revelation of the boy's perplexity {{concerning}} me. He was twelve, rather tall for his age, and the delicate modelling of his face resembled my father's. He had begun to think.. What did he think of me? ...|$|R
60|$|She {{paused in}} her polishing, a shining dish in her hand, and looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{something}} between a laugh and a frown.|$|E
6000|$|At this Mrs. Pallant got up; {{she stood}} there looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "You make my reparation--my expiation--difficult!" [...] And leaving me still more {{astonished}} she moved along the terrace.|$|E
6000|$|He looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{from under}} his {{beautiful}} eyelashes (have I mentioned that I am a little woman?), and he asked in his persuasive tones: [...] "Must we say good-by?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "O mother, when I lay myself <b>down</b> <b>at</b> your feet;Bless <b>me</b> {{with the}} dust that they tread, for they will bejewel me.O mother dear, what little I have I will lay at your feet,How {{fulfilling}} to stop adorning myself with foreign purchases,To {{know that even}} the rope you provide for a noose can be my adornment!" [...] (331) ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had gone}} nearly through the alders, {{following}} {{the course of}} a little brook and stealing along without a sound, when behind me I heard the kingfisher coming above the alders, rattling as if possessed, klrrr, klrrr, klrrr-ik-ik-ik! On the instant there was a heavy plunge and splash just ahead, and the swift rush of some large animal up the hillside. Over me poised the kingfisher, looking <b>down</b> first <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> then ahead <b>at</b> the unknown beast, till the crashing ceased in a faint rustle far away, when he swept back to his fishing-stub, clacking and chuckling immoderately.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that all? Thank God {{it is no}} worse!" [...] And now he unknit {{his black}} brows; looked <b>down,</b> smiling <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and stroked my hair, as if well pleased at seeing a danger averted. [...] "I think I may confess," [...] he continued, [...] "even {{although}} I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant. You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. Janet, by-the-bye, {{it was you who}} made me the offer." ...|$|R
60|$|A deep, hollow peal {{followed}} my nerveless little pull at the chain bell-rope, {{and almost immediately}} the door opened. A grey-haired manservant, in black livery, looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in surprise.|$|E
60|$|I {{was awakened}} {{by the light of}} a hand-lantern shining in my face. A small man of about thirty, with green eyes and a tangle of fair hair, stood looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|And {{the pool}} answered, 'But I loved Narcissus because, {{as he lay}} on my banks and looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> in the mirror of his eyes I saw ever my own beauty mirrored.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fever!" [...] he cried. [...] "Give me fever. Give me plague. They are diseases. One gets over them. But I {{am being}} murdered. I am being murdered by the Portuguese. The gang here <b>downed</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> last among them. I am {{to have my}} throat cut the day after tomorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{they are}} the most stupid brutes alive," [...] said the accountant, as he {{regarded}} the pack with a look of contempt. [...] "I've seen one of them sit <b>down</b> and look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> while I set a trap right before his eyes; and I had not got a hundred yards from the spot when a yell informed me that the gentleman's curiosity had led him to put his foot right into it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The folk {{round about}} are not over partial to strangers," [...] he observed, [...] "and you'm been away so long I reckon there's not many as'd {{recollect}} you. And as for carpentering jobs, there's Tom Lake over at Lesser Blakeney {{and his brother}} <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Brancaster, besides <b>me</b> on the spot, as you might say. It's a poor sort of opening there'd be, if you ask my opinion, especially for one like yourself, as 'as got education." ...|$|R
