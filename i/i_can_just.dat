She had difficulty coping with {{the ups and downs of}} the business… As a child, I thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just,</b> sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E

[...] Marilyn was made into something not human in a way, and I can relate to that. Her sexuality was something everyone was obsessed with and that I can relate to. And there were certain things about her vulnerability that I'm curious about and attracted to.|$|E

In 2010 speaking of his ten-year tenure on the serial Dawson said he felt he like he was [...] "turning a bit into Ken Barlow" [...] and added that he enjoyed playing Darren more each year. Dawson added that he was [...] "still learning" [...] and did not take his role for granted. He stated, [...] "I’m not ignorant enough to think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> go off and be a Hollywood star! I’d like to take on some more challenges for Darren".|$|E

500|$|Cartwright's normal {{speaking}} {{voice is}} said to have [...] "no obvious traces of Bart". The voice came naturally to Cartwright; prior to The Tracey Ullman Show, she had used elements of it in shows such as My Little Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform, saying, [...] "Some characters take a little bit more effort, upper respiratory control, whatever it is technically. But Bart is easy to do. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> slip into that without difficulty." [...] She usually does five or six readings of every line in order to give the producers more to work with. In flashforward episodes, Cartwright still provides the voice of Bart. For [...] "Lisa's Wedding", (season six, 1995) Bart's voice was electronically lowered.|$|E

She's got morals and this isn't good enough." [...] Cooper has also spoke of her confusion of the audiences perception that Jacqui is [...] "a bitch" [...] when she has strong morals. Cooper has said she is proud of Jacqui's wardrobe {{because it is not}} glam. She brands her as the complete opposite of the [...] "honey image" [...] the serial sometimes becomes associated with. Describing how she plays Jacqui she states: [...] "It's great playing Jacqui because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> be completely grotesque and over the top, snarling and grunting." ...|$|E
500|$|Second-place {{championship}} driver Edwards said {{he expected}} the top three points leaders to remain together during the race, [...] "I'll probably be glued to Jimmie, no matter where he's at. If him and Greg and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> stay together, and make sure we either all avoid or either all get in the same wrecks, then we'll probably be all right." [...] Earnhardt said he aimed to achieve his sixth victory at Talladega Superspeedway (where he had {{a large amount of}} fan support) in an effort to move ahead in the championship standings. Gordon, who had not won so far during 2008, felt that he could win the race, and employed a strategy where he would attempt to avoid being caught up in a multi-car collision. Johnson felt the AMP Energy 500 would be [...] "interesting" [...] and [...] "a turning point in the chase".|$|E

This includes an electric left-handed guitar, a shirt similar to Cobain's, and a blonde wig. The costuming for the performance is critical; Schwartz explained that [...] "if anything's missing, Al won't do it". The rest of Al's band also participates. Steve Jay, who plays bass, uses two bass straps to emulate and exaggerate [...] "Novoselic's low-hanging bass". He explained that he positions his instrument [...] "to where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> barely touch the strings". The members of the band also mock-mosh. Jim West, the band's guitarist, noted that moshing is usually tame, but that there [...] "were a few collisions where people got hurt, but not the audience, just the band." [...] Sometimes during the third verse, after Yankovic sings [...] "And I forgot the next verse," [...] he drops out {{for the next few}} lines, pretending to actually forget the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, {{the idea for}} [...] "Who Am I" [...] came while he was driving home {{with his wife and}} {{children}} one night. Hall, who was having personal worship time during the drive, recounts that he wondered [...] "Who am I to think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> call up to God whenever I want, from the middle of nowhere, and expect Him to hear me?" [...] Hall says [...] "immediately I started thinking I'm a new creation, I'm more than a conqueror... I'm [...] grass, that is rises up and is gone in a day". In an interview, he commented that [...] "me being a conqueror is true, {{but at the same time}} I need to understand that my life is a vapor, and me being able to even pray to [...] is because of what he's done for me". [...] "Who Am I" [...] was produced by Mark A. Miller and Steven Curtis Chapman. It was recorded at Glow In The Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, and it was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E

Mays auditioned with the song [...] "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" [...] from The Rocky Horror Show, while Monteith initially submitted a tape of himself acting only, and was requested to submit a second, musical tape, in which he sang [...] "a cheesy, '80s music-video-style version" [...] of REO Speedwagon's [...] "Can't Fight This Feeling"." [...] Monteith has deemed his casting [...] "spot on" [...] as: [...] "I'm just like my character. I've never trained or had any lessons. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> do it – with some adjustments, obviously." [...] McHale came from a boy-band background, having previously {{been part of the}} group Not Like Them. He auditioned with the song [...] "Let It Be" [...] and tested alongside Colfer and Ushkowitz. He explained that the diversity of the cast's backgrounds reflects the range of different musical styles within the show itself: [...] "It's a mix of everything: classic rock, current stuff, R Even the musical theater stuff is switched up. You won't always recognize it." [...] Lynch was originally intended to be a guest star, but became a series regular when a Damon Wayans pilot she was working on for ABC fell through.|$|E

[...] "It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants," [...] he stated. [...] "We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment." [...] Although he felt Avatar would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic, he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience." [...] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that Avatar would need significant [...] "repeat business" [...] just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed Avatar could inspire the same [...] "sharing" [...] reaction as Titanic. He said that film worked because, [...] "When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lewis, {{the song}} was conceptualised when the singer was {{experiencing}} a stressful time in her personal life when she visited her friend and co-writer of the song, Ryan Tedder in Denver, Colorado. The aim of the trip was to visit Tedder and his family, as well as conceive ideas and themes for material to be included on Glassheart. Lewis stated {{that she did not}} want to sing a ballad which would make her [...] "more sad", therefore they decided to work on an upbeat dance song instead. She asked Tedder: [...] "Can you give me a song where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> dance and jump around?", to which he replied [...] "What about this?" [...] as he played a beat which Lewis found [...] "hypnotic". Despite being in a raw form, Lewis was impressed with the song's beat, and said [...] "Yes! We have to do this." [...] The collaboration with Tedder marks the third album of Lewis' on which the pair have worked together. They first collaborated on Lewis' debut studio album, Spirit (2007), on the songs [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow". Tedder also co-wrote songs on Lewis' second studio album, Echo (2009), [...] "Happy", [...] "You Don't Care" [...] and [...] "Lost then Found", a collaboration with the group Tedder is a member of, OneRepublic.

The article states: [...] "Schuckardt said last week he thought the document was an eviction notice rather than an order to appear in court. He also believed an arrest warrant had been issued." [...] Bruce Erickson, a Spokane attorney representing Chicoine stated: [...] "There wasn't any warrant out for his arrest. I or the court or the sheriff's department can't force them to read the documents". Schuckardt left the mansion during the second week of June. The article went on [...] "either Schuckardt nor a legal representative appeared in court. The court therefore issued an order banning the bishop from church property." [...] Spokane County sheriff detectives confirmed that no warrant exists for Schuckardt. The court later ruled that Bishop Schuckardt had never been given proper legal notice of the pending action and overturned its original judgment against him and a handful of his followers.|$|E
