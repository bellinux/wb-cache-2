5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. <b>Federal</b> <b>courts</b> are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason <b>federal</b> <b>courts,</b> and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E
5|$|Prof. Freedman {{has argued}} that Bollman erred in {{applying}} § 14's proviso to both courts and individual judges (as opposed to only individual judges) and thus that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did confer <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> the power to grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners. The Reconstruction-era Congress granted <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> this power in 1867.|$|E
5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin {{of a black}} family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But <b>federal</b> <b>courts,</b> authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster children did not have standing in <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Parliament passed {{legislation}} which divided the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> into two <b>courts.</b> The <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> – Trial Division became the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada, while the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> – Appeal Division became the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal. The {{jurisdiction of the}} two new courts {{is essentially the same}} as the corresponding former divisions of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada was established, inheriting {{much of the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the Exchequer <b>Court.</b> The <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada gained {{the jurisdiction}} to hear judicial reviews from federal agencies and tribunals. The <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada had two divisions, the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> [...] - [...] Trial Division and <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> [...] - [...] Appeal Division.|$|R
50|$|The {{application}} was dismissed by the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court.</b> On appeal, the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal upheld {{the decision of}} the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court,</b> Trial Division. The decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court.|$|R

5|$|On April 10, 1826, Rowan {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to legislation to reorganize the federal judiciary that would have required seven justices to concur with a decision in order to strike down a law as unconstitutional. The amendment, which ultimately failed, was offered {{in the aftermath of}} a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States declaring an occupying claimant law to be unconstitutional; Rowan personally disagreed with the Court's decision. Rowan offered another amendment providing that ministers of the <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> would be subject to state laws when carrying out the decisions of the <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> After a month of debate, the entire bill was tabled.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the Federal Supreme Court is to hear appeals against rulings of cantonal or <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> The judges are elected by the Federal Assembly for six-year terms.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal, meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E
50|$|Article 95 {{establishes}} the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Justice, the <b>Federal</b> Administrative <b>Court,</b> the <b>Federal</b> Finance <b>Court,</b> the <b>Federal</b> Labour <b>Court</b> and the <b>Federal</b> Social <b>Court</b> as supreme courts {{in their respective}} areas of jurisdiction.|$|R
25|$|In 1971, Parliament {{passed the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> Act which {{abolished}} the Exchequer Court {{and created a}} new <b>court,</b> the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada. That Court had two divisions: the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> – Trial Division, and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> – Appeal Division. Although the two divisions had different functions, they were {{all part of a}} single court.|$|R
50|$|Admission to {{practice}} in <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> is not of itself evidence of experience in <b>federal</b> <b>court.</b> Due {{to the complexity of}} many <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> cases and the legal and procedural differences from state court cases, it is sensible for a person involved in federal litigation or a federal criminal defendant to seek a lawyer with considerable <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> experience.|$|R
5|$|Equal {{protection}} {{may have}} seemed inapt to the litigants or to the Court for a case of sex discrimination in 1942, or it {{may have seemed}} inapt for a case of cross-group challenge. The Sixth Amendment was not again invoked by the Supreme Court against jury discrimination for thirty years; the Sixth Amendment did not (yet) apply to state juries, and in federal cases the Court seemed to prefer its supervisory power over lower <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the Court held that, {{due to the}} Eleventh Amendment, <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> {{could not}} {{exercise}} ancillary jurisdiction over cross-claims by counties against states. Although only two other justices agreed with the entirety of Justice Powell's majority opinion, Brennan and Marshall agreed with Parts I-IV and VI (the Oneida's claims against the counties) and Burger, White, and Rehnquist agreed with Part V (the counties claims against the state), thus forging separate majorities.|$|E
5|$|In September 1976, Boston {{law firm}} Ropes & Gray opined that the state's $27 million {{municipal}} bond issue {{could not go}} forward using property within the claim area as collateral. On September 29, Governor Longley flew to Washington, and Maine's delegtion introduced legislation directing the <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> not to hear the tribe's claim; Congress adjourned before the bills could be considered.|$|E

5000|$|At the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal, court {{agreed with}} much of the {{judgement}} of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court,</b> but found that it was inappropriate for the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> to engage in claims construction absent a [...] "foundation of knowledge about the relevant art". The <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal remanded the construction of the patent claims back to the Commissioner for expedited re-examination.|$|R

5|$|On March 4, 1794, Congress {{approved}} {{an amendment}} to the United States Constitution clarifying judicial power over foreign nationals, and limiting the ability of citizens to sue states in <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> and under federal law, and submitted it to the state legislatures for ratification. The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified by the requisite number of states (then 12) on February 7, 1795, {{to become part of the}} Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court also issued {{important}} opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although the Court did {{not explicitly}} cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain influential {{in interpreting the}} Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and venue provision of Article Three. The Court also laid down the common law rules of evidence in <b>federal</b> <b>courts,</b> including the hearsay exception for party admissions and the narrowing of the best evidence rule.|$|E
5|$|The United States also observes tribal {{sovereignty}} of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> Like the states they {{have a great deal of}} autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.|$|E

50|$|Blanchard {{continued}} in the finance ministry after Camille Thériault became Premier of New Brunswick and was re-elected to his Campbellton riding in 1999. He served briefly in opposition before being appointed to the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada in 2000, shortly thereafter he also took {{a seat on the}} Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada. When the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada was split into the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal in 2003, he took a seat on the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> while maintaining his post on the Court Martial Appeal Court.|$|R

Additionally, there are offices for both of Oregon's United States Senators and an office for a single member of the United States House of Representatives. Representative Peter DeFazio of Oregon's 4th congressional district uses that office.|$|E
5|$|The ruling {{has been}} criticized for its {{intrusion}} into state affairs and its basis in previous rulings. Prior to Santosky, the realm of family life had been left to the states. Because of this, Santoskys direct intervention into the affairs of state interests was seen as contrary to United States v. Yazell, which held that <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> should only overturn state statutes when those statutes cannot adequately serve a clear and substantial federal interest.|$|E
5|$|Though {{based on}} a technicality, the Blyew case set a {{precedent}} in state and <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> {{that led to the}} erosion of Congress's Thirteenth Amendment powers. The Supreme Court continued along this path in the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), which upheld a state-sanctioned monopoly of white butchers. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to exonerate perpetrators of the Colfax massacre and invalidate the Enforcement Act of 1870.|$|E
5000|$|Decisions of the High Court are {{binding on}} the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court.</b> There is an appeal {{level of the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> (the [...] "Full Court" [...] of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court),</b> which {{consists}} of several judges, usually three but occasionally five in very significant cases.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> is {{the highest}} court in Malaysia. The <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> may hear appeals of civil {{decisions}} of the Court of Appeal where the <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> grants leave to do so. The <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> also hears criminal appeals from the Court of Appeal, but only in respect of matters heard by the High Court in its original jurisdiction (i.e. where the case has not been appealed from the Subordinate Courts).|$|R
5000|$|There is no reverse [...] "removal". That is, if a case {{originates}} in a <b>federal</b> <b>court,</b> {{there is no}} ability for a defendant to remove a case from <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> into state <b>court.</b> If the <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> lacks jurisdiction, the case is dismissed. Only cases that originate in a state court and are improperly removed to a <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> may {{be sent back to}} the state court where they started.|$|R
