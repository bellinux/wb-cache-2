5|$|In {{comparison}} to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, {{is relatively small}} and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but {{the expansion of the}} Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and <b>dressing</b> <b>table</b> are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker <b>Dressing</b> <b>Table</b> – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Burges's painted {{furniture}} {{can be seen}} {{in major}} museums including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the National Museum Wales and the Manchester Art Gallery. The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum, Bedford, holds a particularly fine collection, begun with a large number of purchases from the estate of Charles and Lavinia Handley-Read, including the Narcissus washstand, Burges's bed and the Crocker <b>Dressing</b> <b>Table.</b> The most recent acquisition by the Bedford Museum is the Zodiac settle (1869–70), painted by Henry Stacy Marks. The Museum paid £850,000 for the settle, comprising a £480,000 grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, £190,000 from the Trustees of the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery and £180,000 from the Art Fund after the British government imposed an export ban on the work.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} pieces of furniture, such as the Narcissus Washstand, the Zodiac Settle and the Great Bookcase, were {{originally}} made for Burges's office at Buckingham Street and were later moved to the Tower House. The Great Bookcase was also part of Burges's contribution to the Medieval Court at the 1862 International Exhibition. Later pieces, such as the Crocker <b>Dressing</b> <b>Table</b> and the Golden Bed, and its accompanying Vita Nuova Washstand, were made specifically for the house. John Betjeman located the Narcissus Washstand in a junk shop in Lincoln {{and gave it to}} Evelyn Waugh, a fellow enthusiast for Victorian art and architecture, who featured it in his 1957 novel, The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold. Betjeman later gave Waugh both the Zodiac Settle and the Philosophy Cabinet.|$|E

50|$|We {{asked him}} to alter and {{decorate}} the house—a somewhat new departure, since the architects of that day looked down on house-decoration as a branch of dress-making, and left the field up to the upholsterers, who crammed every room with curtains, lambrequins, jardinières of artificial plants, wobbly velvet-covered tables littered with silver gew-gaws, and festoons of lace on mantelpieces and <b>dressing</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|R
25|$|Femme au miroir (en. Woman with a Mirror), Femme à sa toilette or Lady at her <b>Dressing</b> <b>Table,</b> is a {{painting}} by the French artist Jean Metzinger. This distilled synthetic form of Cubism exemplifies Metzinger's continued interest, in 1916, towards less surface activity, with {{a strong emphasis on}} larger, flatter, overlapping abstract planes. The manifest primacy of the underlying geometric configuration, rooted in the abstract, controls nearly every element of the composition. The role of color remains primordial, but is now restrained within sharp delineated boundaries in comparison with several earlier works. The work of Juan Gris from the summer of 1916 to late 1918 bares much in common with that of Metzinger's late 1915, early 1916 paintings.|$|E
25|$|The {{sculptures of}} Lipchitz, Laurens and Csaky, and the {{paintings}} of Gris, Severini and Gleizes represented Cubism in its most distilled form between 1916 and 1920. However, {{by the time of}} his exhibition at the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne at the outset of 1919—just as before the war—Metzinger was considered a leader of the movement. His paintings at this exhibition were perceived as highly significant. The fact that Metzinger's Lady at her <b>Dressing</b> <b>Table</b> was chosen to be reproduced in The Sun (New York) amongst over 100 artworks in the Rosenberg sale suggests that Metzinger was perceived as a leader of the Cubist movement abroad as well. For the general public, the idea of Cubism was for many years associated more with Metzinger than Braque or Picasso, {{due to the fact that}} these artists did not exhibit in the salons, but rather in a private gallery; essentially removing themselves from the public.|$|E
