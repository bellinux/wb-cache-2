5|$|Following {{the lifting}} of the five-year ban on English clubs from European competitions, which had been imposed after the Heysel Stadium disaster, United became England's first {{entrants}} into the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in the 1990–91 season. Bruce played regularly, and scored three goals, in the team's progress to the final against FC Barcelona. He came close to scoring the first goal, only <b>for</b> <b>Mark</b> Hughes to deflect the ball over the line and claim the goal, and United {{went on to win the}} game 2–1. This was a particularly high-scoring season for Bruce, who found the net 13times in the First Division and 19times in total in all competitions. He also played again at Wembley, in the Football League Cup final, in which United were defeated by Sheffield Wednesday of the Second Division.|$|E

He signed a new three-year contract with the club two days later. On 20 May 2007, {{the final game of}} the season, he made his league debut against Hibernian, playing the final two minutes of a 2–1 defeat at Easter Road in place of Craig Beattie. Sheridan made his European debut on 21 October 2008, coming on as a substitute for Scott McDonald in Celtic's Champions League game against Manchester United at Old Trafford.

Gascoigne was at the centre of the action again in the quarter-final clash with Cameroon when he gave away a penalty, which Cameroon converted. In extra-time he made a successful through-ball pass from which Gary Lineker won, and subsequently scored a penalty, which proved to be the winning goal.|$|E
5|$|In 64BC the Roman Republic {{conquered the}} Seleucid kingdom, and the Roman general Pompey {{established}} {{the province of}} Syria. Palmyra was left independent, trading with Rome and Parthia but belonging to neither. The earliest known Palmyrene inscription is dated to around 44BC; Palmyra was still a minor sheikhdom, offering water to caravans which occasionally took the desert route on which it was located. However, according to Appian Palmyra was wealthy enough <b>for</b> <b>Mark</b> Antony to send a force to conquer it in 41 BC. The Palmyrenes evacuated to Parthian lands beyond the eastern bank of the Euphrates, which they prepared to defend.|$|E

The match is notable <b>for</b> <b>Mark</b> Burchill's three goals scored {{in the space of}} three minutes, the quickest hat-trick in the history of a UEFA club competition. Celtic went on to eliminate HJK Helsinki in the first round proper, before going out 3–2 on aggregate in the next round to Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|One {{result was}} a flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted {{ceilings}} and walls in estate houses. These included detailed coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. The designs relied upon continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, as well as elements that called on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory. The earliest example still extant is at the Hamilton palace of Kinneil, West Lothian, decorated in the 1550s for the then regent the James Hamilton, Earl of Arran. Other examples include the ceiling at Prestongrange House, undertaken in 1581 <b>for</b> <b>Mark</b> Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at Pinkie House, painted for Alexander Seaton, Earl of Dunfermline in 1621.|$|E

5|$|Rodman {{remained}} a bench player during the 1988–1989 season, averaging 9.0 points and 9.4 rebounds in 27minutes, yet providing such effective defense {{that he was}} voted into the All-Defensive Team, the first of eight times in his career. He also began seeing more playing time after Adrian Dantley was traded at midseason to Dallas <b>for</b> <b>Mark</b> Aguirre. In that season, the Pistons finally vanquished their playoffs bane by sweeping the Boston Celtics, then winning in six games versus the Chicago Bulls—including scoring champion Michael Jordan—and easily defeating the Lakers 4–0 in the 1989 NBA Finals. Although he was hampered by back spasms, Rodman dominated the boards, grabbing 19 rebounds in Game 3 and providing tough interior defense.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{fragments}} of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted {{at the end of}} the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists <b>for</b> <b>Mark</b> and John.|$|E
5|$|After {{signing a}} three-year contract, worth $850,000 per {{year with the}} Canucks on May 4, 2006, Bourdon earned {{a spot on the}} team's 2006–07 opening roster. He played his first NHL game on October 10, 2006 against the Minnesota Wild, but after playing nine games and scoring no points, he was sent again to the QMJHL for further development. On January 8, 2007, Bourdon was again traded in the QMJHL, with Moncton sending him to the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles in {{exchange}} <b>for</b> <b>Mark</b> Barberio and a first round selection in the 2007 QMJHL draft. As a Screaming Eagle, Bourdon lost in the QMJHL semi-final against his former team, Val-d'Or. He finished the 2006–07 QMJHL season with 20 points in 36 games. When the Canucks did not qualify for the playoffs, they sent Bourdon to play five games for the Manitoba Moose, who {{were in the middle of}} the AHL playoffs. He was held pointless through five AHL playoff games. Including his participation in the 2007 World Junior Championships, Bourdon played for five different teams throughout the 2006–07 season.|$|E
