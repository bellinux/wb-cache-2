25|$|Many, perhaps most, {{threaded}} parts {{have potential}} to be generated via additive manufacturing (3D printing), {{of which there are}} many variants, including fused deposition modeling, selective laser sintering, <b>direct</b> <b>metal</b> <b>laser</b> <b>sintering,</b> selective laser melting, electron beam melting, layered object manufacturing, and stereolithography. For most additive technologies, it has not been long since they emerged from the laboratory end of their historical development, but further commercialization is picking up speed. To date, most additive methods tend to produce a rough surface finish and tend to be restricted in the material properties that they can produce, and thus their earliest commercial victories have been in parts for which those restrictions were acceptable. However, the capabilities are continually growing.|$|E
25|$|AM {{processes}} for metal sintering or melting (such as selective laser sintering, <b>direct</b> <b>metal</b> <b>laser</b> <b>sintering,</b> and selective laser melting) usually went {{by their own}} individual names in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that we now call non-additive (casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining); although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies (such as by robot welding and CNC), {{the idea of a}} tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal (rather than adding it), such as CNC milling, CNC EDM, and many others. But the automated techniques that added metal, which would later be called additive manufacturing, were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid-1990s, new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, including microcasting and sprayed materials. Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common, enabling new object geometries.|$|E
2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and <b>direct</b> <b>metal</b> <b>laser</b> <b>sintering.</b> Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of 45 patients who were restored with posterior three-unit fixed partial denture prosthesis made using direct <b>laser</b> <b>sintered</b> metal-ceramic restorations.

40|$|Three reflectors {{have been}} {{developed}} and tested to assess {{the performance of a}} distributed network of piezocomposite actuators for correcting thermal deformations and total wave-front error. The primary testbed article is an active composite reflector, composed of a spherically curved panel with a graphite face sheet and aluminum honeycomb core composite, and then augmented with a network of 90 distributed piezoelectric composite actuators. The piezoelectric actuator system may be used for correcting as-built residual shape errors, and for controlling low-order, thermally-induced quasi-static distortions of the panel. In this study, thermally-induced surface deformations of 1 to 5 microns were deliberately introduced onto the reflector, then measured using a speckle holography interferometer system. The reflector surface figure was subsequently corrected to a tolerance of 50 nm using the actuators embedded in the reflector's back face sheet.

METHODS: An epoxy resin master model was produced. The impression was first made with silicone, and master and working models were then produced.

Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) acquisition and 3 D image conversion, combined with the DLMS process, allow the fabrication of custom-made, root-analogue implants (RAIs). CBCT images of 15 non-restorable premolars (eight maxilla; seven mandible) were acquired and transformed into 3 D models: from these, custom-made, root-analogue DLMS implants with integral abutment were fabricated.

At the 1 -year follow-up, no implants were lost, for a survival rate of 100 %. All implants were stable, with no signs of infection.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>Metal</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>Sintering</b> (MLS) {{process has}} been {{developed}} {{over the last decade}} to produce 3 D parts from CAD files using metal powders. A considerable amount of research has been conducted into the melting and solidifying process of metal powders, mainly to predict the temperature distribution in a single metal powder layer or a few layers. The temperature and thermal residual stress distribution in real parts built using MLS has rarely been reported. Finite element simulations of temperature distributions in metal powders and parts requires huge computing resources, this is the main obstacle to successfully predicting temperature and thermal stress distributions in MLS parts. However, from the numerical results in this paper, the periodic nature of temperature distributions in parts around the laser spot can be used to simplify the numerical simulation process to achieve the prediction of temperature and thermal stresses distributions in parts built by MLS...|$|R
