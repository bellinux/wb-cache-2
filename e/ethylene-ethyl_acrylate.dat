40|$|The {{environmental}} {{stability and}} the failure mechanisms of a eathodically chromated lead/tin (38 / 62) alloy joint bonded with an ethylene-acrylic a id (EAA) copolymer (20 weight percent acrylic acid) have been inves~tigated in alkdline solutions. The environmental stability has been {{compared with that of}} the alloy joint bonded with an <b>ethylene-ethyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> copolymer grafted with acrylic acid (EEA-g-AA). The peel strength of the EAA joint decreases rapidly with immersion in alkaline solutions. This decrease in peel strength results from stepwise swelling of the EAA adhesive layer from the edges of the joint to the inside, which swelling occurs by alkaline ions diffusing into the joint inside. On the other hand, the decrease in peel strength of the EEA-g-AA joints occurs from stepwise interfacial degradation from the joint edges, with no swelling of the EEA-g-AA adhesive layer. The interfacial failure mechanism is d~scussed in comparison with that of the EAA joint. Cathodically chromated lead/tin alloy joints bonde...|$|E
