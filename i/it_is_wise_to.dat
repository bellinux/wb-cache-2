25|$|The {{essential}} oils of D. ambrosioides contain terpene compounds, {{some of which}} have natural pesticide capabilities. The compound ascaridole in epazote inhibits the growth of nearby plants, so {{it would be best to}} relegate this plant at a distance from other inhabitants of the herb garden. Even though this plant has an established place in recipes and in folklore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> use only the leaves, and those very sparingly, in cooking.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{historical}} {{sources for}} The Mercenary War {{suffers from the}} same problem as any history of Carthage: Few primary sources of Carthaginian history exist, except as fragments in translation quoted by Roman and Greek historians. The main extant account of the Mercenary War is that of Polybius, a Greek historian writing many years after the events portrayed here. While {{it is likely that}} he based much of his account on now-lost works of prior Greek and Roman historians, it is unlikely that they had an unbiased view of Carthage and its history. When reading such history <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> take this into account. We have the best historical reconstruction that we can derive, but we must also remember that its balance and objectivity is in question.|$|E

That is why if many {{projects}} are declared, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> wait for everyone to say what is his highest card, {{and see if you}} can show your project or not.|$|E

2500|$|In {{cooperation}} with the HN, the FID organization needs to define its initial set of operations, accepting that needs will change over time. No single operational plan will fit all HN environments, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> consider the various counterinsurgency models {{and see if the}} proposed plan will work to fill the identified gaps, weaknesses, and disconnection ...|$|E
2500|$|Players {{raised on}} {{international}} chess often make poor use of drops, but dropping {{is half the}} game. If a player {{has more than a}} couple of captured pieces in hand, it is likely that dropping attacks are being overlooked. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> keep a pawn in hand, and often to exchange pieces if necessary to get one. [...] Compared with international chess players, shogi players are more likely to sacrifice pieces, even powerful ones, if the resulting capture can be dropped back into play for a specific purpose.|$|E
2500|$|While the Duck {{and cover}} countermeasure, {{in its most}} basic form, offers a small to {{negligible}} protection against fallout; the technique assumes that after {{the effects of the}} blast and initial radiation subside, with the latter of which being no longer a threat after about [...] "twenty seconds" [...] to 1 minute post detonation, a person who ducks and covers will realize when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> cease ducking and covering (after the blast and initial radiation danger has passed) and to then seek out a more sheltered area, like an established or improvized fallout shelter to protect themselves from the ensuing potential local fallout danger, as depicted in the film.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, Emmet Keeler and Joel Spencer {{considered}} {{the question of}} when to double or accept a double using an idealized version of backgammon. [...] In their idealized version, the probability of winning varies randomly over time by Brownian motion, {{and there are no}} gammons or backgammons. [...] They showed that the optimal time to offer a double was when the probability of winning reached 80%, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> accept a double only if the probability of winning is at least 20%. [...] As their assumptions do not correspond perfectly to the real game, actual doubling strategy may vary, but the 80% number still provides a possible rule of thumb.|$|E
2500|$|The Seven Years' War (1756â€“63) began {{somewhat}} inauspiciously for the Navy, with a French {{siege of}} Minorca {{and the failure}} of Admiral John Byng to relieve it; he was executed on his own quarterdeck. Voltaire famously wrote, in reference to Byng's execution, that [...] "in this country <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> kill an admiral {{from time to time to}} encourage the others" [...] (admirals). (Today the French phrase [...] "pour encourager les autres" [...] used in English euphemistically connotes a threat by example.) Minorca was lost but subsequent operations went more successfully (due more to government support and better strategic thinking, rather than admirals [...] "encouraged" [...] by Byng's example), and the British fleet won several victories. The French tried to invade Britain in 1759 but their force was defeated at Quiberon Bay off the coast of Brittany. Spain entered the war against Britain in 1762 but lost Havana and Manila, though the latter was given back in exchange for Florida. The Treaty of Paris that ended the war left Britain with colonial gains, but isolated strategically.|$|E

60|$|The pain--was--considerable, he said. Oh, she saw that, but he {{had already}} proved himself so good at bearing pain, and the new school of {{surgeons}} held that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> exercise an injured limb.|$|R

60|$|Then one {{sometimes}} {{wonders what}} may lie behind it, though {{an attempt to}} ascertain is not always advisable. In some cases there is nothing, and in others things which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wiser</b> <b>to</b> leave unseen.|$|R
60|$|Sylvia hesitated. She {{believed}} her influence over Bland would not weaken much in her absence; but, after all, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wiser</b> <b>to</b> run no risk. Moreover, she would, to some extent, feel her {{separation from the}} man.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{would that}} you had laid hands upon him," [...] said the Prince angrily, {{continuing}} his conversation with Chandos, [...] "and yet, perchance, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wiser</b> <b>to</b> play this trick and make them think that we were retreating." ...|$|R
