25|$|At {{an early}} age, doctors {{diagnosed}} that the singer suffered from 40-percent hearing loss {{in her left}} ear and 20-percent in her right, after discovering that the protective envelope of her eardrums had vanished. Consequently, she had ear tubes placed and, a month prior to her American Idol audition, fits for silicon spray ear plugs. Miller's condition has affected her singing, obstructing her hearing of her surroundings, rather than herself. She claimed that she learned to manage <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years prior to her American Idol audition. In January 2013, her mother revealed to The Salem News that a third surgery to skin graft her eardrum was impending once Miller completed her stint on the series.|$|E

[...] Two slaves were killed, and most of the others were incapacitated for months. [...] Unable to afford replacements and burdened with other debts from his newspaper, Yancey was forced to sell most of the slaves as they recovered. Yancey did open in Wetumpka the Argus and Commercial Advertiser.|$|E

[...] "There's been a turnover of people [...] who wanted to reconcile and I've been cool with <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years definitely makes a big difference", said Hoffman. In addition to his front office role, he also served as an instructor during spring training. In 2014, Hoffman became San Diego's upper-level pitching coordinator, essentially an additional pitching coach for the Padres at their Double-A and Triple-A levels. His new role also involved assisting San Diego general manager Josh Byrnes. Under General Manager A. J. Preller in 2015, Hoffman became senior advisor for baseball operations, overseeing pitching instruction {{at all levels of}} the Padres' minor league system.|$|E
500|$|Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News {{felt that}} Keys [...] "croons" [...] on the track's chorus line, [...] "I'm from Neeeeww Yooooork/These streets {{will make you}} feel brand-new/Bright lights will inspire you." [...] Keys said that while {{recording}} the song she wanted to make sure she got the hook right explaining, [...] "I did try <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> times, but it was more about capturing the kind of grand feeling of it. With the way I sang it the first time, I was actually kind of sick, and I knew that he needed the record, so I was like, 'Let me get to it.'" [...] She added, [...] "I came back and revisited it so that it could be what it is now So it actually took a couple of times, but every time, the energy was just so high." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song's hook has a [...] "crucial role", believing that [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] is a [...] "smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play, and it just wouldn't work without a big, clear voice to sing that hook". In November 2012, Keys said she had to redo the vocals after Jay-Z said he wasn't happy with her original take. Keys said she had been battling [...] "nasal congestion" [...] when she did the first take.|$|E

2500|$|Once Robert De Niro {{agreed to}} play Conway, Scorsese {{was able to}} secure the money {{needed to make the}} film. The {{director}} cast Ray Liotta after De Niro saw him in Jonathan Demme's Something Wild (1986), and Scorsese was surprised by [...] "his explosive energy" [...] in that film. Liotta had read Pileggi's book when it came out and was fascinated by <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years afterwards, his agent told him Scorsese was going to direct a film version. In 1988, he met the director over a period of a couple of months and auditioned for the film. He campaigned aggressively for a role, but the studio wanted a well-known actor. He later said [...] "I think they would've rather had Eddie Murphy than me".|$|E
2500|$|During Nancy's {{relationship}} with Jake Dean, Nancy's character was rapidly transformed {{due to her}} abuse {{at the hands of}} Jake. Fox told a journalist from OK! that when the relationship begins Jake is [...] "very controlling" [...] towards Nancy and he takes away [...] "all the things that made Nancy Nancy – the way she was opinionated and outspoken". She explained that during the storyline Nancy acts out of character which she found challenging to portray. She added that Nancy's abuse at the hands of Jake is psychological abuse rather than physical abuse. Sacre explained that Nancy wants to call off the wedding but Jake [...] "dismisses her concerns and insists the wedding goes ahead. He's kind of bulldozing his way through it all". He added that Jake Nancy still does not feel the wedding is right after he makes the arrangements but Jake still [...] "keeps on pushing and pushing and she gives in". Sacre said that Nancy regrets marrying Jake as soon as she has gone through with the wedding. Jake [...] "ends up trying to force himself on her on their wedding night". Sacre commented that in reaction to this Jake [...] "plays the victim and tries to blame Nancy for what's happened". The actor revealed that while Jake is in [...] "a desperate state" [...] he accidentally tells Nancy that he made allegations that she was having a sexual {{relationship with}} a pupil. Nancy is [...] "incensed", and Fox explained that this revelation is the [...] "final straw" [...] for Nancy who declares the marriage is over as this admission [...] "really shows Jake’s true colours" [...] to her. Fox stated that she and the production team were careful not to have the character return to her previous self, saying: [...] "We've tried really hard to make sure that Nancy didn't just snap back into her old self after the whole Jake incident last year. There's always a bit of darkness with her. That's something that really annoys me in soap, when something really dramatic happens to a character and they forget about <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks later".|$|E
2500|$|When Entity FX {{took over}} the duties of {{creating}} the digital effects for the series, they also {{took over the}} challenge of crafting effects that would illustrate Clark’s super-powered abilities, including the new [...] "heat vision" [...] that was introduced this season. The visual effects for heat vision evolved {{over the course of}} the first season, until Gough and Millar agreed on one that reflected their image of what heat vision should look like; they did not want the usual [...] "red beams" [...] or [...] "laser vision". The visuals developed from the idea that they wanted Clark to be able to use it in front of people without them being able to see it. What emerged was a [...] "heat ripple" [...] from [...] "distorting the frame". John Wash explains what the creators were looking for:" [...] wanted to be fairly accurate in terms of what you might see from something that was searingly hot traveling through the air, like a disturbance of the atmosphere. We keyed our research off the little ripples that you see if a light goes past a hotplate and reflects on a wall. We used a computer to create a conical version of that effect that could emanate from Clark's eyes, in combination with a little effect." [...] They used [...] "blobs of heat vision" [...] instead of [...] "constant rays" [...] for the first instances of Clark using his ability, in an effort to simulate Clark's attempts to control <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> episodes later in [...] "Red", the special effects team would use similar techniques for red kryptonite. To illustrate red kryptonite’s effect on Clark, and it releasing his inhibitions, the special effects team crafted digital effects in his eyes. Brian Harding tweaked the effects they were already using for Clark’s heat vision, giving them a [...] "little devilish, hellish red flicker" [...] in Clark’s iris. To help illustrate Clark’s super speed, Mat Beck and his team would slow down and speed up background settings in a single shot. For example, in [...] "Ryan", when Clark speeds up to the camera everything else slows to a stop—leaves stop blowing and birds are frozen in mid-flight—then everything begins moving normally as Clark races away from the camera. Entity FX also adds a blurring effect to Clark's body, as well as a distortion to the background to help further illustrate the speed at which Clark travels.|$|E
