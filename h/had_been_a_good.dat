Celia <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> student in her youth, graduating from high school at age fifteen, yet could not further her own education because her family chose to send her brother to college instead. Celia wanted her daughter to get more education, which she thought would allow Ruth to become a high school history teacher. Ruth attended James Madison High School, whose law program later dedicated a courtroom in her honor. Celia struggled with cancer throughout Ruth's high school years and died the day before Ruth's high school graduation.|$|E

Stuart also played rugby and football, and played for the local professional football team, the Ottawa Rough Riders.|$|E

500|$|Bakke {{complained to}} Dr. George Lowrey, {{chairman}} of the admissions committee at the medical school, about the special admissions program. [...] At Lowrey's request, Assistant Dean Peter Storandt told Bakke his candidacy had come close and encouraged him to reapply. [...] If he was not accepted the second time, “he could then research the legal question. [...] He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> candidate. [...] I thought he’d be accepted and that would end the matter.” [...] Storandt also gave Bakke the names of two lawyers interested in the issue of affirmative action. The {{general counsel for the}} University of California said, “I don’t think Storandt meant to injure the university. [...] It’s simply an example of a non-lawyer advising on legal matters.” [...] Storandt stated, “I simply gave Allan the response you’d give an irate customer, to try and cool his anger. [...] I realized the university might be vulnerable to legal attack because of its quota, and I had the feeling by then that somebody somewhere would sue the school, but I surely didn’t know this would be the case.” Storandt was demoted and later left the university. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of the Bakke case, Storandt was fired.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and to participate later in a press conference. After the feature race, Vandoorne {{said that it was}} a [...] "very entertaining race" [...] and he thought that the safety car came out at the wrong time. He stated that {{from his point of view}} overtaking was easy, and he did not expect to catch Rossi, but it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start for the season starting from first place, recording the fastest lap, and winning the event. Haryanto said it felt [...] "really great" [...] to finish on the podium, but thought it would be difficult to close the gap with the drivers in front of him. He stated that he did not expect to have a fast pace on the soft-compound tyres but knew that his pace under race conditions was good. Having been disappointed at his result in the qualifying session, Rossi was pleased to stand on the podium. He felt he achieved the best result for Racing Engineering. He stated that it was a good race for the team, and felt he should have not pushed too hard when he knew Vandoorne was in clean air.|$|E

Barry believed that as Australia <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> training ground for the Bee Gees it would also help his youngest brother. Lesley Gibb had remained in Australia, where she raised a family with her husband. Both Alderson and Stringer followed Andy to Australia {{with the hope of}} forming a band there. With Col Joye producing, Andy, Alderson and Stringer recorded a number of Andy's compositions. The first song was a demo called [...] "To a Girl" [...] (with his brother Maurice playing organ), which he later performed on his television debut in Australia on The Ernie Sigley Show. Sigley later informed the audience that it was from Gibb's forthcoming album, but it was never released. In November the same year, he recorded six demos - again produced by Joye - including [...] "Words and Music", [...] "Westfield Mansions" [...] and [...] "Flowing Rivers" [...] (which was later released). What may have detracted from the [...] "training ground" [...] aspect of Australia for Andy compared to his brothers was that Andy was relatively independent financially, mainly because of his brothers' support and their largesse; hence, the group's sporadic work rate. Andy would disappear for periods of time, leaving Alderson and Stringer out of work with no income. Despondent, Alderson and Stringer returned to the UK.|$|E

A TAG analysis of these constructions must take a different approach and a comparison reveals some fundamental differences in the two frameworks. Since the work of [5], there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of comparative study of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) and HPSG. 1 Much of this work has shown how analyses in one formalism can be translated into the other.
