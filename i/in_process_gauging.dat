40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that, in {{an appropriate}} limit, the off-shell M 5 -brane worldvolume action effectively captures the scalar potential of Seiberg-Witten theory perturbed by a small superpotential and, consequently, any nonsupersymmetric vacua that it describes.

We then construct exact nonholomorphic M 5 configurations in the special case of SU(2) Seiberg-Witten theory deformed by a degree six superpotential which correspond to the recently discovered metastable vacua of Ooguri, Ookouchi, Park [2], and Pastras [3]. These solutions take the approximate form of a holomorphic Seiberg-Witten geometry with harmonic embedding along a transverse direction and allow us to obtain geometric intuition for local stability of the gauge theory vacua.

40|$|Abstract: This project {{investigated}} uncertainties <b>in</b> the <b>gauging</b> <b>process</b> {{to permit}} the devel-opment of improved methods. Preliminary studies investigated the potential sources of error {{in the areas of}} measurement, track and structure position, and vehicle position (including the effects of wind). A Monte-Carlo and an approximate analytic, method quantified individual and total propagated biases and uncertainties in the clearance. The dominant sources of bias were found to be the track tolerances, measurement error allowances, steering allowances, and con-servatism in the swept envelope. The dominant sources of uncertainty were found to be specific measurement uncertainties, surface position variations for irregular or poorly aligned structures, approximations in the swept envelope calculation, and the effects of cant variation or wind on the swept envelope. The present method of applying tolerances (by linear superposition) can be challenged as individual tolerances do not bear a consistent relationship with the potential errors and variations they represent and because the superposition results in a level of safety that will vary according to the relative importance of factors at different locations. An improved method for determining and applying tolerances is recommended. This is based on the probabilistic approach used for the uncertainty analysis...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} was to quantitatively characterise the {{developed}} surface topography of finishes on stainless steel sheet using three-dimensional surface analysis techniques. At present surface topography is measured using (mainly) stylus profilometry and analysed with 2 D parameters, such as Ra, Rq and Rz. These 2 D measurements are not only unreliable {{due to a lack}} of standardised measurement methodology, but are also difficult to relate directly to the actual shape of the topography in 3 dimensions. They bear little direct relation to the functional properties of the surface of stainless steel, making them less useful than their 3 D counterparts. Initially it is crucial to ensure that the surface topography data collected is correct, accurate and relevant, by defining a measurement strategy. Models of the surface topography are developed encompassing the usual features of the topography and variations in the topography caused by production or 'defects'. The functional features are discussed and predicted relevant parameters are presented. The protocol covers the selection of the correct measuring instrument based on the surface model and the size of the relevant functional features so that the desired lateral and vertical resolution and range is achievable. Measurement data is then analysed using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to separate the different frequencies within the spatial frequencies detected on the surface. The frequency of the important features shows up dominantly on a Power Spectral Density (PSD) plot and this is used to find the correct sampling interval to accurately reconstruct the 3 D surface data. The correct instrument for further measurements is then selected using a Steadman diagram. Operational details of the measuring instruments available for this project are given and variables for these instruments are discussed. Finally, measurement method recommendations are made for each of the four finishes modelled. Based on this surface characterisation an attempt is made to identify the 3 D parameters that give a quantitative description of common stainless steel sheet finishes with respect to some aspects of their production and functional performance. An investigation of the differences <b>in</b> manufacturing <b>processes,</b> <b>gauge</b> and grade of material is presented, providing an insight into the effect on topography of such divergences. The standardised 3 D parameter set is examined to determine its sensitivity to common variations in the topography of the 2 B finish and therefore their potential relevance. A new data separation technique of the material probability curve for use on the 3 D datasets establishes a cut-off (transition point) between the two main functionally relevant features of the 2 B surface (plateaus and valleys) by finding the intersection of the asymptotes of a fitted conic section, giving a non subjective methodology to establish the section height. The standardised 3 D parameters are then used on the separated data, with the aim of being more functionally relevant to the main surface studied. Functional tests to rate capability of these parameters in the areas of optical appearance, lubricant retention and corrosion are carried out and the appropriate topography parameters are related to their performance.

40|$|A priori {{determined}} model {{structures are}} common in catchment rainfall-runoff modeling. While this has resulted in many ready-to-use modeling tools, there are several shortcomings of a one-size-fits-all model structure. The uniqueness of catchments {{with respect to their}} hydrological behavior and the need to adapt model complexity to data availability challenge this status quo. We present a flexible approach to model development where the model structure is adapted progressively based on catchment characteristics and the data described by the experimentalist. We demonstrate this approach with the Maimai catchment in New Zealand, a location with a large availability of data, including stream discharge, groundwater levels, and stream isotope measurements. Different types of data are introduced progressively, and the architecture of the model is adjusted in a stepwise fashion to better describe the processes suggested by the new data sources. The revised models are developed in a way {{to strike a balance between}} model complexity and data availability, by keeping models as simple as possible, but complex enough to explain the dynamics of the data. Our work suggests that (1) discharge data provides information on the dynamics of storage (represented by the “free” water in the reservoirs) subject to pressure wave propagation generated by rainfall into the catchment, (2) groundwater data provides information on thresholds and on the contribution of different portions of the catchment to stream discharge, and (3) isotope data provides information on particle transport and mixing of the rainfall with the storage present in the catchment. Moreover, while groundwater data appear to be correlated with discharge data, and only a marginal improvement could be obtained adding this information to the model development process, isotope data appear to provide an orthogonal view on catchment behavior. This result contributes to understanding the value of data for modeling, which may serve as a guidance <b>in</b> the <b>process</b> of <b>gauging</b> ungauged catchments.
