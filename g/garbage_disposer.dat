50|$|A garbage {{disposal}} unit (also {{known as a}} {{garbage disposal}}, waste disposal unit, <b>garbage</b> <b>disposer,</b> or in Canadian English a garburator) is a device, usually electrically powered, installed under a kitchen sink between the sink's drain and the trap. The disposal unit shreds food waste into pieces small enough—generally less than 2 mm—to pass through plumbing.|$|E
50|$|Home {{designs are}} {{typically}} smaller home projects (240 square-feet per person), with preferred minimal landscaping {{techniques such as}} xeriscaping and simplified interior features such as no carpet, vinyl, dishwasher, <b>garbage</b> <b>disposer,</b> trash compactor, separate dining room and large bedrooms. All features of the home opt for environmental alternatives such as tank-less water heaters and the toilet and washing machine being fed with rainwater from a cistern.|$|E
50|$|The garbage {{disposal}} {{was invented in}} 1927 by architect John Hammes of Racine, WI. He went on to found InSinkErator, which is still at work making millions of garbage disposers a year. The function of the <b>garbage</b> <b>disposer</b> is to grind food waste (e.g. chicken bones, fruit, coffee grinds, meat) {{so that it can}} be sent down standard household plumbing without clogging. The device works by attaching a small chamber underneath the drain of a sink. This chamber contains whirling blades and grinders which chop and grind the waste into much smaller particles. Once the food is small enough to pass out of this chamber, it is flushed down the rest of the plumbing.|$|E
50|$|In most of Europe, <b>garbage</b> <b>disposers</b> are {{not used}} at all; the high load of organic matter in the waste water {{requires}} a higher capacity sewage treatment plant, since the increased organic matter requires additional oxygen and water to process. Instead, garbage is separated at the source, into compostable {{and other types of}} garbage and collected. Similarly, in the United States there have been some political and environmental issues with <b>garbage</b> <b>disposers.</b> For many years, New York City had banned their use. The stated reason was the above-mentioned increased sewage treatment capacity, but many area residents also suspected that it was the garbage unions not wanting work taken away from them. The ban was rescinded on September 11, 1997.|$|R
50|$|In 1887, {{malted milk}} {{was invented in}} Racine by English {{immigrant}} William Horlick, and Horlicks remains a global brand. The garbage disposal was invented in 1927 by architect John Hammes of Racine, who founded the company InSinkErator, which still produces millions of <b>garbage</b> <b>disposers</b> every year in Racine. Racine is also the home of S.C. Johnson & Son, whose headquarters were designed in 1936 by Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright also designed the Wingspread Conference Center and several homes and other buildings in Racine. The city {{is also home to}} the Dremel Corporation, Reliance Controls Corporation and Twin Disc. Case New Holland’s Racine manufacturing facility, which builds two types of tractors (the New Holland T8 and the Case IH Magnum), offers public tours throughout the year.|$|R
5000|$|InSinkErator is {{a company}} and brand name known for {{producing}} instant hot water dispensers and waste disposal systems, generally called garbage disposals or <b>garbage</b> <b>disposers.</b> The company was founded in Racine, Wisconsin by John W. Hammes, who was working as an architect there. Hammes is credited with inventing the [...] "in-sink" [...] food waste disposal in 1927, for his wife. It works by grinding and shredding solid food waste. He spent ten years improving the design and went into business selling the appliance. His company was called the In-Sink-Erator Manufacturing Company. The name is a play on the word [...] "incinerator" [...] and refers {{to the fact that}} the mouth of the disposal unit is located [...] "in" [...] the [...] "sink".|$|R
50|$|Though the Blue, Pink and Red Teams are shortlisted for {{the title}} of the episode's most improved, the Pink Team are {{immediately}} removed from consideration due to their failure to complete the third challenge, whereas the Blue and Red Teams completed all three. Though Rob favours the Red Team for doing well in all the challenges and completing the most complex challenge (the kitchen) flawlessly, Helder and Hillary agree that Fabian still needs to work on his leadership style, and that Jesse and Holly have {{done a good job of}} addressing their previously very poor teamwork. The Blue Team are named the most improved, something which the experts admitted that three episodes ago they didn’t see ever happening, and Jesse and Holly are awarded a high-end kitchen sink and <b>garbage</b> <b>disposer,</b> which Jesse immediately resolves to install when the two get home.|$|E
