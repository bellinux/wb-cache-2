40|$|One {{straight}} and two divergent supersonic circular combustors, all with hydrogen fuel injection, were experimentally {{tested in a}} shock tunnel at a condition representative of Mach 8 flight at an altitude 30 km. All three combustors were 500 mm long (L/D = 15. 4) and were preceded by a 249. 5 mm (L/D = 7. 7) long constant area tube. The two divergent combustors had a half cone divergence angle of 1 ° and 2 ° and both had an exit to inlet ratio of 2. The pressure profiles indicated that at an equivalence ratio around 1, separation of the boundary layer was suspected to have occurred in all three combustors and that {{the point of this}} suspected separation moved forward as the equivalence ratio was increased. Experimental results were compared to one-dimensional analysis to derive estimations for the combustion efficiency and the point of combustion extinguishment for each combustor. The point of extinguishment was estimated to be approximately 270 mm (L/D = 8) from the point of injection for the 1 o combustor whereas it was further downstream for the 2 ° at 420 mm (L/D = 13) due to the longer constant area section, though closer to the point of <b>divergence.</b> <b>Coefficients</b> of inviscid thrust over the expanding section of the divergent combustors were calculated. The maximum coefficient of inviscid thrust achieved for the 1 ° and 2 ° combustors were 0. 070 and 0. 076 respectively and were achieved at an equivalence ratio approximately equal to 1 for both divergent combustors.

40|$|Studies {{have found}} that on average males earn {{substantially}} higher wages than females. Females are paid lower {{than their male counterparts}} due to several reasons such as educational attainment, job characteristics and types of industries. Even after accounting for variations in these productivity- related characteristics, gender wage differentials may still prevail as a result of discriminatory practice by employers. This paper attempts to measure the determinants of wage differentials by gender in the Malaysian manufacturing sector. The analysis is based on a survey of 2, 046 workers in six major industries conducted in 1999. These are the electrical and electronics, textile, woodbased, transport equipment, food and chemical industries. The determinants of wage differentials are obtained by using the coefficients of the earnings functions. These factors are decomposed into several categories, namely, demographic factors, human capital, job characteristics and industry characteristics. The results reveal that demographic factors and human capital variables {{play a major role in}} determining the wage differentials by gender.

The decomposition actually shows that in Japan, both productivity and hours worked sharply decreased in line with the decline in real GDP, allowing for less adjustment on the extensive margin (i.e. by firing workers). In Spain, however, all three decomposition variables increased 12, with a greater adjustment in productivity and labour force than hours worked.

30|$|The results {{presented}} in this paper confirm that Okun’s coefficient varies across countries and time, where the latter is due to both longer-term trends and movements in output over the business cycle. Focusing on the period of the global financial crisis, the findings show that there was considerable divergence in the rolling regression estimates of Okun’s coefficient during 2007 - 2010. In the United States, Canada, Spain and other badly affected economies, the coefficient increased rapidly, departing from pre-crisis levels and suggesting high volatility of those labour markets. In other countries where unemployment has remained subdued, namely Germany and the Netherlands, the coefficient has fallen dramatically. Changes in unemployment were decomposed to identify the association with other channels of labour market adjustment (hours, productivity and labour force). The results presented provide in-depth insights on the reasons behind the <b>divergence</b> in Okun’s <b>coefficient</b> during the recession and across countries.

Motivated by the {{development}} of efficient Monte Carlo methods for PDE models in molecular dynamics, we establish a new probabilistic interpretation of a family of divergence form operators with discontinuous coefficients at the interface of two open subsets of R d. This family of operators includes the case of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation used to compute the electrostatic free energy of a molecule. More precisely, we explicitly construct a Markov process whose infinitesimal generator belongs to this family, as the solution of a SDE including a non standard local time term related to the interface of discontinuity. We then prove an extended Feynman-Kac formula for the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This formula allows us to justify various probabilistic numerical methods to approximate the free energy of a molecule. We analyse the convergence rate of these simulation procedures and numerically compare them on idealized molecules models. Résumé.

40|$|Bayesian {{classification}} labels observations {{based on}} given prior information, namely class-a priori and class-conditional probabilities. Bayes' risk is the minimum expected classification cost that {{is achieved by}} the Bayes' test, the optimal decision rule. When no cost incurs for correct classification and unit cost is charged for misclassification, Bayes' test reduces to the maximum a posteriori decision rule, and Bayes risk simplifies to Bayes' error, the probability of error. Since calculating this probability of error is often intractable, several techniques have been devised to bound it with closed-form formula, introducing thereby measures of similarity and divergence between distributions like the Bhattacharyya coefficient and its associated Bhattacharyya distance. The Bhattacharyya upper bound can further be tightened using the Chernoff information that relies {{on the notion of}} best error exponent. In this paper, we first express Bayes' risk using the total variation distance on scaled distributions. We then elucidate and extend the Bhattacharyya and the Chernoff upper bound mechanisms using generalized weighted means. We provide as a byproduct novel notions of statistical <b>divergences</b> and affinity <b>coefficients.</b> We illustrate our technique by deriving new upper bounds for the univariate Cauchy and the multivariate $t$-distributions, and show experimentally that those bounds are not too distant to the computationally intractable Bayes' error.

There is, however, little empirical data on partially asexual organisms to test this prediction. Here we examine patterns of nucleotide diversity at eight nuclear loci in continentwide samples of two species of cyclically parthenogenetic Daphnia to assess the effect of partial asexual reproduction on effective population size and amount of recombination. Both species have high nucleotide diversities and show abundant evidence for recombination, yielding large estimates of effective population sizes (300, 000 – 600, 000).

In this paper we shed light on estimating query vectors in ad-hoc retrieval where a limited information is available in the original query. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) is a well-known technique for updating query language models and expanding the queries with a number of relevant terms. We formulate the query updating in low-dimensional spaces first with rotating the query vector and then with scaling. These consequential steps are embedded in a query-specific projection matrix capturing both angle and scaling. In this paper we propose a new but not the most effective technique necessarily for PRF in language modeling, based on the query projection algorithm. We learn an embedded coefficient matrix for each query, whose aim is to improve the vector representation of the query by transforming it to a more reliable space, and then update the query language model. The proposed embedded <b>coefficient</b> <b>divergence</b> minimization model (ECDMM) takes top-ranked documents retrieved by the query and obtains a couple of positive and negative sample sets; these samples are used for learning the coefficient matrix which will be used for projecting the query vector and updating the query language model using a softmax function. Experimental results on several TREC and CLEF data sets in several languages demonstrate effectiveness of ECDMM. The experimental results reveal that the new formulation for the query works as well as state-of-the-art PRF techniques and outperforms state-of-the-art PRF techniques in a TREC collection in terms of MAP,P@ 5, and P@ 10 significantly...|$|R
