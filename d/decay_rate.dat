5|$|When the {{luminosity}} of a TypeII supernova is plotted over {{a period}} of time, it shows a characteristic rise to a peak brightness followed by a decline. These light curves have an average <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> of 0.008magnitudes per day; much lower than the <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> for TypeIa supernovae. Type II are sub-divided into two classes, depending on the shape of the light curve. The light curve for a TypeII-L supernova shows a steady (linear) decline following the peak brightness. By contrast, the light curve of a TypeII-P supernova has a distinctive flat stretch (called a plateau) during the decline; representing a period where the luminosity decays at a slower rate. The net luminosity <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> is lower, at 0.0075magnitudes per day for TypeII-P, compared to 0.012magnitudes per day for TypeII-L.|$|E

However, a limitation of all eQTL studies to date, which have used measurements of steadystate {{gene expression}} levels, is the inability to directly distinguish between variation in transcription and <b>decay</b> <b>rates.</b> To address this gap, we performed a genome-wide study of variation in gene-specific mRNA <b>decay</b> <b>rates</b> across individuals. Using a time-course study design, we estimated mRNA <b>decay</b> <b>rates</b> for over 16, 000 genes in 70 Yoruban HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), for which extensive genotyping data are available. Considering mRNA <b>decay</b> <b>rates</b> across genes, we found that: (i) as expected, highly expressed genes are generally associated with lower mRNA <b>decay</b> <b>rates,</b> (ii) genes with rapid mRNA <b>decay</b> <b>rates</b> are enriched with putative binding sites for miRNA and RNA binding proteins, and (iii) genes with similar functional roles tend to exhibit correlated <b>rates</b> of mRNA <b>decay.</b> Focusing on variation in mRNA decay across individuals, we estimate that steady-state expression levels are significantly correlated with variation in <b>decay</b> <b>rates</b> in 10 % of genes. Somewhat counter-intuitively, for about half of these genes, higher expression is associated with faster <b>decay</b> <b>rates,</b> possibly due to a coupling of mRNA decay with transcriptional processes in genes involved in rapid cellular responses.

5|$|Generally, {{people have}} fewer than 36 {{repeated}} glutamines in the polyQ region {{which results in}} production of the cytoplasmic protein Huntingtin. However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results {{in the production of}} a protein which has different characteristics. This altered form, called mutant huntingtin (mHTT), increases the <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> of certain types of neurons. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons, and are affected accordingly. Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD. 36–39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed. With very large repeat counts, HD has full penetrance and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD. This accounts for about 7% of HD carriers.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{by adding}} a perturbative {{electric}} potential to the quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom, tiny shifts in the spectral lines of hydrogen caused {{by the presence of}} an electric field (the Stark effect) can be calculated.

25|$|The {{constancy}} of {{the decay}} rates of isotopes is well supported in science.

Although scientists have noted slight increases in the <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> for isotopes subject to extreme pressures, those differences were too small to significantly impact date estimates. The constancy of the decay rates is also governed by first principles in quantum mechanics, wherein any deviation in the rate would require {{a change in the}} fundamental constants.

25|$|Many {{statements}} {{have been}} made concerning the relationship between transsaccadic memory and visual short-term memory. Researchers have noted several similar characteristics between the two systems, leading several to believe that transsaccadic memory is in fact visual short-term memory or a part of visual short-term memory. Transsaccadic memory has a limited capacity of three to four items, a slow <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> and maskable characteristics. Basically, transsaccadic memory can hold three to four items for each saccade, and the retention of items decays or disappears from consciousness slowly after {{the presentation of the}} stimulus. However, once a mask stimulus, such as a blank screen, is presented immediately after the stimulus, the items retained prior to the mask can be replaced and/or eliminated faster by the mask. All of these factors are typical characteristics of visual short-term memory. The content stored in transsaccadic memory are less-image like, more abstract and are sparse representations of the objects, which is found to be similar to the type of representations in visual short-term memory. Transsaccadic memory is different from visual short-term memory in that it takes into account the changes of the target's location due to the eye moving to new saccades. The information retained between saccades do not take into account positional information very well. Nevertheless, relational and identity information are well retained. Prime and colleagues (2006) hypothesize, transsaccadic memory utilizes egocentric mechanisms, like selective attention, to reduce the visual search of the target and allow for spatial information between saccades to be retained and updated by incorporation of information across saccades.|$|E
500|$|The modern {{standard}} model for Type Ia supernovae explosions {{is founded on}} a proposal by Whelan and Iben in 1973, and is based upon a mass-transfer scenario to a degenerate companion star. In particular, the light curve of SN1972e in NGC 5253, which was observed {{for more than a}} year, was followed long enough to discover that after its broad [...] "hump" [...] in brightness, the supernova faded at a nearly constant rate of about 0.01 magnitudes per day. [...] Translated to another system of units, this is nearly the same as the <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> of cobalt-56 (56Co), whose half-life is 77 days. [...] The degenerate explosion model predicts the production of about a solar mass of nickel-56 (56Ni) by the exploding star. The 56Ni decays with a half-life of 6.8 days to 56Co, and the decay of the nickel and cobalt provides the energy radiated away by the supernova late in its history. [...] The agreement in both total energy production and the fade rate between the theoretical models and the observations of 1972e led to rapid acceptance of the degenerate-explosion model.|$|E
500|$|The light curves for TypeIa {{are mostly}} very uniform, with a {{consistent}} maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity. [...] Their optical energy output {{is driven by}} radioactive decay of ejected nickel-56 (half life 6 days), which then decays to radioactive cobalt-56 (half life 77 days).

Studies of cosmology today rely on 56Ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of Type Ia, which are the [...] "standard candles" [...] of cosmology but whose diagnostic 847keV and 1238keV gamma rays were first detected only in 2014. The initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted. [...] The light curve continues to decline in the B band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about 40 days, but {{this is only a}} hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra-red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it. The visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> of the radioactive cobalt (which has the longer half life and controls the later curve), because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation. [...] After several months, the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt-56, although this portion of the light curve has been little-studied.|$|E
