During the integrative phase of uptake, a passive sampling device accumulates residues linearly relative to time, assuming constant exposure concentrations.

Sixty enamel slabs from recently extracted thirty molars were used. The specimens were polished with sandpapers under water-cooling. The enamel samples were randomly divided in four groups, treated with 10 % hydrogen peroxide (HP) or Whitening Strips (WS) containing 10 % hydrogen peroxide and using two conditions: in vitro or <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> model. For <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>condition,</b> six volunteers wore an intra-oral appliance containing enamel slabs, while for in vitro condition the specimens were kept in deionized water after the bleaching protocols. The bleaching treatments were applied one-hour daily for 14 days. Similar amounts of bleaching agents were used in both conditions. Before and after bleaching treatments, microhardness was measured. Statistical analysis (ANOVA and Tukey test) showed that <b>in</b> the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>condition</b> there was no statistically significant microhardness reduction in the bleached enamel (p> 0. 05). Significant decrease in hardness was observed for enamel slabs bleached with both treatments in the in vitro condition (p< 0. 05). Regarding the bleaching agents, <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> results showed no difference between HP and WS, while in vitro WS produced the lowest hardness value.

30|$|For the systematical {{underestimation}} of calculated temperatures discerned in âMulticomponent geothermometryâ section, {{a number}} of processes or parameters are worth considering.
