40|$|Early Warning Systems (EWS) {{provide an}} {{effective}} measure for better disaster preparedness, response, and mitigation. The effectiveness of EWS depends highly {{on the ability}} to distribute alert message to the persons that will be affected. In this context mobile devices play already a vital role in the ability to reach people in time and at the endangered location. Most existing approaches focus on mass dissemination methods via SMS and Cell-Broadcasting. As these approaches are effective to inform masses about a disaster with one message for all they have their weaknesses in telling the people how to respond according to their location and provide individual guidance (e. g. by maps) within specific communities. Research in disaster management gives strong evidence that the later is often crucial for better disaster response. Accordingly, we witness an increasing demand for more community-centered warnings systems solutions. This paper introduces the general foundations and architecture for alert services on mobile devices that adapt incoming alert information to the profile and situation of user groups and even individual users. The approach is scalable for different communitycentered warning systems. Its first applicability and community engagement effects are shown in the example of the community-centered public disaster alert system in Germany and a target group specific weather <b>hazard</b> <b>alert</b> <b>system,</b> KATWARN and WIND with currently over 2. 5 million subscribed users, which was developed by the authors...|$|E

We use a recently-developed airspace encounter model to analyze intruder line-of-sight rate behavior prior to near miss. We look at a simple <b>hazard</b> <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> that <b>alerts</b> whenever the line-of-sight rate drops below some set threshold. Simulations demonstrate that such an approach, regardless of the chosen threshold, leads to frequent false alerts. We explain how the problem of <b>hazard</b> <b>alerting</b> can also be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and show how such an approach significantly decreases the false alert rate.

40|$|The {{role of an}} <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> is to {{make the}} system {{operator}} (e. g., pilot) aware of an impending hazard or unsafe state so the hazard can be avoided or managed successfully. A review of 46 commercial aviation accidents (between 1998 and 2014) revealed that, {{in the vast majority of}} events, either the <b>hazard</b> was not <b>alerted</b> or relevant <b>hazard</b> <b>alerting</b> occurred but failed to aid the flight crew sufficiently. For this set of events, <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> failures were placed in one of five phases: Detection, Understanding, Action Selection, Prioritization, and Execution. This study also reviewed the evolution of <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> schemes in commercial aviation, which revealed naive assumptions about pilot reliability in monitoring flight path parameters; specifically, pilot monitoring was assumed to be more effective than it actually is.

40|$|This {{project is}} aimed at {{developing}} a flood <b>hazard</b> <b>alert</b> control <b>system</b> {{with the use of}} a microcontroller. The system comprises a microcontroller. three water level float sensors, two valves, a water pump and a siren. The system enables flood water to be diverted to two alternative channels with the use of two valves. The pump is activated once the water level exceeds the predetermined limit. The siren will be activated in a critical condition when both channels are full and the system is unable to cope with the flood water. It signals evacuation for people in order to minimise loss of lives and properties. The function of the microcontroller enables the system to operate automatically without the use of computer and manpower. The water level float sensor is the input for the system to activate the ouput which is the water pump, the valves and siren. Water flow analysis is done to determine the time and volume of water flowing through the system. It is recommended that the system to be upgraded with ultrasonic water level sensors and Short Message Service (SMS) alert if continuous monitoring of the water level is required...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an approach to}} designing <b>hazard</b> avoidance <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> based on a Markov decision process (MDP) model of the alerting process, and shows its benefits over standard design methods. One benefit of the MDP method is that it accounts for future decision opportunities when choosing {{whether or not to}} alert, or in determining resolution guidance. Another benefit is that it provides a means of modeling uncertain state information, such as knowledge about unmeasurable mode variables, so that decisions are more informed. A mode variable is an index for distinct types of behavior that a system exhibits at different times. For example, in many situations normal system behavior is safe, but rare deviations from the normal increase the likelihood of a harmful incident. Accurate modeling of mode information is needed to minimize <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> errors such as unnecessary or late alerts. The benefits of the method are illustrated with two alerting scenarios where a pair of aircraft must avoid collisions when passing one another. The first scenario has a fully observable state and the second includes an uncertain mode describing whether an intruder aircraft levels off safely above the evader or is in a hazardous blunder mode. In MDP theory, outcome preferences are described in terms of utilities of different state trajectories. In keeping with this, <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> requirements are stated {{in the form of a}} reward function. This is then used with probabilistic dynamic and sensor models to compute an alerting logic (policy) that maximizes expected utility. Performance comparisons are made between the MDP-based logics and alternate logics generated with current methods. It is found that in terms of traditional performance measures (incident rate and unnecessary alert rate), the MDP-based logic can meet or exceed that of alternate logics...|$|R

40|$|Postsecondary {{institutions}} have increasingly attempted to discover innovative methods to promote student engagement and persistence, thus combating student attrition. In recent years, {{the higher education}} landscape has been flooded with intervention strategies sourced in early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> that utilize technological components to encourage student connections to institutional support entities. Whether homegrown or commercially developed, early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> provide cost-effective means of bolstering student persistence while depleting limited financial resources. While early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> {{have the potential to}} be a useful and cost-effective tactic to provide students with platforms for connections to faculty, academic advisors, and support resources, their development and implementation provides challenges. This study was based on Tinto’s student development and Astin’s student engagement theories. The purpose of this study was to uncover and analyze student perceptions of early <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> usage as a retention tool, an area of research lacking depth. The entire undergraduate student enrollment (N = 21, 437) during the fall 2014 academic semester at East Carolina University was invited to complete an on-line survey requesting student opinions of campus utilization of the Starfish™ early <b>alert</b> <b>system.</b> A total of 4, 658 student responses were collected. A series of statistical tests were used to assess differences in student perceptions of early <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> usage.

Additionally, results of the analysis showed statistical significance indicating that early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> serve as conduits between students and the institution, impacting their educational satisfaction, motivation to seek resources, communication with campus officials, and overall sense of belonging. Results from this study offer implications and recommendations for administrators, faculty, and other key institutional decision-makers focused on utilizing early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> as a retention tool.

40|$|Cockpit <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> monitor {{potentially}} hazardous situations, {{both inside}} and outside the aircraft. When a hazard is projected to occur, the <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> displays <b>alerts</b> and/or command decisions to the pilot. However, pilots have been observed to not conform to <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> commands by delaying their response or by not following the automatic commands exactly. This non-conformance to the automatic <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> can reduce its benefit. Therefore, a need exists to understand the causes and effects of pilot non-conformance in order to develop automatic <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> whose commands the pilots are more likely to follow. These considerations were examined through flight simulator evaluations of the collision avoidance task during closely spaced parallel approaches. This task provided a useful case-study because the effects of non-conformance can be significant, given the time-critical nature of the task. A preliminary evaluation of <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> identified non-conformance in over 40 % of the cases and a corresponding drop in collision avoidance performance. A follow-on experiment found subjects' alerting and maneuver selection criteria were consistent with different strategies than those used by automatic systems, indicating the pilot may potentially disagree with the <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> if the pilot attempts to verify automatic alerts and commanded avoidance maneuvers. A final experiment found supporting automatic alerts with the explicit display of its underlying criteria resulted in more consistent subject reactions. In light of these experimental results, a general discussion of pilot non-conformance is provided. Contributing factors in pilot non-conformance include a lack of confidence in the automatic system and mismatches between the <b>alerting</b> <b>system's</b> commands and the pilots' own decisions based on the information available to them. The effects of non-conformance on system performance are discussed. Possible methods of reconciling mismatches are given, and design considerations for <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> which alleviate the problem of non-conformance are provided...|$|R
