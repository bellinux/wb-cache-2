25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as <b>drostanolone</b> propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Aside from 5α-reductase, {{aromatase}} may inactivate testosterone signaling in {{skeletal muscle}} and adipose tissue, so AAS that lack aromatase affinity, {{in addition to}} being free of the potential side effect of gynecomastia, might be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio in comparison. In addition, DHT is inactivated by high activity of 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle (and cardiac tissue), and AAS that lack affinity for 3α-HSD could similarly be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio (although perhaps also increased long-term cardiovascular risks). In accordance, DHT, mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT), and mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives like oxandrolone, oxymetholone, <b>drostanolone,</b> and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics.|$|E

2500|$|On July 24, 2014, it was {{announced}} that Diaz had signed a three-fight contract to return to the UFC. Diaz faced Anderson Silva on January 31, 2015 at UFC 183. He lost the fight by unanimous decision (46–49, 45–50, and 45–50). [...] A few days after the fight, the UFC revealed that Diaz had once again failed his post-fight drug test for marijuana metabolites, and Silva tested positive on January 9 for <b>drostanolone,</b> androstane, oxazepem, and temazepem in pre-fight drug screening. On August 13, after several reschedules, Silva's disciplinary hearing was held to decide on the subject. Silva's defense argued that a tainted sexual enhancement supplement was the root of the two failed tests for <b>drostanolone</b> and also appealed to mistakes in the NSAC testing procedures, pointing to a pair of drug tests, one on Jan 19 and one after the fight, which Silva passed. He admitted to using both temazepem and oxazepem, benzodiazepines, the night prior to the fight as therapy to control stress and help him sleep. Silva's team was unable to explain the presence of androsterone in the Jan 9 test. The commission rejected the defense and suspended him for one year retroactive to the date of the fight, as the current guidelines were not in effect {{at the time of the}} failed tests. Silva was also fined his full win bonus, as well as 30% of his show money, totaling $380,000. The result was overturned to a no contest.|$|E
2500|$|Natural AAS like {{testosterone}} and DHT {{and synthetic}} AAS are analogues {{of each other}} and are very similar structurally. For this reason, they have the capacity to bind to and be metabolized by the same enzymes. According to the intracellular metabolism explanation, the androgenic-to-anabolic ratio of a given AR agonist is based on its capacity to be transformed by the aforementioned enzymes in conjunction with the AR activity of any resulting products. As an example, whereas the AR activity of testosterone is greatly potentiated by local conversion via 5α-reductase into DHT in tissues where 5α-reductase is expressed, an AAS that is not metabolized by 5α-reductase or has already been 5α-reduced, such as DHT itself or a derivative (like mesterolone or <b>drostanolone),</b> would not experience such potentiation in said tissues. Moreover, nandrolone is metabolized by 5α-reductase, but unlike the case of testosterone and DHT, the 5α-reduced metabolite of nandrolone has much lower affinity for the AR than does nandrolone itself, and this results in reduced AR activation in 5α-reductase-expressing tissues. As so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues such as skin/hair follicles and reproductive tissues are very high in 5α-reductase expression, while skeletal muscle is virtually devoid of 5α-reductase, this may primarily explain the high myotrophic-androgenic ratio and dissociation seen with nandrolone, as well as with various other AAS.|$|E
50|$|Many bodybuilders combine <b>drostanolone</b> {{with other}} AAS. <b>Drostanolone</b> itself is only weakly anabolic, {{which is why}} it is not used alone during bulking cycles. However, when {{combined}} with other anabolic steroids, <b>drostanolone</b> may enhance their effects. Also, <b>drostanolone</b> binds sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) which usually will bind a portion of free sex hormones and steroids, like testosterone, and inactivate them. When <b>drostanolone</b> binds to SHBG, the level of unbound SHBG drops, lowering the chance of it binding to other steroids, which increases their bioavailablilty.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Drostanolone</b> (INN), {{also known}} as dromostanolone, is an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS). It {{is a part of}} the {{dihydrotestosterone}} (DHT) group of AAS. <b>Drostanolone</b> itself has never been marketed; it is instead used as the ester prodrug <b>drostanolone</b> propionate (brand names Masteron, Drolban). Its main medical uses (as <b>drostanolone</b> propionate) include lowering cholesterol levels and as an antineoplastic agent [...] in the treatment of some cancers.|$|E
50|$|With the {{development}} of more precise treatment approaches, <b>drostanolone</b> as an antitumor agent is being replaced by medicaments with lower virilization risk and reduced side effects. However, <b>drostanolone</b> remains popular amongst bodybuilders, especially during cutting cycles, when fat loss is the main target. It should be emphasized that <b>drostanolone</b> will be only effective if the user's body fat percentage is already low (<10%). If this is the case, <b>drostanolone</b> will not only help with the last stubborn bit of fat, but will also improve the physique, making it appear harder and leaner by underlining muscle separation. This makes <b>drostanolone</b> popular for pre-contest cycles. These effects of <b>drostanolone</b> are due to its inability to aromatize into estrogen.|$|E
50|$|However, {{androgenic}} effects such as accelerated alopecia and acne can appear. In women, <b>drostanolone</b> {{can cause}} virilization {{when used in}} high doses. <b>Drostanolone</b> can also cause a decrease in HDL cholesterol {{and an increase in}} LDL cholesterol. As <b>drostanolone</b> also suppresses natural testosterone production, additional testosterone therapy and post-cycle therapy should be considered.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drostanolone</b> {{propionate}} (BAN) (brand names Masteron, Drolban, others), {{also known}} as dromostanolone propionate (USAN), as well as 2α-methyl-4,5α-dihydrotestosterone, is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and the propionate ester of <b>drostanolone.</b> It is incapable of aromatization and has similar properties to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has been successfully used to treat breast cancer, {{but because of the}} high risk of virilization, options with better tolerability are usually prescribed instead. <b>Drostanolone</b> propionate is not orally active, and must be administered instead via intramuscular injection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drostanolone</b> binds to the {{androgen}} receptor and activates {{a cascade of}} genetic changes, which increases the protein synthesis (anabolism) and decreases the amino acids degradation (catabolism). Other effects of <b>drostanolone</b> are reduction or inhibition of prolactin or estrogen receptors, which are linked to its antitumor properties.|$|E

50|$|Bolazine (INN), {{also known}} as 2α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one azine, is a {{synthetic}} anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) of the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) group that was never marketed. It is not orally active and is used as the ester prodrug bolazine capronate (brand name Roxilon Inject) via depot intramuscular injection. Bolazine has a unique and unusual chemical structure, being a dimer of <b>drostanolone</b> linked at the C3 position of the A-ring by an azine group, and reportedly acts as a prodrug of <b>drostanolone.</b>|$|E

50|$|In addition, <b>drostanolone</b> is also {{suitable}} for those following calories restricted regime as it increases strength, reduces recovery periods and improves endurance without weight gain.|$|E
50|$|As <b>drostanolone</b> {{does not}} aromatize at any dose, typical estrogen-linked side effects {{encountered}} when using other anabolic steroids, like water retention, gynecomastia, and elevated blood pressure are not observed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drostanolone,</b> {{also known}} as 2α-methyl-5α-dihydrotestosterone (2α-methyl-DHT) or as 2α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} androstane steroid and a derivative of DHT. It is specifically DHT with a methyl group at the C2α position.|$|E

50|$|Hormonal {{treatment}} {{is part of}} the complex therapy for some kind of tumors, particularly the ones associated with hormone-active tissues like breast or prostate cancer. Some types of breast cancer cells, expressing estrogen receptors (called ER+ cancers), use estrogen for their growth and dissemination. That is why drugs that block estrogen receptors or decrease their expression on the cell membrane- anti-estrogens- could limit the tumor spread and size. <b>Drostanolone</b> has been FDA approved as an anti-estrogenic drug for the treatment of breast cancer. By the time of its release, there were not many alternatives for patients suffering from breast cancer and <b>drostanolone</b> was a revolution for these patients. As it has lower androgenic rate compared to testosterone, the risk of virilization is much lighter. Due to this fact, women, who usually do not respond well to any anabolic steroids, were having much greater chance to survive cancer. <b>Drostanolone</b> can also be used for breast tumors that do not respond well to other treatments or also as palliative care for advanced incurable tumors. The effects of the product depend of course on the dose and period of administration. The risk of virilization becomes greater with high doses and continuous administration period.|$|E
