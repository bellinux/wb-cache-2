40|$|Hydropower is {{the largest}} {{renewable}} energy source available in today's society. Operation and production is handled by high-tech electronics. This thesis is done on behalf of Statkraft Sweden AB who wants to explore the possibility of replacing the hydraulic cylinder with an electric actuator, generally {{as well as a}} case of a small power station on the river Nissan. Whether it is the chaplain or francis turbine vanes are actuated by hydraulic cylinders. Because of Gustavsberg hydropower is inconstant operation, this report is based on power calculations, which are read and computed according to the available <b>hydraulic</b> <b>diagram.</b> With the system operating pressure of 100 bars determined that the hydraulic cylinder on Gustavsberg power stations is sized for a force of 143 kN. Based on this force, it has committed to fit a suitable modular actuator from SKF. Electric motor is determined according to actuator screw parameters which are implemented in MATLAB to find out which torque is needed to power the actuator. Two options are suitable for the application. One is the complete drive packages from SKF with AC servo motor and controller to this, the other is asynchronous motor from the appropriate manufacturer such as ABB, together with drives from the same manufacturer. Since the actuator will not work more than twice an hour, there will be needed holding torque for the actuator to maintain its position. Holding torque is achieved easiest with an inverse function of the mechanical disc brake. This can be applied both during operation of the servo motor or asynchronous motor. Security is key in a hydroelectric power station thereof demands on the components involved in the closure of the turbine. In the current situation the power station is equipped with two independent systems to shut off the turbine at degraded situations as power failure or fire. The first system consists of the UPS device, the other is a counterweight at 2600 kg. This thesis makes the assumption that the UPS system has fallen away {{and the only thing that}} remains is the counterweight. The counterweight issued to turn the vanes if the hydraulic system loses pressure. In degraded situations problems occur with actuator when the actuator backwards runs due to the influence of guide rails and counterweights force. To solve this problem it has been developed three solutions suggested methods. Regenerative braking is most appropriate when the actuator is driven by servomotor. Industrial damper or modification of the actuator is possible to implement regardless of the operation of the servo motor or asynchronous motor.

The most important of the FTC characteristics were calculated and plotted on a diagram, which is called the <b>hydraulic</b> efficiency <b>diagram</b> (HED). Using the HED it was shown that the hydraulic efficiency of the tank improves by placing the inlet slot away from the mid-depth, either {{close to the surface}} or preferably close to the bottom. Hydraulic efficiency improves further by the use of inlet deflectors, whose position (distance and submersion) is not very critical provided that die deflectors are effective and divert the incoming jet towards the bottom.

40|$|Most pedotransfer {{functions}} (PTFs) {{have adopted}} soil texture information {{as the main}} predictor to estimate soil hydraulic properties, whether inputs are {{defined in terms of}} the relative proportion of different grain size particles or texture-based classifications. The objective of this studywas to develop ternary diagrams for estimating soil water retention (θ) at− 33 and− 1500 kPa matric potentials, corresponding to the field capacity and wilting point, respectively, from particle size distribution using two geostatistical approaches. The texture triangle was divided into a 1 % grid of soil texture composition resulting in 4332 different soil textures. Measured soil water retention values determined in 742 soil horizons/layers located in Portugal were then used to develop and validate the <b>hydraulic</b> ternary <b>diagrams.</b> The development subset included two-thirds of the data, and the validation subset the remaining samples. The measured soil water content values were displayed in the ternary diagram according to the coordinates given by the particles size distribution determined in the same soil samples. The volumetric water content values were then predicted for the entire ternary diagram using two different geostatistical interpolation algorithms (ordinary kriging and the empirical best linear unbiased predictor). Uncertainty analysis resulted in a root mean square error below 0. 040 and 0. 034 cm 3 cm− 3 when comparing the interpolated water contents at − 33 and − 1500 kPa matric potential values, respectively, with the measured ones included in the validation dataset. The estimation variance calculated with both methods was also considered to access the uncertainty of the predictions. The available water content of Portuguese soils was then derived from θ− 33 kPa and θ− 1500 kPa ternary diagrams developed with both approaches. The <b>hydraulic</b> ternary <b>diagrams</b> may thus serve as simplified tools for estimating water retention properties from particle size distribution and eventually serve {{as an alternative to the}} traditional statistical regression and data mining techniques used to derive PTFsinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|The study {{presented}} in this manuscript investigates the patterns that describe reliability of water distribution networks focusing to the node connectivity, energy balance, and economics of construction, operation and maintenance. A number of measures to evaluate the network resilience has been developed and assessed to arrive at more accurate diagnostics of regular and irregular demand scenarios. These measures have been proposed {{as a part of}} the methodology for snap-shot assessment of network reliability based on its configuration and hydraulic performance. Practical outcome of the research is the decision support tool for reliability-based design of water distribution networks. This computer package named NEDRA (NEtwork Design and Reliability Assessment) consists of the modules for network generation, filtering, initialisation, optimisation, diagnostics and cost calculation, which can be used for sensitivity analyses of single network layout or assessments of multiple layouts. The study concludes that none of the analysed aspects develops clear singular patterns. Nevertheless, the proposed network buffer index (NBI) and the <b>hydraulic</b> reliability <b>diagram</b> (HRD) as visual representation of the network resilience give sufficient snap-shot pointing the composition of the index value, and displaying possible weak points in the network that can be hidden behind the averaged values of various reliability measures.

40|$|In {{one-dimensional}} river modelling it {{is common}} to schematise the cross-section into a rectangular cross-section with a constant width. If a quasi-steady flow is assumed, the equilibrium longitudinal profile is known and unique: the bottom slope is constant and equals the water surface slope. However, numerical calculations at DELFT HYDRAULICS suggest that for rivers with a composite cross-section more equilibrium longitudinal profiles can exist. In addition, it appears that a stable curved equilibrium can exist. As an example, a river with floodplains can be mentioned to have a composite crosssection. This report contains a study on the equilibrium longitudinal profiles of rivers with a composite cross-section. In order to calculate these profiles, and their stability, three different models are applied to a schematised river. Calculations are done both analytically and numerically, and all results are visualized in phase <b>diagrams.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|This study {{comprises}} {{the design of}} the reconstruction of the main breakwater of the Tripoli Harbour in Libya. Tripoli harbour {{is one of the oldest}} harbours of North Africa situated on the Southern coast of Mediterranean Sea. The harbour as it existed in 1972 was built at the beginning of this century and was protected by two main breakwaters. The original construction of these main breakwaters dates back to the Spaniards. The main breakwater on the North, known as the Spanish Mole, extended some 1900 m East North-East. A special feature of the harbour was the existence of a line of reefs north of the main breakwater about 100 m on the sea side, working as natural protection from wave attack. In the sixties, the increasing oil-based economic resources of Libya necessitated an expansion of the port facilities. Sir Bruce White, Wolfe Barry & Partners submitted a design of the breakwater locating the new breakwater some 100 m seaward from the Spanish Mole. The main breakwater was designed to be constructed in two stages; stage 1 B, 2190 m long with a backfill (built 1972 - 1976, see Figure 2) and stage 2 A, 2520 m long without any backfill (built 1974 - 1980). Significant wave heights of 4 and 4. 5 m were adopted for the design of stages 1 B and 2 A respectively which were based on certain wave data available up to 1971 and 1975. Already during construction it became evident that the breakwater would not fulfil its design criteria. Two major storms in 1981 with a significant wave height of 9. 2 m destroyed large parts of the breakwater. In deep-water sections (over 7 m deep) almost all wave walls were broken and a large part of the 19 -ton tetrapods damaged in the actual situation (see Figure 4). The direct hinterland of the breakwater is left at the mercy of overtopping water and spray. The two main roads on the landfill were completely eroded by overtopping and venting water. Netherlands Engineering Consultants (NEDECO) made a complete redesign of the breakwater in 1982 after the breakwater failure (see Figure 3). Meanwhile, during the last 16 years, extreme storms have further deteriorated the breakwater. Frequent nuisance of overtopping water and spray is no exception. The Harbour Authorities have asked for a complete evaluation and modification of the 1982 NEDECO design, because some criteria and boundary conditions have been changed significantly. In this study the new redesign criteria have been determined and based on these criteria a proposal for reconstruction has been worked out. The complete study of the Tripoli Breakwater reconstruction has been divided into four parts. These are: 1. Preliminary Investigations and Data Collection 2. Update Environmental Conditions 3. Preliminary Design 4. Optimization of the Reconstruction Design The approach used in the different sections is further described below and presented in a <b>diagram.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
