5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism.|$|E
25|$|Endocrinology is {{a branch}} of {{medicine}} dealing with disorders of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> and its specific secretions called hormones.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Chandler McCuskey Brooks (December 18, 1905-November 29, 1989) was an American {{physiologist}} {{notable for}} {{his research on}} {{the relationships between the}} central nervous and <b>endocrine</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
25|$|Affects {{skeletal}} {{and smooth}} muscle {{as well as}} the eye, heart, <b>endocrine</b> <b>system,</b> and central nervous system; clinical findings, which span a continuum from mild to severe, have been categorized into three somewhat overlapping phenotypes: mild, classic, and congenital.|$|E
25|$|Hormones are {{the major}} {{signaling}} molecules of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system,</b> though they often regulate each other's secretion via local signaling (e.g. islet of Langerhans cells), and most are also expressed in tissues for local purposes (e.g. angiotensin) or failing that, structurally related molecules are (e.g. PTHrP).|$|E
25|$|In the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system,</b> Anahata is {{associated}} with the thymus gland, located in the chest. This gland produces T-cells, that combat disease, and bring equilibrium to the body. The functioning of the thymus is greatest before puberty and is impaired by the appearance of sex hormones in the blood stream from puberty onwards.|$|E

25|$|The kidney {{participates in}} whole-body homeostasis, {{regulating}} acid-base balance, electrolyte concentrations, extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure. The kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and {{in concert with}} other organs, particularly those of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system.</b> Various endocrine hormones coordinate these endocrine functions; these include renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide, among others.|$|E
25|$|An insect’s sensory, {{motor and}} {{physiological}} processes {{are controlled by}} {{the central nervous system}} along with the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system.</b> Being the principal division of the nervous system, it consists of a brain, a ventral nerve cord and a subesophageal ganglion which is connected to the brain by two nerves, extending around each side of the oesophagus.|$|E
25|$|Cells {{have evolved}} methods to {{perceive}} {{and respond to}} their microenvironment, thereby enhancing their adaptability. Cell signaling coordinates cellular activities, and hence governs the basic functions of multicellular organisms. Signaling between cells can occur through direct cell contact using juxtacrine signalling, or indirectly through the exchange of agents as in the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system.</b> In more complex organisms, coordination of activities can occur through a dedicated nervous system.|$|E
50|$|A second {{proposed}} {{framework for}} categorizing knowledge dimensions distinguishes embedded {{knowledge of a}} system outside of a human individual (e.g., an information system may have knowledge embedded into its design) from embodied knowledge representing a learned capability of a human body's nervous and <b>endocrine</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{is influenced by}} cardiac output, total peripheral resistance and arterial stiffness and varies depending on situation, emotional state, activity, and relative health/disease states. In the short term it is regulated by baroreceptors which act via the brain to influence nervous and <b>endocrine</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hypothalamic {{disease is}} a {{disorder}} presenting primarily in the hypothalamus, which {{may be caused by}} damage resulting from malnutrition, including anorexia and bulimia eating disorders, genetic disorders, radiation, surgery, head trauma, lesion, tumour or other physical injury to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is the control center for several <b>endocrine</b> functions. <b>Endocrine</b> <b>systems</b> controlled by the hypothalamus are regulated by anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, growth hormone-releasing hormone, oxytocin, all of which are secreted by the hypothalamus. Damage to the hypothalamus may impact any of these hormones and the related <b>endocrine</b> <b>systems.</b> Many of these hypothalamic hormones act on the pituitary gland. Hypothalamic disease therefore affects the functioning of the pituitary and the target organs controlled by the pituitary, including the adrenal glands, ovaries and testes, and the thyroid gland.|$|R
25|$|Thyronamines are {{molecular}} derivatives of {{the thyroid}} hormone {{and are very}} important for <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> function. 3-Iodothyronamine (T1AM) is the most potent TAAR1 agonist yet discovered, although it lacks monoamine transporter affinity and therefore has little effect in monoamine neurons of the central nervous system. Activation of TAAR1 by T1AM results {{in the production of}} large amounts of cAMP. This effect is coupled with decreased body temperature and cardiac output.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ovaries}} are removed, {{a woman is}} at a seven times greater risk of {{cardiovascular}} disease, but the mechanisms are not precisely known. The hormone production of the ovaries currently cannot be sufficiently mimicked by drug therapy. The ovaries produce hormones a woman needs throughout her entire life, in the quantity they are needed, {{at the time they}} are needed, in response to and as part of the complex <b>endocrine</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 2 (above; left), notch {{acts as a}} {{receptor}} for ligands that are expressed on adjacent cells. While some receptors are cell surface proteins, others are found inside cells. For example, estrogen is a hydrophobic molecule that can pass through the lipid bilayer of the membranes. As part of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system,</b> intracellular estrogen receptors {{from a variety of}} cell types can be activated by estrogen produced in the ovaries.|$|E

25|$|Hormones {{play a role}} in the {{establishment}} of dominance hierarchies among P. gallicus. Dominant females tend to have more developed ovaries due to higher activity levels in their <b>endocrine</b> <b>systems.</b> A larger corpora allata also influences the determination of dominance.

25|$|Iron overload: People with {{thalassemia}} {{can get an}} overload of iron {{in their}} bodies, either from the disease itself or from frequent blood transfusions. Too much iron can result in damage to the heart, liver, and <b>endocrine</b> <b>system,</b> which includes glands that produce hormones that regulate processes throughout the body. The damage is characterized by excessive deposits of iron. Without adequate iron chelation therapy, almost all patients with beta-thalassemia accumulate potentially fatal iron levels.|$|E
25|$|Clinical studies {{consistently}} {{conclude that}} morphine, like other opioids, often causes hypogonadism and hormone imbalances in chronic users of both sexes. This side effect is dose-dependent and occurs in both therapeutic and recreational users. Morphine {{can interfere with}} menstruation in women by suppressing levels of luteinizing hormone. Many studies suggest the majority (perhaps as much as 90%) of chronic opioid users have opioid-induced hypogonadism. This effect may cause the increased likelihood of osteoporosis and bone fracture observed in chronic morphine users. Studies suggest the effect is temporary. , the effect of low-dose or acute use of morphine on the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition {{and being}} {{underweight}} {{are more common}} in the elderly than in adults of other ages. If elderly people are healthy and active, the aging process alone does not usually cause malnutrition. However, changes in body composition, organ functions, adequate energy intake and ability to eat or access food are associated with aging, and may contribute to malnutrition. Sadness or depression can play a role, causing changes in appetite, digestion, energy level, weight, and well-being. A study on the relationship between malnutrition and other conditions in the elderly found that malnutrition in the elderly can result from gastrointestinal and <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> disorders, loss of taste and smell, decreased appetite and inadequate dietary intake. Poor dental health, ill-fitting dentures, or chewing and swallowing problems can make eating difficult. As a result of these factors, malnutrition is seen to develop more easily in the elderly.|$|E
50|$|A Canadian study {{studying}} {{the effect of}} A. flos-aquae on the immune and <b>endocrine</b> <b>systems,</b> {{as well as on}} general blood physiology, found that eating it {{had a profound effect on}} natural killer cells (NKCs). A. flos-aquae triggers the movement of 40% of the circulating NKCs from the blood to tissues.|$|R
