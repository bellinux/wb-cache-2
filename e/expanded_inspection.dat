All the firms with <b>expanded</b> <b>inspection</b> reports, which included 107 inspections as of December 18, 2011 were included in the survey. The issues that were most common that were not resolved included issues related to audit performance. The seven most common issues were: 1. Technical competency, due care, and professional skepticism (firms with issue, 59, 55. 1 %); 2. Auditor Communications (firms with issue, 45, 42. 1 %); 3. Concurring Partner Review (firms with issue, 43, 40. 2 %); 4. Appropriate Procedures (firms with issue, 21, 19. 6 %); 5. Fraud Procedures (firms with issue, 16, 14. 9 %); 6. Engagement Completion Document (firms with issue, 12, 11. 2 %); and 7. Testing Appropriate to the Audit (firms with issue, 12, 11. 2 %) The limitations of disclosure, including the agreement to maintain confidentiality of certain issues by the firms, precludes providing conclusions about the status of quality control in registered public accounting firms. The question that cannot be answered is: “Has the PCAOB’s strategy for the inspection of quality controls and the nonpublic disclosure of extent of issues identified resulted in significant improvement in quality controls in registered firms?” There is need for empirical, objective research to determine the effectiveness of the PCAOB’s strategy in enhancing audit quality. Within a year (of March 2012), the PCAOB will have completed a decade of oversight. To date, there has been no publicly revealed evidence of achievements...|$|E

40|$|Quality is {{becoming}} more important instrument of competition in industry of technology. A product with decent quality sells well {{in the market and}} increases the image of the company. In addition the quality increases profitability. The aim of this work is to design an automated quality inspection gate before test run. Quality inspection is already conducted by a human worker but objective is to <b>expand</b> quality <b>inspection</b> with a robot and smart camera. The work presents different kind of inspection systems from manufacturing industry. The system requires a robot in order that a smart camera can be moved easily and all camera angles can be reached. The system could be designed to be part of manual quality gate and that’s why this work presents light weight robots which can co-operate with a human without external safety equipment. One of the objectives is also to find which features are important and how they could be inspected automatically...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its recall efforts, a new global quality committee to coordinate defect analysis and future recall announcements was announced by Toyota in early 2010, along with a Swift Market Analysis Response Team ("SMART") in the U.S. to conduct on-site vehicle <b>inspections,</b> <b>expanded</b> Event Data Recorder usage and readers, third-party quality consultation, and increased driver safety education initiatives. Industry analysts noted that the recall response was a challenge for The Toyota Way manufacturing philosophy, because the recalled parts were not due to factory errors or quality control problems, but rather to design issues leading to consumer complaints. As a result, better communication of consumer issues with management was needed, and so the global quality committee aimed to be more responsive to consumer concerns.|$|R
40|$|A {{composite}} laminate is layers of fibres of composite materials which are assembled to provide desired engineering properties. These {{have a wide}} range of application, especially in weight sensitive structures like aircraft, spacecraft. Laminated plates used in these structures are subjected to dynamic loads. These plates with numerous circular cut outs are either used to lessen the mass of the whole structure or to <b>expand</b> the <b>inspection.</b> The presence of cut outs in the plates changes the stress distribution of the plates and makes the analysis complex. When an external system vibrates has exactly the same natural frequency as the internal system, resonance follows producing considerable deflections. Specific plans can minimise these unnecessary failures. Hence the analysis of the modal characteristics of these plates is significant. First an isotropic circular plate’s behaviour is studied and then a circular orthotropic plate has been considered for this study. The material properties have been fixed. The natural frequencies have been computed for different boundary condition, hole-radius ratio, and thickness to radius ratio, and fibre orientation, asymmetric and symmetric holes. The effects of these variables on the nature of vibration have been analysed and discussed. ANSYS 13. 0 is used for the computation of natural frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{accelerated}} corrosion (FAC) {{phenomenon has}} persisted {{its impact on}} plant reliability and personnel safety. Unless we change the operation condition drastically, most parameters affecting FAC will not be effectively controlled. In order to help <b>expand</b> piping <b>inspection</b> coverage, we have developed a screening approach to monitor the wall thinning by direct current potential drop (DCPD) technique. To improve the applicability to the complex piping network such as the secondary cooling water system in PWR's, we devised the equipotential control method that can eliminate undesired leakage currents outside a measurement section. In this paper, we present Wide Range Monitoring (WiRM) and Narrow Range Monitoring (NaRM) with Equipotential Switching Direct Current Potential Drop (ES-DCPD) method to rapidly monitor the thinning of piping. Based on the WiRM results, susceptible locations can be identified for further inspection by ultrasound technique (UT). On-line monitoring of a thinned location {{can be made by}} NaRM. Finite element analysis results and a closed-form resistance model are developed for the comparison with measured wall thinning by the developed DCPD technique. Verification experiments were conducted using UT as the reference. The result shows that model predictions and the experimental results agree well to confirm that both WiRM and NaRM based on ES-DCPD can be applicable to FAC management efforts...|$|R
50|$|The Association grew rapidly though, because of, {{among other}} reasons, the {{increasing}} legal pressure on factory owners {{to make their}} workplaces safer for their employees. Thus, in 1876, the Association was able to report that it had almost doubled its number of inspection visits in only two years. Said legal pressure resulted mainly in the July 2, 1899 and March 10, 1900 laws on safety and health. Robert Vinçotte was heavily involved in the drafting of these laws as, by then, he had a huge experience in the relatively new area of reliability engineering: not only had he led the Association for more than 25 years, but he had also made an important study visit to the United States in 1881, a trip {{that resulted in a}} series of basic mathematical rules for the reliability of steam boilers. Its success allowed the Association in 1887 to offer its employees a life insurance payable upon retirement.In 1905 the Association <b>expanded</b> its <b>inspection</b> domain, due to the advent of electrical devices and installations. Steam boilers would remain its main area of operation {{for some time to come}} though: in 1910 it inspected more boilers than the combined inspection organisations of Germany and France, respectively. But the First World War would put a halt to the Association's growth: not only did the latter refuse to inspect German-controlled installations, but a great number of its engineers were drafted into army service. This bleak period did not pass with the end of the war: 1919 and 1920 brought massive inflation and attendant high wage costs. This combined with the death of Robert Vinçotte Jr., son of the founder and the director of the Association at the time.|$|R
40|$|The California State Water Resources Control Board (State Board) {{originally}} {{issued a}} National Pollutant Discharge System (NPDES) permit for storm water discharges associated with construction activities in 1992. This NPDES permit was issued {{as a general}} permit, applicable throughout the state (with certain exceptions). The general construction permit was made site-specific by a discharger-developed Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). As with most NPDES construction storm water permits, monitoring requirements were limited to inspections. Sampling and analysis of discharges was not specifically required, but a Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Board) could require additional monitoring. In 1999, the State -Board revised and reissued its construction general permit. While the 1999 permit significantly enhanced the erosion and sediment control descriptions and requirements, and <b>expanded</b> the <b>inspection</b> program, sampling and analysis was still not required. Environmental advocacy groups took exception {{to the absence of}} sampling requirements and sought relief in court to add sampling and analysis. In 2001, the State Board in response to the court order adopted a resolution requiring sampling and analysis of construction site runoff under two conditions. Turbidity and/or sediment sampling is required when construction site runoff enters water bodies determined to impaired for sediment or turbidity. Sampling for non-visible pollutants is required when construction operations expose materials to storm water. Sampling construction site runoff is relatively new concept for NPDES permits. Only a few permits throughout the country require sampling and analysis for sediment-related pollutants, and California is one of the only permitting entities to require sampling for non-visible pollutants in construction site runoff. The added complexity of sampling runoff requires construction operators and erosion and sediment control professionals to expand their skill set. The bottom line of the new California sampling and analysis requirements is a renewed emphasis on erosion and sediment control as well as proper materials management. In the instance of the non-visible pollutants, the requirements provide incentives for projects that eliminate exposure of construction materials management by reducing sampling requirements...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{in the development of}} business strategies. Consequently, transport activities come under particular attention due to its significant role in economic development process and its impacts on the environment. Achieving sustainability in transport sector becomes more challenging given the growing demand for any kind of transport activities. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the Iranian transport sector’s sustainability barriers, and evaluate the efficiency of implemented policies and strategies in order to identify the potentials of improvement. For this purpose, an overview of the country and its transport sector in terms of energy consumption and pollutant emissions, which are two main recognized sustainability issues in Iran, will be discussed at first. Then, sustainability barriers are identified. To that end, the case study approach is used, and data are collected through documents analysis and interviewing transport planning and environment management experts. Then, the detected policies and strategies and their efficiency are discussed using the view point of transport and environment management experts by Delphi technique. The research revealed that the growing rate and the age of road vehicle fleet, outdated manufacturing standards, wasteful consumption patterns, traffic and inefficiency of public transport system are the main obstacles in the way of achieving a sustainable transport system in Iran. In addition, according to the viewpoint of experts, renovating deteriorated passenger cars, obligatory vehicle <b>inspections,</b> <b>expanding</b> subway system in metropolitans, renovating public transport vehicles and motivating private sector for investment in public transport were policies who considered having better performance. It is concluded that a sustainable transport system in Iran will be achieved only in case of changing the vehicle production and fuel consumption patterns. Also passenger travel and freight distribution should be shifted to other transport mode...|$|R
