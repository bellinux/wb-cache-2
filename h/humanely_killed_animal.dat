30|$|The acute {{administration}} of pequi peel extract at 5000  mg/Kg produced lethality in {{three out of}} five animals within the first 48  h after dosing.

40|$|When {{the fungus}} Stachybotrys chartarum is inhaled, its mycotoxins may cause lung injury and inflammation. The {{severity}} of human responses to S. chartarum in both occupational and home settings varies widely. To explore these differences, we intratracheally instilled C 3 H/HeJ, BALB/c, and C 57 BL/ 6 J mice with S. chartarum spores suspended in saline. One day later, the mice were <b>humanely</b> <b>killed,</b> bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, and biochemical and cellular indicators of lung injury and inflammation were measured. BALB/c mice showed the highest myeloperoxidase activity, albumin and hemoglobin levels, and neutrophil numbers in their BAL {{among the three}} strains.

40|$|PURPOSE. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} ways to improve qualitative and quantitative assessments of retinal vessels and neovascularization (NV). METHODS. At postnatal day (P) 17, mice with oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy were injected intravitreously with one of a variety of FITC-labeled or unlabeled antibodies and <b>humanely</b> <b>killed</b> 12 hours later. Retinas were flat mounted (retinas from eyes injected with labeled antibodies) or incubated with secondary antibody and then flat mounted (retinas from eyes injected with unlabeled antibodies). RESULTS. Retinas from eyes injected with labeled anti-platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM 1) showed good resolution of the fine structure of retinal NV, including filopodia at the tips of sprouts. New vessels originated from superficial retinal vessels, something that is widely recognized, bu...|$|R

With no time to prepare a vaccine, the Judges' only hope is to intercept all the infected agents, but they fail to, and during their investigation Judge Roake is killed by an enemy agent. As the disease is incurable and causes outbursts of extreme violence in those infected, a senior judge, Judge Vass, proposes that the hundreds of affected people already quarantined should be <b>humanely</b> <b>killed</b> and buried outside the city. However Chief Judge Francisco is horrified and vetoes the idea.|$|R

The committee was worried that when the government will need to ration food, pet owners would decide to split their rations with their pets or leave their pets to starve. In response to that fear, NARPAC published a pamphlet titled [...] "Advice to Animal Owners." [...] The pamphlet suggested moving pets from the big cities and into the countryside. It concluded with the statement that [...] "If you cannot place them in the care of neighbours, it really is kindest to have them destroyed." [...] The pamphlet also contained an advertisement for a pistol that could be used to <b>humanely</b> <b>kill</b> pets.|$|R

30|$|All the {{experimental}} designs {{in this study}} were approved by the Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of University Putra Malaysia (UPM/IACUC/AUP-R 028 / 2015). The preliminary study used ten (n[*]=[*] 10) and seventy one (n[*]=[*] 71) rat cadavers of 30  weeks and 8  weeks old respectively. The cadaver rats were <b>humanely</b> <b>killed</b> for other experiments following the guidelines of the AICUC. The fracture was induced using the three-point bending pliers as described below. In the in vivo study, a total of twenty five (n[*]=[*] 25), 8  weeks old female Sprague-Dawley rats with an average weight of 187.04 [*]±[*] 10.15  g were used. An acclimatization period of one week was allowed before the experiment started. The rats were starved for 12  h prior to surgery following the acclimatization period.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. Hormone {{diseases}} induce {{changes in}} the lacrimal gland (LG) and ocular surface (OS). Thyroid hormone (TH) induces cell proliferation and lipid metabolism through the activation of TH receptors. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the location and comparative expression of TH receptor �- 1 (Thrb) in LG of rats with hypothyroidism and in controls and to evaluate the impact of this disease on LG and OS structure and function. METHODS. Hypothyroidism was induced in Wistar male rats by the long-term use of tiamazole. Ten weeks later corneal cells were collected for impression cytology (IC). Rats were <b>humanely</b> <b>killed,</b> and tissues were evaluated by immunoperoxidase staining and Western blot for Thrb.

5000|$|A paper {{published}} by Jeff Lines {{and his collaborators}} in 2003 announced that stunning trout for 60 seconds in an electric field of 250 V/m r.m.s. with a sinusoidal waveform of 1,000 Hz rendered them permanently unconscious without degrading meat quality. A stunning system, called HS1, has been developed in accordance with Lines' study. The system first stuns fish and then keeps them unconscious, through electronarcosis, until death. The machine has been widely adopted in the UK, precessing an estimated 80% of all UK trout killed for meat. [...] According to the Humane Slaughter Association's James Kirkwood: [...] "Before ten years ago {{there was no way}} to <b>humanely</b> <b>kill</b> farmed fish en masse - they died slowly through suffocation when harvested from the water.
