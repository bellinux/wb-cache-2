5|$|During the War of the Roses between 1455 and 1485, fought by {{the rival}} <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> the Lancastrians and the Yorkists, Conwy was reinforced, but played little {{part in the}} fighting.

For his part in the battle he was appointed a Field Crown Hetman, and became the starost of Hrubieszów.|$|E
5|$|The eleven electors were {{relatively}} evenly {{divided between the}} <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> Colonna and Orsini, two powerful Roman families, led by Giacomo Colonna and Matteo Orsini, respectively. The three Orsini cardinals were pro-French and pro-Angevin, while the two Colonna cardinals supported competing Aragonese claims in Sicily. James II of Aragon had bankrolled the Colonna faction with gold, but it is unknown whether simony actually transpired.|$|E

The leftist <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. Hamas gained {{the majority of the}} open seats in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the emperor}} was absent from a court conference but sought its advice, he {{relied on the}} {{chancellor}} to direct it and inform him of the resulting majority opinion. If the attending ministers were split into opposing <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> roughly equal size, the chancellor would listen to the positions of both sides and count {{the exact number of}} ministers who supported either opposing opinion.|$|E
5|$|While the war {{was still}} being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician, {{bringing}} together—and holding together—all the main <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> the Republican Party, and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party.|$|E

50|$|In the 2002 Ukrainian {{parliamentary}} election Dobkin was elected People's Deputy of Ukraine.

5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce {{spent the first}} few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|Antoninus Pius soon {{reversed}} the containment policy {{of his predecessor}} Hadrian, and Urbicus was ordered to begin the reconquest of Lowland Scotland by moving north. Between 139 and 140 he rebuilt a fort at Corbridge and by 142 or 143, commemorative coins were issued celebrating a victory in Britain. It is therefore likely that Urbicus led the reoccupation of southern Scotland , probably using the 2nd Augustan Legion. He evidently campaigned against several British tribes (possibly including <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> the northern Brigantes), certainly against the lowland tribes of Scotland, the Votadini and Selgovae of the Scottish Borders region, and the Damnonii of Strathclyde. His total force may have been about 16,500 men.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the perceived blasphemy, Akhtar declared it was his personal jihad to find {{those responsible for the}} packaging and destroy their professional status, personal life and the UK as a whole for having a culture allowing the insult to occur. This event, Akhtar's reaction and other similar issues with companies such as Nike and Unilever have been used by conservative political critics, such as James Joyner, claiming that western nations and organizations are kowtowing in too easily to Muslims' claims or threats and by commentators, including author Daniel C. Dennett, highlighting how <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> the Islamic faith gravitate towards iconoclasm.|$|E

5|$|Later in the century, {{a series}} of civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses broke out between the rival <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> the House of Lancaster and York. After the Battle of Northampton in 1460, Harlech formed a refuge for Queen Margaret of Anjou, and between 1461–68 it was held by her Lancastrian supporters, {{under the command of}} Dafydd ap Ieuan, against the Yorkist Edward IV. Thanks to its natural defences and the supply route by sea, Harlech held out and {{eventually}} became the last major stronghold still under Lancasterian control. It finally fell after a month's siege, the events credited with inspiring the song Men of Harlech.|$|E
5|$|Like the Italian and French Communist parties, the {{majority}} of the Communist Party of Finland denounced the occupation. Nonetheless, Finnish president Urho Kekkonen was the very first Western politician to officially visit Czechoslovakia after August 1968; he received the highest Czechoslovakian honours from the hands of President Ludvík Svoboda, on 4 October 1969. The Portuguese communist secretary-general Álvaro Cunhal was one of few political leaders from western Europe to have supported the invasion for being counter-revolutionary. along with the Luxembourg party and conservative <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> the Greek party.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Lima shared the turmoil caused by struggles between {{different}} <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> Spaniards. At {{the same time it}} gained prestige as it was designated capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543. Latin America and Lima's first university, the National University of San Marcos was established in 1551 and its first printing press in 1584.

5|$|Rural {{and urban}} cantons {{had the same}} {{standing}} in the federation. Each canton was sovereign within its territory, pursuing its own foreign policy and also minting its own money. The diet and central council of the federation, the Tagsatzung, held no real power and served more {{as an instrument of}} coordination. The reformation in the early 16th century had led to a confessional division amongst the cantons: the central Swiss cantons including Lucerne had remained Catholic, while Zürich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and also the city of St. Gallen had become Protestant. The Tagsatzung was often paralysed by disagreements between the equally strong <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic and Protestant sides.|$|E
5|$|Six {{men were}} {{candidates}} for the Greenback nomination. James B. Weaver, an Iowa congressman and Civil War general, was the clear favorite, but two other congressmen, Benjamin F. Butler from Massachusetts and Hendrick B. Wright from Pennsylvania, also commanded considerable followings. Weaver triumphed quickly, winning {{a majority of the}} 850 delegates' votes on the first ballot. Barzillai J. Chambers, a Texas businessman and Confederate veteran, was likewise nominated for vice president on the initial vote. More tumultuous was the fight over the platform, as delegates from disparate <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> the left-wing movement clashed over women's suffrage, Chinese immigration, {{and the extent to which}} the government should regulate working conditions.|$|E
5|$|Steve Neal, McNary's biographer, {{describes}} McNary as {{a progressive}} who {{stuck with the}} Republican Party in 1910 even when many progressives left the party in favor of West, a Democrat. McNary backed the Progressive Era reforms (the initiative, recall, referendum, primary elections, and the direct election of US senators) of Oregonian William Simon U'Ren, {{and he was an}} early supporter of public, rather than private, power companies. After West won the election, he chose McNary to be special legal counsel to Oregon's railroad commission, who urged lower passenger and freight rates. Meanwhile, McNary maintained friendly relations with both progressive and conservative <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> the Oregon Republicans and with West.|$|E

Both Hoffa and Beck were indicted, but Hoffa won the battle {{for control of the}} Teamsters. In response, the AFL-CIO instituted a policy that no union official who had taken the Fifth Amendment during a corruption investigation could continue in a leadership position. Meany told the Teamsters that they could continue as members of the AFL-CIO if Hoffa resigned as president. Hoffa refused, and the Teamsters were ousted from the AFL-CIO on December 6, 1957. Meany supported the AFL-CIO's adoption of a code of ethics, {{in the wake of the}} scandal.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth, {{assertive}} militarily under King Stephen Báthory, {{suffered from}} dynastic distractions during the reigns of the Vasa kings Sigismund III and Władysław IV. It had {{also become a}} playground of internal conflicts, in which the kings, powerful magnats and <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> nobility were the main actors. The Commonwealth fought wars with Russia, Sweden and the Ottoman Empire. At the Commonwealth's height, some of its powerful neighbors experienced difficulties {{of their own and}} the Polish–Lithuanian state sought domination in Eastern Europe, in particular over Russia. Allied with the Habsburg Monarchy, it did not directly participate in the Thirty Years' War.|$|E
5|$|The papal {{conclave}} from November 29, 1549, to February 7, 1550, convened {{after the}} death of Pope Paul III and eventually elected Giovanni Del Monte to the papacy as Pope Julius III. It was the second-longest papal conclave of the 16th century, and (at the time) the largest papal conclave in history {{in terms of the number}} of cardinal electors. The cardinal electors (who at one point totalled fifty-one) were roughly divided between the <b>factions</b> <b>of</b> Henry II of France, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and Alessandro Farnese, the cardinal-nephew of Paul III.|$|E
