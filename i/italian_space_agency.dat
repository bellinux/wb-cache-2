40|$|Safety {{requirements}} {{and the increase}} in balloon flight duration make a computerized balloon control system essential. Starting with a global thermodynamic model of a stratospheric balloon (NASA-SINBAD) and 48 -hour wind forecast data, a flexible system can be built to predict its trajectory. In order to increase the trajectory forecast accuracy, the thermodynamic model of SINBAD, related to infrared radiation and albedo, has been improved. The model and the methodology have been evaluated by comparing the altitude excursion of some already flown zero-pressure balloons, with the altitude excursion computed by SINBAD; meteorological and satellite data (METEOSAT) and meteorological forecast data have been used as input. This system, connected during the mission to the balloon’s managing unit, will continuously update the forecast trajectory and will enable real and simulated data to be compared. In this way it will also be possible to simulate the balloon flight trajectory in case of any failures.

40|$|Abstract A large dike {{intrusion}} and {{fissure eruption}} lasting 9 months began on November 27, 2013, beneath the south flank of Tolbachik Volcano, Kamchatka, Russia. The eruption {{was the most}} recent at Tolbachik since the Great Tolbachik Eruption from 1975 to 1976. The 2012 eruption was preceded by more than 6 months of seismicity that clustered beneath the east flank of the volcano along a NW–SE trend. Seismicity increased dramatically before the eruption, with propagation of the seismicity from the central volcano conduit in the final hours. We use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to compute relative displacement images (interferograms) for {SAR} data pairs spanning the eruption. We use satellite {SAR} data from the Canadian <b>Space</b> <b>Agency's</b> RADARSAT- 2 and from the <b>Italian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency's</b> COSMO-SkyMed missions. Data are modeled first through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo solution for a single tensile dislocation (dike). We then use a boundary element method that includes topography to model a distributed dike-opening model. We find the best-fitting dike dips 80 ° to the {WNW} with maximum opening of 6 – 8 m, localized in the near surface and more broadly distributed in distinct regions up to 3 km beneath the surface, which varies from 1 to 2 km elevation for the eruptive fissures.

40|$|A {{case study}} is {{presented}} to illustrate {{some of the problems}} of applying cognitive science to complex human-machine systems. Disregard for facts about human cognition often undermines the safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of complex systems. Yet single-point methods (for example, better user-interface design), whether rooted in computer science or in experimental psychology, fall far short of addressing systems-level problems in a timely way using realistic resources. A model-based methodology is proposed for organizing and prioritizing the cognitive engineering effort, focusing appropriate expertise on major problems first, then moving to more sophisticated refinements if time and resources permit. This {{case study is}} based on a collaborative effort between the Human Factors Division at NASA-Ames and the Spaceborne Imaging Radar SIR-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) Project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California institute of Technology.
