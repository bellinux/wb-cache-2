500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Variety, on {{the other}} hand, called the show [...] "loony" [...] and [...] "without a story, form, music, dancing, beauty or artistry.... It's impossible to tell whether [...] talent. [...] Maybe talent is irrelevant in this new kind of show business." [...] Reviews in the news weeklies were mixed; Jack Kroll <b>in</b> <b>Newsweek</b> wrote, [...] "There is no denying the sheer kinetic drive of this new Hair... there is something hard, grabby, slightly corrupt about O'Horgan's virtuosity, like Busby Berkeley gone bitchy."
