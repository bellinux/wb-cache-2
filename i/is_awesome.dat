Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic.

He praised Mars performance by saying he [...] "offered a brand of artistry unmatched by the bulk of the telecast."

The UK edition of The Huffington Post commented that despite Mars' voice being on top form, it was the pole-dancer performance who stole the show. Other performers, such as Ed Sheeran and Adam Lambert praised the interpretation by calling it an amazing performance and noticing Mars' vocals, respectively. Hilary Duff called [...] "Gorilla" [...] a [...] "straight baby making music".|$|E

The record, however, was never sent to Azalea and on 1 August 2013, she denied that Ora would be collaborating with her on the album. Azalea then met Perry for the first time, as her supporting act at the iTunes Festival that year. At the festival, Perry approached Azalea with an offer to record [...] "Black Widow" [...] as she felt the song would suit her better. Azalea was then invited to Perry's after party that night, where the two exchanged numbers, and Perry sent Azalea the record. When Azalea received the song, it only consisted of a hook and a beat. She initially wanted Perry to sing the song's hook, but Perry was unable to because of time constraints. In an interview, Azalea mentioned, [...] "It needed someone who could really sing, as Katy's voice <b>is</b> <b>awesome.</b> The sky's the limit for Rita.

[...] Similarly, Perry was astonished by how Carson [...] "can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such grammatized form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice." [...] Jonathan Cherry, who recently emerged in the 2003 film House of the Dead, was appointed as Rory Peters. Cherry characterized Rory as [...] "a very opposite of me whose arc goes from, 'I don't really care at all', to 'Oh my God, this is really happening!'" [...] In the script, Bress said that Rory was his favorite character to write since [...] "he's great comic relief, he's got a drug problem, he's funny, and he's all that." [...] Bress bragged that [...] "Cherry <b>is</b> <b>awesome,</b> awesome casting cause he's just so funny and the way he delivers his lines. It's like 'Oh yeah. That's good! That's better!'" [...] "What I think was surprising on him was that from all of the humor he's involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with Kat, there is some moments where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you're really becoming sympathetic to Rory. You like him at first cause he's the funny guy, but then you care about him because you realize that there's a place that humor comes from that we all share," [...] Perry appended.|$|E
