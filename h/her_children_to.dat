5|$|Connections with Francia {{went beyond}} {{trade and the}} royal marriages Æthelberht and Eadbald made with Frankish princesses. Eadbald's granddaughter, Eorcengota, became a nun at Faremoutiers, and his great-granddaughter, Mildrith, was a nun at Chelles. When Edwin was killed in about 632, Æthelburg, escorted by Paulinus, fled by sea to Eadbald's court in Kent, but in a further sign of her family's ties across the channel she sent <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> the court of King Dagobert I of the Franks, to keep them safe from the intrigues of Eadbald and Oswald of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{gave birth}} to her first child, Prince Charles, on 14 November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued letters patent {{allowing}} <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince. A second child, Princess Anne, was born in 1950.|$|E

In August 1861, Hay escorted Mary Lincoln and <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> Long Branch, New Jersey, a resort on the Jersey Shore, both as their {{caretaker}} and {{as a means of}} giving Hay a much-needed break. The following month, Lincoln sent him to Missouri to deliver a letter to Union General John C. Frémont, who had irritated the President with military blunders and by freeing local slaves without authorization, endangering Lincoln's attempts to keep the border states in the Union.|$|E
5|$|Prior to abandoning Juana Ibarguren, Juan Duarte {{had been}} her sole means of support. Biographer John Barnes writes that after this abandonment, all Duarte left to the family was a {{document}} declaring that the children were his, thus enabling them to use the Duarte surname. Soon after, Juana moved <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> a one-room apartment in Junín. To pay the rent on their single-roomed home, mother and daughters took up jobs as cooks in the houses of the local estancias.|$|E
5|$|Alice, heavily {{pregnant}} with her third child, saw Louis depart to command the Hessian cavalry against the Prussians, and sent <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> stay with Queen Victoria in England. Despite her pregnancy, she performed the royal duties expected of her sex and station, making bandages for troops and preparing hospitals. On 11 July, {{she gave birth to}} Princess Irene; Prussian troops {{were on the verge of}} entering Darmstadt, she begged the Grand Duke to surrender on Prussia's terms. This provoked fury from the fiercely anti-Prussian Prince Alexander, but Alice realised that the conquered German states would likely form a union which she, like her sister Victoria, supported.|$|E

5|$|Eadbald's {{influence}} {{was less than}} his father's, but Kent was powerful enough to be omitted {{from the list of}} kingdoms dominated by Edwin of Northumbria. Edwin's marriage to Eadbald's sister, Æthelburg, established a good relationship between Kent and Northumbria which appears to have continued into Oswald's reign. When Æthelburg fled to Kent on Edwin's death in about 633, she sent <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> Francia for safety, fearing the intrigues of both Eadbald and Oswald. The Kentish royal line made several strong diplomatic marriages over the succeeding years, including the marriage of Eanflæd, Eadbald's niece, to Oswiu, and of Eorcenberht to Seaxburh, daughter of King Anna of East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|In July 1935, Alexander {{married a}} physicist, Norman Alexander, from New Zealand. When her husband took {{the post of}} Professor of Physics at Raffles College in Singapore, Elizabeth Alexander began a study into the effects of {{weathering}} in the tropics. Whilst in Singapore, the couple had three children, William in 1937, Mary in 1939 and Bernice in 1941. On 4 January 1942, under Navy orders to take <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> safety and return with specialist equipment being made in Australia, Dr. Alexander and her children were evacuated to New Zealand by a Short S23 C flying boat. After the Fall of Singapore on 15 February she was stranded in New Zealand with no news of her husband for six months, then the inaccurate information that he was dead.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{supported}} by Irish Catholics {{in his effort}} to regain the thrones, James launched an expedition to Ireland in March 1689. He abandoned it upon his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. During James's campaign, Mary supported his cause throughout the British Isles: she sent three French supply ships to Bantry Bay and £2,000 to Jacobite rebels in Dundee. She financed those measures by selling her jewellery. Money problems plagued the Stuart court-in-exile, despite a substantial pension from Louis XIV of 50,000 livres. Mary tried her best to assist those of her husband's followers living in poverty, and encouraged <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> give part of their pocket money to Jacobite refugees.|$|E

50|$|It is {{very hard}} to find daycare in some parts of Japan, and it is {{socially}} looked down upon if a mother sends <b>her</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> one. The mother is seen as insufficient, not having the skills <b>to</b> raise a <b>child</b> on <b>her</b> own, or selfish, giving <b>her</b> <b>child</b> over <b>to</b> a caretaker while she pursues her own separate goals.|$|R
5|$|Isaac Manning {{left the}} family in 1869 after selling most of the family's realty to his wife. There is no {{evidence}} that suggests that Isaac had any permanent relations with any members of the family again. Within four years James was remarried to her son Sylvester's father-in-law, Frank Perkins. The marriage lasted less than two years, after which time she reverted to her former married name. It was at this time that James became increasingly worried about her eternal welfare. She began to petition the First Presidency to be endowed and to be sealed, along with <b>her</b> <b>children,</b> <b>to</b> Walker Lewis, a prominent African-American Mormon Elder. Lewis, like Elijah Abel, had been ordained to the priesthood during Joseph Smith's lifetime, and James therefore assumed that he would be eligible for temple ordinances. However, her petitions were consistently ignored or refused.|$|E
5|$|A {{turning point}} came in 1777 when British forces invaded New York from Canada and laid siege to Patriots in Fort Stanwix. In August, when Brant {{learned that a}} large body of Patriot militia {{was on its way to}} relieve the fort, she sent Mohawk runners to alert the British {{commander}} of the danger. This information enabled a British, Mohawk, and Seneca force to ambush the Patriots and their Oneida allies in the Battle of Oriskany. The Iroquois were divided in their loyalties. The Oneida allied with the Patriots, while most bands of the other four nations allied with the British. After this battle, in which Iroquois warriors of these nations fought on both sides, the war in the Mohawk Valley became particularly brutal. The Oneida and rebel Americans retaliated against Brant by pillaging Canajoharie. Brant fled with <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> Onondaga, the central city of the Iroquois Confederacy. Her departure was so precipitate that she had to leave most of her belongings behind.|$|E
5|$|In reality, he had {{continued}} as Scientific Adviser to the Armed Forces, moving {{to help out}} at Singapore General Hospital when Raffles College {{was on the front}} line. At the hospital, he kept the X-ray machines going until Singapore fell a few days later. He was then interned in Changi, then Sime Road camps, along with the senior medical staff of the hospital. In September 1945 he was reunited with his family in New Zealand for six months compulsory sick leave, returning to Singapore in March 1946 to restart both Physics and Chemistry Departments at Raffles College. Both departments had been looted and the Professor of Chemistry and his senior lecturer were both dead. Dr. Elizabeth Alexander wound up her work in Wellington and took <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> England, leaving them with her sister as guardian. She rejoined Norman Alexander briefly in England to buy equipment for the College, before they returned to Singapore together. She then took up the post of Government Geologist, restarted her work on tropical weathering and acted as registrar for the conversion of Raffles College to the University of Malaya.|$|E

5|$|The growing family, {{which came}} to include eight children, spent its winters in Berlin and summers in Potsdam; the year also usually {{included}} a stay in the country, {{to the delight of}} the children. In 1863 Vicky and Frederick purchased a run-down property and refurbished it into a farm, allowing the family to periodically experience a simple country life. Frederick was a loving husband, but as an officer in the Prussian army, his duties increasingly pulled him away from the home. Vicky was an intellectually demanding mother who expected <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> exhibit moral and political leadership, and in her husband's absence she carefully supervised their education and upbringing. Shortly after arriving in her new adopted country, Vicky observed the continuous arguments and intrigues within the Prussian royal family. This bolstered her belief in the superiority of English culture; she raised her children in English-style nurseries, and successfully fostered a love of her native country by incorporating aspects of English culture in the home and taking them on frequent trips to England.|$|E

Aristides' two families lived in the same house for some time, but they did not get along very well, and four years later, Eurídice moved with <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> a small room behind a bar in São Paulo. After that Lula rarely saw his father, who became an alcoholic and died in 1978.|$|E
50|$|In the {{performing}} arts, a stage mother {{is the mother}} of a child actor. The mother will often drive <b>her</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> auditions, make sure he or she is on the set on time, etc. The term stage mother sometimes has a negative connotation, suggesting that the individual is prone to obnoxiously demanding special treatment for <b>her</b> <b>child,</b> or suggesting that the individual has placed inappropriate pressure on <b>her</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> succeed, perhaps for reasons of vicariously living out her own dreams through the child. Entitled and grandiose demands have sometimes led to reportedly veiled threats from a stage parent, for instance comments made by LaVar Ball while promoting the basketball career of his son, Lonzo Ball.|$|R
