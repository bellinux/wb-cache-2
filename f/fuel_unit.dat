After developing a mathematical model, comprehensive energetic, exergetic, economic and environmental evaluations (4 E analysis) are performed and a multi-objective optimization method is utilized to find optimal solutions while considering the exergetic and economic objectives simultaneously. Two conflicting objectives including total exergetic efficiency and total cost rate of the system in multi-objective optimization {{are taken into account}} to build a set of Pareto optimal solutions.

It was found that <b>fuel</b> <b>unit</b> price, income level, and population {{are the most important}} variables that affect demand on electrical power, while population is the most important variable in the case of fuel consumption. Obtained results proved that the multivariate linear regression models can be used adequately to simulate residential electricity and fuel consumptions with very high coefficient of determination. Without employing most effective energy conservation measures, electricity and fuel demands are expected to rise by approximately 100 % and 23 %, respectively within 10 years time. Consequently, associated GHG emissions resulting from activities within the residential sector are predicted to rise by 59 % for the same period.

A two-stroke engine work was selected as it posses a number of technological challenges, e. g. increase in its thermal efficiency and emission, which upon successful undertakings will be useful in assisting the group in future powertrain undertakings in UTM.

40|$|One {{approach}} {{to address the}} United States Nuclear Power (NP) 2010 program for the advanced light water reactor (LWR) (Gen-III+) intermediate-term spent fuel disposal need is to reduce spent fuel storage volume while enhancing proliferation resistance. One proposed solution includes increasing burnup of the discharged spent fuel and mixing minor actinide (MA) transuranic nuclides (237 Np and 241 Am) in the high burnup fuel. Thus, we can reduce the spent fuel volume while increasing the proliferation resistance by increasing the isotopic ratio of 238 Pu/Pu. For future advanced nuclear systems, MAs are viewed more as a resource to be recycled, and transmuted to less hazardous and possibly more useful forms, rather than simply disposed of as a waste stream in an expensive repository facility. MAs play a much larger part {{in the design of}} advanced systems and fuel cycles, not only as additional sources of useful energy, but also as direct contributors to the reactivity control of the systems into which they are incorporated.

In this work, the Monte-Carlo coupling with ORIGEN- 2. 2 (MCWO) method was used to optimize the MA loading in the UO 2 fuel such that the discharged spent fuel demonstrates enhanced proliferation resistance, while minimizing plutonium production.

To monitor air quality trends in China for the period 2005 – 2015, we derive SO 2 columns and NO x emissions on a provincial level with improved accuracy. To put these trends into perspective they are compared with public data on energy consumption and the environmental policies of China. We distinguish the effect of air quality regulations from economic growth by comparing them relatively to fossil fuel consumption. Pollutant levels, per unit of fossil fuel, are {{used to assess the}} effectiveness of air quality regulations. We note that the desulfurization regulations enforced in 2005 – 2006 only had a significant effect in the years 2008 – 2009, when a much stricter control of the actual use of the installations began. For national NO x emissions a distinct decreasing trend is only visible from 2012 onwards, but the emission peak year differs from province to province. Unlike SO 2, emissions of NO x are highly related to traffic. Furthermore, regulations for NO x emissions are partly decided on a provincial level. The last 3  years show a reduction both in SO 2 and NO x emissions per fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>unit,</b> since the authorities have implemented several new environmental regulations. Despite an increasing fossil fuel consumption and a growing transport sector, the effects of air quality policy in China are clearly visible.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Older electricity generating unitsthose that began operating in or before 1978 provided 45 percent of electricity from fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>units</b> in 2010 but produced {{a disproportionate share of}} emissions, both in aggregate and per unit of electricity generated. Overall, in 2010 older units contributed 75 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, 64 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions, and 54 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>units.</b> For each unit of electricity generated, older units collectively emitted about 3. 6 times as much sulfur dioxide, 2. 1 times as much nitrogen oxides, and 1. 3 times as much carbon dioxide as newer units. The difference in emissions between older units and their newer counterparts may be attributed to a number of factors. First, 93 percent of the electricity produced by older fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>units</b> in 2010 was generated by coal-fired units. Compared with natural gas units, coal-fired units produced over 90 times as much sulfur dioxide, twice as much carbon dioxide and over five times as much nitrogen oxides per unit of electricity, largely because coal contains more sulfur and carbon than natural gas. Second, fewer older units have installed emissions controls, which reduce emissions by limiting their formation or capturing them after they are formed. Among coal-fired unitswhich produce nearly all sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power generationapproximately 26 percent of older units used controls for sulfur dioxide, compared with 63 percent of newer units. Controls for nitrogen oxide emissions were more common among all types of fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>units,</b> but these controls vary widely in their effectiveness. Among older units, 14 percent had installed selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment, the type of control capable of reducing the greatest amount of nitrogen oxides emissions, compared with 33 percent of newer units. In addition, approximately 38 percent of older units did not have any controls for nitrogen oxides, compared with 6 percent of newer units. Third, lower emissions among newer units may be attributable in part to improvements in the efficiency with which newer <b>units</b> convert <b>fuel</b> into electricity.
