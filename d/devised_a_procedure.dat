5|$|Only {{microscopic}} {{quantities of}} plutonium were available until the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works came online on 4 November 1943, {{but there were}} already some worrying signs. When plutonium fluoride was produced at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it was sometimes light colored, and sometimes dark, although the chemical process was the same. When they managed to reduce it to plutonium metal in November 1943, the density was measured at 15g/cm3, and a measurement using X-ray scattering techniques pointed to a density of 13g/cm3. This was bad; it had been assumed that its density {{was the same as}} uranium, about 19g/cm3. If these figures were correct, far more plutonium would be needed for a bomb. Kennedy disliked Seaborg's ambitious and attention-seeking manner, and with Arthur Wahl had <b>devised</b> <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> for plutonium purification independent of Seaborg's group. When they got hold of a sample in February, this procedure was tested. That month the Metallurgical Laboratory announced that it had determined that there were two different fluorides: the light colored plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4) and the dark plutonium trifluoride (PuF3). The chemists soon discovered how to make them selectively, and the former turned out to be easier to reduce to metal. Measurements in March 1944 indicated a density of between 19 and 20g/cm3.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhat {{happens to}} organelles during mitosis, {{and how they}} are apportioned to each of the {{daughter}} cells, is not completely clear. We have <b>devised</b> <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> to address whether Golgi membranes fuse with the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) during mitosis via the detection of interactions between ER and Golgi proteins. This procedure involves coexpressing an FKBP-tagged Golgi enzyme with an ER-retained protein fused to FRAP in COS cells. Since treatment with rapamycin induces a tight association between FKBP and FRAP, one would expect rapamycin to trap the FKBP-fused Golgi protein in the ER if it ever visits the ER during mitosis. However, after the doubly transfected cells progress through mitosis in the presence of rapamycin, we find the Golgi protein in the newly formed Golgi stacks and not in the ER. Based on these results, we conclude that Golgi membranes remain separate from the ER during mitosis in mammalian cells...|$|E
