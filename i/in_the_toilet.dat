25|$|Slow {{composting}} toilets {{have been}} installed by the Green Mountain Club in Vermont's woodlands. They employ multiple vaults (called cribs) and a movable building. When {{one of the}} vaults fills, the building is moved over an empty vault. The full vault is left untouched {{for as long as}} possible (up to three years) before it is emptied. The large surface area and exposure to air currents can cause the pile to dry out. To counteract this, signs instruct users to urinate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet.</b> The club also uses pit latrines and simple bucket toilets with woodchips and external composting and directs users to urinate in the forest to prevent odiferous anaerobic conditions.|$|E

25|$|Yorishiro are, however, most {{numerous}} in people's homes. During the New Year's holidays people decorate their entrances with kadomatsu, {{which are}} the yorishiro of the new year's kami. Kamifuda, pieces of paper representing the kami, are hung above the door. There are kami who dwell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> (benjō-gami) and in the well (suijin). The kamado-gami lives in the oven, and its function {{is to protect the}} house from fires. Other common yorishiro are the small altar called kamidana and the butsudan, which is an altar for the dead. (Butsudan were originally meant just for Buddhist worship, but now often contain also spirit tablets called ihai, which are yorishiro used to recall the spirits of one's dead ancestors). In shops one often sees clay cats with a raised paw called maneki-neko or rake-like bamboo objects called kumade supposed to attract good business.|$|E
25|$|By Knox's account, {{having spent}} the night with Sollecito, she arrived at Via della Pergola7 {{on the morning of}} 2November 2007, finding the front door open and drops of blood in the {{bathroom}} she shared with Kercher. Kercher's bedroom door was locked, which Knox took as indicating that Kercher was sleeping. After showering in the bathroom she and Kercher shared, Knox found feces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> of the bathroom shared by Romanelli and Mezzetti. Knox went back to Sollecito's home and later returned with him to Via della Pergola7. Noticing a broken window in Romanelli's bedroom and alarmed that Kercher did not answer her door, Sollecito unsuccessfully tried to force the door open. Sollecito called his sister, a lieutenant in the carabinieri, for advice. She advised him to call the 112 emergency number, which he did.|$|E

40|$|A {{human health}} risk {{assessment}} {{was performed to}} evaluate the risks due to chlorobenzenes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air of residential houses. Chlorobenzenes found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilets,</b> rooms, and outdoors of three houses in Brisbane, Australia, were sampled by trapping on Tenax TA and analyzed using an automated thermal desorption (ATD) -gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. Concentrations of 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene (1, 4 -DCB) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rooms, <b>toilets,</b> and outdoors were used as the exposure concentrations (E), while those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilets</b> (姯m 3) were used as the high-exposure concentrations (HE). The exposure concentrations were transformed into exposure doses (EXDE and EXDHE). Dose-response data from the literature {{for a range of}} adverse effects in animals were obtained and exposure doses were expressed as human equivalent dose (HED). The HED values were higher than the EXDE and EXDHE values for all adverse effects, and a hazard quotient was calculated that indicated a low level of risk with the high-exposure environment. The lifetime average daily doses (LADDs) {{for a wide range of}} adverse effects observed in human case studies were estimated and compared to <b>the</b> doses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-exposure (HE) situation. Using the Monte Carlo simulation technique the probabilities of risk quotients higher than unity ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 26. This evaluation indicated that 1, 4 -DCB posed low risks to general residents; however, for individuals with susceptible characteristics and exposure to elevated 1, 4 -DCB, the probability of adverse responses was moderate to high.

25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E
25|$|Greek pottery also {{provides}} {{an insight into}} the daily life of prostitutes. Their representation can generally be grouped into four categories: banquet scenes, sexual activities, toilet scenes and scenes depicting maltreatment. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> scenes the prostitute frequently has a less than perfect body; sagging breasts, rolls of flesh, etc. There is a kylix showing a prostitute urinating into a chamber pot. In the representation of sexual acts, {{the presence of a}} prostitute is often indicated by a purse, which underscores the financial nature of the relationship. The position most frequently shown is the leapfrog—or sodomy; these two positions being difficult to visually distinguish. The woman is frequently folded in two with her hands flat on the ground. Sodomy was considered degrading for an adult and it seems that the leapfrog position (as opposed to the missionary position) was considered less gratifying for the woman. Finally, a number of vases represent scenes of abuse, where the prostitute is threatened with a stick or sandal, and forced to perform acts considered by the Greeks to be degrading: fellatio, sodomy or sex with two partners.|$|E

25|$|On November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense's final witness. Arbuckle was simple, direct, and unflustered in both {{direct and}} cross examination.

After the doctor declared that Rappe was just drunk, Arbuckle then drove Taub to town.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E

Apart from an enclosed toilet in the north-west corner, the observation room is an open space with a central pillar that contains cavities for services that link to the roof level. Fixed angled glazing wraps around the north, east and south sides. A set of recent laminated cabinetry sits below the observation windows along the north-east. Original metal window frames on the western wall are a mixture of mid-point pivoting and fixed panes, while more recent aluminium-framed windows are found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet.</b> Floors are lined with linoleum and a system of suspended ceiling panels conceals the underside of the concrete roof slab. A recent sink and cupboard sits up against the southern wall of the toilet. All original communications equipment has been removed. Access to the external balcony, which wraps around all sides except the straight, western edge, is through a single door in the south-west corner. This timber door retains the original separate screen door. The narrow balcony has a concrete floor and a balustrade made from two tubular steel rails and widely separated balusters covered in asbestos cement sheeting rendered with pebble-dash on the exterior face. The steel balusters pierce the concrete floor slab and are fixed on the underside.|$|E
