25|$|The Cape cobra is a diurnal {{species and}} {{actively}} forages throughout the day. During very hot weather {{it may become}} crepuscular, but is rarely if ever observed during the hours of darkness. It is a terrestrial snake, but will readily climb trees and bushes, and shows considerable agility in for example systematically robbing the nests of the sociable weaver. When not active, it hides in holes or under ground cover, such as brush piles, often remaining in the same retreat for some time. It is a quick moving and alert species, and although a report mentions that this species is generally calm when compared to some other African venomous snakes, it strikes readily if threatened. When disturbed and brought to bay the Cape cobra raises its <b>forebody</b> off the ground, spreads a broad hood and may hiss loudly. While on the defensive, it strikes unhesitatingly. If the threat remains motionless, the snake will quickly attempt to escape, but at any sign of movement will adopt its defensive posture again. The Cape cobra is more aggressive during the mating period.|$|E
500|$|The F-16 has a cropped-delta wing {{incorporating}} wing-fuselage blending and <b>forebody</b> vortex-control strakes; a fixed-geometry, underslung {{air intake}} (with splitter plate) {{to the single}} turbofan jet engine; a conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement with all-moving horizontal [...] "stabilator" [...] tailplanes; a pair of ventral fins beneath the fuselage aft of the wing's trailing edge; and a tricycle landing gear configuration with the aft-retracting, steerable nose gear deploying a short distance behind the inlet lip. There is a boom-style aerial refueling receptacle located behind the single-piece [...] "bubble" [...] canopy of the cockpit. Split-flap speedbrakes are located at the aft end of the wing-body fairing, and a tailhook is mounted underneath the fuselage. A fairing beneath the rudder often houses ECM equipment or a drag chute. Later F-16 models feature a long dorsal fairing along the fuselage's [...] "spine", housing additional equipment or fuel.|$|E

2500|$|... 30 July 1966: 60-6941 (Article 135), {{one of the}} two drone carriers, {{was lost}} during a test flight off the California coast. The pilot and launch control {{engineer}} ejected safely but the engineer drowned. Article 135 was operating 300 miles from the California coast to carry out a test launch of a D-21. The aircraft was flying at Mach 3.2+ when the crew made sure that the Marquardt engine on the D-21 had the required airflow. The drone was launched but the D-21 engine failed to start and it slammed down on the launch pylon causing the mother ship to pitch up. The pressure from the Mach-3.2 airflow [...] "ripped the fuselage <b>forebody</b> from the wing planform". The crew were unable to escape at this high speed but managed to eject as the <b>forebody</b> tumbled towards the sea. The pilot was picked up by helicopter from the sea but the LCO drowned.|$|E

40|$|Aerodynamic side {{forces on}} <b>forebodies</b> are {{considered}} that {{are produced by}} two types of flow: asymmetric vortices on bodies of revolution and nonuniform flow separation on square bodies with rounded corners under spinning conditions. Steady side forces that can be {{as large as the}} normal force are produced by asymmetric vortices on pointed <b>forebodies.</b> This side force has a large variation with Reynolds number, decreases rapidly with Mach number, and can be nearly eliminated with small nose bluntness or strakes. The angle of attack where the side force first occurs depends primarily on body geometry. The theoretical techniques to predict these side forces are necessarily semi-empirical because the basic phenomenon is not well understood. The side forces produced by nonuniform flow separation under spinning conditions depend extensively on spin rate, angle of attack, and Reynolds number. The application of simple crossflow theory to predict this side force is inadequate much below angles of attack of 90 deg...|$|R

40|$|Vortex asymmetries {{can arise}} on {{aircraft}} and missile <b>forebodies</b> at high angles of attack and have proven difficult to simulate {{in the wind}} tunnel because of a large array of parameters that can influence the test results.

40|$|To {{identify}} planform characteristics {{which have}} promise for a highly maneuverable vehicle, an investigation {{was conducted in}} the Langley Subsonic Basic Research Tunnel to determine the low-speed longitudinal aerodynamics of 21 planform geometries. Concepts studied included twin bodies, double wings, cutout wings, and serrated <b>forebodies.</b> The planform models tested were all 1 / 4 -in. -thick flat plates with beveled edges on the lower surface to ensure uniform flow separation at angle of attack. A 1. 0 -in. -diameter cylindrical metric body with a hemispherical nose was used to house the six-component strain gauge balance for each configuration. Aerodynamic force and moment data were obtained across an angle-of-attack range of 0 to 70 deg with zero sideslip at a free-stream dynamic pressure of 30 psf. Surface flow visualization studies were also conducted on selected configurations using fluorescent minitufts. Results from the investigation indicate that a cutout wing planform can improve lift characteristics; however, cutout size, shape, and position and wing leading-edge sweep will all influence {{the effectiveness of the}} cutout configuration. Tests of serrated <b>forebodies</b> identified this concept as an extremely effective means of improving configuration lift characteristics; increases of up to 25 percent in the value of maximum lift coefficient were obtained...|$|R
