25|$|An <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacer</b> is a truck-like vehicle used {{to clean}} and smooth the surface of an ice rink. Frank J. Zamboni of Paramount, California invented the first <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacer,</b> which he called a Zamboni, in 1949.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{quality is}} judged by smoothness, friction, hardness, and brittleness. Factors {{affecting}} ice quality include temperature, water quality, and usage, with toe picks causing more deterioration. For figure skating, an ice temperature of 24°F (-4°C) is generally preferred. Typically after every two warm-up groups, an <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacer</b> cleans and smooths {{the surface of}} the ice sheet. Inadequate ice quality may affect skaters' performances.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacer</b> is {{a vehicle}} or hand-pushed device used {{to clean and}} smooth the surface of an ice sheet, usually in an ice rink. The two major North American {{manufacturers}} are Resurfice Corporation, which sells Olympia-brand machines, and Frank J. Zamboni & Company and other brands include the Okay Elektra, an electric <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacer</b> made in Canada {{in the province of}} Quebec. The first <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacer</b> was pioneered and developed by American inventor and engineer Frank Zamboni in 1949 in the city of Paramount, California.

40|$|Indoor {{air quality}} in ice skating rinks {{has become a}} public concern due {{to the use of}} propane- or {{gasoline-powered}} <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacers</b> and edgers. In this study, the indoor air quality in three ice rinks with different volumes and resurfacer power sources (propane and gasoline) was monitored during usual operating hours. The measurements included continuous recording of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), particulate matter with a diameter less than 2. 5 μm (PM 2. 5), particulate matter with diameter less than 10 μm (PM 10), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2). The average CO, CO 2, and TVOC concentrations ranged from 3190 to 6749 μg/m 3, 851 to 1329 ppm, and 550 to 765 μg/m 3, respectively. The average NO and NO 2 concentrations ranged from 69 to 1006 μg/m 3 and 58 to 242 μg/m 3, respectively. The highest CO and TVOC levels were observed in the ice rink which a gasoline-fueled resurfacer was used. The highest NO and NO 2 levels were recorded in the ice rink with propane-fueled <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacers.</b> The air quality parameters of PM 2. 5, PM 10, and SO 2 were fully acceptable in these ice rinks according to HKIAQO standards.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{combination}} of poor ventilation and fuel-powered <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacers</b> {{has resulted in}} elevated nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) concentrations in many indoor ice skating rinks. This study examined the factors influencing concentrations {{and the effects of}} various engineering controls in ice rinks with different resurfacer fuels. METHODS: Indoor NO 2 concentrations were measured in 19 enclosed ice skating rinks over 3 winters by means of passive samplers, with 1 -week average measurements during the first winter pilot study and single-day working-hour measurements in the final 2 winters. Personal exposures to drivers also were assessed during the last winter. RESULTS: Rinks in which propane-fueled resurfacers were used had a daily mean indoor NO 2 concentration of 206 ppb, compared with 132 ppb for gasoline-fueled and 37 ppb for electric-powered resurfacers. Engineering controls, such as increased ventilation and resurfacer tuning, reduced NO 2 concentrations by 65 % on average, but outcomes varied widely, and concentrations increased in subsequent months. CONCLUSIONS: Electric <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacers,</b> increased ventilation, or emission control systems are recommended to protect the health of workers and patrons, with surveillance programs proposed to track implementation and maintain an observer effect...|$|R
500|$|The {{changing}} temperatures {{forced the}} ice crews {{to abandon the}} use of <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacers</b> for fear of damaging the playing surface. [...] Instead, they manually flooded the ice between periods using a high-pressure hose and shovels. The players admitted that they were challenged by {{the condition of the}} ice, but praised the efforts of Dan Craig and his ice crew at quickly fixing areas of the surface that required patching. Flames defenceman Cory Sarich noted that while he had difficulty handling the puck, he was not concerned about the safety of the ice surface.|$|R

5000|$|A popular origin story {{holds that}} in outdoor ice hockey before <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacers,</b> the losing {{team in a}} hockey game would have to hose down the rink after a game to make the ice smooth again. Thus the term hoser was synonymous with loser. Another {{suggestion}} for {{the origin of the}} term involves farmers of the Canadian prairies who would siphon gasoline from farming vehicles with a hose during the Great Depression of the 1930s. [...] "Hosed" [...] is also a euphemism for drunkenness in Canadian English, and by extension a hoser is one who is drunk.|$|R
50|$|Various other {{applications}} of the screw or auger conveyor include its use in snowblowers, to move snow towards an impeller, where it is thrown into the discharge chute. Combine harvesters use both enclosed and open augers to move the unthreshed crop into the threshing mechanism and to move the grain {{into and out of}} the machine's hopper. <b>Ice</b> <b>resurfacers</b> use augers to remove loose ice particles from the surface of the ice. An auger is also a central component of an injection molding machine. An auger is used in some rubbish compactors to push the rubbish into a lowered plate at one end for compaction.|$|R

5000|$|It {{has been}} noted in [...] "Occupational and Environmental Medicine" [...] that indoor ice-resurfacing can subject people to {{negative}} health effects, due to {{the operation of the}} vehicle's combustion engine indoors. Indoor ice-resurfacing has resulted in [...] "cases of acute Carbon Monoxide and Nitrogen Dioxidesic poisoning...resulting from the release of pollutants". Exposure to high concentrations of these gases can cause [...] "acute and chronic illness". Recommendations that have been made with the aim of improving air quality include: regular maintenance of ice resurfacers; utilization of pollution control devices (like a catalytic converter); proper ventilation; wider use of electric <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacers</b> instead of fossil-fuelled machines; and monitoring air quality within the arena.|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacers</b> are {{fitted with}} a [...] "board brush", a rotary brush powered by a {{hydraulic}} motor. The board brush is extended and retracted {{on the left side}} of the machine by a hydraulic arm. This allows the operator to collect ice shavings and debris that accumulate along the edge of the rink (along the kick plates below the dasher boards of the rink) where the conditioner cannot easily reach. The brush sweeps the accumulations into the path of the conditioner, which removes them from the ice. The use of a board brush can dramatically reduce the need for edging of the rink.|$|R
50|$|The use of studs is {{restricted}} {{in some countries}} due to the increased road wear that they cause, with the notable exception of most Nordic and North American jurisdictions, where they are commonly used in colder areas during the winter season.

50|$|The {{device is}} a small, {{independently}} rotating knob (similar to a U.S. classic door knob) facing the driver that is securely {{mounted on the}} outside rim of a steering wheel. The protruding knob is an aftermarket accessory. The free rotation is intended to help make steering with one hand less difficult or faster. Brodie knobs had limited popularity on trucks and tractors {{before the advent of}} power steering. Their main use today is still in trucks, particularly semi trucks where they allow simultaneous steering and operation of the radio or gearshift. They are also used on forklifts, riding lawnmowers, and <b>ice</b> <b>resurfacers,</b> where frequent sharp turning is required. The knob is also standard equipment in most modern farm and commercial tractors, its main purpose being to ease single-hand steering while the driver operates other controls with his/her other hand or is traveling in reverse.|$|R
