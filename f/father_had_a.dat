5|$|In {{the last}} years of his life, Blancornelas lived as a virtual prisoner, always {{accompanied}} by an escort of fifteen armed guards. He died in the border city of Tijuana, Baja California on November 23, 2006 in Del Prado Hospital, from complications caused by stomach cancer, possibly caused by the embedded bullets he received when he was shot. Blancornelas was taken to the hospital on November 19 after his son confessed that his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lung defect that dated back to his youth. Prior to his death, Blancornelas stopped reporting directly for the Zeta magazine since February 2006 but still sent information to the magazine, particularly on issues covering drug trafficking. Beginning to doubt Zetas ability to foster change, Blancornelas considered closing the magazine with his death. Editor Adela Navarro Bello and his son César René Blanco Villalón persuaded him to let the magazine continue, however, and succeeded him as the magazine's co-publishers.|$|E

40|$|Our {{investigation}} aims {{to study}} the relationship between forms of aggression preteens students {{and the level of}} education of their fathers. For this purpose, fifty-four (54) all children in the classroom Middle Course (CM), 27 students <b>have</b> <b>fathers</b> level of primary research and 27 fathers of higher level of education were examined. These subjects were ageded between 9 and 12 years, and they live with their biological fathers. For data collection, we used a questionnaire adapted to measure forms of aggression Little, Brauner, Jones, Hawley (2003). The results of our research show that there is {{a significant difference between the}} two groups of subjects with regard to forms of aggression studied. The alternate assumptions are confirmed. In other words, physical aggression is more common among those whose <b>fathers</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> primary level compared to their counterparts whose <b>fathers</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> higher level of education study. In contrast, relational aggression is more common among those whose <b>fathers</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> higher level of education compared to those whose <b>fathers</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> primary-level study.

5|$|Riley's father {{returned}} from the war partially paralyzed. He was unable to continue working in his legal practice and the family soon fell into financial distress. The war had a negative physiological effect on him, and {{his relationship with his}} family quickly deteriorated. He opposed Riley's interest in poetry and encouraged him to find a different career. The family finances finally disintegrated and they were forced to sell their town home in April 1870 and return to their country farm. Riley's mother was able to keep peace in the family, but after her death in August from heart disease, Riley and his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> final break. He blamed his mother's death on his father's failure to care for her in her final weeks. He continued to regret the loss of his childhood home and wrote frequently of how it was so cruelly snatched from him by the war, subsequent poverty, and his mother's death. After the events of 1870, he developed an addiction to alcohol which he struggled with for the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|Marley and Neville Livingston (later {{known as}} Bunny Wailer) had been {{childhood}} friends in Nine Mile. They {{had started to}} play music together while at Stepney Primary and Junior High School. Marley left Nine Mile with his mother when he was 12 and moved to Trenchtown, Kingston. Cedella Booker and Thadeus Livingston (Bunny Wailer's <b>father)</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> daughter together whom they named Claudette Pearl, who was a younger sister to both Bob and Bunny. Now that Marley and Livingston were living {{together in the same}} house in Trenchtown, their musical explorations deepened to include the latest R from American radio stations whose broadcasts reached Jamaica, and the new Ska music. The move to Trenchtown was proving to be fortuitous, and Marley soon found himself in a vocal group with Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Beverley Kelso and Junior Braithwaite. Joe Higgs, who was part of the successful vocal act Higgs and Wilson, resided on 3rd St., and his singing partner Roy Wilson had been raised by the grandmother of Junior Braithwaite. Higgs and Wilson would rehearse {{at the back of the}} houses between 2nd and 3rd Streets, and it wasn't long before Marley (now residing on 2nd St), Junior Braithwaite and the others were congregating around this successful duo. Marley and the others didn't play any instruments at this time, and were more interested in being a vocal harmony group. Higgs was glad to help them develop their vocal harmonies, although more importantly, he had started to teach Marley how to play guitar—thereby creating the bedrock that would later allow Marley to construct some of the biggest-selling reggae songs in the history of the genre.|$|E
