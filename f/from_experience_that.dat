2500|$|As the {{dismantling}} of the Ottoman Empire was finalised {{by the end of the}} war in late January 1919, Bell was assigned to conduct an analysis of the situation in Mesopotamia. Due to her familiarity and relations with the tribes in the area she had strong ideas about the leadership needed in Iraq. She spent the next ten months writing what was later considered a masterly official report, [...] "Self Determination in Mesopotamia". The British Commissioner in Mesopotamia, Arnold Wilson, had different ideas of how Iraq should be run, preferring an Arab government to be under the influence of British officials who would retain real control, as he felt, <b>from</b> <b>experience,</b> <b>that</b> Mesopotamian populations were not yet ready to govern and administer the country efficiently and peacefully.|$|E
2500|$|The Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) {{responded to}} Berkeley's criticisms of Locke, {{as well as}} other {{differences}} between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of skepticism. [...] Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, [...] "Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated. But to conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities—by ‘proofs’ meaning arguments <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> leave no room for doubt or opposition."

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{the rebels}} at Constitution Hill (Toongabbie) were having {{difficulties}} co-ordinating their force as several parties, {{including one of}} around 70 men under Samuel Humes, had lost their way in the night. Nevertheless, Cunningham and William Johnston commenced drilling their men, while a party unsuccessfully tried to enter Parramatta where they were to set fire to a building to signal other conspirators to begin converging on Constitution Hill. Cunningham, being involved in two previous rebellions and the mutiny on the Anne, knew <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> {{the most important element}} of a rebellion or uprising would be secrecy. However, there were two defections [...] an Irish convict overseer named Sloane and Lewis Bulger [...] and the commandant at Parramatta, Captain Edward Abbott, who had warning of the rebellion as it was happening, commenced defensive measures and sent a message to the Governor in Sydney.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1871 Paul Draneht, {{the general}} manager of the Cairo Opera, {{negotiated}} with Sasse about the possibility of appearing as Amneris in the world premiere of Verdi's new opera Aida which was to be performed in Cairo later that year. He wrote about this to Verdi, who then wrote to Giovanni Battista Lampugnani, the theatrical agent in Milan: [...] "I have no use for her – either as Amneris, who is a mezzo-soprano, or as Aida, for other reasons." [...] Draneht visited Verdi at his home in Sant' Agata in May, where they discussed her further. Draneht, having been unaware of Verdi's opposition, had already signed her to sing Amneris. Verdi was adamantly opposed, not only because the part was too low, but because [...] "I know <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> it {{is in the interest of}} both the management and the composer to give her operas in which she is the only soprano, or at least an opera which has no other role equal or superior to hers." ...|$|E
2500|$|A modular view of {{sentence}} processing {{assumes that}} the stages involved in reading a sentence function independently in separate modules. These modulates have limited interaction with one another. For example, one influential theory of sentence processing, the garden-path theory, states that syntactic analysis takes place first. Under this theory as the reader is reading a sentence, he or she creates the simplest structure possible {{in order to minimize}} effort and cognitive load. This is done without any input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information. Hence, in the sentence [...] "The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable," [...] by the time the reader gets to the word [...] "examined" [...] he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parse. This commitment is made {{despite the fact that it}} results in an implausible situation; we know <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> evidence can rarely if ever examine something. Under this [...] "syntax first" [...] theory, semantic information is processed at a later stage. It is only later that the reader will recognize that he or she needs to revise the initial parse into one in which [...] "the evidence" [...] is being examined. In this example, readers typically recognize their misparse by the time they reach [...] "by the lawyer" [...] and must go back and re-parse the sentence. This reanalysis is costly and contributes to slower reading times.|$|E

Our tools for making inferences from counterfactuals permit inferring sentences that are not themselves counterfactual. This is what makes them useful. A simple class of useful counterfactuals involves a change of one component of a point in a space provided with a cartesian product structure. We call these cartesian counterfactuals. Cartesian counterfactuals can be modeled by assignment and contents functions as in program semantics. We also consider the more general tree-structured counterfactuals...|$|R
