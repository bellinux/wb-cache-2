50|$|The Dana Spicer 25 {{was based}} on the Dana 23 and was made only as a front axle for Four-wheel drive vehicles. This was the company's first <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Construction The {{primary use}} of the WorkStar is as a heavy 6x4 dump truck with a GVWR of {{approximately}} 50,000 lb. With all the upgrades possible, {{it can be used}} as a concrete mixer, where the heavy duty <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> is often used. It can also be a semi-tractor, pulling dump or lowboy trailers.|$|E
5000|$|Fire equipment. [...] In {{rural areas}} of the US, {{especially}} in state and national parks, fire equipment {{has to go to}} remote off-road areas, often carrying water with them. The WorkStar has options needed, high strength and power, heavy duty <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle,</b> an advanced electrical system, and a crew-cab. An extreme truck can be ordered with factory parts.|$|E

50|$|Retained {{features}} {{from its}} agricultural tractor heritage is the operators location {{and the basic}} layout. The driver thus sit behind the engine and above the transmission and <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle.</b> The permanently attached trailer can not move vertically {{in relation to the}} tractor, but can rotate and swing on the horizontal plane. The operator have a conventional steering wheel that initiates hydraulic cylinders that push and pull the tractor relative to the trailer. The tractor and the trailer sections can move at great angles to each other making for a small turning radius.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, UAZ began {{production}} of the UAZ-450 series of trucks and vans. The first model was the 450A ambulance; with room for two stretchers and four-wheel drive, it was arguably {{the best in the}} world for use in remote areas. It was followed by the 450D drop-side pickup, which had an 800 kg payload; the 450 van, with a 750 kg payload; and the 11-seat 450V microbus. All the 450 series were capable of disconnecting the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> and of reaching 56 mph, achieving fuel economy of , and of towing an 850 kg trailer.|$|E
5000|$|Sesspir - In 1984-85 the CSIR {{developed}} a prototype Casspir with six wheels. An additional non-driven axle was fitted {{in front of}} the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle,</b> this to be sacrificed {{in the event of a}} landmine detonation. It steered along with the regular driven front wheels and was equipped with winch cables to hoist either side of the axle clear off the ground in the event of the loss of a wheel. The theory being the vehicle would remain mobile. The idea was shelved as one of numerous problems was simply a lack of power from the engine to push the undriven axle along through bush and soft sand. Only one prototype was built.|$|E
5000|$|One {{example was}} the Italian State Railways class 640 2-6-0. The frontmost axle did not carry a {{conventional}} pony truck. Instead this axle {{along with the}} <b>front</b> <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> together carried a bogie. This driving axle had a lateral play of about 20 mm, and spherical bearings were used on the cranks and coupling rods to this axle. (The engine used inside cylinders driving the middle set of drivers.) The first two axles worked together to guide the locomotive, similar to a conventional leading bogie. The Dovregubben class 2-8-4 on the Norwegian State Railways also used this [...] "Zara" [...] truck.|$|R

50|$|Street {{and road}} {{maintenance}} In the northern US snow {{is a problem}} for roads, which need to be plowed and salted. Built with wiring and controls for lights and equipment, body options like heated windshields, mirrors, and seats, the truck comes ready for the service from the factory. The strong chassis with heavy-duty <b>front</b> wheel <b>drive</b> can plow around the clock for days.Utilities The WorkStar is popular with utilities, who often work off road for long periods in bad weather. The <b>front</b> <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> is very useful when the truck is moved to many different sites. The strong frame adapts to outriggers and a long boom, so employees can work on overhead wires.|$|R
40|$|The master {{thesis is}} about design and {{optimization}} of tractor <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> console. The first part, include {{the design of}} the new console geometry with respect of the surrounding area. After that is on the newly designed part performed a strain-stress analysis for three selected operating modes of the tractor, which have been defined based on critical operating situations. In thanks {{of the results of the}} individual states, the geometry of the component is adjusted according to meet the fatigue failure limit state. After inclusion of critical site modifications, the console design was subjected to design optimization in the ANSYS Workbench program to reduce the amount of material by 10 %. The end of the work, is carried out the evaluation of these places and then the console control calculation...|$|E
50|$|<b>Drive</b> <b>axles</b> are MAN {{single tyre}} hub-reduction, {{and with the}} {{exception}} of the heavier tractor units which are full-time all-wheel drive for traction and torque distribution reasons, all models have selectable <b>front</b> <b>axle(s)</b> <b>drive.</b> All <b>axles</b> have cross-axle differential locks and there are longitudinal differential locks in rear (and front on 8×8 and 10x10 chassis) axle combinations and the transfer case. Axle weight ratings are 9000 kg or 11,000 kg for front axles, and 10,000 kg for rear axles with single wheels/tyres.|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R

50|$|By this time, {{the station}} wagon, panel van, and pickup body styles {{had all been}} dropped and 1965 was {{the last year for}} the Greenbrier window van, which was {{retained}} mainly for fleet orders, with 1,528 being built. In all, 235,528 Corvairs were built in 1965. Chevrolet replaced the Corvair-based vans with the Chevrolet Sportvan/GMC Handi-Van, which used a traditional <b>front</b> engine/rear <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> borrowed from the Chevy II.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This lecture {{provides}} a {{short history of}} agricultural tractors and wheel equipment. A list of basic tire terms {{used to describe the}} tire profile is covered, along with performance criteria used to match mechanical <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> to the rear axle for proper gearing. In addition, the RCI table is introduced to provide a visual example of how tires can be grouped by rolling circumference and overall diameter. A description of tire size designations is listed for bias, radial, and flotation sizing. The load rating designations for ply, star, and load index is also explained. The five most common tread designs for powered axles are defined, with examples of the different patterns. Two examples of the creation of new tire sizes are given: one for large, high-horsepower, four-wheel drive tractors, and one for high-capacity row crop sprayers. Cyclical loads and their restrictions are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|In that {{original}} quattro system, later found in road-going passenger cars, {{the engine and}} transmission are situated in a longitudinal position. Torque is sent through the transmission to a mechanical centre differential (commonly abbreviated to [...] "diff") which apportions (distributes) the torque between <b>front</b> and rear <b>driven</b> <b>axles.</b> 4WD was permanently active.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s the Dana 70HD was offered. The axle tubes were {{increased}} to 4 inches diameter and carrier bearings were larger and thicker, the axle shafts were 35 spline only. These upgrades gave the Dana 70HD a gross axle rating of 10,000 lbs. The Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> {{used in the}} Chevrolet Kodiaks and GMC Topkicks also had these features. This axle was standard for the Big Three (automobile manufacturers) dual rear wheel trucks until 1985, when Ford started using the Sterling 10.25 rear axle. However Ford still kept the Dana 70HD an option until the Dana 80 was made available. The axle was available or optional for the Big Three until 1994 when Dodge used the Dana 80 for its dual rear wheel trucks instead. The Dana 70HD is still seen in commercial applications today. In the UK the 70HD Dana axles were license built by Salisbury Engineering in an early 10/23 spline version with a 4.3 metric tonne (9500lbs) rating for the Ford A-series truck with a European 6x205mm DIN standard hub bolt pattern.|$|R
50|$|The Dodge Ram {{features}} {{a wide variety}} of axles. For the front axle of 4x4 Rams, a Dana 44 was used on all 1500 Rams and the early (light-duty) 2500 Rams. However, most of the 2500 and all 3500 Rams use Dana 60 front axles. The 1500 Rams and some early light duty 2500 Rams used a 9.25 Chrysler (Spicer) axle in the rear. A Dana 60 rear axle was used on heavy duty 2500 V8 Rams. A Dana 70 rear axle was used in 2500 Rams with a V10 or a Diesel/Automatic transmission combination. A Dana 80 rear axle was used on 2500 Rams with a manual transmission and V10/diesel engine combination. Every 3500 Ram was made with a Dana 80. The <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> in these Rams were unique in the fact they didn't feature Locking hubs, but featured a Center axle disconnect. The 2002 2500 and 3500 Rams saw the eventual phase out of the Center axle disconnect, in favor of front axles that were permanently locked in. Dodge continued to feature front axles like this for their 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 trucks until 2013 models.|$|R

50|$|One {{example of}} a {{tri-axle}} K94UB (K94UB6x2/4LB) was produced in 2000. In Hong Kong, the K94UB has been fitted with a Volgren CR224LD 12m double-deck bodywork and is currently in operation with Citybus in Hong Kong. It {{is equipped with a}} 260 hp Euro III engine (which was uprated to 300 hp before entering service) and a hydraulically (ZF - RAS) steered tag axle in <b>front</b> of the <b>drive</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
5|$|VAT got {{a notable}} {{order from the}} Infrastructure and Hydro Engineering Administration in April 1965. The order for 250 {{vehicles}} was funded by a loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) for development of the road network. Forty vehicles were equipped with a <b>driven</b> <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> The order was completed in 1966.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{manufacturer}} of American-made half-tracks was the International Motor Truck Corporation division of International Harvester. IH built approximately 12,853 half-tracks, which were shipped to Europe {{for use by}} British and French troops. In 1942, they produced 152 M5 units and 5 M14 units at the Springfield Works; in 1943 they produced 2,026 M9 units, 1,407 M0A1 units, 4,473 M5 units, 1,600 M14 units, and 400 M17 units, all at the Springfield Works; in 1944 they produced 1,100 M5A1 units and 1,100 M17 units also at the Springfield Works; and in 1945 they built 589 M5A1 and 1 M5A3 units at Springfield Works. The IHC half-tracks differed visibly from the White, Diamond T, and AutoCar units in several ways. The IHC units had flat front fenders instead of fenders with compound curves; used the International Red Diamond 450 engines instead of the Hercules 160AX engines used by the other manufacturers; used IHC Model 1856 4-speed transmissions instead of the Spicer 4-speed transmissions used by the other manufacturers; had IHC Model FOK-1370 <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> instead of the Timken front axles used by their competitors; used IHC Model RHT-1590 axles in the rear instead of the Timken axles used by their competitors; and were constructed with fully welded armor with rounded rear corners instead of the bolted armor with square corners used by the other three manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|The {{single wheel}} {{in the front}} is {{responsible}} for the steering, while the engine (also in the <b>front)</b> <b>drives</b> the rear <b>axle.</b> The Reliant Robin aimed to provide economical, predictable personal transportation. The 850cc engine gives an acceleration of 0 to 60 mph in 14 seconds and a top speed of 85 mph, they also give a very good economy figure of up to 70mpg, the later Mk3 Reliant Robin was quoted to give 60 to 100mpg.|$|R
50|$|A dead axle, {{also called}} a lazy axle, {{is not part}} of the drivetrain, but is instead free-rotating. The rear axle of a front-wheel drive car is usually a dead axle. Many trucks and {{trailers}} use dead axles for strictly load-bearing purposes. A dead axle located immediately in <b>front</b> of a <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> is called a pusher axle. A tag axle is a dead axle situated behind a <b>drive</b> <b>axle.</b> Dead axles are also found on semi trailers, farm equipment, and certain heavy construction machinery serving the same function. On some vehicles (such as motorcoaches), the tag axle may be steerable. In some designs the wheels on a lazy axle only come into contact with ground when the load is significant, thus saving unnecessary tire wear.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{four-wheel-drive}} tractors {{with equal}} sized wheels by fitting a <b>driven</b> <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> running from output from a sandwich plate between the gearbox and rear axle casings. Because {{of the size}} of the axle this meant the whole tractor was raised considerably from standard height. However the traction gains were considerable (as with County and Roadless tractors) and Muir-Hills have been and are used for heavy draught applications.|$|R
50|$|Although {{successful}} in its trials, the 6×6 bogie suspension {{was the victim}} of its own success. The WD's development of its patented rear bogie suspension allowed 6×4 vehicles to be built on a commercial chassis, avoiding the complexity of the Hathi's <b>driven</b> <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> Such vehicles had almost as good cross-country performance as the all-wheel-drive 6×6, but at lower cost and with the use of mass production commercial lorry factories, not military vehicle specialists.|$|R
50|$|SP4294 was {{the last}} of 256 Southern Pacific {{articulated}} cab forwards starting with class AC-1. 4294 {{was the last}} in a group of 20 locomotives that comprised SP's AC-12 class of 4-8-8-2 cab forward locomotives. It is essentially two locomotives, linked together, sharing fire box, boiler and crew. Only the front locomotive has its cranks quartered 90 degrees apart. The <b>front</b> and back <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> are free to roll out of phase with respect to each other. If unloaded, the locomotive has a vertical oscillation, near 50 mph, that can lift the tires above the rails.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other key}} {{component}} in the transmission is a transfer case incorporating the torque-splitter, located between the main gear box and the tandem axle. This apportiones the torque from the gearbox between the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> and the <b>driven</b> rear <b>axle.</b> The torque-splitter incorporates a two-step reduction gear and a longitudinal differential. The splitter was available in two versions, featuring slightly different low speed ratios. The [...] "AVV" [...] model provides the vehicle with slow ratio of 2.48:1 whereas the [...] "AVD" [...] provides a ratio of 2.47:1. Using the slow ratio also engages the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> <b>drive.</b> The [...] "AVD" [...] uses a planetary gear that splits the torque in the ratio 23:77 between the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> and the <b>driven</b> rear <b>axle.</b>|$|R
40|$|Constant Velocity [CV] Joints {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of <b>front</b> wheel <b>drive</b> <b>axles.</b> It is subjected to various stresses such as bending stress, shear stress and bearing stress. Apart from these stresses, it is also subjected to vibrations, due to out of balance tire or wheel and an out of round tire or wheel, or a bent rim. The main objective of this work is to reduce the stiffness of the damper, so that the damper can withstand within the required constraints [i. e. the forced frequency range of 80 Hz to 150 Hz]. The free vibrational and forced vibrational effects are investigated to predict the resonance phenomenon of the damper. Finite Element Analysis in ANSYS- 11 software was performed to predict the dynamic behavior of the system under the required vibrational frequencies ranging from 80 Hz to 150 Hz at given loading conditions...|$|R
50|$|The {{main gearbox}} {{contains}} five speed forward of which all are synchronised and one reverse gear. In addition, {{the vehicle is}} equipped with a two-step reduction gear. Both <b>axles</b> are <b>driven</b> and equipped with planetary hub reduction and differential locks. The <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> <b>drive</b> engagement works pneumatically and can be used during driving. Suspension is carried out with leaf springs, the front axle has got also shock absorbers. The service brakes are air operated and the hand brake works by releasing of the air pressure.|$|R
50|$|Single axle {{semi-trailers}} were {{commonly used}} for log transportation in Finland in the 1960s. The maximum axle load of the existing 4×4 Sisu K-40 was often exceeded in logging work. The solution was a truck incorporating {{the addition of a}} non-driven third axle at the back, paired in a tandem axle with the rear <b>driven</b> <b>axle.</b> The new model, the Sisu K-44, was introduced in 1959, with a choice of engine sizes for both the middle-weight ("Kontio") and the heavy ("Jyry") classes. The K-44's <b>driven</b> <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> and transfer case were borrowed from the existing K-40, while the bogie, of which only the first <b>axle</b> was <b>driven,</b> came from the K-34. This drivetrain layout, called 4×4+2, is seldom seen outside Finland. However, Vanajan Autotehdas, SAT's main domestic competitor, had already introduced a similarly configured vehicle a year earlier.|$|R
