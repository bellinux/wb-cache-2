Most of them {{are based on the}} reological properties of the emulsions. There are very few which relay on the direct emulsion observations. In this paper we present the developed method for the emulsion stability evaluation by the direct observation of optical properties. As the stability quantification measure we propose the fractal dimension approach. The method is based on the measure of the emulsion transmittance properties, which are directly dependent on the emulsion stability at the moment of measurement. As the test emulsion the oil in the water emulsion was used. The system is classified as the stable emulsion and our intention was to find the moment when the emulsion starts to break. The emulsion transmittance properties were measured using an acquisition system, consisting of a CCD camera and a fast PC configuration equipped with the capturing software. The fractal dimensions were determined by the so called box counting method. The experimental emulsions were measured continuously within the period of 1200 h, from the moment of the emulsion creation. The changes of fractal dimensions were observed which indicates that the emulsion changed its state and therefore the stability during the time. Three regions of the emulsion life circle were divided according to the fractal <b>dimensions</b> <b>measurement,</b> which can be connected with the stable, unstable, and meta-stable states of the emulsion life circle.

E-service quality is found to be a prime determinant of consumer loyalty which is very important for the growth of any business regardless of the industry. On this study, we have selected four most important dimensions of e-service quality which are: Reliability, Responsiveness, Ease of use, and Security. We adopted a quantitative approach for this study and our survey took place in the area of Umea University. We reached a total of 200 respondents who are used to with purchasing electronic products online. After collecting the data we analyzed it with the help of statistical tools and then interpreted the results in connection to our theoretical framework. We found that all the four dimensions of e-service quality have strong relationship with consumer loyalty which means that they have considerable impact on building and maintaining the loyalty of consumers in electronics retail industry. We found out that the consumers give the highest priority to the organization of website contents and security of transaction. If the company present the e-retailing website convincingly and ensure safety of transaction, the consumers are more likely to show loyalty towards that company. We also found that reliability is less important than the three other factors according to multiple regressions analysis result; though all the four factors found to be significant according to simple regression. This study fulfills the lack of industry-specific study on the relationship between e-service quality and loyalty for consumer electronic goods industry.

40|$|Patch antennas are {{fundamental}} elements in many microwave communications systems. However, patch antennas receive/transmit signals over {{a very narrow}} bandwidth (typically a maximum of 3 % bandwidth). Design modifications directed toward bandwidth expansion generally yield 10 % to 40 % bandwidth. The series varactor tuned patch antenna configuration was the bandwidth enhancement method explored in this research; this configuration is implemented by dividing a patch antenna into multiple sections and placing varactors across the resultant gaps. In addition to yielding a large bandwidth, the configuration {{has a number of}} ancillary benefits, including straightforward integration and design flexibility. Through the research represented by this work, the properties of the series varactor tuned patch antenna, herein referred to as the Fragmented Patch Antenna (or FPA), were explored and optimized. As a result, an innovative patch antenna was produced that yielded 63. 4 % frequency tuning bandwidth and covered a frequency range between 2. 8 and 5. 4 GHz. The wide bandwidth was achieved through a detailed parametric study. The products of this study were the discovery of multiple tuning resonances that were used to expand the tuning bandwidth and the understanding/documentation of the significance of specific antenna <b>dimensions.</b> <b>Measurement</b> results were obtained through the fabrication of a prototype antenna using semiconductor varactors. In the second research phase, the construction of capacitors using the tunable permittivity material Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) was investigated. Using this material in conjunction with nano-fabrication techniques, varactors were developed that had good estimated performance characteristics and were considered appropriate for integration into adaptive microwave circuitry, such as the tunable antenna system. The varactors were constructed by using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling to create a nano-scale capacitive gap in a transmission line. A combination of end-point current detection (EPD) and cross-section scanning electron (SEM) and ion beam (FIB) microscope images were used to optimize the milling procedure. The future extensions of this work include the integration of the BST varactors with the antenna design; the configuration of the developed BST varactors lends itself to a straightforward integration with the FPA antenna...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{increasing}} {{globalization of}} business provides a compelling reason {{for understanding the}} cultural context of consumer behaviour. Our thesis investigates the impact of culture on consumers’ propensity to innovate and consumers’ susceptibility to interpersonal influence that is divided into normative interpersonal influences and informational interpersonal influences. A lot of research has been studied intentionally to find {{the factors that influence}} the acceptation rate of innovation. Culture is considered as one of those factors by some researchers while other researchers find insufficient evidence to support this view, which means that their findings are inconsistent. Moreover, previous studies about the cultures’ role on consumers’ propensity to innovate between Western and Eastern countries are very limited, which inspires us to make a further study in this area. An empirical quantitative study was conducted among 360 young people in Sweden and China based on the independent variable factors, ‘propensity to innovate’, ‘propensity to imitate’, ‘susceptibility to normative interpersonal influence’, and ‘susceptibility to informational interpersonal influence’ by using Hofstede’s (2001) five cultural <b>dimensions.</b> <b>Measurement</b> scales were taken from Baumgartner et al (1996) and Bearden et al (1989). The validity and reliability of factors and scales have been discussed. The findings are unable to identify culture as a variable that statistical significantly affects innovativeness and consumers’ propensity to imitate. In contrast, the results indicate the differential sensitivity of consumers in different national cultures to their susceptibility to normative influence and susceptibility to informational influence. Consumers in more collectivistic, large power distance, strong uncertainty avoidances, and long-term orientation cultures are going to be convinced into adopting new products through normative influence and informational influence. In addition, our research suggests that gender has a significant difference in innovativeness,implying that female have higher innovativeness. Occupation has a significant difference on ‘susceptibility to normative influence’ and ‘susceptibility to informational influence’, while age has no correlation with the four factors. The major implication is that international markers would be better employ normative and informational interpersonal influences to attract consumers to accept innovations when they make marketing strategies to consumers in more collectivist, larger power distance, stronger uncertainty avoidance, more long-term orientation cultures...|$|E
40|$|This thesis enquires into {{major changes}} in the {{measures}} of poverty from 1990 until 2015. Critical reviews here unveils the building blocks of past and present approaches as well as theoretical frameworks of poverty measures at the global level. Issues discussed include conceptualisation of poverty, various perspectives of viewing poverty, the different types and measurement approaches available. Knowledge of poverty measurement is key to understanding the nature of issues that bring about the conditions of the poor and how to establish anti-poverty policies. A review of earlier contributions of scholars to poverty measurement will not only aid knowledge but also influence contemporary researchers’ interest in making relevant contributions to theoretical framework of poverty, policymaking and implementation process. Main measures reviewed include headcount ratio, poverty gap index, Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) class of measures, human poverty index and multidimensional poverty index. I find that in addition to simple monetary measures, non-monetary measures developed from the 1990 s upward enhance a deeper assessment of poverty. This study reveals that observing poverty using the monetary approach results in measuring it in terms of shortage of income to take care of consumption, which suggests eradication of poverty by ensuring economic growth. However, through some illustrations, I show that in spite of economic growth, inequality and poverty prevail. This is in contrast to improving indicators like life expectancy, literacy rate, and gross enrolment ratio and education quality of a society. Generally, an improvement in these measures go together with decreased inequality, which may also reduce the prevalence of poverty in the society. I also realised that in addition to income shortage, poverty is also capability deprivation that reduces the quality of human life and eradicating poverty simply means improving health, literacy and standard of living. Whilst data availability remains a major hindrance, scholars and policy drivers have concluded that poor people’s reports are mostly invaluable to achieving a more accurate estimation of how much poverty there is and how best to overcome the menace it poses. The ideal measure of poverty, however must consider both material wellbeing and other essential elements of human life through which quality of life is guaranteed. When data is collected in relevant <b>dimensions,</b> <b>measurement</b> is not only accurate, but also making informed and effective policies toward poverty eradication can be possible...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{investigating}} complex {{flows in}} rod bundles with spacer grids that have mixing devices (such as flow mixing vanes) have mostly been performed using single-point measurements. Although these measurements allow local comparisons of experimental and numerical data they provide little insight because the discrepancies can {{be due to}} the integrated effects of many complex flow phenomena such as wake-wake, wake-vane, and vane-boundary layer interactions occurring simultaneously in a complex flow environment. In order to validate the simulations results, detailed comparison with experimental data must be done. This work describes an experimental database obtained using Time Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (TR-PIV) measurements within a 5 x 5 rod bundle with spacer-grids. Measurements were performed using two different grid designs. One typical of Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) with swirl type mixing vanes and the other typical of Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) with split type mixing vanes. High quality data was obtained {{in the vicinity of the}} grid using the multi-scale approach. One of the unique characteristic of this set-up is the use of the Matched Index of Refraction (MIR) technique employed in this investigation. This approach allows the use of high temporal and spatial non-intrusive dynamic measurement techniques to investigate the flow evolution below and immediately above the spacer. The experimental data presented includes explanation of the various cases tested such as test rig <b>dimensions,</b> <b>measurement</b> zones, the test equipment and the boundary conditions in order to provide appropriate data for comparison with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Turbulence parameters of the obtained data are analyzed in order to gain insight of the physical phenomena. The shape of the velocity profile at various distances from the spacer show important modifications passing the grid which delineates the significant effects of the presence of the grid spacer. Influence of the vanes wake in the global velocity was quantified to be up to a distance of 4 hydraulic diameters from the edge of the grid. Spatial and temporal correlations in the two measured dimensions were performed to quantify the time and length scales present in the flow in the vicinity of the grids and its influence in the flow modification induced by the vanes. Detection of vortex cores was performed using the vorticity, swirl strength and Galilean decomposition approach. The resulted cores were then tracked in time, in order to observe the evolution of the structures under the influence of the vanes for each grid. Vortex stretching was quantified in order to gain insight of the energy dissipation process normally associated with the phenomena. This work presents data in a single-phase flow situation and an analysis of these data for understanding complex flow structure.

A series of IOLMaster (partial coherence interferometry, optical pachometry) and Echoscan (US 800, Nidek, Tokyo, Japan) (ultrasound) measurements were taken on 179 Chinese children (mean age, 10. 6 0. 8 years) {{taking part in}} a longitudinal study of myopia development, and the measurements were repeated on 37 of these subjects. Results. IOLMaster axial length measurements showed better repeatability (95...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} algorithms {{for measuring}} the fractal dimension of real and complex digital signals embedded in one, two or higher dimensional spaces. Simple, yet efficient MATLAB ® implementations, allowing the fast handling of whole chromosome complex genomic signals, are described. Both global and local fractal <b>dimension</b> <b>measurements</b> are performed, {{as required by the}} fractal structure analysis along DNA molecules. Performance test results, as well as some preliminary results for prokaryote genomic signals, are presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{so-called}} {{triangulation method}} of contact-less <b>dimension</b> <b>measurement</b> determines the measured object’s dimension from its shadow projected on an imaging sensor without lens. A point light source {{is used to}} illuminate the measured object. The so far used linear CCD sensors introduced a considerable uncertainty to the measurement. Application of area CMOS imaging sensors improves the measurement uncertainty and enables to use some new measurement methods. A special CMOS measuring camera was designed for this purpose. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a characteristic of}} fractal <b>dimension</b> <b>measurement.</b> The fractal <b>dimensions</b> are calculated from digital images based on a box-counting method. Three kinds of connections with contours are examined : the 4 -nearest neighbor connection(4 NN), the 8 -nearest neghibor connection(8 NN), and a dilated type(DT). The 4 NN works very well for not only simple shapes of particles but also complicated ones. The other 8 NN and DT cause greater magnitude of errors in lower resolutional images...|$|R
