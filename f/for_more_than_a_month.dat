5|$|If {{signs of}} {{disturbance}} are present <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> {{but less than}} six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting {{less than a month}} may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, while schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E

5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when {{the horrors of the}} latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E
5|$|They first {{prepared}} a cheval de frise to prevent British ships from sailing up the Hudson and outflanking the American position. <b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> the troops transported boulders from {{the heights of}} Manhattan {{to the edge of}} the river, where they loaded them into a collection of hulks and cribs made of timber and stretched it across the river. When the cheval de frise was finished, they began work on the fort. Little soil covered the rocky surface, so men had to haul soil up from the low ground. They were unable to dig the customary ditches or trenches around the fort. The fort was built in the shape of a pentagon with five bastions. The main walls were made of earth, constructed with ravelins with openings for guns from every angle. The fort enclosed a total of three to four acres. The troops built an abbattis around the fort. After the barracks were finished in September, all the troops in the area were placed under the command of Major General William Heath. Washington established his headquarters near the fort.|$|E
