When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E

She later reminisced about her experience with Dupri: [...] "I am so grateful I went to Atlanta," [...] she said. [...] "And I have to say, we wrote {{some of my favorite}} songs on the album. I'm so proud of Jermaine – he's so focused, and he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> to be done." ...|$|E

500|$|..... {{the most}} {{important}} person in the flat [...] was never, ever seen; it was the spirit of Del's (and Rodney's) beloved mother Joan who had passed away 17 years before, and throughout the run of the series Del constantly referred to her and past events within the Trotter Family. ... But much of his historical information was at best contradictory, and [...] outright lies. We were left with a situation where the only person who really <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened was an unreliable witness, so I decided to return to those misty days of 1960 to meet all those characters we'd only ever heard about ...|$|E
500|$|A love {{triangle}} between Natasha, Andrew and Summer is formed. Natasha's {{feelings for}} Andrew grow when they organise a party together, but she notices Andrew's concern for Summer when she collapses and warns Summer away from Andrew. Natasha later asks Andrew if he loves her, {{but he does}} not reply. In December 2010, Summer and Andrew give into their feelings for each other and have sex. Novakovic said Natasha would be [...] "devastated" [...] if she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened and that she would not let Andrew and Summer off lightly. Andrew tells Natasha {{that he is going to}} business meeting, but he meets Summer instead. While they are together in Summer's house, a fire breaks out. Natasha sees the smoke and calls her father and the emergency services before entering the house to rescue Summer, unaware Andrew is also there. Novakovic explained Natasha's ordeal: [...] "Natasha is pulled from the fire by her dad, Michael. Andrew and Summer are rescued separately, and Natasha has no idea of the reason why Andrew was in the house - he was cheating on her with Summer!" [...] After the rescue, Natasha has to come to terms with the fact she will be scarred from a burn she sustains on her neck. Novakovic said that it is a [...] "big deal" [...] for Natasha, as she aspires to be a model and this could ruin her chances. Novakovic also opines that Summer wants nothing more than to be with Andrew, but how can she take him when Natasha tried to save her? Novakovic believed Natasha was blasé to their feelings adding [...] "Deep down, I think Natasha knows that there's something going on, but she doesn't want to admit it to herself. But sooner or later, I reckon she'll have to face the inevitable." ...|$|E

All I have done is call for justice for my son’s death. I have to confess that, {{after so many years}} of waiting, I had lost faith; I never thought we would reach this point. Now I feel a great deal of contentment and of satisfaction. I always <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened.

In the early 1990s, {{with the fall of}} communism, Stoppard found out that all four of his grandparents had been Jewish and had died in Terezin, Auschwitz and other camps, along with three of his mother's sisters. In 1998, following the deaths of his parents he returned to Zlín {{for the first time in}} over 50 years. He has expressed grief both for a lost father and a missing past, but he has no sense of being a survivor, at whatever remove. [...] "I feel incredibly lucky not to have had to survive or die. It's a conspicuous part of what might be termed a charmed life." ...|$|E
