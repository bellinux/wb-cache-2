25|$|While pyridoxine/doxylamine, a {{combination}} of vitamin B6 and <b>doxylamine,</b> is effective in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, some have questioned its effectiveness in HG.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to taking prescription drugs, some evidence shows that an average person seeking short-term help may find relief by taking over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or <b>doxylamine.</b> Diphenhydramine and <b>doxylamine</b> are widely used in nonprescription sleep aids. They are the most effective over-the-counter sedatives currently available, at least in much of Europe, and in Canada, Australia, and the United States, and are more sedating than some prescription hypnotics. Antihistamine effectiveness for sleep may decrease over time, and anticholinergic side-effects (such as dry mouth) {{may also be a}} drawback with these particular drugs. While addiction {{does not seem to be}} an issue with this class of drugs, they can induce dependence and rebound effects upon abrupt cessation of use. However, people whose insomnia is caused by restless legs syndrome may have worsened symptoms with antihistamines.|$|E
25|$|The H1 {{receptor}} antagonism of doxepin {{is responsible}} for its hypnotic effects and its effectiveness {{in the treatment of}} insomnia at low doses. The incidence of side effects with doxepin and its safety at these doses was similar to that of placebo in clinical trials; the most frequent side effects were headache and somnolence/sedation, both with an incidence of less than 5%. Other side effects sometimes associated with antihistamines, including daytime sedation, increased appetite, and weight gain, all were not observed. Clinical evidence of H1 receptor antagonists and TCAs for the treatment insomnia shows mixed effectiveness and is limited in its quality due to weaknesses like small sample sizes and poor generalizability. However, doxepin is a unique and notable exception; it has been well-studied in the treatment of insomnia and shows consistent benefits with excellent tolerability and safety. Aside from diphenhydramine and <b>doxylamine,</b> which have historical approval as hypnotics, doxepin is the only H1 receptor antagonist that is specifically approved for the treatment of insomnia in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Studies of <b>doxylamine's</b> {{carcinogenicity}} in {{mice and}} rats have produced positive results for both liver and thyroid cancer, especially in the mouse. [...] The carcinogenicity of the drug in humans is not well studied, and the IARC lists the drug as [...] "not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans".|$|R
25|$|At {{very low}} doses, doxepin has not shown {{discontinuation}} or withdrawal effects nor rebound insomnia. Sustained effectiveness without apparent tolerance was demonstrated in clinical studies {{of up to}} 12weeks duration. This {{appears to be in}} contrast to over-the-counter antihistamines like diphenhydramine and <b>doxylamine</b> and all other first-generation antihistamines, which are associated with rapid development of tolerance and dependence (by day 3 or 4 of continuous dosing) and loss of hypnotic effectiveness. It is for this reason that, unlike doxepin, they are not recommended for the chronic management of insomnia and are advised for only short-term treatment (i.e., 1week). It is not entirely clear why doxepin and first-generation antihistamines are different in this regard, but {{it has been suggested that}} it may have to do with the lack of selectivity for the H1 receptor of the latter or may have to do with the use of optimal doses. Unlike very-low-dose doxepin, most first-generation antihistamines also have marked anticholinergic activity as well as associated side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and confusion. This is particularly true in older people, and antihistamines with concomitant anticholinergic effects are not recommended in adults over the age of 65. Anticholinergic activity notably may interfere with the sleep-promoting effects of H1 receptor blockade.|$|E
2500|$|Itching and {{flushing}} {{and other}} effects of blood vessel dilation are also common side-effects, due to histamine release {{in response to}} the drug using one or more types of receptors in the CNS or other responses elsewhere in the body. [...] First-generation antihistamines such as tripelennamine (Pyrabenzamine), clemastine (Tavist), hydroxyzine (Atarax), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cyproheptadine (Periactin), brompheniramine (Dimetapp), chlorphenamine (Chlor-Trimeton), <b>doxylamine</b> (NyQuil) and phenyltoloxamine (Percogesic Original Formula) not only combat the histamine-driven side-effects, but are analgesic-sparing (potentiating) in various degrees. The antihistamine promethazine (Phenergan) may also {{have a positive effect on}} hepatic metabolism of dihydrocodeine as it does with codeine. Higher doses of promethazine may interfere with most other opioids with the exception of the pethidine family (Demerol and the like) by this or other unknown mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{medications}} {{found in the}} toxicological analysis may be prescribed in the United States for insomnia, anxiety, pain, or common cold (<b>doxylamine)</b> symptoms, {{the vast majority of}} physicians in the US are extremely reluctant to prescribe multiple benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam, and temazepam) to a single patient, let alone prescribe the same to a patient already taking a mix of oxycodone and hydrocodone. Although the Associated Press and other media reported that [...] "police estimate Ledger's time of death between 1pm and 2:45pm [...] " [...] (on 22 January 2008), the Medical Examiner's Office announced {{that it would not be}} publicly disclosing the official estimated time of death. The official announcement of the cause and manner of Ledger's death heightened concerns about the growing problems of prescription drug abuse or misuse and combined drug intoxication (CDI).|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, codeine {{preparations}} must be {{sold only}} at a pharmacy. Preparations will often {{be a combination of}} paracetamol (500mg), ibuprofen (200mg) and <b>doxylamine</b> succinate (5mg), and the codeine content may range from 5mg to 15mg; preparations with in excess of 15mg per tablet are S4 (Schedule 4, or [...] "Prescription Only") medications. The item is given over the counter, no prescriptions, at the discretion of the pharmacist. Most preparations are considered S3 (schedule 3, or [...] "Pharmacist Only") medications, meaning that they must be sold with the direct involvement of a pharmacist. It must be labelled and usage history monitored by the pharmacist to help deter misuse and dependence. The exception to this rule is cold and flu preparations such as [...] "Codral". These preparations contain phenylephrine (5mg), paracetamol (500mg) and codeine (9.5mg) or phenylephrine (5mg), paracetamol (500mg), chlorpheniramine (2mg) and codeine (9.5mg).|$|E
2500|$|Doxepin is {{a highly}} potent antihistamine, with this being its strongest activity. In fact, doxepin has been {{said to be the}} most or one of the most potent H1 {{receptor}} antagonists available, with one study finding an in vitro Ki of 0.17nM. It is the most potent and selective H1 receptor antagonist of the TCAs (although the tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) mirtazapine is slightly more potent), and other sedating antihistamines, for instance the over-the-counter diphenhydramine (Ki = 16nM) and <b>doxylamine</b> (Ki = 42nM), show far lower affinities for this receptor in comparison. The affinity of doxepin for the H1 receptor is far greater than its affinity for other sites, and 10- to 100-fold higher doses are needed for antidepressant effects. In accordance, although it is often described as a [...] "dirty drug" [...] due to its highly promiscuous binding profile, doxepin acts as a highly selective antagonist of the H1 receptor at very low doses (less than 10mg; typically 3 to 6mg). At these doses, it notably has no clinically relevant anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth or cognitive/memory impairment, unlike most other sedating antihistamines, and similarly has no effect on other receptors such as adrenergic and serotonin receptors.|$|E
