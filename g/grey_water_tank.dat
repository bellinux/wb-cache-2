40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{emphasized}} by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), a national consensus-based standard under the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) for developing sustainable or high performance buildings, is water efficiency. A LEED registered project can attain up to five points under water efficiency upon successful integration of various techniques to conserve water. Many techniques are available to conserve <b>water</b> and <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reuse is one option considered by many LEED registered projects. In spite of widespread popularity, some of the sustainable techniques including <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reuse, which is recommended by the USGBC and various agencies engaged in green building constructions, are not viable {{in many parts of}} the United States due to their effects on construction cost and project schedules. Even though a project could get one or multiple points upon successful implementation of a <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reuse system and conserving potable water, the following factors may have a positive or negative effect on the design team?s decision to implement a <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reuse system: capital cost, maintenance cost, LEED credits, local plumbing codes, project schedule, local water conservation issues, complexity of the system, etc. Implementation of a <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reuse system has a significant effect on the capital cost of a project. The increase in cost may be attributed to dual sanitary and <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> distribution piping which doubles construction piping costs. Disinfection treatment, filtration, overflow protection, <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> storage <b>tanks,</b> etc. also add to the cost of construction. Ninety percent of the projects claim that project schedule is not affected by the implementation of a <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reuse system in a green building project. The factors which prevent the project team from implementing a <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reuse system include capital cost, maintenance cost, local plumbing codes, local water conservation issues, complexity of the system, etc. LEED credits and the spirit of sustainability are the factors which have a positive effect on the design team?s decision to implement a <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reuse system...|$|R

40|$|The reuse of <b>grey</b> <b>water,</b> for {{applications}} such as toilet flushing and irrigation, represents a potential sustainable solution to water shortages experienced by regions worldwide. Although reused <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> is not intended for potable use, the potential for transmission of waterborne pathogens by aerosol inhalation, topical contact, or indirect ingestion is a key concern for <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reuse. This thesis explores the pathogen content of <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> and investigates pathogen removal through treatment and disinfection processes. The impacts of organic and particulate material in <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> on the efficacy of disinfection processes are investigated in depth. <b>Grey</b> <b>water</b> can potentially harbour a range of pathogenic microorganisms, with opportunistic bacterial pathogens in <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> indicating a particular risk of <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reuse for the vulnerable members of society. The disinfection of <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> is therefore critical prior to reuse. Particulate material in <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> limits the efficacy of disinfection by chlorine, ultraviolet light, and origanum essential oil, by shielding microorganisms from the applied disinfectant. Microbial resistance to the disinfectants {{was linked to the}} particle size distribution of the <b>grey</b> <b>water,</b> with increasing particle size offering greater protection to associated microorganisms. Additional organic material was shown to reduce the applied disinfectant but no impact on microorganism resistance to disinfection was observed when a constant disinfectant dose was maintained. Treatment of <b>grey</b> <b>water,</b> targeting the removal of large particulate material, improves the efficacy of <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> disinfection, allowing compliance with stringent microbiological standards for urban water reuse.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Grey</b> <b>water</b> – {{wastewater}} {{from the}} bath, shower and washing machine – {{is available to}} all residential water users as a personal, on-site water resource (POSWAR). Despite contradicting reports on the value versus danger of on-site reuse, <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> constitutes a significant fraction (± 50 %) of wastewater flow from a typical suburban home, where pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) enter the water stream as soluble substances at grey-water producing points in a home. The work focuses {{on the impact of}} prolonged <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reuse on soil chemistry and vegetation growth. An internet survey of 19 respondents suggests that garden watering is the predominant application for untreated, private on-site <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> reused in South African urban areas. As part of this research 15 different soil samples were collected from <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> use points and control points on 6 properties in the Western Cape, South Africa.

The amount of <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> produced per person in The Netherlands is about 90 Ld- 1, accounting for up to 75 % of the wastewater volume produced by households, and over 90 % if vacuum toilets are installed. <b>Grey</b> <b>water</b> is relatively low in pollution and therefore, after appropriate treatment, has great potential for reuse in non-potable applications such as infiltration, irrigation, toilet flushing, laundry water, etc. The goal of this thesis {{was to develop a}} treatment concept for <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> to exploit its reuse potential. A special focus of this thesis was set on the study of organic micropollutants from personal care and household chemicals. <b>Grey</b> <b>water</b> (from 32 houses in Sneek, The Netherlands) contains, on average, 724 - 150 mgL- 1 of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 27 - 12 mgL- 1 of total nitrogen, 7. 2 - 4. 2 mgL- 1 of phosphorus and 41 - 12 mgL- 1 of anionic surfactants. The high biodegradability of <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> (70 - 5 %) indicated the possibility of recovering COD as methane. Biological treatment of <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> was conducted in three systems, aerobic, anaerobic and combined anaerobic + aerobic, at a total hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 - 13 hours at 32 °C. Aerobic treatment in a sequencing batch reactor resulted in COD removal of 90 %, which was significantly higher than 51 % removal by anaerobic treatment in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. <b>Grey</b> <b>water</b> treatment in a combined anaerobic + aerobic system resulted in a COD removal efficiency of 89 %. The application of a UASB reactor for the pre-treatment of <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> yielded a small amount of energy.
