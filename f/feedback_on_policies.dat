40|$|Abstract Robust {{motion control}} {{algorithms}} are {{fundamental to the}} successful, autonomous operation of mobile robots. Motion control {{is known to be}} a difficult problem, and is often dictated by a policy, or state-action mapping. In this chapter, we present an approach for the refinement of mobile robot motion control policies, that incorporates corrective feedback from a human teacher. The target application domain of this work is the low-level motion control of a mobile robot. Within such domains, the rapid sampling rate and continuous action space of policies are both key challenges to providing policy corrections. To address these challenges, we contribute advice-operators as a corrective feedback form suitable for providing continuous-valued corrections, and Focused Feedback For Mobile Robot Policies (F 3 MRP) as a framework suitable for providing <b>feedback</b> <b>on</b> <b>policies</b> sampled at a high frequency. Under our approach, policies refined through teacher feedback are initially derived using Learning from Demonstration (LfD) techniques, which generalize a policy from example task executions by a teacher. We apply our techniques within the Advice-Operator Policy Improvement (A-OPI) algorithm, validated on a Segway RMP robot within a motion control domain. A-OPI refines LfD policies by correcting policy performance via advice-operators and F 3 MRP. Within our validation domain, policy performance is found to improve with corrective teacher feedback, and moreover to be similar or superior to that of policies provided with more teacher demonstrations...|$|E

This paper provides case study research to explore the possibility that post-colonial extractive institutions were already present in pre-colonial times. In Zambia’s case this is indeed true. Extractive institutions existed in Zambia before colonisation, and colonisation certainly did not improve on them. The question whether countries like Zambia are doomed for failure is also considered, and it is concluded that an environment that allows experimentation is supportive of economic growth and development. With an authoritative regime during the Second Republic, <b>feedback</b> <b>on</b> <b>policy</b> decisions was limited and may provide more of an answer to bad post-colonial economic performance than extractive colonisation.

We explore how a particular kind of state transition system can be con-structed to serve as a semantic model to support reasoning about alternative policy decisions. The policy making process includes stages that support the construction of a model, which can then be exploited in reasoning. The reasoning itself will be driven by a par-ticular argumentation scheme for practical reasoning, {{and the ways in which}} arguments based on this scheme can be attacked and eval-uated.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explain why the European Union {{ratcheted}} up restrictive measures on Myanmar from 1991 until 2010, despite divergent interests of EU member states and the apparent inability of sanctions to quickly achieve the primary objectives of EU policy. This empirical puzzle applies the ‘sanctions paradox’ to the issue of joint action in the EU. It also connects the assessment of policy effectiveness to EU foreign policy-making. The investigation unravels this conundrum through competitive theory testing. The study discovers that EU foreign policy was essentially decided by the largest member states. Since 1996, the UK has fostered a consensus among EU policymakers on a principled common policy, which would induce political reform in Myanmar mainly via the implementation of punitive measures. Hence, noncompliance by the target with EU demands offers a credible, but insufficient explanation of why the EU tightened its sanctions regime. US pressure <b>on</b> EU <b>policy</b> was marginal. The dissertation argues that a ‘normative’ interpretation of liberal intergovernmentalism best solves this puzzle. The EU met domestic pressures for action, although the measures adopted were clearly too inadequate to be effective. <b>Feedback</b> <b>on</b> <b>policy</b> effectiveness did not {{play a significant role in}} EU decision-making. EU policy was driven by a consensus to treat Myanmar as a ‘pariah’ state. Ideological motivations have largely outweighed material interests. Normative arguments were necessary to put proposals on the common agenda; yet, decisions ultimately involved ‘cooperative bargaining’ among the largest states. Consensus building was therefore a dynamic process. The policy entrepreneur defined its interests domestically; member states with lower preference intensity generally refrained from opposing its leadership. This thesis thus contributes to the liberal intergovernmental scholarship by proposing a more comprehensive explanation for the drivers and constraints that influence the making of European sanctions...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of context dynamics {{in the course}} of the climate change mitigation policy instruments’ (PIs) deployment cycle, usually causes a need for policy adaptation mechanisms to ensure that policies can meet the sector needs efficiently and effectively. In this paper, we argue that important contextual factors are the ones that are perceived to have a great impact over policy effectiveness by key related actors. By examining more thoroughly those effects over PIs, as perceived by policy and market actors, useful <b>feedback</b> <b>on</b> observed <b>policy</b> adaptations can be highlighted. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present a conceptual framework which seeks to investigate the impact of key external factors <b>on</b> <b>policy</b> decision-making. This framework is then applied to policies intended to foster sustainability in the Greek building sector. Contextual parameters that are influential over the effectiveness of the national energy conservation measures are identified through a stakeholder survey. Cluster analysis is then employed for the elicitation of three distinct decision-making priorities’ scenarios. General macroeconomic trends, energy costs, characteristics of the building sector and socio-institutional factors are prioritized differently from various types of actors and induce certain types of PI changes. Distinguishing among the different types of PI change can help explain better under which contextual circumstances policy adaptations occur and provide guidance to other policy makers when found in similar decisional contexts...|$|R

Despite evidence of the powerful effects that investigative journalism and expos鳠have on policymaking processes, very little work has specifically investigated the links between the media and policymaking in the past. Things started to change in 1986, when Martin Linsky wrote the seminal book Impact: How the Press Affects Federal Policymaking. Unfortunately though, this field still tends to be rather under theorized, even today. Through the media, citizens learn how government policies will affect them, and governments gain <b>feedback</b> <b>on</b> their <b>policies</b> and programs.

The results showed that this policy was integrated because of its social perspective, the high number of involved stakeholders, the willingness to handle water issues, and the local scale suitable for participation. We emphasized the prominence of the watershed scale guaranteed by the local water authority. This area was also characterized by compromise, arrangements, and power dynamics on a fine scale. We examined the most politically engaged writings regarding water management, which topics each group emphasized, and how the groups agreed and disagreed on issues based on their values and context.

40|$|Almost {{thirty years}} ago, Harold Proshansky argued that if {{environmental}} psychology was to survive, {{it needed to}} “strengthen itself as a social institution”. While we can find much {{evidence to suggest that}} environmental psychology has achieved this, in so doing it has tended to concentrate on changes to individual consumption behaviours and lifestyles, rather than focusing on the everyday lives and conditions which frame the actions of individuals and communities. People live, work, and act in cooperation with others and this cooperation is shaped by and shapes individual and collective identities and actions. One of the central places where people act collectively is the workplace. Two case studies are presented. The first employed backcasting scenarios to explore employees’ visions for an alternative, sustainable future and involved scenario development by creating visions for the future, defining strategic pathways to reach them, providing <b>feedback</b> <b>on</b> how <b>policy</b> measures would function in a simulated environment and asking participants to suggest corrections to their initial proposals and the model design.

40|$|We use the Li-Strahler geometric-optical model {{combined}} with a scaling-based approach to detect forest structural changes in the Three Gorges region of China. The physical-based Li-Strahler model can be inverted to retrieve forest structural properties. One of the main input variables for the inverted model is the fractional component of sunlit background, which is calculated by using pure reflectance spectra (endmembers) of surface components. In this study, we extract these endmembers from moderate spatial resolution MODIS data using two scaling-based methods (namely, a regional based linear unmixing and a purest-pixel approach) relying on corresponding high spatial resolution Landsat TM images. Then, the forest structural property crown closure (CC) is estimated by inverting the Li-Strahler model based on the extracted endmembers. Changes in CC are mapped using MODIS mosaics dated 2002 and 2004 for the whole Three Gorges region. Validation of the estimated CC using 25 sample sites indicates that the regional scaling-based endmembers extracted using linear unmixing are more suitable {{to be used in}} combination with the inverted Li-Strahler model for monitoring the forest CC than the purest-pixel approach, and results in significantly better estimates in both years (R- 2002 (2) = 0. 614, RMSE 2002 = 6 %, R- 2004 (2) = 0. 631 and RMSE 2004 = 5. 2 %). A change detection map of the model derived CC in 2002 and 2004 shows a decrease in CC in the eastern counties of the Three Gorges region located close to the Three Gorges Dam.
