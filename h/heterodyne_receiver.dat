5000|$|In 1901 Reginald Fessenden {{had invented}} a better means of {{accomplishing}} this. [...] In his <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> an unmodulated sine wave radio signal at a frequency fO offset from the incoming radio wave carrier fC {{was applied to}} a rectifying detector such as a crystal detector or electrolytic detector, along with the radio signal from the antenna. In the detector the two signals mixed, creating two new heterodyne (beat) frequencies at the sum fC + fO and the difference fC − fO between these frequencies. By choosing fO correctly the lower heterodyne fC − fO was in the audio frequency range, so it was audible as a tone in the earphone whenever the carrier was present. Thus the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of Morse code were audible as musical [...] "beeps". A major attraction of this method during this pre-amplification period was that the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> actually amplified the signal somewhat, the detector had [...] "mixer gain".|$|E
5000|$|In 1901, Reginald Fessenden {{demonstrated}} a direct-conversion <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> or beat receiver {{as a method}} of making continuous wave radiotelegraphy signals audible. Fessenden's receiver did not see much application because of its local oscillator's stability problem. While complex isochronous electromechanical oscillators existed, a stable yet inexpensive local oscillator was not available until Lee de Forest invented the triode vacuum tube oscillator. [...] In a 1905 patent, Fessenden stated that the frequency stability of his local oscillator was one part per thousand.|$|E

40|$|Review of {{infrared}} {{coherent detection}} processes. Three receivers are described which were built {{with the primary}} goal of exploiting quantum noise limited heterodyne detection in a spectral region where atmospheric transmission characteristics are favorable. The combination of high power, high efficiency carbon dioxide lasers, coherent <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> with sensitivities approaching the quantum noise limit, and low-loss atmospheric transmission have presented new possibilities in infrared communications and radar. In particular, high sensitivity 10. 6 micrometer <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> with wide IF bandwidths have been developed...|$|R
50|$|Because the superregenerative {{detectors}} tend {{to receive}} the strongest signal and ignore other signals in the nearby spectrum, the superregen works best with bands that are relatively free of interfering signals. Due to Nyquist's theorem, its quenching frequency {{must be at least}} twice the signal bandwidth. But quenching with overtones acts further as a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> mixing additional unneeded signals from those bands into the working frequency. Thus the overall bandwidth of superregenerator cannot be less than 4 times that of the quench frequency, assuming the quenching oscillator produces an ideal sine wave.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of the circuit was that the tube {{could be made to}} oscillate, and thus a single tube could serve as both a beat frequency oscillator and a detector, functioning as a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> to make CW radiotelegraphy transmissions audible. [...] This mode was called an autodyne receiver. To receive radiotelegraphy, the feedback was increased until the tube oscillated, then the oscillation frequency was tuned {{to one side of the}} transmitted signal. The incoming radio carrier signal and local oscillation signal mixed in the tube and produced an audible heterodyne (beat) tone at the difference between the frequencies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receiver,</b> {{which uses}} a superconducting-insulator-superconducting (SIS) Josephson {{junction}} as the mixer, is the two-backshort design of Kerr (Pan et al. 1983). A scalar feed couples the microwave signal to the receiver, where it is mixed with a local oscillator (LO) signal to produce a 1.4 GHz intermediate frequency (IF) signal that is further amplified with a low-noise high electron mobility field effect transistor (HEMT FET) amplifier, and passed to the IF section of the receiver. The IF section further amplifies the signal and heterodynes it down to 150 MHz, passing a bandwidth of 200 MHz to the spectrometer.|$|E

Attention is presently given to the technical challenges faced by terahertz-range receiver developers, and {{it is noted that}} optically pumped sub-mm lasers furnish the only practical local oscillation source for <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> in the 600 - 3000 GHz range.

50|$|The JCMT is also {{equipped}} with three <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receivers,</b> which allow submillimetre spectral line observations to be made. The spectral-line mapping {{capabilities of the}} JCMT have been greatly enhanced by the commissioning of HARP-B, a 350 GHz, 16 element <b>heterodyne</b> array <b>receiver.</b> HARP-B, and the other heterodyne instruments, {{can be used in}} conjunction with the JCMT's new digital autocorrelation spectrometer, ACSIS.|$|R
40|$|<b>Heterodyne</b> <b>receivers,</b> which down-convert radio {{frequency}} (RF) signals to intermediate frequency (IF) signals - preserving the amplitude and phase information {{of the incoming}} radiation, are generally the detector of choice for high resolution spectroscopic studies in astrophysics and planetary remote sensing...|$|R
50|$|IQ {{imbalance}} is a performance-limiting {{issue in}} the design of direct conversion receivers, also known as zero intermediate frequency (IF) or homodyne receivers. Such a design translates the received radio frequency (RF, or passband) signal directly from the carrier frequency (fc) to baseband using only one mixing stage. The traditional <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> structure needs an intermediate-frequency (IF) stage between the RF and baseband signals. The direct conversion receiver structure does not have an IF stage, and does not need an image rejection filter. Due to the lower component count, it is easier to integrate. However, a direct-conversion RF front-end suffers from two major drawbacks: one is IQ imbalance and the other is DC offset. When designing a homodyne receiver, control of IQ imbalance is necessary to limit signal demodulation error.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1915 the tikker was {{replaced}} by a better means of accomplishing the same thing; the [...] "heterodyne receiver" [...] invented by Reginald Fessenden in 1902. In this an electronic oscillator generated a radio signal at a frequency fo offset from the incoming radio wave carrier fC. This was applied to the rectifying detector with the radio carrier. In the detector the two signals mixed, creating a heterodyne (beat) signal at the difference fC - fC between these frequencies, which was in the audio frequency range. The heterodyne provided the audible tone in the earphone whenever the carrier was present. After vacuum tube oscillators were invented in 1913 by Alexander Meissner the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> replaced the tikker. Today the heterodyne method is still used to receive CW signals, and the beat frequency oscillator (BFO) is a standard part of all communications receivers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{receiver}} {{was ahead}} of its time, because when it was invented there was no oscillator capable of producing the radio frequency sine wave fO with the required stability. [...] Fessenden first used his large radio frequency alternator, but this wasnt practical for ordinary receivers. The <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> remained a laboratory curiosity until a cheap compact source of continuous waves appeared, the vacuum tube electronic oscillator invented by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner in 1913. [...] After this it became the standard method of receiving CW radiotelegraphy. The heterodyne oscillator is the ancestor of the beat frequency oscillator (BFO) {{which is used to}} receive radiotelegraphy in communications receivers today. The heterodyne oscillator had to be retuned each time the receiver was tuned to a new station, but in modern superheterodyne receivers the BFO signal beats with the fixed intermediate frequency, so the beat frequency oscillator can be a fixed frequency.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the communication and maintenance van, other AN/MSQ-77 trailers were the 33 ft radar van with roof-mounted Cassegrain antenna, [...] "control and plotting van, two diesel generator vans, and an administrative and supply van" [...] which were emplaced as a military installation at the surveyed site. [...] The primary modification for the AN/MSQ-77 was the control equipment for aircraft guidance (ballistic computer, guidance/release circuitry, and UHF command equipment). The central also had an added beacon tracking capability used when the aircraft had a receiver/transmitter (e.g., Motorola SST-181 X Band Beacon Transponder)http://www.1stcombatevaluationgroup.com/1CEVG_skyspot_history.PDF to increase the range so the radar site could be located farther from the hostile region of bombing targets. Beacon track upgrades included radar circuitry to switch the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> to demodulate the transponder frequency, compensation for the transponder delay, and modification of the central's plotting board circuitry to allow display for increased ranges. The plots were of tracks calculated by the computer's Aircraft Coordinates and Plotting Group which converted radar spherical data to plotting board cartesian coordinates (non-inertial east, north, up coordinate system) using sine/cosine voltages and radar-estimated range respectively from the Antenna Group (azimuth/elevation resolvers) and from the Track Range Computer. Additional A/C Coordinates amplifiers computed the velocity components (not plotted) which along with the track position components were provided as initial bomb conditions to the ballistic computer (Bomb Trajectory Group).|$|E

40|$|<b>Heterodyne</b> <b>receivers,</b> which down-convert radio {{frequency}} (RF) signals to intermediate frequency (IF) signals – preserving the amplitude and phase information {{of the incoming}} radiation, are generally the detector of choice for high resolution spectroscopic studies in astrophysics and planetary remote sensing. Many interesting astronomical objects, such as galaxies, molecular clouds, star-forming regions, proto-stars, and planets have rich submillimeter spectra. Much {{can be learned from}} these spectra, including the structure, dynamics, chemistry, energy balance, mass, density, and temperature of the sources. High resolution spectroscopy is very often required to avoid line blending and resolve the line shapes. <b>Heterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> provide both the sensitivity and resolution for such studies. Moreover, <b>heterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> at submillimeter wavelengths are increasingly being used in medical imaging and contraband detection. However, {{it is clear that the}} future instruments, specifically the space-based observatories with cold telescopes, will demand heterodyne arrays for higher sensitivity, greater mapping speed, large scale mapping ability, multiple line spectroscopy, and imaging capability. Passive and/or active heterodyne focal plane arrays would have profound impact on medical diagnostics, contraband detections, and astrophysical spectroscopy and imaging applications. However, only a handful of heterodyne array instruments at submillimeter wavelengths with a limited number of pixels are currently operational or being developed for astrophysical studies.
