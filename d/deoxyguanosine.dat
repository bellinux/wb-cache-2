25|$|The {{genetic code}} {{was most likely}} based on DNA. Some {{studies suggest that the}} LUCA may have lacked DNA and been defined wholly through RNA. If DNA was present, it was {{composed}} of four nucleotides (deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, deoxythymidine, and <b>deoxyguanosine),</b> to the exclusion of other possible deoxynucleotides. The DNA was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent enzyme, DNA polymerase. The integrity of the DNA was maintained by a group of maintenance enzymes, including DNA topoisomerase, DNA ligase and other DNA repair enzymes. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as histones. The genetic code was composed of three-nucleotide codons, thus producing 64 different codons. Since only 20 amino acids were used, multiple codons code for the same amino acids.|$|E

40|$|Mitomycin C reduced with sodium {{borohydride}} induced the DNA damage at <b>deoxyguanosines</b> preferentially in dinucleotide sequence G-T. The DNA damage produced strand breaks when subsequently heated. The DNA damage scarcely {{occurred when the}} end-labeled DNA was preincubated with ethidium bromide or actinomycin D before the addition of mitomycin C and the reducing agent. Fully reduced mitomycin C did not induce the DNA damage. The mitomycin C-inducing DNA damage seems to require the intercalation of the partially reduced mitomycin C of short life time, probably semiquinone radical, between DNA base pairs. The inhibitory effects of sodium chloride and radical scavengers suggested that the requirement of the covalent bond formation of mitomycin C to DNA and the involvement of oxygen radicals in the DNA damage. 7 -N-(p-hydroxyphenyl) mitomycin C, which is reported to show a higher antitumor activity and a lower toxicity than mitomycin C, was readily reduced with dithiothreitol and induced the sequence-specific DNA damage, whereas mitomycin C was not...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} 2 ’-deoxy- 2 ’-fluoroarabinonucleotide {{residues}} (2 ’F-araN) on different G-quadruplexes {{derived from a}} thrombin-binding DNA aptamer d(G 2 T 2 G 2 TGTG 2 T 2 G 2), an anti-HIV phosphorothioate aptamer PS-d(T 2 G 4 T 2) and a DNA telomeric sequence d(G 4 T 4 G 4) via UV thermal melting (Tm) and circular dichroism (CD) experiments has been investigated. Generally, replacement of <b>deoxyguanosines</b> that adopt the anti conformation (antiguanines) with 2 ’F-araG can stabilize G-quartets and maintain the quadruplex conformation, while replacement of syn-guanines with 2 ’F-araG is not favored and results in a dramatic switch to an alternative quadruplex conformation. It was found that incorporation of 2 ’F-araG or T residues into a thrombin-binding DNA G-quadruplex stabilizes the complex ("Tm up to »+ 38 C/ 2 ’F-araN modification); 2 ’F-araN units also increased the half-life in 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) up to 48 -fold. Two modified thrombin-binding aptamers (PG 13 and PG 14) show an approximately 4 -fold increase in binding affinity to thrombin, as assessed via a nitrocellulose filter binding assay, both with increased thermal stability (» 18 C/ 2 ’F-ANA modification increase in Tm) and nuclease resistance (4 – 7 -fold) as well.

40|$|The {{antitumor}} {{activity of}} cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II (cis-platin) {{is believed to}} be related to its covalent interaction with DNA where a major DNA binding product is an intrastrand N 7 -bidentate adduct on adjacent <b>deoxyguanosines.</b> A novel immu-noassay was used to quantitate this adduct in buffy coat DNA from testicular and ovarian cancer patients undergoing cisplatin therapy. 44 out of 120 samples taken from 45 cisplatin patients had detectable cisplatin-DNA adducts. No adducts were detected in 18 samples of DNA taken from normal controls, patients on other chemotherapy, or patients before treatment. The quantity of measurable adducts increased as a function of cumulative dose of cisplatin. This was observed both during repeated daily infusion of the drug and over long-term, repeated 21 - 28 d cycles of ad-ministiation. These results suggested that adduct removal is slow even though the tissue has a relatively rapid turnover. Patients receiving cisplatin {{for the first time on}} 56 -d cycles, and those given high doses of cisplatin as a "salvage " regimen, did not accumulate adducts as rapidly as patients on first time chemo-therapy on 21 - or 28 -d cycles. Disease response data, evaluated for 33 cisplatin-treated patients, showed a positive correlation between the formation of DNA adducts and response to drug therapy. However, more data will be required to confirm this relationship. These data show that specific immunological probes can readily be applied to quantitate DNA adducts in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Gradual {{depletion}} {{of the ozone layer}} and consequently, increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the Earth's surface induces DNA-lesions inside the genome, thereby causing mutations. Three kinds of photoproducts are mainly formed, namely: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), pyrimidine-(6 - 4) -pyrimidone dimer [(6 - 4) PP] and the Dewar valence isomer of (6 - 4) PP lesion. The formation of these photolesions is a major cause of cell death (aging) and fatal disease like skin cancer. A part of this research was performed to investigate the formation and characterization of DNA-lesions under UVC radiation. Small, fluorescent labeled oligonucleotide hairpins (DNA, RNA and mixed DNA-RNA) were employed to this purpose. The amount of damage was quantified using HPLC. Here, a new method was developed, using ion-exchange SAX-column which works at pH = 13, to measure the lesion formation in a direct way. In order to know which lesions are formed, the irradiated hairpins were enzymatically digested. The lesions were separated by HPLC followed by their characterization using MS/MS fragmentation analysis. Investigation was performed to understand the impact of the neighboring nucleobases on the photo-reactivity of a dTpdT-dinucleotide. For this, hairpins were prepared in various sequential contexts. Analysis of these irradiated hairpins revealed the surprising result that the reactivity is strongly reduced when a dTpdT dinucleotide is locked between two neighboring 2 '- <b>deoxyguanosines,</b> strongly implying that genomic DNA will be inhomogeneously damaged and hence mutated under UVC radiation. In order to account for the effect of oligonucleotide conformations (A versus B) on the photolesions formation, DNA, RNA and mixed DNA-RNA hairpins were irradiated. The most surprising observation is that the oligonucleotide hairpins, possessing more A-like conformations were found to be very much resistant to UVC degradation. RNA hairpins containing UpU dinucleotides were found to be fully protected from being damaged. A short, dTpdT-containing DNA stretch, embedded in an A-like RNA environment, was also found to be highly stable under UVC light. In the second part of this study, investigation was performed to assay the activities of CPD-photolyase enzyme isolated from different organisms. A synthetic cis-syn thymidine dimer with an open backbone was incorporated into DNA. CPD-photolyases were found to recognize and split this CPDlesion, via a cycloreversion process, into two 2 '-deoxythymidine monomers. In order to profile the activities of photolyases and also to study photolyase activity inside living cell, a sensitive DNA-probe, known as molecular beacon was synthesized. The hairpin probe, which features a loop and stem structure contains the model CPD-lesion in its loop region. The molecular beacon (MB 1) in its closed form, is non-fluorescent due to efficient energy transfer (FRET) from the 5 '-FAM to 3 '-Dabsyl. The MB 1 was designed to undergo strand break on reaction with photolyase in presence of light, thus separating the FAM and the Dabsyl and causing the fluorescence of FAM to be restored. The activities of the photolyase can be studied by monitoring the fluorescence change. Activities of CPDphotolyase isolated from A. nidulans and A. thaliana were studied using this MBprobe. The sensitivity of this probe was tested with wild-type cell-extract from A. thaliana. The fishing-out of photolyase activity from this wild-type extract was possible. Effort was made to investigate the repair process within a living cell, using laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. The insertion of this artificial, chemically modified DNA-substrate in the cell nucleus was achieved...|$|R
