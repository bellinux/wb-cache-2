40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a {{comprehensive}} technique to obtain accurate three-dimensional (3 D) micromachining forces for frequency bandwidths up to 25 kHz. The capability to precisely measure cutting forces is central to gaining fundamental understanding on micromachining mechanics and dynamics. Multi-axis dynamometers are used to measure 3 D machining forces. Forces experienced during micromachining involve very high frequencies due to the ultra-high spindle speeds used during the process. However, the specified bandwidths <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometers</b> do not meet high frequency requirements of micromachining forces; this limitation stems from the structural-dynamics response <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometers.</b> Therefore, {{it is important to}} develop approaches to compensate for the distortions arising from the dynamic effects <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometer's</b> structure in order to accurately measure micromachining forces. This paper presents a fully 3 D compensation approach to enable accurate <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> 3 D micromachining forces within a wide frequency range. The presented approach involves: (1) accurate identification of 3 D force measurement characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometer</b> in the form of 3 x 3 force-to-force frequency response functions (F 2 F-FRFs) matrix within a 25 kHz bandwidth, (2) design of an optimal inverse filter for post-processing the measured force data to remove the influence of structural dynamics of the dynamometer; and (3) validation of the compensation approach through impact testing where the actual applied force data acquired by the reference force sensor is compared with the corrected dynamometer measurements. Subsequently, the presented approach is demonstrated by obtaining 3 D micromachining forces during micromilling of a brass workpiece. It is concluded that the presented approach is effective in high-frequency correction <b>of</b> <b>dynamometer</b> measurements for accurate measurement of 3 D micromachining forces within the 0 - 25 kHz frequency range...|$|R

Nevertheless, in some cases, the use <b>of</b> <b>dynamometers</b> can be problematic, for instance in case of thin-walled workpieces in presence of instabilities: due to the presence of resonances in the frequency response <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometer</b> itself can induce significant perturbations in the measured signals.

This thesis includes a description <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometer,</b> and <b>of</b> the recalibration and software work that has been carried out to enable computer-controlled vehicle testing of a flexible and reliable nature. In order to exert a known force at the wheels of a vehicle on the chassis dynamometer, the appropriate equations of motion must be applied to the known inertial mass and frictional characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometer</b> system. These equations of motion are discussed in terms <b>of</b> the chassis <b>dynamometer</b> and their application in the simulation of realistic on-road vehicle forces. Several techniques have been proposed to determine the system friction and inertia, and the most appropriate method was chosen on the basis of repeatability and equipment limitations. Dynamometer control and data acquisition software has been written in the C++ programming language, which includes automated routines for the calibration <b>of</b> the chassis <b>dynamometer</b> as well as several vehicle testing regimes.

Twelve elite Sanda athletes from the Competitive Sports School of Shanghai University of Sport were randomly assigned to experimental group (EG) and control group (CG). EG and CG were regularly trained with suspension training and traditional strength training for 40 minutes three times per week. The total duration of training was 10 weeks.
