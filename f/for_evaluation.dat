5|$|Holt {{tractors}} {{were widely}} used as artillery tractors during World War I and their capabilities and reliability had become well-known. Benjamin Holt also gained valuable experience securing government contracts. These capabilities separated {{him from his}} competition. Holt had obtained significant loans and begun a large expansion to meet the war planners' need for his tractors. Holt also made a steam powered tank <b>for</b> <b>evaluation</b> using Doble steam engines.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, {{eighteen}} {{years after the}} rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group <b>for</b> <b>evaluation.</b> By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone was too weak with heart problems and respiratory illness to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton {{was president of the}} new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} season with the Wild Ballard was hit by the New York Islanders' Matt Martin after making a pass. The hit was {{delivered}} as Ballard turned away from Martin. Ballard's head struck a glass partition and as he fell his head bounced off the ice. He lay on the ice {{for a few minutes}} before being able to leave the ice on his own. Ballard suffered a concussion and multiple facial fractures as a result. He was taken to Regions Hospital <b>for</b> <b>evaluation</b> and observation and released the next day. There was no penalty or suspension in result of the hit.|$|E

5|$|In late 1934, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) {{issued a}} {{specification}} for new scout bomber and torpedo bomber designs. Eight companies submitted {{a total of}} ten designs in response, evenly split between monoplanes and biplanes. The Hall Aluminum Aircraft Company submitted the only seaplane design; a single prototype was ordered by the Navy <b>for</b> <b>evaluation</b> on June 30, 1934. Given the designation XPTBH-1, it became the only aircraft to receive three mission-type letters under the U.S. Navy's designation system used between 1922 and 1962.|$|E
5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler {{was supposed to have}} been built ashore <b>for</b> <b>evaluation,</b> but it was not completed until early 1941, which further complicated the production plan.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need <b>for</b> <b>evaluation</b> of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E

5|$|Six of {{the eight}} {{surviving}} evaluation aircraft (the three allocated to the U.S. plus those allocated to Germany) were transferred to the U.S. <b>for</b> <b>evaluation</b> by the Army, Air Force, and Navy as the XV-6A Kestrel. After Tri-Service evaluation they were passed to the USAF for further evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base, except for two that were assigned to NASA. One of the two remaining British-based Kestrels {{was attached to the}} Blind Landing Experimental Unit (BLEU) at RAE Bedford and the other, XS693, went to Blackburn for modification to take the uprated Pegasus 6 engine.|$|E
5|$|The Douglas XCG-17 was an American assault glider, {{developed}} by the conversion of a C-47 Skytrain twin-engine transport during World War II. Although the XCG-17 was successful in testing, the requirement for such a large glider had passed, and no further examples of the type were built; one additional C-47, however, was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration briefly during 1946 <b>for</b> <b>evaluation,</b> but was quickly reconverted to powered configuration.|$|E
5|$|The Polikarpov design bureau (OKB) was ordered, in 1936, {{to begin}} {{development}} of a fast twin-engined aircraft {{that could be used}} for ground attack duties and as a heavy fighter. It delivered the ground attack version the following year <b>for</b> <b>evaluation,</b> although it could be modified as necessary for other roles. The VIT-1 was reasonably successful, but it was decided to give it more powerful engines and modify its structure. The improved aircraft was designated as the VIT-2.|$|E

5|$|The XSBF-1—piloted by {{test pilot}} Bud Gillies—flew {{for the first}} time on December 24, 1935. Following initial testing, which found the {{aircraft}} to be reasonably faultless, the XSBF-1 was delivered to the U.S. Navy <b>for</b> <b>evaluation</b> in competition with two other biplanes submitted to the 1934 specification, the Great Lakes XB2G and the Curtiss XSBC-3. Unusually for biplanes, all three types possessed retractable landing gear. The evaluation showed that the design from Curtiss was superior to the Grumman and Great Lakes designs, and an order was placed for the Curtiss type, designated SBC-3 Helldiver in service, in August 1936.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} were designed by Bob Thomas, whereas the code was written by Dave Thomas. The Thomas brothers decided to show their progress {{of the game}} to Tim and Chris Stamper <b>for</b> <b>evaluation,</b> despite feeling embarrassed due to their workspace being inside their parents' attic. Impressed by the game, the Stamper brothers commissioned an entire series to be released for the Commodore 64. Dave Thomas recalled that every game they produced was met with little interference from Ultimate; once a game was complete, it {{would be sent to}} quality assessment and subsequently published for release.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvement}} process continued {{throughout the}} production run, {{though they were}} not immediately implemented in the production line, but were instead incorporated in a fourth prototype <b>for</b> <b>evaluation.</b> This aircraft first flew on 29 October 1940 and was a significant improvement over the I-200s then in production. It passed its State acceptance trials and its improvements were incorporated in the production line from the 101st I-200. These were designated as the MiG-3 on 9 December, although the first production MiG-3 was not completed until 20 December 1940.|$|E

5|$|This {{deficiency}} {{was addressed}} by procuring further German Bf 109 and French Morane D-3800fighters. In 1942, the Swiss-built F+W C-36 multipurpose aircraft was introduced into service, and in 1943, Switzerland opened its own aircraft factory, Flugzeugwerk Emmen. Caverns {{were built in}} which to shelter aircraft and maintenance personnel from air attack, for example in Alpnach, Meiringen and Turtmann. In 1942-43, an air gunnery range at Ebenfluh-Axalp was opened for training. The Surveillance Squadron (Überwachungsgeschwader) was formed in 1941 and made combat-ready in 1943. A night fighter squadron was formed <b>for</b> <b>evaluation</b> purposes in 1944 and disbanded in 1950.|$|E
5|$|In August 1936, Romania {{placed an}} order for 126; the bulk of these were {{delivered}} {{from the end of}} 1938 by Škoda. Afghanistan ordered ten in 1940; but, these were sold instead to Bulgaria. Total production was 434, including 298 for the Czechoslovak Army, 126 for Romania (under the designation Škoda R-2) and ten for Bulgaria. The Wehrmacht used 218 vehicles captured from the Czechoslovak Army in March 1939. Britain's Alvis-Staussler negotiated for a production license from September 1938 until March 1939 when the Nazi occupation made an agreement impossible. The Soviets were also interested so Škoda shipped the S-II-a prototype and one production LT vz. 35 to the proving grounds at Kubinka <b>for</b> <b>evaluation.</b> The Soviets were only interested in buying the prototype, but Škoda refused to sell unless a license was purchased as well, believing that the Soviets would simply copy the design and build it without paying any royalties.|$|E
5|$|Operation Iskra was a {{strategic}} {{victory for the}} Soviet forces. From a military perspective, the operation eliminated {{the possibility of the}} capture of the city and a German–Finnish link up, as the Leningrad Front was now very well supplied, reinforced and able to co-operate more closely with the Volkhov Front. For the civilian population, the operation meant that more food was able to reach the city, as well as improved conditions and the possibility of evacuating more civilians from the city. Breaking the blockade also had a significant strategic effect, although it was overshadowed by the surrender of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad only a few days later. Notably, the first Tiger tank captured by the Soviets was taken during this battle. It was undamaged and evacuated by the Soviet forces <b>for</b> <b>evaluation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Donor agencies, and {{recipient}} governments want {{to assess}} the effectiveness of aid-supported sector policies. Unfortunately, existing methods <b>for</b> impact <b>evaluation</b> are designed <b>for</b> the <b>evaluation</b> of homogeneous interventions ("projects") where those with, and without "treatment" can be compared. The lack of a methodology <b>for</b> <b>evaluations</b> of sector-wide programs is a serious constraint in the debate on aid effectiveness. We propose a method of statistical impact evaluation in situations with heterogeneous interventions, {{an extension of the}} double differencing method often used in project evaluations. We illustrate its feasibility with an example from the education sector in Zambia. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
