Author and critic Elbert Hubbard wrote in Crane's obituary in the Philistine that [...] "The Open Boat" [...] was [...] "the sternest, creepiest bit of realism ever penned". Also noting the depressing Realism utilized in the story, editor Vincent Starrett stated: [...] "It is a desolate picture, and the tale <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> greatest short stories." [...] Another of the author's friends, H. G. Wells, wrote that [...] "The Open Boat" [...] was [...] "beyond all question, the crown of all [...] work." [...] Singling out Crane's usage of color and chiaroscuro in his writing, Wells continued: [...] "It has all the stark power of the earlier stories, with a new element of restraint; the color is as full and strong as ever, fuller and stronger, indeed; but those chromatic splashes that at times deafen and confuse in The Red Badge, those images that astonish rather than enlighten, are disciplined and controlled." [...] The story remains popular with critics; Thomas Kent referred to [...] "The Open Boat" [...] as Crane's [...] "magnum opus", while Crane biographer Stanley Wertheim called it [...] "Crane's finest short story and one of the masterworks of late nineteenth-century American literature".|$|E

2500|$|When John F. Kennedy, a Catholic, ran for President in 1960, Rev.

This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> precious freedoms and every denomination should have the right in every country to operate and not be hindered. A Roman Catholic is a member of an ecclesiastical system ... that demands the first allegiance of every true member ... and says in a conflict between church and state, the church must prevail." [...] A Roman Catholic President, he said, would be subject to the absolute authority of the Pope according to church teachings. As archived in the Presidential Campaign Papers at the John F.
