5|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{refined and}} expanded from the version they used in Awakening. The My Castle feature was suggested by Maeda {{as an alternative}} activity for players, {{and to provide a}} means for <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> main characters outside battle. The amount of content included in the feature made some staff comment that it could be its own game. The social elements of My Castle were originally going to be exclusive to StreetPass, but it was suggested that players in areas with low StreetPass activity should be able to access the functions through a normal Internet connection. Some ideas thought up by Maeda for earlier titles, such as the Dragon Vein ability and the way skills were inherited by second generation characters, were also implemented. Due to the necessity for multiple versions, map designing became a larger task than anticipated, with very few maps being shared between versions. The Phoenix Mode was included to bring new fans into the series, a philosophy that they had neglected up until Awakening and improved for Fates. For {{the first time in the}} Fire Emblem series, the option for the main character to marry a character of the same sex was included: the potential male and female partners respectively appear in Conquest and Birthright, and both appear in Revelation. According to Nintendo, this move was done to reflect the diversity of their player base.|$|E

25|$|Barr easily {{turned back}} token {{opposition}} in the Republican primary and again received financial support from the National Republican Campaign Committee in his general election campaign. When Chandler decided not to attend the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Barr charged {{that he was trying}} to avoid association with President Barack Obama, who was seeking a second term but who was unpopular with many voters in Kentucky. A spokesperson for Chandler maintained that Chandler had previous engagements in his home district that week, but that he supported Obama's reelection. Barr was chosen to give a brief address at the 2012 Republican National Convention, during which he decried Obama's perceived hostility toward the coal industry. Chandler campaign staffers criticized Barr's decision to attend the convention, stating that he should spend the time in his district, <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> people there better. They also mocked the fact that the backdrop for Barr's speech was a picture of the city of Louisville, which is not in the 6th district; Barr's campaign countered that they had no part in choosing the backdrop.|$|E

500|$|At {{the heart}} of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill {{conceived}} this as a job for women only. She and her assistants (who included Emma Cons and Eva McLaren) combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> tenants personally, acting as early social workers. At first Hill believed, [...] "Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers." [...] Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce. Her system required a large staff. Rent was collected on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Rent accounts were balanced in the afternoons and arrangements were made with contractors for repairs. On Thursdays and Fridays arrears were pursued, contractors' invoices paid, new tenancy lettings and tenants' moves organised.|$|E
500|$|Joshi, {{one of the}} lyricists, was {{impressed}} with the director, Rakeysh Mehra, who was ready to adjust to his style of writing as well as his creativity. Confessing that the film's soundtrack was his favorite out of all his previous works, Joshi felt that it [...] "was a wonderful experience <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> mindset of today's youth and to pen down their feelings". Speaking about one of his songs, [...] "Luka Chuppi", in which veteran Lata Mangeshkar sang with Rahman, Joshi said that it was developed while discussing with Rahman the scene about a mother losing her son. Joshi wrote the lyrics about the mother and son playing hide-and-seek with the sad reality of the son being hidden forever. He confessed to have been in tears while Mangeshkar was singing the song. The soundtrack won the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director, and had two of its tracks, Khalbali and Luka Chuppi, considered for an Academy Award for Best Original Song nomination.|$|E

Krishna {{wrote that the}} film [...] "deserves to be vastly {{appreciated}} as an earnest endeavor to portray with sensitivity and empathetically diagnose a malady in human life". They also felt it blended [...] "modern professional knowledge" [...] with a [...] "humane approach" [...] in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the [...] "present age where everyone is in a restless hurry". The pair wrote, [...] "This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading {{to a state of}} mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?" [...] The film depicts how [...] "threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan [...] "dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities". Overall, the pair found a [...] "naive oversimplification" [...] in the film. With India [...] "only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability", however, they [...] "easily [...] under artistic license".|$|E
500|$|On October 25, 2005, Giants patriarch Wellington Mara {{died after}} a brief illness, {{at the age of}} 89. Mara had been {{involved}} with the Giants since he was nine years old, when he was a ball boy for the team. Mara was universally beloved by the players. Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort {{to get to know each}} of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s at practice very day, he loves hanging around the locker room and <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more for me than Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping me to find help.... And he never lectured me. I could tell he disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E
