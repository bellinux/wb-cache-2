50|$|The initial {{destination}} is positioned so that less <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> {{is needed for}} a flight from the origin to the initial destination than for a flight from the origin to the final destination. Under normal circumstances, little {{if any of the}} <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> is actually used, so when the aircraft reaches the reclear fix it still has (almost) all the original <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> on board, which is enough to cover the flight from the reclear fix to the final destination.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to standard fuel needs, some organizations require that a flight plan include <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> if certain conditions are met. For example, an over-water flight of {{longer than a}} specific duration may require the flight plan to include <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel.</b> The <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> may be planned as extra which is left over on the aircraft at the destination, {{or it may be}} assumed to be burned during flight (perhaps due to unaccounted for differences between the actual aircraft and the flight performance data).|$|R
50|$|In July 1988 Walpole was {{grounded}} by British Airways for {{landing a}} transatlantic Concorde at Heathrow with 25 minutes of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> remaining, instead of 30 minutes of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel.</b> Walpole {{had the option}} to divert to Shannon airport to refuel, but had not done so.|$|R
50|$|Some {{iteration}} {{is generally}} required {{due to the}} need to calculate interdependent values. For instance, <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> is often calculated as a percentage of trip fuel, but trip fuel cannot be calculated until the total weight of the aircraft is known, and this includes the weight of the <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|R
50|$|From an accountant's viewpoint, the {{provision}} of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> costs money (the fuel needed to carry the hopefully unused <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel).</b> Techniques known variously as reclear, redispatch, or decision point procedure have been developed, which can greatly {{reduce the amount of}} <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> needed while still maintaining all required safety standards. These techniques are based on having some specified intermediate airport to which the flight can divert if necessary; in practice such diversions are rare. The use of such techniques can save several tons of fuel on long flights, or it can increase the payload carried by a similar amount.|$|R
50|$|One factor {{identified}} by Arthur and Rose that helps achieve the maximum possible saving {{is to have}} an initial destination positioned so that descent to the initial destination starts immediately after the reclear fix. This is beneficial because it minimises the <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> needed between reclear fix and initial destination, and hence maximises the amount of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> available at the reclear fix.|$|R

5000|$|The basic {{purpose of}} a flight {{planning}} system is to calculate how much trip fuel is needed in the air navigation process by an aircraft when flying from an origin airport to a destination airport. Aircraft must also carry some <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> to allow for unforeseen circumstances, such as an inaccurate weather forecast, or air traffic control requiring an aircraft to fly at a lower-than-optimal altitude due to congestion, or the addition of last-minute passengers whose weight was not accounted for when the flight plan was prepared. The way in which <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> is determined varies greatly, depending on airline and locality. The most common methods are: ...|$|R
50|$|For {{the flight}} from {{destination}} to alternate, a flight planning system can calculate alternate trip <b>fuel</b> and alternate <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> {{on the basis that}} the aircraft weight on reaching the alternate is zero fuel weight plus alternate holding.|$|R
50|$|Landing {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} as it lands at the destination. This is the brake release weight minus the trip fuel burned. It includes the zero fuel weight, unusable fuel, and all alternate, holding, and <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|R

50|$|A reclear {{flight plan}} has two {{destination}}s. The final destination airport {{is where the}} flight is really going to, while the initial destination airport is where the flight will divert to if more fuel is used than expected during {{the early part of}} the flight. The waypoint at which the decision is made as to which destination to go to is called the reclear fix or decision point. On reaching this waypoint, the flight crew make a comparison between actual and predicted fuel burn and check how much <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> is available. If there is sufficient <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel,</b> then the flight can continue to the final destination airport; otherwise the aircraft must divert to the initial destination airport.|$|R

50|$|The maximum {{achievable}} saving {{depends on}} {{the position of the}} reclear fix. This position cannot be determined theoretically since there are no exact equations for trip <b>fuel</b> and <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel.</b> Even if it could be determined exactly, there may not be a waypoint at the right place.|$|R

30|$|AO {{is another}} {{important}} dependent factor related to the fuel efficiency. According to Peeters et al. [62] and Hileman et al. [32] improved aviation operations have resulted in better value of fuel efficiency. The relationships between operational efficiency and efficiency are expressed by payload fuel efficiency equation [21, 32]. Therefore, aircraft operational efficiency were {{measured in terms of}} parameters such as aircraft range [4, 51], <b>fuel</b> weight, <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> weight, payload, aircraft speed, crew weight, takeoff filed length, and landing filed length ([2, 4, 5, 27, 29, 65]). Aircraft range is the total distance that an aircraft can fly with full fuel tank. We can improve the aircraft fuel consumption by optimizing the aircraft range. Optimized <b>fuel</b> weight, <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> weight, and crew weight have also contributed toward the improved fuel efficiency [2, 27]. The payload rate is another operational performance indicator that is commonly used to assess fuel burn. Air transport emission can be reduced with increased payload (reduce the number of empty seats flown) while optimizing the flight frequencies. Also, optimized aircraft speed [5], has also improved the fuel efficiency of airliners [4, 65]. Optimum values of takeoff filed length, and landing filed length also affects positively the fuel efficiency. So, therefore we have included the aircraft range, <b>fuel</b> weight, <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> weight, payload, aircraft speed, crew weight, takeoff filed length, and landing filed length to measure AO construct.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the western}} theatre of the war, the Indian Navy {{successfully}} attacked Karachi's port in Operation Trident {{on the night}} of 4-5 December, using missile boats, sinking Pakistani destroyer PNS Khyber and minesweeper PNS Muhafiz; PNS Shah Jahan was also badly damaged. In response, Pakistani submarines sought out major Indian warships. 720 Pakistani sailors were killed or wounded, and Pakistan lost <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> and many commercial ships, thus crippling the Pakistan Navy's further involvement in the conflict.

Since Pakistan's naval headquarters and almost its entire fleet operated from the port city of Karachi, this was a major strategic victory that enabled the Indian navy to attain complete naval superiority, and to partially blockade Pakistan.|$|R
