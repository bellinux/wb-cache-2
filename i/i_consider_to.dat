Saxon, the President of the University of California, Agnew wrote that his decision was influenced by [...] "dissatisfaction with University administration policies {{and a lack of}} advocacy for the total LASL [...] program" [...] and [...] "frustration with what <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be a continuing inequitable distribution of defense program funding by the Department of Energy between the LASL and LLL [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The song, {{according}} to Joel, is an anti-drug song. He says, [...] "What's so horrible about an affluent young white teenager's life that he's got to shoot heroin? It's really {{a song about}} what <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be a pathetic loser kind of lifestyle. I've been accused of, 'Oh, this song promotes drug use and masturbation.' No, no, no. Listen to the song. This guy is a loser." [...] In writing about the song in the liner notes of his Songs in the Attic album, Joel once again emphasized the point: [...] "...so many friends shoveled under the Long Island dirt. The miracle of modern chemistry killed them if Vietnam didn't." ...|$|E

[...] "t this point we're not sure when the record will come out and in what form.

500|$|Michelle Erica Green, {{reviewing}} the episode for TrekNation, described the episode as [...] "very classic Trek". She {{was pleased to}} see that some character depth was being introduced into the new Xindi characters, and compared Gralik to Captain Dathon from the [...] episode [...] "Darmok" [...] but thought that Gralik didn't get developed quite enough {{to be on the same}} level. Overall, she described the episode as [...] "a very solid hour of entertainment, with very few nitpicks... a slick package with the values <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be real Trek". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] wasn't enthusiastic about a particularly [...] "lackluster" [...] action scene which he felt was a bad cross between [...] and Andromeda. However, he was pleased with the other aspects of the plot and praised the clever scripting. He gave the episode a score of three out of four.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the dispute}} between King Henry and Thomas Becket, Bartholomew refused to {{cooperate}} with either side, which caused Becket to scold him as a bad friend. At {{the start of the}} dispute, Bartholomew was sent with a royal deputation to Sens to ask the pope to send papal legates to England to settle the quarrel. Thereafter, he avoided being drawn into the controversy, until 1170. When Roger of York crowned Henry the Young King in 1170, Bartholomew was said to be present. In September 1170, Pope Alexander III suspended Bartholomew from office for attending the coronation, along with a number of other bishops. Shortly after a settlement of the dispute was reached in 1172, Henry wrote to Bartholomew saying that [...] "I shall abolish all new customs introduced in my reign against the churches of my land (which <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be few or none)", which signaled Henry's intentions of mostly ignoring the settlement. Bartholomew was restored to his office before 21 December 1171, when he helped restore Canterbury Cathedral to use for religious ceremonies.|$|E
2500|$|Others doubted whether recent {{graduates}} had {{the necessary}} skills and maturity {{for such a}} task. The idea was popular among students, however, and Kennedy pursued it, asking respected academics such as Max Millikan and Chester Bowles to help him outline the organization and its goals. During his inaugural address, Kennedy again promised to create the program: [...] "And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask {{what you can do}} for your country". President Kennedy in a speech at the White House on June 22, 1962, [...] "Remarks to Student Volunteers Participating in Operation Crossroads Africa", acknowledged that Operation Crossroads for Africa was the basis {{for the development of the}} Peace Corps. [...] "This group and this effort really were the progenitors of the Peace Corps and what this organization has been doing for a number of years led to the establishment of what <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be the most encouraging indication of the desire for service not only in this country but all around the world that we have seen in recent years". The Peace Corps website answered the question [...] "Who Inspired the Creation of the Peace Corps?", acknowledging that the Peace Corps were based on Operation Crossroads Africa founded by Rev.

2500|$|In a 1993 {{interview}} with Miller, Option wrote that success was a touchy subject for him, quoting Miller's joking {{example of a}} typical review: [...] "Nothing good ever happens to Scott Miller, but somehow he's managed to drag his broken body into a studio {{one more time and}} make another album." [...] Miller continued that he was [...] "past the point of fighting" [...] discussions of how [...] "arty or brainy" [...] he was, but had hoped for greater emphasis [...] "on what the songs are about—be it the boy-girl situation, or being depressed about some key failure I've had, or getting a little bit of understanding about life." [...] In another 1993 interview, Miller mused:I don't think I'm in danger of making albums that don't age well, because I haven't ever fit into the times spectacularly well. I've always been aware of myself drawing on a musical vocabulary so broad {{that a lot of people}} don't get what <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be my real songwriting coups. I think they go right past a lot of people. The bad part of that is I probably won't become a big star. But the good part is that I don't think people will find the albums less useful over time. They'll sound as good in 2004 as they will in 1994.|$|E
