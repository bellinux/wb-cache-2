5|$|In the Ramayana, Surabhi is {{described}} to be distressed by {{the treatment of}} her sons—the oxen—in fields. <b>Her</b> <b>tears</b> are considered a bad omen for the gods by Indra, the god-king of heaven. The Vana Parva book of the Mahbharata also narrates a similar instance: Surabhi cries {{about the plight of}} her son—a bullock, who is overworked and beaten by his peasant-master. Indra, moved by Surabhi's tears, rains to stop the ploughing of the tormented bullock.|$|E

His early verse cleverly dissimulates his preoccupation with Immanuel Kant's philosophy. Its fabric includes striking alliterations, wild rhythmic combinations, day-to-day vocabulary, and hidden allusions to his favourite poets such as Rilke, Lermontov, Pushkin and German-language Romantic poets.|$|E
25|$|A similar anointing is {{described}} in the Gospel of Luke as occurring {{at the home of}} one Simon the Pharisee in which a woman who had been sinful all her life, and who was crying, anointed Jesus' feet and, when <b>her</b> <b>tears</b> started to fall on his feet, she wiped them with her hair. Luke's account (as well as John's) differs from that of Matthew and Mark by relating that the anointing is to the feet rather than the head. Although it is a subject of considerable debate, many scholars hold that these actually describe two separate events.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographical}} formations of {{the region}} are frequently mentioned in local folklore.

The Covadonga area is also rich with astonishing stories, such as the one which is said to have happened in a shepherd village where today Enol and Ercina lakes are situated. Mary, mother of Jesus, disguised as a pilgrim, is said to have visited that village and asked for food and shelter from every house of that village. She was rudely rejected by every person, except for a shepherd who gave her refuge and warmly shared everything he had. On the following day, as punishment for their lack of hospitality, a flood of divine origin devastated the village, which completely covered everything except the cottage of the good shepherd. In front of him, the mysterious guest started to cry, and <b>her</b> <b>tears</b> became flowers when they reached the floor. Then the shepherd realized that the pilgrim was actually Mary.|$|E

The fly causes Sudeep to have an accident {{on his way to}} the airport and writes [...] "I will kill you" [...] on the windshield; this makes Sudeep paranoid. The fly, who sees Bindu mourning Nani's death in her bedroom, reveals itself to be Nani by writing on the desk with <b>her</b> <b>tears.</b> It conveys the circumstances of Nani's death to Bindu, and they join forces against Sudeep.

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "You Lost Me" [...] {{talks about}} a [...] "cheating" [...] man, who has left Aguilera's world [...] "infected". Amar Toor from AOL Radio thought that its lyrical content [...] "perfectly captures {{one of the most}} {{difficult}} experiences young lovers have to go through". The song begins with a [...] "somber orchestral" [...] piano opening, followed by the lines [...] "I am done, smoking gun/ We've lost it all, the love is gone" [...] sung by Aguilera. During the chorus, she sings, [...] "I feel like our world's been infected/ And somehow you left me neglected". Toward the ending, Aguilera's [...] "painful" [...] and [...] "catharsis" [...] voice [...] "crescendos dramatically". According to Jon Pareles from The New York Times, Aguilera [...] "barely" [...] holds back <b>her</b> <b>tears</b> in the song. The Village Voice critic Drew Hinshaw thought that Aguilera is [...] "less vexed by what he did than what he lost".|$|E
500|$|When Maria Amélia {{was only}} 20 days old, her father {{departed}} France to invade Portugal. For almost two years, {{she lived in}} Paris {{with her mother and}} half-sister MariaII. When news arrived that the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, had fallen to Pedro's forces, Amélie of Leuchtenberg left Paris with her infant daughter and stepdaughter for Portugal. They arrived in Lisbon on 22 September 1833 and disembarked the next day. Charles John Napier, a British naval officer who had fought alongside Pedro, wrote about the emotional reunion: [...] "I never saw [...] so happy and pleased; he went onboard just a little above Belém; he was received at the ladder by the empress [...] who hugged and kissed him with the greatest affection: the queen [...] was very moved and could not hold <b>her</b> <b>tears.</b> The little Princess [...] Amélia, his youngest daughter, took much of his attention: she became somewhat scared of seeing his bushy beard and did not warm to his caresses." ...|$|E
500|$|While Vissi's {{popularity}} and commercial appeal {{had already begun}} declining by the early 2000s, as seen by the sales of albums such as Nylon which although successful had relatively low sales compared to her other albums [...] Eurovision was considered by {{a small number of}} reporters to have had a detrimental affect to her career. Vissi admitted that she viewed her participation as a mistake. Although this was partially due to hardships faced by the Greek music industry including piracy, the financial crisis, and changing musical tastes, leading to a general decline of the laïko-pop scene and image-based singers, her career choices, such as the pursuit of an international career at a relatively advanced age, leading to several long absences from Greece and attempting to use Eurovision as a gateway, were thought to be major components. In an article about the [...] "golden trio of Greek pop" [...] consisting of Vissi, Despina Vandi, and Sakis Rouvas, Anna Vlavianou of To Vima considered Vissi to have [...] "the most vociferous" [...] decline of the group.

Mary began by scolding Knox, then she burst into tears. [...] "What have ye to do with my marriage?" [...] she asked, and [...] "What are ye within this commonwealth?" [...] "A subject born within the same, Madam," [...] Knox replied. He noted that though he was not of noble birth, he had the same duty as any subject to warn of dangers to the realm. When Mary started to cry again, he said, [...] "Madam, in God's presence I speak: I never delighted in the weeping of any of God's creatures; yea I can scarcely well abide the tears of my own boys whom my own hand corrects, much less can I rejoice in your Majesty's weeping."

[...] They focused on the choice of visuals, saying that [...] "the clip shows the Destiny's Child alum struggling with a relationship, while numerous wardrobe changes, vivid colors, doves, and stunning shots of Kelly burst onto the screen." [...] Liz Goodwin of Gather.com agreed with the visuals, saying, [...] "In the music video, Kelly Rowland's body is looking fantastic. (Though she could switch up the weave for another hairstyle.) The outfits are hot– she’s looking fit! Kudos to Kelly for pulling off the very, very low-cut corset without falling out of it! She can be grateful to gravity for still being on her side...and for double-sided tape." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator said, [...] "We hope two things happen now that Kelly Rowland’s Rankin-directed 'Rose Colored Glasses' music video has premiered: 1.) you like it and show Miss Kelly some love on iTunes, and 2.) radio programmers in this fine country open their ears and show Miss Kelly major love on the airwaves...Kelly looks truly stunning in this video, from the opening shot of her wearing a dress shirt and tie to the couture dresses she vamps in expertly." ...|$|E
500|$|The younger Angelo Padovani {{went with}} De Angelis to confront Morisi in San Giovanni in Persiceto. Padovani {{recalled}} finding her in tears. After the visitors {{assured her that}} they meant no harm, Morisi recounted what she had told Feletti. She said that a grocer named Cesare Lepori had suggested the baptism when she mentioned Edgardo's sickness, and shown her how to perform it. She had not mentioned it to anyone, she went on, until soon after Edgardo's brother Aristide {{died at the age}} of one in 1857—when a neighbour's servant called Regina proposed that Morisi should have baptised Aristide, that she had done so to Edgardo [...] "slipped out of my mouth". According to Padovani, Morisi described crying during her interrogation by the inquisitor, and expressed guilt over Edgardo's removal: [...] "figuring that it was all my fault, I was very unhappy, and still am." [...] Morisi agreed to have this formally recorded, but was gone when Padovani and De Angelis returned after three hours with a notary and two witnesses. After searching for her in vain, they went back to Bologna with only their hearsay account of her story, which Padovani thought genuine: [...] "Her words, and her demeanour, and <b>her</b> <b>tears</b> before she could launch into her story, persuaded me that what she told me was all true." ...|$|E
