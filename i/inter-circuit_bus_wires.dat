40|$|We propose an {{approach}} {{for reducing the}} energy consumption of address buses that targets both the switching and the crosstalk components of power dissipation. The method {{is based on the}} combined application of two techniques.

Then, the slack available in the floorplanning for the routing of the <b>bus</b> <b>wire</b> is exploited to realize a bus with non-uniform inter-wire spacing. Both swapping and placement are driven by the switching data obtained from the analysis of typical address bus traces, and can be successfully applied to any address bus.

40|$|Abstract—A {{crosstalk}} effect {{leads to}} increases in delay and power consumption and, in the worst-case scenario, to inaccurate results. With the scale down of technology to deep-submicrometer level, the crosstalk effect between adjacent wires {{becomes more and more}} serious, particularly between long on-chip buses. In this paper, we propose a deassembler/ assembler technique to eliminate undesirable crosstalk effects on bus transmission. By taking advantage of the prefetch process, where the instruction/data fetch rate is always higher than the instruction/data commit rate, the proposed method incurs almost no penalty in terms of dynamic instruction count. In addition, when the bus width is 128 b, the required number of extra <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> is only 7 as compared to the 85 extra <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> needed in the work of Victor and Keutzer.

We compared Dual Rail encoding versus Hamming with respect to power consumption of the <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> themselves (passive capacity model) [13]. In this paper we analyze the contribution of the active elements of both coding schemes. We first present a detailed analysis of the power consumption of an encoded bus, taking into account the <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> (with mutual capacitances, drivers, repeaters and receivers), as well as the encoding/decoding circuitry. Then we compare the two considered coding technique with respect to the power consumption, and we show how different tradeoffs can be achieved.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about a design for {{diagnosis}} (DFD) technique for <b>bus</b> <b>wires.</b> It uses digital method to measure the delay and crosstalk noise for the testing and diag-nosis of on-chip <b>bus</b> <b>wires.</b> The DelayDFD architecture has been proposed for the delay measurement. Within the DelayDFD, the digital delay measurement module (DMM) counts the duty cycle of the reference signal and delayed signal to determine the delay time. This function {{is based on the}} law of large numbers in random proc-ess. Moreover, three modes of the diagnosis configuration can be reconfigured to diagnosis the possible cause of the faults such as the drivers, receivers, or wires. The CrossDFD can achieve crosstalk measurement with minimum hardware modification. The crosstalk noise profile can be plotted by delay measurement. A test chip is implemented by TSMCSPQM 0. 35 –?m technology to verified the proposed functions such as digital delay measurement, design for diagnosis, crosstalk noise measurement, and external delay measurement. - III...|$|R

50|$|These cables use two {{parallel}} <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> which carry electricity {{but do not}} create significant heat. They are encased in a semi-conductive polymer. This polymer is loaded with carbon; as the polymer element heats, it allows less current to flow. The cables are manufactured and then irradiated and by varying both the carbon content and the dosage then different tape with different output characteristics can be produced. There is then an inner jacket which separates the <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> from the grounding braid. In commercial and industrial cables, an additional outer jacket of rubber or Teflon is applied. The benefits of this cable are the ability {{to cut to length}} in the field, It is more rugged but not necessarily more reliable than series or zone heaters, it cannot over-heat itself so in theory it can be crossed, but it is bad practice to install tape in this way. Self-regulating heating cables have a specific maximum exposure temperature based on the type of polymer which is used to make the heating core which means that if they are subject to high temperatures then the tape can be damaged beyond repair. Also self-limiting tapes are subject to high inrush currents on starting up similar to an 'induction' motor so a higher rated contactor is required.|$|R

50|$|This {{de facto}} {{mechanical}} standard for CAN could be implemented with the node having {{both male and}} female 9-pin D-sub connectors electrically wired to each other in parallel within the node. Bus power is fed to a node's male connector and the bus draws power from the node's female connector. This follows the electrical engineering convention that power sources are terminated at female connectors. Adoption of this standard avoids the need to fabricate custom splitters to connect two sets of <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> to a single D connector at each node. Such nonstandard (custom) wire harnesses (splitters) that join conductors outside the node reduce bus reliability, eliminate cable interchangeability, reduce compatibility of wiring harnesses, and increase cost.|$|R

40|$|A {{protocol}} for delay-insensitive asynchronous communication {{based on the}} time-multiplexing of two bit on a dual rail line is proposed and analyzed. Compared to conventional dual-rail protocols, it halves the number of <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> and, according to simulations, significantly reduces energy consumption with small throughput loss and nearly no area overhead. 1. Introduction As feature size of CMOS technology decreases, the balance between gate and wire delays is going worse, with wiring delays moving into dominance. The dominant wire delay causes many troubles in synchronous designs: since wire delays depend on the final physical design, the system performance strongly depends on physical implementation, so many design cycles are needed to obtain a correct circuit. Delay-insensitive asynchronous communication can simplify design, reducing sensitivity to circuit delays; nevertheless, conventional delay-insensitive techniques (i. e. dual-rail coding) are expensive in terms of energy [1] [...] ...|$|R

Our analysis is based on the evaluation of the coupling effective capacitance which needs to be charged during bus activity. In particular, we analyze the cases of the Hamming and dual rail codes. We show that Hamming codes do not allow us to avoid the most delay costly bus transitions, while this can be the case for dual rail codes. Furthermore, we illustrate that, by increasing the redundancy of the dual rail code by only one bit, even higher crosstalk-induced delay reductions can be achieved.
