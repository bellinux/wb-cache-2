Modeling systems that include inbreeding requires knowledge of how inbreeding affects genetic variance. The objectives of this work were to model the effects of inbreeding on variances of genetic effects in individuals and repartitioning of genetic variance within and among subpopulations derived from a common metapopulation. Two hundred random inbred lines were developed in the BS 13 (S) C 0 maize population by four generations of self-pollination to {{study the effects of}} inbreeding at the individual and population level in BS 13 (S) C 0. The 200 lines along with a set of related half-sib families were evaluated in replicated yield trials. Genetic covariances of inbred relatives were estimated for six agronomic characters. Inbreeding caused a significant change in the mean of all six traits, and an increase in the variance of <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations</b> for five of six traits demonstrating th{{at both the}} mean and variance of <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations</b> are larger in inbred individuals (F = 1) than in noninbred individuals. Additionally, <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations</b> became negatively correlated with breeding values in inbred individuals. The correlation between <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations</b> and genotypic values in inbred individuals was 0. 37 or less for all traits except grain yield, which had a correlation between <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations</b> and genotypic values in inbred individuals of 0. 63. The average degree of dominance was found to be greater than 2 (0 is no dominance, 1 is complete dominance) for all traits except grain yield. Based on predicted effects of inbreeding on variance component structure in BS 13 (S) C 0, additive variance for grain yield will change very little at average inbreeding coefficients less than 0. 5. Other traits will lose genetic variance roughly in accord with neutral additive expectations based on estimates of additive variance in the base population. Pseudo-overdominance, combined with the high correlation between inbred <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations</b> and genotypic values may explain the lack of response to inbred-progeny recurrent selection for grain yield in the BS 13 (S) population.

Two hundred random S 1, S 2, S 3, and S 4 lines were developed from the BS 13 (S) C 0 population by single-seed descent {{and a set of}} 200 related half-sib families were developed from the S 1 lines. The lines and half-sib families were evaluated in replicated yield trials for six agronomic characters. Under a purely additive model, the expected variance among inbred individuals is exactly twice the variance of noninbred individuals. The observed variance of inbred individuals in our study was 1. 18 times the variance of noninbred individuals or less for five of six traits studied. By contrast, variance of <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations</b> of inbred individuals ranged from 1. 6 to 3. 3 times the variance of <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations</b> of noninbred individuals for five of six traits studied.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the short-term behavior of the genetic variability of quantitative traits simulated from models with additive and non-additive gene action in control and phenotypic selection populations. Both traits, one with low (h² = 0. 10) and the other with high (h² = 0. 60) heritability, were controlled by 600 biallelic loci. From a standard genome, it was obtained six genetic models which included the following: only the additive gene effects; complete and positive dominance for 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of the loci; and positive overdominance for 50 % of the loci. In the models with <b>dominance</b> <b>deviation,</b> the additive allelic effects were also included for 100 % of the loci. Genetic variability was quantified from generation to generation using the genetic variance components. In the absence of selection, genotypic and additive genetic variances were higher. In the models with non-additive gene action, a small magnitude covariance component raised between the additive and dominance genetic effects whose correlation tended to be positive on the control population and negative under selection.

40|$|The genetic {{relationship}} among individuals {{is at the}} core of nearly all quantitative genetic theory. Dominant gene action has long been either ignored or disregarded as insignificant in many previous genetic models. For grain yield in maize (Zea mays L.), dominance has consistently accounted for a large proportion of genetic variance. We have used previously developed genetic theory that accounts for dominance variance during inbreeding and applied it to a unique breeding design. Our breeding design allowed us to estimate five genetic covariance parameters for six traits. In addition, we developed genetic gain equations that accounted for both dominance and inbreeding. We found that the genetic covariance parameters introduced via inbreeding were significant for five traits. Our estimates of the genetic covariance parameters allowed us to predict genetic gain over a range of selection units and response units. Half-sib selection proved superior to inbred progeny selection when the response was measured in the outbred progeny. In addition, the relative proportions of additive and dominance variance influenced the effectiveness of inbred progeny selection. We also showed that even when dominance constitutes a larger proportion of the total genetic variance than additive variance, the loss of additive effects has a greater influence on the decline associated with inbreeding than the addition of homozygous <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations.</b> Our results also indicated that the reason realized gain often falls short of predicted gain is due to the negative covariance between additive effects and homozygous dominance effects.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Quantitative {{genetics}} {{theory for}} genomic selection has mainly focused on additive effects. This study presents quantitative genetics theory applied to genomic selection aiming {{to prove that}} prediction of genotypic value based on thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) depends on linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and QTLs, assuming dominance and epistasis. Based on simulated data, we provided information on dominance and genotypic value prediction accuracy, assuming mass selection in an open-pollinated population, all quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of lower effect, and reduced sample size. We show that the predictor of dominance value {{is proportional to the}} square of the LD value and to the <b>dominance</b> <b>deviation</b> for each QTL that is in LD with each marker. The weighted (by the SNP frequencies) dominance value predictor has greater accuracy than the unweighted predictor. The linear × linear, linear × quadratic, quadratic × linear, and quadratic × quadratic SNP effects are proportional to the corresponding linear combinations of epistatic effects for QTLs and the LD values. LD between two markers with a common QTL causes a bias in the prediction of epistatic values. Compared to phenotypic selection, the efficiency of genomic selection for genotypic value prediction increases as trait heritability decreases. The degree of dominance did not affect the genotypic value prediction accuracy and the approach to maximum accuracy is asymptotic with increases in SNP density. The decrease in the sample size from 500 to 200 did not markedly reduce the genotypic value prediction accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Two {{strains of}} rat have been {{developed}} by selective breeding: one strain (R rats) is resistant to salt hypertension, the other strain (S rats) is highly susceptible. The inheritance of these traits has been explored in the first (F 1) and second (F 2) generation of crossbred rats and in backcrosses between parent and first filial (F 1 x R, F 1 x S) generations. Male F 1 rats had an average blood pressure close to the mid-parental (R and S) values, and the average of F 2 males was equivalent to that of F 1. Male offspring of F 1 with R, or F 1 with S also showed averages close to the respective mid-parental values. Female offspring showed deviations from this linear relationship, indicating a significant dominance in the female for the genes of normal blood pressure. A model of two autosomal, nonlinked diallelic loci, with a <b>dominance</b> <b>deviation</b> at one locus in the female, gave predictions with a reasonable agreement to the observed values. The same model also appeared compatible with human data if we assume a gene frequency of 0. 13 for the hypertensinogenic allele on both loci.

40|$|Both {{ecological}} and genetic mechanisms {{have been proposed}} to explain patterns of herbivore attack on interspecific plant hybrids, but distinguishing among them can be difficult in natural hybrid zones. We performed a common-garden experiment to evaluate four genetic hypotheses: dominance, additivity, elevated hybrid susceptibility, and elevated hybrid resistance. Censuses and cage experiments were used to compare insect responses to basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. tridentata), mountain big sagebrush (A. t. vaseyana), and their F 2 progeny. After two growing seasons, hybrid shrubs resembled mountain big sagenbrush in size, but were more similar to basin big sagebrush in flower production. Censuses of naturally colonizing insects (the gall midge Rhopalomyia obovata, the bagworm moth Apterona helix, and the aphid Obtusicauda coweni) tended to support the dominance hypothesis: if the insect clearly discriminated between the two parents, its frequency on hybrids closely resembled that {{on one of the}} parents. Moreover, colonization of hybrids in all three cases suggested a <b>dominance</b> <b>deviation</b> toward the susceptible parent rather than toward the resistant parent. In contrast to the censuses, cage experiments involving two insects supported the hybrid-susceptibility hypothesis; both survival and growth of the grasshopper Melanoplus sanguinipes and growth of the leaf beetle Trirhabda pilosa were higher on hybrid shrubs than on either parent. Because many secondary compounds have been determined to occur at intermediate concentrations in F 2 shrubs, dominance for susceptibility may indicate that insects respond to plant traits (e. g., oviposition stimulants and deterrents) in a threshold manner. Mechanisms underlying increased hybrid susceptibility are less clear, but our experimental design makes environmental explanations (e. g., the plant-stress hypothesis) unlikely. Although we eliminated several confounding factors, our results agree with the conclusion from natural hybrid zones that insect responses to hybrid plants are likely to be idiosyncratic; even congeneric species did not respond similarly to hybrid and parental plants...|$|E

Genome-wide panels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been mainly used to map additive effects for quantitative traits, {{but they can also}} be used to investigate non-additive effects. We estimated dominance and epistatic effects of SNPs on various traits in beef cattle and the variance explained by dominance, and quantified the increase in accuracy of phenotype prediction by including dominance deviations in its estimation. MethodsGenotype data (729 068 real or imputed SNPs) and phenotypes on up to 16 traits of 10 191 individuals from Bos taurus, Bos indicus and composite breeds were used. A genome-wide association study was performed by fitting the additive and dominance effects of single SNPs. The dominance variance was estimated by fitting a dominance relationship matrix constructed from the 729 068 SNPs. The accuracy of predicted phenotypic values was evaluated by best linear unbiased prediction using the additive and dominance relationship matrices. Epistatic interactions (additive × additive) were tested between each of the 28 SNPs that are known to have additive effects on multiple traits, and each of the other remaining 729 067 SNPs. ResultsThe number of significant dominance effects was greater than expected by chance and most of them were in the direction that is presumed to increase fitness and in the opposite direction to inbreeding depression. Estimates of dominance variance explained by SNPs varied widely between traits, but had large standard errors. The median dominance variance across the 16 traits was equal to 5 % of the phenotypic variance. Including a <b>dominance</b> <b>deviation</b> in the prediction did not significantly increase its accuracy for any of the phenotypes. The number of additive × additive epistatic effects that were statistically significant was greater than expected by chance.

40|$|Brassica rapa cultivars occupy about 44 % of Canada's {{five million}} {{hectares}} of canola. However, B. rapa cultivars yield 15 to 20 % less seed {{than those of}} B. napus. In order to increase the competitiveness of B. rapa, significant increases in seed yield must be achieved. The development of hybrid cultivars of B. rapa could {{provide the basis for}} high yield. The objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of B. rapa doubled haploid (DH) lines and their potential use as parents in hybrid cultivars. A total of 162 DH lines, derived from five B. rapa breeding populations were evaluated in field tests at Saskatoon. Bud pollination was used to obtain selfed seed for evaluation of the DH lines. Sixteen top cross and 27 polycross progenies and 45 single cross hybrids were evaluated in the field to measure combining ability of DH lines. Many B. rapa DH lines were chlorophyll deficient as a result of expression of recessive alleles, a classical inbreeding phenomenon. Average seed and biological yield and number of seeds/pod of DH lines were only 24, 48, 46 % of their donor populations, indicating severe inbreeding depression. Inbreeding greatly extended days to flowering. However, seed weight, pod length and days to mature were less severely affected than other traits measured. Several DH lines equaled their donor population in plant weight and height at specific stages of growth, however, on average the overall growth and development of the DH lines was slower than their respective donor populations. One DH line (BC- 3015) equaled the seed and biomass yields of its donor population, suggesting that <b>dominance</b> <b>deviation</b> not overdominance was the genetic basis of high yield in B. rapa. It is suggested that chlorophyll deficient, late flowering DH plants could be discarded on the basis of greenhouse performance. Top cross and polycross procedures were equally effective in ranking DH lines for general combining ability (GCA). The top cross method of predicting GCA is the preferred method since it will allow the use of a weak, recessive tester which will not mask dominant alleles present in DH lines. Hybridity of top cross seed was high as measured by the erucic acid marker. The single cross procedure identified heterotic combinations which were different from those identified in the top cross and polycross methods. It was concluded that this difference was caused by the differential effects of male parents used to determine GCA. One single cross hybrid yielded significantly more seed than the check cultivar Tobin (130 %). It is concluded that DH lines of B. rapa will be useful in developing inbred parents for hybrid development and procedures for combining ability testing and maintenance of SI DH lines for the production of hybrids is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} dominance and inbreeding on covariances between relatives are still poorly understood in maize (Zea mays L.) populations. Our objectives were {{to address the}} following questions: (i) What {{is the importance of}} dominance in a maize synthetic? (ii) How does inbreeding affect the genetic variance among individuals in a maize synthetic. (iii) How do the covariance parameters compare between populations? (iv) How does breeding design impact estimators? We estimated covariance components for inbred relatives in the maize synthetic BSCB 1 (R) C 13. Previous estimates of covariance parameters have been used to explain the ineffectiveness of inbred progeny selection in the stiff-stalk population BS 13. We found that the dominance variance was larger than the additive variance for grain yield, whereas the additive variance was larger than the dominance variance for all other traits. Negative estimates of the covariance between additive and homozygous <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations</b> were found for all traits with the exception of traits associated with reproductive maturity, suggesting a negative relationship between inbred and outbred performance. The correlation between genotypic values and breeding values was lower for grain yield than for any other trait. Our results were similar to previous results found in the stiff-stalk maize population BS 13, suggesting similarity in structure among populations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The present {{work was}} based on the {{evaluation}} of full sib and S 1 progenies from the maize (Zea mays L.) population ESALQ-PB 1 after six cycles of divergent selection for tassel size. The following traits were analyzed: plant height, ear height, tassel branch number, tassel length, and tassel weight. For all traits, the experimental units were means of three plants per plot. Progenies were evaluated in eleven experiments (completely randomized blocks) with three replications in Piracicaba – SP, Brazil. Means of inbred (m 1) and non-inbred (m 0) progenies were used to estimate inbreeding depression (I = m 1 – m 0) and the contribution of homozygotes (µ 0 + a*) and heterozygotes (d*) to the population mean. Considering the five traits under study, inbreeding depression varied from 1. 9 to 15. 9 % but significance for that effect was detected only for plant height. Plant traits exhibited higher depression than tassel traits; and tassel branch number seems to be more sensitive to inbreeding than the other two tassel traits. Except for plant height, it was apparent that inbreeding depression was higher in the subpopulation negatively selected for tassel size (T–). Estimates of A = µ 0 + a* and d * indicate a smaller effect of <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations</b> for all traits, as compared to the contribution of homozygotes. Significant variability among progenies was detected in most instances...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to genetic progress made by selection on additive genetic values, short-term gains {{can be produced}} by recovering possible inbreeding depression or utilising putative overdominance. These are both caused mainly by dominance genetic variation which can be quantified using mixed model methodology. Inbreeding brings along a requirement for extra parameterisation in expressing and estimating dominance variance. The extra parameters specify how dominance is affecting the mean and (co) variances among inbred animals. The full description for breed crosses contains a very large set of parameters. The benefits from crossbreeding are highest with widely deviating allele frequencies between the breeds. Maximisation of heterosis can be done only on a temporary basis as a continued exploitation leads to stagnation in the overall genetic progress. Therefore efficient methods with immediate returns are needed {{to find the most}} promising breeds jointly with the most potential mating pairs. One possibility is the use of genomic tools in assessing populations for crossbreeding and in searching for major genes mediating dominance variation. The analyses are providing markers {{that can be used in}} choosing mating pairs that produce desirable <b>dominance</b> <b>deviations</b> in analysed marker brackets. Genome-wide marker sets can be used for discovering genome segments with maximum heterosis effect. The phenotypic records are available for such analyses, soon are also the large marker sets and their genotypes: the analytical tools need developers. ...|$|R
