5|$|On July 8, 2014, Beckett {{landed on}} the {{disabled}} list with a left hip <b>impingement,</b> an injury he said had gotten worse as the season went on. He returned to the rotation on July 22, but struggled when he returned. In a start on August 3, he was only able to pitch four innings against the Cubs. Afterward, Beckett told the team that he had experienced renewed discomfort in his injured hip. An MRI revealed that his hip <b>impingement</b> had resulted in a torn labrum and two cysts, possibly requiring season ending surgery. He was placed back on the 15-day disabled list on August 8. On September 3, 2014, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly told reporters that Beckett's season was likely over due to his injury. A couple of days later, Beckett confirmed that he would not pitch again in 2014 and added that he was also considering retirement. Beckett officially announced his retirement on October 7, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} often {{begins with}} {{examination of the}} patient's gait. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated {{in an attempt to}} avoid tibial spine <b>impingement</b> on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) {{is a major}} {{musculoskeletal}} disorder which causes are not always fully understood. Femoroac-etabular <b>impingements</b> such as cam / pincer cannot always explain observed OA in hips with normal morphology. This paper investigates the hypothesis of extreme repetitive movements {{as a source of}} cartilage degeneration. We present a clinical study conducted with professional ballet dancers and a methodology to perform functional sim-ulations of the hip joint in extreme postures. Throughout the process, various computer graphics techniques are used, like motion capture, 3 D body scanning and physically-based models. In addition to accelerate and strengthen some tasks, these techniques strongly participate in the clinical understanding of OA related to motion.

5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine <b>impingement</b> on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5|$|Roy's NBA debut {{was in his}} {{hometown}} against the Seattle SuperSonics. He scored 20points in that game, and 19 in the following game. An <b>impingement</b> in his left heel {{kept him out of}} 20games early in the season, but he scored his first career double-double shortly after his return, on December 22, 2006, against the Toronto Raptors. At the end of January 2007, Roy led all NBA rookies with 14.5points per game. He became the fourth Trail Blazer to be selected for the rookie squad of the NBA All-Star Weekend Rookie Challenge since its inception in 1994. He was the first Trail Blazer to participate in the All-Star Weekend since Rasheed Wallace's selection as an all star reserve in 2001.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. On the {{condition}} of water multiple jet <b>impingements,</b> a steady-state experimental study had been conducted for boiling heat transfer in an atmospheric pressure. The jet velocity was 0. 95 ~ 1. 59 m/s and the sub-cooling degrees of jet fluid were 30 ~ 83 â„ƒ. The results revealed that increasing either jet velocity or sub-cooling degrees would promote the heat flux through heated surface, and the effect was more pronounced in partial boiling regime than fully-developed boiling regime. The heat transfer with multiple jets is enhanced due to disturbance of different <b>impingements.</b> With modification of the factor which related to flow distance of fluid on heated surface, correlation which is applicable to one single impinging jet boiling, {{can also be used}} to calculate critical heat flux(CHF) in boiling heat transfer with multiple impinging jets...|$|R

30|$|In Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA), {{residual}} pain may be {{secondary to}} soft tissue <b>impingements,</b> which {{are difficult to}} visualize around chromium-cobalt implants using medical imaging, so their interactions remain poorly understood. The goal of this work was to establish a protocol for in-vitro imaging of the soft tissues around TKA, usable during throughout the range of motion (ROM).|$|R
25|$|Abnormal {{scapular}} {{function is}} called scapular dyskinesis. One action the scapula performs during a throwing or serving motion is {{elevation of the}} acromion process {{in order to avoid}} <b>impingement</b> of the rotator cuff tendons. If the scapula fails to properly elevate the acromion, <b>impingement</b> may occur during the cocking and acceleration phase of an overhead activity. The two muscles most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the serratus anterior and the lower trapezius. These two muscles act as a force couple within the glenohumeral joint to properly elevate the acromion process, and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder <b>impingement</b> may develop.|$|E
25|$|The final {{common factor}} is <b>impingement</b> syndrome, {{the most common}} non-sports related injury and which occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles become irritated and {{inflamed}} while passing through the subacromial space beneath the acromion. This relatively small space becomes even smaller when the arm is raised in a forward or upward position. Repetitive <b>impingement</b> can inflame the tendons and bursa, resulting in the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The G36 uses a short-stroke piston {{system from}} which HK later {{developed}} the HK-416's <b>impingement</b> system. Unlike direct <b>impingement,</b> this system takes gas trailing the bullet {{to operate a}} piston instead of pushing directly on the bolt. The G36's bolt is operated by a cam that guides the bolt carrier by its respective cutout. Then when fully pushed forward 7 radial locking lugs fully enclose the chamber.|$|E
30|$|In Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA), {{residual}} {{pain and}} poor functional outcomes can {{be due to}} <b>impingements</b> between prosthetic components and soft tissues such as the Popliteus tendon (popliteus) (Barnes & Scott 1995; Kazakin et al. 2014), the Patellar tendon (PT) (Argenson et al. 2005), the iliotibial band (ITB) (Luyckx et al. 2010) or the Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) (Bonnin et al. 2015; Bonnin et al. 2013). <b>Impingements</b> can be secondary to prosthetic overhang or component malposition (Allardyce et al. 1997; Barnes & Scott 1995; Bonnin et al. 2015; Bonnin et al. 2013; Kazakin et al. 2014; Mahoney & Kinsey 2010) but may also occur in well-sized and well-positioned prostheses (Allardyce et al. 1997). Optimizing bone-implant fit is therefore a concern for surgeons, engineers and manufacturers, and precise knowledge of the interactions between soft tissues, bone contours and prosthetic components during full range of movement would be useful.|$|R

These both supported American scientists and climate scientists more generally, and protested against other <b>impingements</b> on academic freedom internationally, such as government action against the Central European University in Hungary and the closure of educational institutes and dismissal of academics in the 2016-17 Turkish purges, {{as well as local}} issues.|$|R
40|$|Despite a large {{prevalence}} of rotator cuff <b>impingements</b> or tears {{in the elderly}} population, little {{research has focused on}} understanding how this population adapts to perform tasks of daily living. Past research has focused on the analysis of upper limb kinematics of young healthy individuals while performing these essential tasks (Magermans, 2004, Murray and Johnson., 2004). The purpose of this thesis was to identify kinematic and shoulder loading differences between elderly mobile individuals and elderly individuals with rotator cuff <b>impingements</b> during specific activities of daily living. Motion capture techniques were used in combination with the Shoulder Loading Analysis Modules (Dickerson, 2005, Dickerson et al., 2007) to estimate thoracohumeral kinematics and calculate external joint moments. Two-tailed t-tests with injury status as the factor determined that differences in active range of motion in flexion/extension and humeral rotations existed between the two populations. Results of the ADL analysis showed that the impinged population tended to have decreased plane of elevation and humeral rotations during ADLs. Task was also a main factor for most variables examined. Perineal care, hair-combing and reaching tasks were the most demanding in terms of range of motion necessary to complete the task. The reaching tasks resulted in the highest shoulder moment. K-means clustering techniques proved to be unsuccessful in identifying different motion strategies between the two study groups. This investigation showed that developing adaptations for perineal care, hair-combing and reaching tasks should be considered a priority when working with patients with rotator cuff <b>impingements,</b> as these tasks demanded the largest ranges of motion as well as high shoulder moments...|$|R
25|$|An {{inflamed}} bursa {{is called}} bursitis. Tendinitis and <b>impingement</b> syndrome are {{often accompanied by}} inflammation of the bursa sacs that protect the shoulder. Inflammation caused by a disease such as rheumatoid arthritis may cause rotator cuff tendinitis and bursitis. Sports involving overuse of the shoulder and occupations requiring frequent overhead reaching are other potential causes of irritation to the rotator cuff or bursa and may lead to inflammation and <b>impingement.</b>|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the mechanisms and extents of popliteus <b>impingements</b> {{before and after}} TKA and to investigate the influence of implant sizing. The hypotheses were that (1) popliteus <b>impingements</b> after TKA may occur at both the tibia and the femur, and (2) even with an apparently well-sized prosthesis, popliteal tracking during knee flexion is modified compared to the preoperative situation. The location of the popliteus in three cadaver knees was measured using computed tomography, before and after implantation of plastic TKA replicas, by injecting the tendon with radiopaque liquid. The pre- and post-operative positions of the popliteus were compared from full extension to deep flexion using normosized, oversized, and undersized implants (one size increments). At the tibia, TKA caused the popliteus to translate posteriorly, mostly in full extension: 4. 1 +/- 2 mm for normosized implants, and 15. 8 +/- 3 mm with oversized implants, but no translations were observed when using undersized implants. At the femur, TKA caused the popliteus to translate laterally at deeper flexion angles, peaking between 80 A degrees and 120 A degrees: 2 +/- 0. 4 mm for normosized implants and 2. 6 +/- 0. 5 mm with oversized implants. Three-dimensional analysis revealed prosthetic overhang at the posterosuperior corner of normosized and oversized femoral components (respectively, up to 2. 9 mm and 6. 6 mm). A well-sized tibial component modifies popliteal tracking, while an undersized tibial component maintains more physiologic patterns. Oversizing shifts the popliteus considerably throughout the full arc of motion. This study suggests that both femoro- and tibio-popliteus <b>impingements</b> could {{play a role in}} residual pain and stiffness after TKA...|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that no single physical examination test distinguishes reliably between bursitis, partial-thickness, and full-thickness tears. On the contrary, a combination of tests seems to provide the most accurate diagnosis. For <b>impingement,</b> these tests include the Hawkins-Kennedy <b>impingement</b> sign in which the examiner medially rotates the patient's flexed arm, forcing the supraspinatus tendon against the coracoacromial ligament and so producing pain if the test is positive a positive painful arc sign, and weakness in external rotation with the arm at the side.|$|E

40|$|Past {{statistical}} studies {{demonstrating the}} likelihood of slow blood flow in most ruptured aneurysms have sug-gested that thrombogenesis {{plays an important role}} in ruptures of cerebral artery aneurysms. In the authorsâ€™ previous study, it was reported that the degree of platelet aggregation in an aneurysm had a significant cor-relation with the flow pattern in the aneurysmal dome. It is, therefore, crucial to investigate flow structures in various different aneurysms in order to understand better the relationship between thrombogenesis and ruptures. In this study, patterns of blood flow in three models of cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysms were numerically analysed and compared to discern {{the likelihood of}} platelet aggregation. The three model aneurysms had com-parable aspect ratios (depth/neck width) but one model was larger in volume than the other two. Experimentally captured images of visualised flow in one of the three models were available and the calculated flow patterns in this model were seen to agree well with the images. Strong <b>impingements</b> of incoming main flows against aneu-rysmal necks were observed in all models regardless of the bifurcation angle and direction of the aneurysmal protrusion. These <b>impingements</b> presumably caused haemolysis, with ADP originating from haemolysed red blood cells inducing platelet aggregation. Dispersion of flow paths was observed only in the largest model and, consequently, fluid motion was slower than in the other two models. Thus, platelet aggregation was considere...|$|R
