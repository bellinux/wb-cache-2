40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the importance of the variation of environmental variables (geomorphological, topographical and climatic factors) along the lon gitudinal profile of a braided stream for the distribution of plant species and communities at a local scale. This was achieved by means of a case study in central Italy. Vegetation data from the river bed were grouped according to floristic and ecological affinities as follows: semi aquatic, helophytic, hygrophilous pioneer grasses, synantropical grasses, mesohygrophilous and pioneer grasses, <b>garigues,</b> hygrophilous shrubs, thermophilous shrubs, xerothermophilous shrubs and grasses, hygrophilous forest and thermophilous forest. A clear division between herbaceous and woody communities was observed along the first DCA axis and was inter preted as a transversal gradient of the stream due to decreasing flooding. Canonical Correspon dence Analysis suggested that altitude, distance from sea and bed width are the most important environmental variables explaining community distribution along the longitudinal profile. However, on this local scale, partial CCA showed that the abiotic variables explained 49. 6 % of the species data variation. This result, together with the lack of a correlation between environ mental factors and DCA axes 1 and 2, suggests that factors other than those included in the analysis, and probably only marginally linked to the longitudinal gradient, influenced the dis tribution of communities as well. On a local scale, we observed that there was no variation in the floristic composition of the coenoses along the longitudinal gradient. Consequently there is no vicariance of communities in terms of climate and/or biogeographic region. Along the longitudinal profile we found, however, the presence of coenoses that were ecologically (hard wood and soft wood) or structurally (dominance of woods, <b>garigues,</b> or pioneer coenoses) different in terms of geomorphological and topographical variables...|$|R

The physical and chemical features of soil were determined for each plot in which species composition and cover were recorded. The plots were classified by cluster analysis and ANOVA was applied to compare the environmental Variables of groups of plots. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to detect the principle factors related to the gradient of species composition within the plant communities. It was found that the grassland and dwarf vegetation of Monte Ferrato is not negatively influenced by soil content of nickel and other metals. Pine canopy cover, which provides additional nutrient input and protects against erosion, was found to be important for evolution of the <b>garigues</b> into grasslands.

S obzirom da otok Vrgada u svom najvišem dijelu vrh Strabinovac doseže visinu od 112 m, na njoj možemo razlikovati samo mediteransko-litoralni vegetacijski pojas. Taj je pojas zastupljen u eumediteranskoj vegetacijskoj zoni, a najznačajnija zajednica je Myrto-Quercetum ilicis, a na zaštićenim položajima Vrgade, te na južnoj i jugozapadnoj ekspoziciji otoka i na otočićima zastupljena je stenome diteranska asocijacija Pistacio-Juniperetum phoeniceae. Ukupno je naprav ljena 31 fitocenološka snimka. Snimke su rađene i analizirane po metodi Braun-Blanquet-a. Na svim snimkama provedene su dvije metode numeričke analize - klasterska analiza i multidimenzionalno skaliranje. Rezultati su pri kazani u tablicama 1 – 5 klasičnim prikazom fitocenoloških snimaka, a numeri čkom analizom dobiven je grafički prikaz (sl. 3 i 4). Sintaksonomskom analizom utvrđene su šumske zajednice gariga –Erico-Cistetum creticiH-ić 1958 i makije: Myrto-Quercetum ilicis (H-ić 1963) Trinajstić (1976) 1985, Fraxino orno–Quercetum ilicisH-ić (1956) 1958,Pistacio-Juniperetum phoe niceaeTrinajstić 1987 i Querco ilici-Pinetum halepensisLoisel 1971. Osim ovih zajednica koje se jasno uočavaju na terenu, dio otoka Vrgade i otočića Arntina obraštaju sastojine alepskog bora koji se spontano širi, a na otočiću Murvenjaku sastojine mirte i tršlje –Myrto-Pistacietum lentisciMoli nier (1936, 1954) Rivas Martinez 1975. The Vrgada Island {{with its}} surface of 2. 3 km 2 {{belongs to the}} group of small islands (Duplančić-Lederet et al., 2004). It is {{surrounded}} by 14 islets and reefs: Murvenjak or Murvenik (0. 609 km 2), Šipnata (0. 085 km 2), Oblik (0. 074 km 2), Kozina (0. 063 km 2), Gira (0. 056 km 2), Obrovanj (0. 04 km 2), Artina (0. 033 km 2), Veliki Školjić (0. 03 km 2), Mali Školjić (0. 013 km 2) and the Rakita, Vrtlić, Lončarić, Kamičić reefs (north of Vrgada) and Kamičić (south of Vrgada). The Vrgada islets and reefs are located in Dalmatia and belong to the Zadar archipelago. The island of Vrgada is made of Senon rudist limestone and alb-cenoman dolomites. Limestone and dolomites alternate with chondrodonts on certain parts of the island. The geological structure of the islets varies from limestone to dolomite (Mamužić et al. 1975). For the Vrgada Island and the surrounding islets there are no climatic data; therefore, the climatic data for Biograd, the nearest weather station on the land, was used in this research. According to the data of the Hydrometeorological In stitute of the Republic of Croatia for the period of 1981 – 2000 the average an­nual temperature was 15 oC. The annual precipitation was 814. 2 mm/m 2. Bioclimatically, the island of Vrgada and its islets belong to the bioclimate alliance Quercion ilicis. The vegetation of this alliance belongs, phytogeo graphically, to the Eumediterranean vegetation zone of the Mediterranean phytogeographic region (comp. Trinajstić 1998). The forest vegetation of the island of Vrgada and the surrounding islets was researched on several occasions during 2009 and 2010 by making rele vés. On the island of Vrgada and its islets we found only the Mediterranean-Littoral vegetation belt. The most significant community in this belt is Myrto-Quercetum ilicis and on the south and southwest exposition of the island of Vrgada and its islets it is the xerothermic vegetation alliance Oleo ceratonion and in it ass. Pistacio-Juniperetum phoeniceae. A total of 31 phy tocenological relevé was made. The relevés were made and analyzed using the classical Braun-Blanquet‘s method (Braun-Blanquet 1964). All records were subjected to two numerical methods of analysis – the cluster analysis and the multidimensional scaling (Sharma 1996; McGarigal et al. 2000). The numerical analysis was made using the SYN-TAX 2000 program package (Podani 2001). The phytocenological relevés were made and analyzed using the classical Braun-Blanquet method (Braun-Blanquer 1964) and the results are shown in the tables 1 – 5 whereas the graphic display (Picture 3 and 4) was made by a nu merical analysis. We have determined the forest communities of <b>garigues</b> – Erico manipulflorae-Cistetum creticiH-ić 1958 and maquis:Myrto-Quercetum ilicis(H-ić 1963) Trinajstić (1976) 1985, Fraxino orno–Quercetum ilicisH-ić (1956) 1958,Pistacio-Juniperetum phoeniceaeTrinajstić 1987 and Querco ilici-Pinetum halepensisLoisel 1971 by means of syntaxonomic analysis. Besides these communities that are easily perceived, a part of the island of Vrgada and a part of the Islet of Artina that were afforested during the 1950 es and 60 es with Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensisMill.) are now overgrowing into its stands. With this spontaneously spreading Aleppo pine we can find on the island of Vrgada the holm oak maquis, within which the initial stage with the community of <b>garigues</b> and the terminal stage with the community Myrto-Quercetum ilicis Trinajstić (1976) 1985 are distinguished. The <b>garigues</b> on Vrgada develop on grasslands and abandoned olive groves and are currently naturally progressing into evergreen maquis. On the Islet of Murvenjak theMyrto-Pistacietum lentisci(Molinier (1936) 1954) Rivas Martinez 1975) stands continue on the halophytic zone.

40|$|One of {{the basic}} tools to {{quantify}} biodiversity {{is based on the}} use of surrogate species. Such groups of species are easily assessed and may reflect the diversity of other important and less easily detectable taxa (cross-taxon surrogacy). Among these key groups of species, the vascular plant flora has great potential in determining diversity of other groups, since in terrestrial ecosystems it constitutes the bulk of total biomass and provides the physical structure for other organisms. The cross-taxon congruence of species diversity (species richness and species composition) among vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, fungi, oligochaetes, butterflies and birds was investigated with special attention to testing the potential role of vegetation as surrogate for the other studied taxa. The 271 ha Nature Reserve ‘‘Bosco di S. Agnese’’ (Tuscany, Italy) characterised by evergreen Mediterranean woodlands, scrublands, <b>garigues,</b> xeric grasslands and cultivations was used as study area. A multi-scale sampling design, based on a restricted random selection of plots, was used to get information about vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, fungi, oligochaetes, butterflies and birds. The congruence in species richness and composition among the different taxa was tested by Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Most of the pair-wise comparisons showed weak and statistically not significant correlations for both species richness and compositional data, indicating a limited cross-taxon congruence. Species richness of vascular plants was significantly correlated only to that of birds and butterflies. Compositional patterns were congruent only between vascular plants and butterflies. The results of this study indicated that neither vascular plants nor any other taxonomic group is a valid surrogate in this nature reserv...|$|R

40|$|Biogeography {{and ecology}} of {{southern}} Portuguese butterflies and burnets (Lepidoptera) During several {{visits to the}} western part of the Algarve (southern Portugal), the author mapped the butterflies and burnets of this region. In total, I observed 58 butterfly species (51 Papilionoidea, 7 Hesperiidae) and 6 Zygaenidae during my observations in spring and summer. More than 80 % of the species are Palaearctic faunal elements, three species are considered Holarctic, three are Nearctic and four are Palaeotropic. Around 75 % of the Palaearctic species are Mediterranean faunal elements. Within the Palaearctic group, the 23 species belonging uniquely to the Atlanto- Mediterranean faunal type are by far the largest group. Siberian elements are lacking. Thus, the observed species composition is characteristic for the Atlanto-Mediterranean region. Some of the observed species can be found all over the study area, often in a variety of habitats. Other species are more or less geographically restricted. Their regional distribution patterns depend on geomorphological and ecological constraints. Several species are restricted to the limestone areas, others are limited to the acid schist and granite areas. Several species were only observed in the western coastal dunes. Some species occur exclusively in the mountain areas. Some species were not recorded along the windy western and south-western coastal areas. Several species become rare or even disappear in suitable habitats that show little diversity of the vegetation. The occurrence of many species is directly linked to one or few distinct types of vegetation like cork oak forests, deciduous forests and natural hedges along water courses, Cistus macchias, <b>garigues</b> on limestone, dry grasslands or hot rocky places with little vegetation...|$|R
40|$|The genus Serapias L. {{comprises}} 30 species (DELFORGE, 2005), has {{a predominantly}} Mediterranenan distribution with its center {{of diversity in}} southern Italy and the Greek islands (Baumann and Künlele, 1989). Their flowers are characterized by sepals, petals and hypochile, joined {{together to form a}} small, dark tube that varies in diameter and depth among taxa (Baumann and Künlele, 1989). The flowers of this genus attract solitary bees to give them a sleeping place (Dafni et al., 1981), a draft free hiding place under bad or rainy weather conditions (Gumprecht, 1977), or a place for thermoregulation, because during the morning hours are warmed by solar radiation to 3 °C above the ambient temperature (Felicioli et al., 1998, Dafni et al., 1981). From a cytogenetic point of view, the heterocromatin distribution and the asymmetry of karyotype indicate a rather recent origin for Serapias (D’emerico et al., 2000); this feature, together with the geografical position of Apulia are two important factor that promote the natural hybridization in this genus. Here we describe the result of this process as two new Orchidaceae’s hybryd species, belong to Serapias genus, named Serapias x ruggieroi and Serapias x demericoi through analysis of morphological aspects. The parental species of S. x demericoi are Serapias x parvifloraParl. and Serapias politisii Renz, while the parental of Serapias x ruggieroi are S. parviflora Parl. and S. vomeracea (Burm. f.) Briq subsp. longipetala (Ten.) H. Baumann & Künkele. The distribution range of two parental species makes first hybrid probably quite common but difficult to detect, while, due to the distribution of Serapias politisii, the second hybrid is more rare and localized. S. x ruggieroi and S. x demericoi were found in a small area near S. Cataldo named "macchie di S. Cataldo" mainly characterized by <b>garigues</b> and maquis...|$|R
40|$|The {{vegetation}} {{of mining}} dumps of SW-Sardinia includes several endemic or rare species, {{that have been}} confined to such artificial habitats by a millennial mining activity. The extreme edaphic specialisation of these species reflects with unusual fidelity the heterogeneity of substrata, therefore creating a system of plant communities that largely contributes to the environmental diversity {{of this part of}} the island. The phytosociological study presented in this paper recognized eight associations, distinguished by the cluster analysis in two main groups, the first including hemicrypto-chamaephytic vegetation, the second including nanophanerophytic <b>garigues.</b> Six associations are belonging to the first group, five of which newly described: Helichryso tyrrhenici-Dianthetum sardoi ass. nov., occurring on gross-grained, hard-sloping dumps deriving from the geologic unit of Gonnesa; Coincyo recurvatae-Helichrysetum tyrrhenici ass. nov., colonizing dumps made of metamorphitic flakes and finer particles; Resedo luteolae-Limonietum merxmuelleri ass. nov., colonizing small-grained mining dumps with high concentrations in sulphides and heavy metals; Ptilostemono casabonae-Iberidetum integerrimae ass. nov., replacing the previous one on older and more consolidated dumps, where the concentration of phytotoxic elements was reduced by the meteoric agents; Epipactidetum tremolsii ass. nov., colonizing muddy deposits originating from ferrous clay; Euphorbio cupanii-Santolinetum insularis Angiolini & Bacchetta 2003, occurring on very old, stabilized dumps. All these associations can be ascribed to the class Scrophulario-Helichrysetea Brullo, Scelsi & Spampinato, 1998. Within this class, a new Sardo-Corsican alliance, Ptilostemono casabonae-Euphorbion cupanii is here proposed, differentiated by a pool of rare or endemic species. In addition to the above- mentioned associations, it is proposed, as well, to include into the new alliance the Polygono scoparii-Helichrysetum tyrrhenici Biondi, Vagge, Fogu & Mossa 1996 corr., that was described for the gravelly riverbeds of Central-Southern Sardinia. As concerns the second group, two new association have been recognized: Dorycnio suffruticosi-Genistetum corsicae ass. nov., found on abandoned, well consolidated mining dumps, with an upper layer altered by pedogenetic processes; Polygalo sardoae-Linetum muelleri ass. nov., occurring in the vicinities of the mines on steep rocky slopes made of Paleozoic metalliferous limestones.

In this work we report {{the content of the}} polar {{fraction}} of Sideritis romana L. subsp. romana, a species widely distributed on the Italian territory on <b>garigues</b> and dry meadows till 1900 m a. s. l. The study of the ethanolic extract of the fresh aerial parts of S. Romana subsp. romana led to the isolation and identification of seven compounds namely phytol (1), apigenin 7 -O-(6 "-O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) (2), 7 -[[2 -O-(6 -O-acetyl-β-D-allopyranosyl) -β-D-glucopyranosyl]oxy]- 5 -hydroxy- 2 -(3 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxyphenyl) - 4 H- 1 -benzopyran- 4 -one (3), 7 -[[2 -O-(6 -O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl) -β-D-glucopyranosyl]oxy]- 2 -(3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl) - 5 -hydroxy- 4 H- 1 -benzopyran- 4 -one, (4), 7 -[[2 -O-(6 -O-acetyl-β-D-allopyranosyl) -β-D-glucopyranosyl]oxy]- 5 -hydroxy- 2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 4 H- 1 -benzopyran- 4 -one (5), 6 -deoxiharpagide (6) and harpagide (7). Compound (1) is a very common acyclic diterpene alcohol, compounds from (2) to (5) are glycosidic-flavones derivates of apigenin and luteolin and lastly compounds (6) and (7) are iridoids. Iridoids are considered chemotaxonomic markers in Lamiaceae, in particular harpagide and its derivatives, and were evidenced {{for the first time in}} this study as constituents of S. romana subsp. romana. The second important aspect is the presence of acetylated apigenin and luteolin glycosides containing allose. This is the first report on the occurrence of these kinds of flavones in the genus Sideritis, while they have been previously isolated only from species comprised in Ajugoideae subfamily (Ajuga reptans, A. genevensis) as glycosides as well as free aglycones. In this context is worth to note the absence of isoscutellarein derivatives, which had been already evidenced in the genus Sideritis and are considered chemosystematic markers since their occurrence seems to be restricted to some correlated genera in the Lamiaceae as Pogostemon, Galeopsis and Stachys. The presence of a considerable amount of flavonoids might perhaps justify the traditional use of this species as a herbal tea. In fact apigenin and luteolin glycosides resulted to exert a strong anxiolytic action...|$|R
