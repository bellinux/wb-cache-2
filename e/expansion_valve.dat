25|$|The working fluid, in its gaseous state, is {{pressurized}} and circulated {{through the}} system by a compressor. On the discharge side of the compressor, the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a heat exchanger, called a condenser, until it condenses into a high pressure, moderate temperature liquid. The condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressure-lowering device also called a metering device. This may be an <b>expansion</b> <b>valve,</b> capillary tube, or possibly a work-extracting device such as a turbine. The low-pressure liquid refrigerant then enters another heat exchanger, the evaporator, in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils. The refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated.|$|E
25|$|The main {{inefficiency}} in {{a common}} thermal working machine is the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve,</b> which allows to pass the refrigerant liquid from the low pressure blow pressure without using the potential energy available. This patented and published invention in 2017 by Giuseppe Verde adopts a special technique based on power regeneration for internal cycles, {{in order to reduce}} the consumption of electricity. Innovation is therefore linked to the insertion of a heat exchanger for the recovery of energy and an alternator within a conventional refrigeration system. Applying this device results in a high improvement in energy efficiency and refrigeration capacity. Both of these effects increase when the operating temperature and the evaporation temperature decrease. In addition, an advantageous object of the present invention is the insertion of an electric charge accumulator comprising an automatic timed control system for switching off the electric circuit, which guarantees the possibility of economically benefiting the multi-hour tariff electric energy.|$|E
2500|$|The vapor-compression {{cycle is}} used in most {{household}} refrigerators {{as well as in}} many large commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system. [...] The thermodynamics of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as Freon enters the compressor as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the vapor pressure at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the condenser which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing flash evaporation and auto-refrigeration of, typically, {{less than half of the}} liquid. [...] That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Large {{commercial}} or industrial refrigeration systems may have multiple <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> and multiple evaporators {{in order to}} refrigerate multiple enclosed spaces or rooms. In such systems, the condensed liquid refrigerant may be routed into a pressure vessel, called a receiver, from which liquid refrigerant is withdrawn and routed through multiple pipelines to the multiple <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> and evaporators.|$|R

40|$|Adopting {{electronic}} <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> in {{air conditioners}} enables an appreciable energy saving {{with respect to}} the same installations equipped with traditional thermostatic <b>expansion</b> <b>valves.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that electronic valves allow a lower condensation pressure in systems equipped with air cooled condensers, which is adjusted to variations in outside air temperature. Furthermore, PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control over the superheating leads to the best use of evaporator under every condition (lower superheating level of the vapour refrigerant), thus increasing the refrigerating capacity. This paper reports on the results of a set of measurements that were carried out from March to November 2006 on the operation of eight direct expansion air conditioners having a total cooling capacity of 120 kW installed at a telephone control room near Bologna (North Italy). Air conditioners are equipped with both thermostatic and electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valves,</b> alternatively activated by solenoid valves on a daily basis, in order to compare the two systems in the same environment and at similar load conditions.

40|$|The survey from US Department of Energy {{showed that}} {{about one-third of}} energy {{consumption}} in US is due to air conditioning and refrigeration systems. This significant usage of electricity in the HVAC industry has prompted researchers to develop dynamic models for the HVAC components, which leads to implementation of better control and optimization techniques. In this research, efforts are made to model a multi-evaporator system. A novel dynamic modeling technique is proposed based on moving boundary method, which can be generalized {{for any number of}} evaporators in a vapor compression cycle. The models were validated experimentally on a commercial supermarket refrigeration unit. Simulation results showed that the models capture the major dynamics of the system in both the steady state and transient external disturbances. Furthermore the use of MEMS (microelectromechanical) based Silicon <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valves</b> (SEVs) have reportedly shown power savings as compared to the Thermal <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valves</b> (TEVs). Experimental tests were conducted on a supermarket refrigeration unit fitted with the MEMS valves to explain the cause of these potential energy savings. In this study an advanced cascaded control algorithm was also designed to control the MEMS valves. The performance of the cascaded control architecture was compared with the standard Thermal <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valves</b> (TEVs) and a commercially available Microstaq (MS) Superheat Controller (SHC). The results reveal that the significant efficiency gains derived on the SEVs are due to better superheat regulation, tighter superheat control and superior cooling effects in shorter time period which reduces the total run-time of the compressor. It was also observed that the duty cycle was least for the cascaded control algorithm. The reduction in duty cycle indicates early shut-off for the compressor resulting in maximum power savings for the cascaded control, followed by the Microstaq controller and then the Thermal <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valves...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thermostatic <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> (TXVs) {{have long}} been used in {{air-cooled}} chillers to implement head pressure control under which the condensing temperature is kept high at around 50 °C by staging condenser fans as few as possible. This paper considers how TXVs prevent the chillers from operating with an increased COP at lower condensing temperatures when the chiller load or outdoor temperature drops. An analysis on an existing air-cooled reciprocating chiller showed that the range of differential pressures across TXVs restricts the maximum heat rejection airflow required to increase the chiller COP, though the set point of condensing temperature is reduced to 22 °C from {{a high level of}} 45 °C. It is possible to use electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> to meet the differential pressure requirements for maximum chiller COP. There is a maximum of 28. 7 % increase in the chiller COP when the heat rejection airflow is able to be maximized in various operating conditions.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{suffer from}} range anxiety, while traditional resistive heating consumes {{a lot of}} electric energy and reduces EV drive range largely. Mobile reversible air conditioning-heat pump system is an energy efficient way of providing heat to EV cabin climate. In this paper, an AC/HP system was built based on the Nissan Leaf system configuration and experimentally studied. This system consists of three heat exchangers, an open-shaft compressor, two <b>expansion</b> <b>valves,</b> and two flow control valves. Heating performance of the system under various operating conditions was extensively investigated. Controlling subcooling was found a beneficial way of obtaining higher energy efficiency. Refrigerant charge imbalance when switching modes {{was found to be}} a challenge, and was studied both experimentally and numerically. Careful positioning of <b>expansion</b> <b>valves,</b> and sizing of liquid lines in both modes are essential in avoiding large charge imbalance. Component wise, the outdoor heat exchanger holds much more charge in AC mode than in HP mode.

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of thermal {{expansion}} valves: internally or externally equalized. The difference between externally and internally equalized valves is how the evaporator pressure affects {{the position of the}} needle. In internally equalized valves, the evaporator pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the inlet of the evaporator, whereas in externally equalized valves, the evaporator pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the outlet of the evaporator. Externally equalized thermostatic <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> compensate for any pressure drop through the evaporator.|$|R

50|$|Subcooling is {{normally}} used {{so that when}} the cycling refrigerant reaches the thermostatic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve,</b> its totality is in its liquid form, thus, allowing the valve to work properly. If gas reaches the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve,</b> in a refrigeration system, a series of usually unwanted phenomena may occur. These may end up leading to behaviors similar to those observed with the flash-gas phenomena: problems in oil regulation throughout the cycle; excessive and unnecessary misuse of power and waste of electricity; malfunction and deterioration of several components in the installation; irregular performance of the overall systems, and, in a totally unwatched situation, even ruined gear.|$|E
50|$|An <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> is {{a device}} in steam engine valve gear that {{improves}} engine efficiency. It operates by closing off {{the supply of}} steam early, before the piston has travelled through its full stroke. This cut-off allows the steam to then expand within the cylinder. This expanding steam is still sufficient to drive the piston, even though its pressure decreases as it expands. As less steam is supplied in the shorter time for which the valve is open, use of the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> reduces the steam consumed and thus the fuel required. The engine (on 1875 figures) may deliver two-thirds of the work, for only one-third of the steam.|$|E

40|$|The active fog {{catching}} senior {{project team}} {{has been asked to}} develop a device that will harvest water from the atmosphere, namely fog, using active means. The project will be centered on maximizing water collection rate, with efficiency as a secondary concern. The final design utilizes a refrigeration system in which fans pull air across the cold evaporators inside of a duct. Water condenses on the evaporators and drain into a collection container. It was decided to focus on maximizing water collection at the cost of efficiency because the feasibility of actively harvesting fog must be proved before trying to make the system efficient. A Copeland condensing unit that provides 2, 490 Btu/min of heat transfer from the evaporator to the incoming fog is used in tandem with three <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> and four evaporators. Two Vernier <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> will allow the system to be finely adjusted while a third ball valve is used to coarsely adjust the flowrate. In addition, temperature and pressure gauges will be used to monitor the performance of the system and add additional control over the system. Speed controllers are connected in series to the fans in order to allow for variable flowrate. For testing, the system was placed in a high humidity environment and the fans were set to run at a predetermined flowrate. The Vernier <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> were adjusted until the first couple coils were frosting and the kWh consumption of the system was monitored using a watt meter. The results showed that the optimal flowrate for this system was between 140 - 150 cfm. In addition, it was discovered that pulsing the fans (toggling between the set point flowrate and the maximum flowrate for a brief period of time) would promote condensate to form droplets and drip out of the evaporators. The results showed that at the optimum flowrate, with pulsing, and a relatively high humidity the system could capture an experimental maximum steady state condensation rate of. 307 gal/kWh. This amounted to approximately one gallon of water collected in six hours, at an energy cost of approximately forty cents...|$|R
