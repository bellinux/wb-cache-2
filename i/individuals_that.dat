5|$|Rh factor, {{also known}} as Rh D antigen, is an antigen found on red blood cells; <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> are Rh-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> are Rh-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal childbirth, {{delivery}} trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a fetus can enter the mother's system. In {{the case of an}} Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.|$|E

5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> even very slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because {{even a small}} degree of protection reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E

5|$|From the 1940s to the 1960s, The Accounting Review {{published}} articles of greater diversity, and leading authors {{during this period}} tended to have less practical accounting experience and more formal education. During this period, the three <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> accounted {{for most of the}} editorial duties of the journal were A. C. Littleton (1944-1947), Frank Smith (1950-1959) and Robert Mautz (1960-1962), all of whom either had practical accounting experience, or were leading authors prior to 1945, when the journal was oriented towards the accounting practice.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study done}} at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of {{organization}} were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities are <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core groups, within the community. Core groups are <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> shared the same core area within a community territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, {{ranging in size from}} two individuals to nine. Females within the groups are cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations of core groups in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013, the perturbational {{complexity}} index (PCI) was proposed, {{a measure}} of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation. This measure was shown to be higher in <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state, making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E

50|$|Essential to {{understanding}} risk-aversion is the implicit learning that occurs during fear-conditioning.

Similarly, fear-conditioning is the acquisition of knowledge <b>that</b> informs an <b>individual</b> <b>that</b> a particular neutral stimulus now predicts an event that endangers their psychological or physical well-being.|$|R

5|$|Most social foragers must {{search for}} food while also {{avoiding}} predators. It {{has been suggested}} that <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> play scrounger could also, by virtue of their head position, be alert for predators and hence contribute to antipredatory vigilance. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence more joining. When stationary, the head-up tactic {{has been shown to be}} associated with antipredatory vigilance. However scanning while hopping does not aid in vigilance and it is thought that the scrounger tactic is incompatible with antipredatory vigilance in the scaly-breasted munia.|$|E

5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} the nest, the queen tends to be the most active individual in the nest. This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest. In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker of the nest and synchronize the worker activity. These last two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> are the least active.|$|E

5|$|Since {{producers}} {{search for}} food and scroungers wait for opportunities to join, prey crypsis imposes a producer specific cost that shifts the producer scrounger equilibria towards more scrounging. Prey crypsis resulted in increased latency to eat the seed and increased number of detection errors. Moreover, {{the presence of a}} competitor negatively affected foraging efficiency under cyptic backgrounds. The foraging efficiency of <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> had previously foraged with a competitor on cryptic seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed. Thus, the costs of foraging on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{as a whole}} exhibit {{varying levels}} of fluency in the Khmer and Vietnamese languages. Vietnamese that live in {{self-contained}} fishing communities along the Tonle Sap use Vietnamese in their day-to-day conversations and have <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> have limited Khmer language skills {{and those that are}} bilingual in both languages. On the other hand, Vietnamese that live in predominantly Khmer-speaking neighbourhoods send their children to public schools, and as a result the children are able to speak Khmer fluently but show very limited understanding of Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E
