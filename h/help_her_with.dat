5|$|Marge and Homer argue {{later that}} night. Homer tells Marge {{that even though}} getting the {{trampoline}} was a mistake at least {{he is willing to}} try new things, while she is boring and nags too much. Marge disagrees, but discovers that Bart and Lisa agree with Homer's assessment. She becomes annoyed and stays the night at Patty and Selma's house. While there, she is introduced to an infomercial featuring self-help guru Brad Goodman, who supposedly can <b>help</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> her chronic nagging. After Marge and Homer watch a Brad Goodman video, Marge is more tolerant {{and the two of them}} get along better. Observing how out of control Bart is, they take the family to see Brad Goodman's live lecture in the hopes that it will change him. Bart interrupts the lecture, and Brad Goodman encourages the town to follow Bart's spontaneous attitude. Soon, the whole town begins to act like Bart, which means Bart's rebellious ways are no longer unique, putting him in a slump.|$|E
5|$|The {{band members}} all {{responded to this}} {{production}} method differently, with Iwadera and Kusakari finding the approach the easiest. Okazaki and Ejima both had trouble adopting this method. Okazaki was very anxious about her ability to create demos, having never used music software before, and not even owning a computer before moving to Tokyo. Yamaguchi bought her an iBook to <b>help</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> the process. Ejima found difficulty in recording demos due {{to the problem of}} recording drums at home for sound sampling. As a result, he learnt how to play the guitar. In June, the band were creating songs on a daily basis, and in August were still in the pre-production stages of the album. The album was created at Yamaguchi's apartment in Noborito in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, which became a meeting place for all of the band members for the album. In total, around thirty demo compositions were produced for the album. This method of song production also led to Yamaguchi being able to think of the album as a whole, as opposed to their methods on Go to the Future and Night Fishing, in which each song was thought of in its own individual context.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Madonna {{collaborated with}} {{photographer}} Steven Klein for an art installation project called X-Static Process. The installation portrayed Madonna in different incarnations of her spiritual practices– from yogi, prophet, queen to freak and pole dancer. The publication was a worldwide success, {{leading to a}} number of exhibitions in New York, London, Paris, Düsseldorf, Berlin and Florence. After the exhibition was over, Madonna was inspired by the images from the exhibitions and decided to incorporate them into her then unplanned tour and asked Klein to <b>help</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> the task. She then began developing her sixth concert tour called Re-Invention World Tour. The poster released for the tour used one of the images from the installation project. It featured Madonna in a seventeenth-century-style dress, crawling on all fours towards the camera. The central theme of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with different themes: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. During the Q Awards, Elton John accused Madonna for lip-synching in her shows which gained great controversy but was denied by Madonna's representatives. Although musician Prince's Musicology Live 2004ever tour was initially projected to be the highest grossing tour of 2004, Billboard Boxscore published that the Re-Invention Tour had sold 55 out of the 56 shows and grossed $125 million. At the 2004 Billboard Touring Awards, Re-Invention Tour received the Top Tour while Madonna's tour manager Caresse Henry was awarded the Top Manager award. A documentary, titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret, which chronicled the tour, was released in 2005.|$|E

Her father asked her if she would like a gift instead that was better than a servant and worth more than everything in the world. Upon her ready agreement, he told her to recite {{at the end of every}} prayer the Great Exaltation, Allahu Akbar 34 times, the Statement of Absolute Gratitude, Alhamdulillah 33 times and the Invocation of Divine Glory, Subhan'Allah 33 times, totalling 100.

According to her family, she quickly {{found that he was}} abusive, possessive, and controlling. Several times a day, he demanded that she send him a picture of herself from her cellphone to prove that she was not with anyone else. Her parents began developing a plan {{to get her out of}} the relationship. By the end of the year, she was pregnant again, likely by Roldan.|$|E

In 1989, the owner of the gym at which she worked offered her space for a studio above the gym, and also casual work as a receptionist if she needed extra money. She remembers the space as squalid, full of cockroach droppings that would be dislodged by the vibrations of people jumping around in the building.

Now struck with fear, her father ordered her to be put to death.|$|E
