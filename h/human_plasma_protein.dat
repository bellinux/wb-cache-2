Using previously established ultracentrifugation approaches, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, the current study investigated the binding of <b>human</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> to commercially available titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles. We found that, despite these particles having similar surface charges in buffer, they bound different <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins.</b> For TiO 2, the shape of the nanoparticles was also an important determinant of protein binding.
