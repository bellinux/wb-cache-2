40|$|The modules of the LHCb Outer Tracker {{have shown}} {{to suffer from}} <b>gain</b> <b>loss</b> under {{irradiation}} at moderate intensities, {{a process known as}} ageing. The plastifier in the glue with which the detector modules were constructed, Araldite AY 103 - 1, {{has been shown to be}} the culprit. In this thesis this is confirmed by irradiating a module constructed with Araldite AY 105 - 1, which does not contain the harmful plastifier. Several methods to prevent and repair the <b>gain</b> <b>loss</b> exist. One preventive measure is the addition of oxygen. However, because of its electronegative nature, oxygen can capture some of the drifting electrons, thereby lowering the gain of the OT. Simulations have been done to investigate the effect of oxygen on the gain and efficiency. One method to remove the ageing is HV training. In this procedure the applied voltage is increased such, that the OT enters the discharge regime. These discharges mostly remove the ageing, but can take place anywhere in the straw tube, not necessarily at the location of the ageing. Curing the module while putting a source near the location of the ageing is shown to always cure the <b>gain</b> <b>loss.</b> Finally, a method has been devised to quantify the amount of <b>gain</b> <b>loss</b> in the OT with the standard OT readout electronics. By performing a threshold scan it is possible to accurately determine the average <b>gain</b> <b>loss</b> of the straws...|$|R

It is only when {{it is difficult to}} imagine how more (less) time would be beneficial (detrimental) that there is dimin-ishing marginal utility (disutility) for time. Thus time valuation shows increasing marginal utility when there is a time deficit, but diminishing marginal utility when there is a time surplus.

40|$|The {{purpose or}} {{objective}} of this dissertation was to analyse the current income tax treatment of derivative financial instruments in South Africa. In the context of financial markets, derivative financial instruments are mainly used for hedging and speculation. The dissertation considers whether the current South African Income Tax Act deals with the income taxation of derivatives with respect to <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> and the timing of those <b>gains</b> and <b>losses.</b> With regards {{to the nature of}} <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> arising from derivative transactions, the aspect which was considered is whether <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> were of a capital or revenue nature in the context of speculation or hedging. With regards to the timing of <b>gains</b> or <b>losses,</b> the dissertation considers when <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> should be brought into taxable income of a taxpayer. The following examples of derivative financial instruments were analysed: cross currency swaps, index options, credit default swaps and contracts for differences (CFDs). These derivatives were analysed with respect to the nature and timing of the <b>gains</b> or <b>losses</b> when hedging or speculating. The impact of the provisions of the Eighth Schedule is also considered with respect to the derivatives mentioned above. CopyrightDissertation (MCom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.
