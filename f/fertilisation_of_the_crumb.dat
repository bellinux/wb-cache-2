40|$|AbstractBackground: Specialised cell {{junctions}} in epithelia {{serve as}} cell–cell adhesion sites and thus contribute to <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> tissue integrity. <b>The</b> Drosophila gene <b>crumbs</b> encodes a transmembrane protein {{that is required}} for <b>the</b> biogenesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zonula adherens, a belt-like structure encircling <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> epithelial cells. As previously shown, expression <b>of</b> just <b>the</b> short membrane-bound cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to rescue major defects associated with <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>crumbs</b> function. Results: <b>The</b> cytoplasmic domain <b>of</b> <b>Crumbs</b> is highly conserved in two putative crumbs homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans. To assess <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> conserved residues, various point mutations and deletions were introduced into this region. Two functional domains were revealed, an amino-terminal region and the carboxy-terminal amino acids EERLI. Both are necessary for rescue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crumbs</b> phenotype. <b>The</b> EERLI motif interacts with Discs Lost, a cytoplasmic protein containing PDZ domains. Overexpression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crumbs</b> cytoplasmic domain induces a transition from the single-layered epithelium to a multilayered tissue. This transition is associated with redistribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Drosophila homologue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, and depends on <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EERLI motif. Conclusions: We propose a model in which <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crumbs</b> carboxyl terminus with Discs Lost organises a membrane-associated protein complex in <b>the</b> apical cytocortex <b>of</b> epithelial cells. This scaffold mediates the localisation and stabilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zonula adherens component DE-cadherin, a crucial component for <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> epithelial cell polarity and tissue integrity...|$|R

Genetic {{studies show that}} polarization of invertebrate epithelia requires <b>the</b> <b>crumbs,</b> partition-defective- 3, and discs large complexes. These evolutionarily conserved protein complexes occur in mammalian kidney; however, their role in renal development remains poorly defined. Here, we find that mice lacking the small PDZ protein mammalian LIN- 7 c (MALS- 3) have hypomorphic, cystic, and fibrotic kidneys. Proteomic analysis defines MALS- 3 as the only known core component <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> <b>crumbs</b> and discs large cell polarity complexes.

Interestingly, MALS- 3 controls apico-basal polarity preferentially in epithelia derived from metanephric mesenchyme, and defects in kidney architecture owe solely to MALS expression in these epithelia.

Scott SmithThe {{prevalence}} of diabetes along with <b>the</b> perceived impact <b>of</b> sugar on health in general {{has increased the}} demand for reduced-sugar and sugar-free baked products. Cakes typically contain large quantities of sucrose which affects not only flavor but also color, volume, and texture. This study evaluated <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> replacing sucrose in white layer cakes with polydextrose and two artificial sweeteners: sucralose and stevia extract. White layer cakes were made using AACCI Method 10 - 90. 01. Batter properties were evaluated by measuring specific gravity. Volume index was measured using a cake template (AACCI Method 10 - 91. 01). Slice area, number of cells, number of holes, and wall thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crumb</b> were calculated and recorded using C-Cell Cake Imaging system. Control batter made with 135 % water had a specific gravity of 0. 90 g/cc and a cake volume index <b>of</b> 112. <b>The</b> cakes had a nicely golden brown, shiny surface. <b>The</b> <b>crumb</b> grain was fine with an even cell distribution. Optimum water level and baking time were obtained for each cake variation. Although replacing sucrose with polydextrose had no significant effect on specific gravity (p> 0. 05), a 25 % replacement resulted in a cake with a volume index of 110, 50 % with an index of 105, 75 % with an index of 103, and 100 % with an index <b>of</b> 97. <b>The</b> <b>crumb</b> grain {{was similar to the}} control cake. Adding sucralose and stevia yielded similar results, where lower volumes were recorded as polydextrose and sucralose/stevia were increased in the cake formula. Complete replacement of sucrose with polydextrose and sucralose or polydextrose and stevia produced an acceptable volume <b>of</b> cake. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> holes and wall thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crumb</b> was not significantly different in any cake variation.
