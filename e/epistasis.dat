25|$|In {{evolutionary}} genetics, {{the sign}} of <b>epistasis</b> is usually more significant than the magnitude of <b>epistasis.</b> This is because magnitude <b>epistasis</b> (positive and negative) simply affects how beneficial mutations are together, however sign <b>epistasis</b> affects whether mutation combinations are beneficial or deleterious.|$|E
25|$|Independently, {{when the}} effect on fitness of two {{mutations}} is more radical than expected from their effects when alone, it {{is referred to as}} synergistic <b>epistasis.</b> The opposite situation, when the fitness difference of the double mutant from the wild type is smaller than expected from the effects of the two single mutations, it is called antagonistic <b>epistasis.</b> Therefore, for deleterious mutations, negative <b>epistasis</b> is also synergistic, while positive <b>epistasis</b> is antagonistic; conversely, for advantageous mutations, positive <b>epistasis</b> is synergistic, while negative <b>epistasis</b> is antagonistic.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{when two}} {{mutations}} together {{lead to a}} less fit phenotype than expected from their effects when alone, it is called negative <b>epistasis.</b> Negative <b>epistasis</b> between beneficial mutations causes smaller than expected fitness improvements, whereas negative <b>epistasis</b> between deleterious mutations causes greater-than-additive fitness drops.|$|E
25|$|When {{the double}} {{mutation}} has a fitter phenotype than {{expected from the}} effects of the two single mutations, it is referred to as positive <b>epistasis.</b> Positive <b>epistasis</b> between beneficial mutations generates greater improvements in function than expected. Positive <b>epistasis</b> between deleterious mutations protects against the negative effects to cause a less severe fitness drop.|$|E
25|$|Terminology about <b>epistasis</b> {{can vary}} between {{scientific}} fields. Geneticists often refer to wild type and mutant alleles where the mutation is implicitly deleterious and may talk {{in terms of}} genetic enhancement, synthetic lethality and genetic suppressors. Conversely, a biochemist may more frequently focus on beneficial mutations and so explicitly state {{the effect of a}} mutation and use terms such as reciprocal sign <b>epistasis</b> and compensatory mutation. Additionally, there are differences when looking at <b>epistasis</b> within a single gene (biochemistry) and <b>epistasis</b> within a haploid or diploid genome (genetics). In general, <b>epistasis</b> is used to denote the departure from 'independence' of the effects of different genetic loci. Confusion often arises due to the varied interpretation of 'independence' among different branches of biology. The classifications below attempt to cover the various terms and how they relate to one another.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epistasis</b> in diploid organisms {{is further}} {{complicated}} {{by the presence of}} two copies of each gene. <b>Epistasis</b> can occur between loci, but additionally, interactions can occur between the two copies of each locus in heterozygotes. For a two locus, two allele system, there are eight independent types of gene interaction.|$|E
25|$|Both {{pleiotropism}} and <b>epistasis</b> {{show that}} a gene need not relate to a character in the simple manner that was once supposed.|$|E
25|$|The NK {{model has}} found use in many fields, {{including}} {{in the study of}} spin glasses, <b>epistasis</b> and pleiotropy in evolutionary biology, and combinatorial optimisation.|$|E
25|$|When {{assaying}} <b>epistasis</b> {{within a}} gene, site-directed mutagenesis {{can be used}} to generate the different genes, and their protein products can be assayed (e.g. for stability or catalytic activity). This is sometimes called a double mutant cycle and involves producing and assaying the wild type protein, the two single mutants and the double mutant. <b>Epistasis</b> is measured as the difference between the effects of the mutations together versus the sum of their individual effects. This can be expressed as a free energy of interaction.|$|E
25|$|Understanding of <b>epistasis</b> {{has changed}} {{considerably}} through {{the history of}} genetics and so too has {{the use of the}} term. In early models of natural selection devised in the early 20th century, each gene was considered to make its own characteristic contribution to fitness, against an average background of other genes. Some introductory courses still teach population genetics this way. Because of the way that the science of population genetics was developed, evolutionary geneticists have tended to think of <b>epistasis</b> as the exception. However, in general, the expression of any one allele depends in a complicated way on many other alleles.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} genetics, if genes A and B are mutated, {{and each}} mutation by itself produces a unique phenotype {{but the two}} mutations together show the same phenotype as the gene A mutation, then gene A is epistatic and gene B is hypostatic. For example, the gene for total baldness is epistatic to the gene for brown hair. In this sense, <b>epistasis</b> can be contrasted with genetic dominance, which is an interaction between alleles at the same gene locus. As the study of genetics developed, and {{with the advent of}} molecular biology, <b>epistasis</b> started to be studied in relation to Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and polygenic inheritance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epistasis</b> is the {{phenomenon}} where {{the effect of}} one gene (locus) {{is dependent on the}} presence of one or more 'modifier genes', i.e. the genetic background. Originally the term meant that the phenotypic effect of one gene is masked by a different gene (locus). Thus, epistatic mutations have different effects in combination than individually. It was originally a concept from genetics but is now used in biochemistry, computational biology and evolutionary biology. It arises due to interactions, either between genes, or within them, leading to non-linear effects. <b>Epistasis</b> has a large influence on the shape of evolutionary landscapes, which leads to profound consequences for evolution and evolvability of phenotypic traits.|$|E
25|$|The same {{methodology}} {{can be used}} {{to investigate}} the interactions between larger sets of mutations but all combinations have to be produced and assayed. For example, there are 120 different combinations of 5 mutations, some or all of which may show <b>epistasis...</b>|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{networks}} {{are used for}} modelling beliefs in computational biology and bioinformatics (gene regulatory networks, protein structure, gene expression analysis, learning <b>epistasis</b> from GWAS data sets) medicine, biomonitoring, document classification, information retrieval, semantic search, image processing, data fusion, decision support systems, engineering, sports betting, gaming, geophysics and volcano monitoring , law, study design and risk analysis.|$|E
25|$|DE allows {{control of}} {{selection}} pressure, mutation rate and environment (both the abiotic environment such as temperature, and the biotic environment, such as other {{genes in the}} organism). Additionally, there is a complete record of all evolutionary intermediate genes. This allows for detailed measurements of evolutionary processes, for example <b>epistasis,</b> evolvability, adaptive constraint fitness landscapes, and neutral networks.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} much {{criticism}} of Kondrashov's theory, since it relies on two key restrictive conditions. The first requires {{that the rate of}} deleterious mutation should exceed one per genome per generation in order to provide a substantial advantage for sex. While there is some empirical evidence for it (for example in Drosophila and E. coli), there is also strong evidence against it. Thus, for instance, for the sexual species Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Neurospora crassa (fungus), the mutation rate per genome per replication are 0.0027 and 0.0030 respectively. For the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the mutation rate per effective genome per sexual generation is 0.036. Secondly, there should be strong interactions among loci (synergistic <b>epistasis),</b> a mutation-fitness relation for which there is only limited evidence. Conversely, there is also the same amount of evidence that mutations show no <b>epistasis</b> (purely additive model) or antagonistic interactions (each additional mutation has a disproportionally small effect).|$|E
25|$|This {{hypothesis}} was proposed by Alexey Kondrashov, and is sometimes {{known as the}} deterministic mutation hypothesis. It assumes {{that the majority of}} deleterious mutations are only slightly deleterious, and affect the individual such that the introduction of each additional mutation has an increasingly large effect on the fitness of the organism. This relationship between number of mutations and fitness is known as synergistic <b>epistasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{are held}} in their {{tertiary}} structure by a distributed, internal network of cooperative interactions (hydrophobic, polar and covalent). Epistatic interactions occur whenever one mutation alters the local environment of another residue (either by directly contacting it, or by inducing changes in the protein structure). For example, in a disulphide bridge, a single cysteine {{has no effect on}} protein stability until a second is present at the correct location at which point the two cysteines form a chemical bond which enhances the stability of the protein. This would be observed as positive <b>epistasis</b> where the double-cysteine variant had a much higher stability than either of the single-cysteine variants. Conversely, when deleterious mutations are introduced, proteins often exhibit mutational robustness whereby as stabilising interactions are destroyed the protein still functions until it reaches some stability threshold at which point further destabilising mutations have large, detrimental effects as the protein can no longer fold. This leads to negative <b>epistasis</b> whereby mutations that have little effect alone have a large, deleterious effect together.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{computational}} {{methods have}} been developed for the detection and characterization of <b>epistasis.</b> Many of these rely on machine learning to detect non-additive effects that might be missed by statistical approaches such as linear regression. For example, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was designed specifically for nonparametric and model-free detection of combinations of genetic variants that are predictive of a phenotype such as disease status in human populations. Some of these approaches have been recently reviewed.|$|E
25|$|Sign <b>epistasis</b> {{occurs when}} one {{mutation}} has {{the opposite effect}} when {{in the presence of}} another mutation. This occurs when a mutation that is deleterious on its own can enhance the effect of a particular beneficial mutation. For example, a large and complex brain is a waste of energy without a range of sense organs, however sense organs can be more useful if the organism's brain is better able to process the information.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{evidence}} for this hypothesis {{has not always been}} straightforward and the model proposed by Kondrashov has been criticized for assuming mutation parameters far from real world observations. In addition, in those tests which used artificial gene networks, negative <b>epistasis</b> is only found in more densely connected networks, whereas empirical evidence indicates that natural gene networks are sparsely connected, and theory shows that selection for robustness will favor more sparsely connected and minimally complex networks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epistasis</b> {{occurs when}} the {{expression}} of one gene is modified by another gene. For example, gene A only shows its effect when allele B1 (at another Locus) is present, but not if it is absent. This {{is one of the}} ways in which two or more genes may combine to produce a coordinated change in more than one characteristic (for instance, in mimicry). Unlike the supergene, epistatic genes do not need to be closely linked or even on the same chromosome.|$|E
25|$|The grove snail, Cepaea nemoralis, {{is famous}} for the rich {{polymorphism}} of its shell. The system is controlled {{by a series of}} multiple alleles. The shell colour series is brown (genetically the top dominant trait), dark pink, light pink, very pale pink, dark yellow and light yellow (the bottom or universal recessive trait). Bands may be present or absent; and if present from one to five in number. Unbanded is the top dominant trait, and the forms of banding are controlled by modifier genes (see <b>epistasis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Thomas Hunt Morgan {{began using}} fruit flies in {{experimental}} studies of heredity at Columbia University in 1910 in a laboratory known as the Fly Room. The Fly Room was cramped with eight desks, each occupied by students and their experiments. They started off experiments using milk bottles to rear the fruit flies and handheld lenses for observing their traits. The lenses were later replaced by microscopes, which enhanced their observations. Morgan and his students eventually elucidated many basic principles of heredity, including sex-linked inheritance, <b>epistasis,</b> multiple alleles, and gene mapping.|$|E
25|$|Diploid organisms contain {{two copies}} of each gene. If these are {{different}} (heterozygous / heteroallelic), the two different copies of the allele may {{interact with each other}} to cause <b>epistasis.</b> This is sometimes called allelic complementation, or interallelic complementation. It may be caused by several mechanisms, for example transvection, where an enhancer from one allele acts in trans to activate transcription from the promoter of the second allele. Alternately, trans-splicing of two non-functional RNA molecules may produce a single, functional RNA. Similarly, at the protein level, proteins that function as dimers may form a heterodimer composed of one protein from each alternate gene and may display different properties to the homodimer of one or both variants.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} K {{controls}} {{the degree of}} <b>epistasis</b> in the NK model, or how much other loci affect the fitness contribution of a given locus. With K = 0, the fitness of a given string is a simple sum of individual contributions of loci: for nontrivial fitness functions, a global optimum is present and easy to locate (the genome of all 0s if f(0) > f(1), or all 1s if f(1) > f(0)). For nonzero K, the fitness of a string is a sum of fitnesses of substrings, which may interact to frustrate the system (consider how to achieve optimal fitness in the example above). Increasing K thus increases the ruggedness of the fitness landscape.|$|E
25|$|This can be {{the case}} when {{multiple}} genes act in parallel {{to achieve the same}} effect. For example, when an organism is in need of phosphorus, multiple enzymes that break down different phosphorylated components from the environment may act additively {{to increase the amount of}} phosphorus available to the organism. However, there inevitably comes a point where phosphorus is no longer the limiting factor for growth and reproduction and so further improvements in phosphorus metabolism have smaller or no effect (negative <b>epistasis).</b> Some sets of mutations within genes have also been specifically found to be additive. It is now considered that strict additivity is the exception, rather than the rule, since most genes interact with hundreds or thousands of other genes.|$|E
25|$|Skin colour {{seems to}} vary mostly due to {{variations}} {{in a number}} of genes of large effect as well as several other genes of small effect (TYR, TYRP1, OCA2, SLC45A2, SLC24A5, MC1R, KITLG and SLC24A4). This {{does not take into account}} the effects of <b>epistasis,</b> which would probably increase the number of related genes. Variations in the SLC24A5 gene account for 20–25% of the variation between dark and light skinned populations of Africa, and appear to have arisen as recently as within the last 10,000 years. The Ala111Thr or rs1426654 polymorphism in the coding region of the SLC24A5 gene reaches fixation in Europe, and is also common among populations in North Africa, the Horn of Africa, West Asia, Central Asia and South Asia.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} to this case-control approach. [...] A common alternative to case-control GWA studies is {{the analysis of}} quantitative phenotypic data, e.g. height or biomarker concentrations or even gene expression. Likewise, alternative statistics designed for dominance or recessive penetrance patterns can be used. Calculations are typically done using bioinformatics software such as SNPTEST and PLINK, which also include support {{for many of these}} alternative statistics. Earlier GWAS focused on the effect of individual SNPs. However, the empirical evidence shows that complex interactions among two or more SNPs, <b>epistasis,</b> might contribute to complex diseases. Moreover, the researchers tries to integrate GWA data with other biological data such as protein protein interaction network [...] to extract more informative results.|$|E
2500|$|Negative <b>epistasis</b> and sex {{are thought}} to be intimately correlated. Experimentally, this idea has been tested in using digital {{simulations}} of asexual and sexual populations. Over time, sexual populations move towards more negative <b>epistasis,</b> or the lowering of fitness by two interacting alleles. It is thought that negative <b>epistasis</b> allows individuals carrying the interacting deleterious mutations to be removed from the populations efficiently. This removes those alleles from the population, resulting in an overall more fit population. This hypothesis was proposed by Alexey Kondrashov, and is sometimes known as the deterministic mutation hypothesis ...|$|E
2500|$|In a haploid {{organism}} with genotypes (at two loci) ab, Ab, aB or AB, we can [...] {{think of}} {{different forms of}} <b>epistasis</b> as affecting the magnitude of a phenotype upon mutation individually (Ab and aB) or in combination (AB).|$|E
2500|$|The term genetic {{enhancement}} {{is sometimes}} used when a double (deleterious) mutant {{has a more}} severe phenotype than the additive effects of the single mutants. Strong positive <b>epistasis</b> is sometimes referred to by creationists as irreducible complexity (although [...] most examples are misidentified).|$|E
2500|$|At {{its most}} extreme, {{reciprocal}} sign <b>epistasis</b> occurs when two deleterious genes are beneficial when together. For example, producing a toxin alone can kill a bacterium, [...] and producing a toxin exporter alone can waste energy, but producing both can improve fitness by killing competing organisms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} genes are now {{commonly}} quantifiable by assaying {{the magnitude of}} a phenotype (e.g. height, pigmentation or growth rate) or by biochemically assaying protein activity (e.g. binding or catalysis). Increasingly sophisticated computational and evolutionary biology models aim to describe the effects of <b>epistasis</b> on a genome-wide scale {{and the consequences of}} this for evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Reciprocal sign <b>epistasis</b> {{also leads}} to genetic {{suppression}} whereby two deleterious mutations are less harmful together than either one on its own, i.e. one compensates for the other. This term can also apply sign <b>epistasis</b> where the double mutant has a phenotype intermediate between {{those of the}} single mutants, {{in which case the}} more severe single mutant phenotype is suppressed by the other mutation or genetic condition. [...] For example, in a diploid organism, a hypomorphic (or partial loss-of-function) mutant phenotype can be suppressed by knocking out one copy of a gene that acts oppositely in the same pathway. [...] In this case, the second gene is described as a [...] "dominant suppressor" [...] of the hypomorphic mutant; [...] "dominant" [...] because the effect is seen when one wild-type copy of the suppressor gene is present (i.e. even in a heterozygote). [...] For most genes, the phenotype of the heterozygous suppressor mutation by itself would be wild type (because most genes are not haplo-insufficient), so that the double mutant (suppressed) phenotype is intermediate between those of the single mutants.|$|E
2500|$|Genetics is {{the study}} of the effect of genetic {{differences}} on organisms. Often this can be inferred by the absence of a normal component (e.g., one gene), in the study of [...] "mutants" [...] organisms with a changed gene that leads to the organism being different with respect to the so-called [...] "wild type" [...] or normal phenotype. Genetic interactions (<b>epistasis)</b> can often confound simple interpretations of such [...] "knock-out" [...] or [...] "knock-in" [...] studies.|$|E
