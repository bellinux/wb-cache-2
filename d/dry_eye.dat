25|$|Treatments include {{artificial}} tears, prescription {{tears and}} punctal occlusion. Punctal occlusion {{is accomplished by}} placing a collagen or silicone plug in the tear duct, which normally drains fluid from the eye. Some patients complain of ongoing <b>dry</b> <b>eye</b> symptoms despite such treatments and <b>dry</b> <b>eye</b> symptoms may be permanent.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>eyes</b> {{can usually}} be {{diagnosed}} by the symptoms alone. Tests can determine both the quantity {{and the quality of}} the tears. A slit lamp examination can be performed to diagnose <b>dry</b> <b>eyes</b> and to document any damage to the eye.|$|R
25|$|Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (<b>dry</b> <b>eye)</b> {{is common}} in dogs. Symptoms include eye redness, a yellow or greenish discharge, {{ulceration}} of the cornea, pigmented cornea, and blood vessels on the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Other subtle {{differences}} {{that have been}} reported include slightly longer limbs and larger hands and feet due to a proportionally greater stature than unaffected women, larger teeth, minimal or no acne, well developed breasts, and a greater incidence of meibomian gland dysfunction (i.e. <b>dry</b> <b>eye</b> syndromes and light sensitivity).|$|E
25|$|Corneal ulcers {{are one of}} {{the most}} common eye {{diseases}} in dogs. They are caused by trauma, detergent burns, and infections. Other eye conditions can cause corneal ulcers, such as entropion, distichiae, corneal dystrophy, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (<b>dry</b> <b>eye).</b> There have been at least two cases where corneal ulceration was caused by canine herpesvirus.|$|E

50|$|The {{lubricating}} property of methyl cellulose {{is of particular}} benefit {{in the treatment of}} <b>dry</b> <b>eyes</b> (Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca). <b>Dry</b> <b>eyes</b> are common in the elderly and is often associated with rheumatoid arthritis. The lacrimal gland and the accessory conjunctival glands produce fewer tears. Methyl cellulose may be used as a tear substitute.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{cyclosporine}} (Restasis) {{is available}} by prescription to help treat chronic <b>dry</b> <b>eye</b> by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. Prescription drugs {{are also available}} that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as cevimeline (Evoxac) and pilocarpine. Salagen, a manufactured form of pilocarpine, {{can be used to}} help produce tears, as well as saliva in the mouth and intestines. It is derived from the jaborandi plant.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of the ulcer depends somewhat on the cause. Central ulcers are typically caused by trauma, <b>dry</b> <b>eye,</b> or exposure from facial nerve paralysis or exophthalmos. Ulcers in the inferior nasal cornea {{may be caused by}} foreign material trapped under the third eyelid. Entropion or distichiae may cause ulceration of the peripheral cornea. Immune-mediated eye disease can cause ulcers at the border of the cornea and sclera.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin {{is known}} to cause meibomian gland {{dysfunction}} which causes persistent keratoconjunctivitis sicca (<b>dry</b> <b>eye).</b> It has also been found to cause salivary gland dysfunction in some people, causing xerostomia (dry mouth). Problems with the meibomian and salivary glands are likely due to the non-selective apoptosis of {{the cells of the}} exocrine glands. Decreased night vision has been reported to persist in some patients after discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>eyes</b> also occurs or {{gets worse}} after LASIK and other {{refractive}} surgeries, {{in which the}} corneal nerves are cut during {{the creation of a}} corneal flap. The corneal nerves stimulate tear secretion. <b>Dry</b> <b>eyes</b> caused by these procedures usually resolves after several months, but it can be permanent. Persons who are thinking about refractive surgery should consider this.|$|R

25|$|Prescriptions {{for contact}} lenses and glasses may be similar, {{but are not}} interchangeable. Prescribing of contact lenses is usually {{restricted}} to various combinations of ophthalmologists, optometrists and opticians. An eye examination {{is needed to determine}} an individual's suitability for contact lens wear. This typically includes a refraction to determine the proper power of the lens and an assessment of the health of the eye's anterior segment. Many eye diseases prohibits contact lens wear, such as active infections, allergies, and <b>dry</b> <b>eye.</b> Keratometry is especially important in the fitting of rigid lenses.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} factors that causes {{complications}} is that the contact lens is an oxygen barrier. The cornea needs a constant supply of oxygen to remain completely transparent and function as it should; it normally gets that oxygen from the surrounding air while awake, and from the {{blood vessels in the}} back of the eyelid while asleep. The most prominent risks associated with long-term, chronic low oxygen to the cornea include corneal neovascularization, increased epithelial permeability, bacterial adherence, microcysts, corneal edema, endothelial polymegethism, <b>dry</b> <b>eye</b> and potential increase in myopia. That is why much of the research into the latest soft and rigid contact lens materials has centered on improving oxygen transmission through the lens.|$|E
25|$|A {{scleral lens}} is a large, firm, oxygen {{permeable}} contact lens that {{rests on the}} sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses {{may be used to}} improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe <b>dry</b> <b>eye</b> syndrome (Kerotanconjuctivis sicca), microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, aniridia, neurotrophic keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.|$|E

50|$|In ophthalmology, {{clobetasone}} butyrate 0.1% eye drops {{have been shown}} to be safe and effective in the treatment of <b>dry</b> <b>eyes</b> in Sjögren's Syndrome. Sjögren's Syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the moisture producing glands of the body causing many symptoms including <b>dry</b> <b>eyes.</b> When compared to other corticosteroid eye drops; {{clobetasone butyrate}} showed only minimal rises in intraocular pressure. Increased pressure within the eye can lead to glaucoma.|$|R
25|$|Xerostomia may {{be caused}} by {{autoimmune}} damage to the salivary glands. Sjögren's syndrome is one such disease, and it causes other symptoms, including xerophthalmia (<b>dry</b> <b>eyes),</b> <b>dry</b> vagina, fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain). Females are more likely to suffer from autoimmune disease, and 90% of people with Sjögren's syndrome are women. Primary Sjögren's syndrome is the combination of <b>dry</b> <b>eyes</b> and xerostomia. Secondary Sjögren's syndrome is identical to primary form but {{with the addition of a}} combination of other connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.|$|R
25|$|The drug {{exhibits}} {{very poor}} solubility in water, and, as a consequence, suspension and emulsion {{forms of the}} drug {{have been developed for}} oral administration and for injection. Ciclosporin was originally brought to market by Sandoz, now Novartis, under the brand name Sandimmune, which is available as soft gelatin capsules, as an oral solution, and as a formulation for intravenous administration. These are all nonaqueous compositions. A newer microemulsion, orally-administered formulation, Neoral, is available as a solution and as soft gelatin capsules (10mg, 25mg, 50mg and 100mg). The Neoral compositions are designed to form microemulsions in contact with water. Generic ciclosporin preparations have been marketed under various trade names, including Cicloral (Sandoz/Hexal), Gengraf (Abbott) and Deximune (Dexcel Pharma). Since 2002, a topical emulsion of ciclosporin for treating inflammation caused by keratoconjunctivitis sicca (<b>dry</b> <b>eye</b> syndrome) has been marketed under the trade name Restasis (0.05%). Inhaled ciclosporin formulations are in clinical development, and include a solution in propylene glycol and liposome dispersions.|$|E
