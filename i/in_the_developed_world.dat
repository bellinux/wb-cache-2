5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution it was {{realized}} that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers.

Height and weight thus both increased through the 19thcentury <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world.</b> During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity. In the 1950s increasing wealth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites {{can affect the}} lungs, {{including}} Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through {{direct contact with the}} skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections are most common in the immunodeficient.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism.

5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world,</b> ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E

In the developing world overall, 35% of birth control is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via oral contraceptives, 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.|$|E

5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{following}} the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularisation, and for liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962. In 2012, the 50th anniversary of Vatican II, an assembly of the Synod of Bishops discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world.</b> Benedict resigned due to advanced age in 2013, the first pope to do so in nearly six hundred years.|$|E

Rates of endometrial cancer have risen in a number of countries between the 1980s and 2010. This is believed to be due to the increasing number of elderly people and increasing rates of obesity.|$|E
