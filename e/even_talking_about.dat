The two attended USC School of Cinematic Arts together, and worked together on various projects afterwards.

500|$|A papal {{election}} {{could bring}} {{a dramatic change}} of fortune for a cardinal-nephew, often bringing the former favorites into conflict with the new Pope. For example, Prospero Colonna and Francisco de Borja were excommunicated, and Carlo Carafa was executed. The papal conclave, May 1605, {{is one example of}} a conclave where a candidate (Antonmaria Sauli) was defeated because enough other cardinals were convinced of the need for [...] "a Pope willing to punish the cardinal-nephews for robbing the papacy". A cardinal-nephew was also a potential threat to any future pontiff; for example, Ludovisi came to lead the opposition against Pope Urban VIII (1623–1644), <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> calling a council against the Pope (which never occurred as Ludovisi died in 1632) because [...] "no one else had the standing to confront Urban's titanic temper".|$|E
2500|$|Nina Wadia has praised Womack and Wallace {{for their}} [...] "acting skills" [...] during the storyline. Wadia told The Sun: [...] "Sam and Jessie were amazing {{and it all}} got taken away from them because people made it out like a real baby had died. It's a soap. It's portraying fictional characters!" [...] Marc Elliott added: [...] "The storyline got whipped up into a massive frenzy. It's not {{representative}} in any way, shape or form of mothers {{who have lost their}} babies." [...] EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer has also praised the plot for its [...] "great acting". In an interview with Take It Easy, asked whether the show's bosses handled the storyline well, Palmer replied: [...] "I think they did. I know there's been loads of bad press, but something like that {{is always going to be}} sad to watch and it will upset people. But at the end of the day, it's a drama and it's not real. I think it got blown out of all proportion. Unfortunately, things like that do happen in real life. Babies get swapped and snatched in hospitals. I'm sure that any parent who has lost a child will find <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> their experience very difficult, let alone watching it being acted out on television. Even my daughter got upset but she is only 9 so maybe I shouldn't have let her watch it. I just didn't realise it was going to be so heart-wrenching, which was down to the great acting." ...|$|E
