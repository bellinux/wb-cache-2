5|$|Before {{its release}} on 10 June 2005, one preview {{wondered}} how the film would fare at the box office. Citing comparisons with the 1953 version, the preview suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film-making, the probable inability of debutant actress, Balan to portray Lalita's character appropriately, suitable 1960s depiction by contemporary actors and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> a successful adaptation.|$|E

5|$|Wollstonecraft wields the English philosopher John Locke's {{definition}} of property (that is, ownership acquired through labour) against Burke's notion of inherited wealth. She contends that inheritance {{is one of}} the major <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> the progress of European civilization, and repeatedly argues that Britain's problems are rooted in the inequity of property distribution. Although she did not advocate a totally equal distribution of wealth, she did desire one that was more equitable.|$|E

5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{emphasize the}} essential equality of human beings, and {{the abolition of}} prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> unity. The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.|$|E
5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E
5|$|In some areas, {{systematic}} {{attacks against}} tribespeople {{in or near}} mining districts occurred. Various conflicts were fought between natives and settlers.Miners often saw Native Americans as <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> their mining activities. Ed Allen, interpretive lead for Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, reported that {{there were times when}} miners would kill up to 50 or more Natives in one day. Retribution attacks on solitary miners could result in larger scale attacks against Native populations, at times tribes or villages not involved in the original act. During the 1852 Bridge Gulch Massacre, a group of settlers attacked a band of Wintu Indians in response to the killing of a citizen named J. R. Anderson. After his killing, the sheriff led a group of men to track down the Indians, whom the men then attacked. Only three children survived the massacre that was against a different band of Wintu than the one that had killed Anderson.|$|E

25|$|Social ills {{were not}} to be {{dismissed}} or ignored, Flower believed, but rather were matters to be addressed forthrightly, with a broad range of opinions solicited in the process of bringing about their rational solution.

25|$|James Baldwin's {{novels and}} plays fictionalize {{fundamental}} personal questions and dilemmas amid complex {{social and psychological}} pressures thwarting the equitable integration of not only blacks yet also of male homosexuals, depicting as well some internalized <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> such individuals' quest for acceptance, namely in his second novel, Giovanni's Room (1956), written well before the equality of homosexuals was widely espoused in America. Baldwin's best-known novel is his first, Go Tell It on the Mountain (1953).|$|E
25|$|The devotional {{practices}} of Sufis vary widely.

The consensus among Sufi scholars is that the seeker cannot self-diagnose, and that it can be extremely harmful to undertake any of these practices alone and without formal authorization.|$|E

Under the current 1983 Code of Canon Law, illegitimacy has no canonical implications or consequences. Defect of birth was an <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> the reception of orders, and inhibited the exercise of the functions of orders already received. The prohibition did not touch the validity of orders, but made the reception of them illicit.|$|R
25|$|India {{perceives}} {{certain aspects}} of European human rights agenda (social clauses) and some statutory labour requirements or precautionary measures in environmental safety as protectionist non-tariff trade barriers. Recurrent trade restrictions on Indian products decided by the European Commission (around 700 generic medicines were black-listed in 2015 which followed an earlier import ban on fruits and vegetables from India in 2014) and the European Parliament resolution in 2015 on alleged human rights violations by India are examples of recent actions which were unhelpful <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> the improvement of European Union-India relations.|$|E
25|$|The next model {{produced}} by TVR was the Grantura Mark 1, which used a fastback-style body over the existing chassis design (with the same trailing-arm independent suspension front and rear.) Engine options included the Ford 100E sidevalve (normally aspirated or supercharged), the Ford 105E OHV unit, two different Coventry Climax units, or the MGA's BMC B-series. The {{interior of the}} Grantura was cramped, with the short doors and 17"-diameter steering wheel proving <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> ingress. Climax-powered cars would be finished with a leather interior, while cars with the lower-specification engines were trimmed with vinyl.|$|E

He also assumed the parallel and convergent evolution of life on other worlds into types of higher multicellular lifeforms {{similar to those of}} Earth, and the ubiquity of intelligent life; thus his alien planets have both animal and plant life, with at least one species of animal life usually having achieved intelligence, and these alien intelligent species are in the main recognizably mammalian or reptilian.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} State of Israel, the law {{concerning}} matters of marriage, divorce, and personal status, is partially {{under the jurisdiction}} of religious courts. For example, there is no civil marriage in Israel. The Jewish religious regulations concerning mamzerim are thus also the national laws imposed on Jews living in Israel, including secular Jews. Because of the severe <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> marriage which mamzer status accords in Jewish law, Israeli civil law has taken the position that the paternity of a child born within a marriage cannot legally be challenged in civil courts, in order to avoid creating a body of evidence that might be used to declare the child a mamzer, or create difficulties for a future marriage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of {{biomedical}} research, notably in America, patents were taken out on particular genes, treatments and techniques. From 1991, the NIH permitted patents {{to be taken out}} on anonymous gene fragments. This created extra costs and <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> creating new treatments and tests. Although in principle rights holders could come together to make a deal, cognitive biases exist in rights owners that can often prevent deals that would likely be beneficial from occurring. For example, tests for certain breast cancer mutations were unavailable since the rights holder for the BRCA human gene did not release them onto the market, which lead to false negative tests for cancer. In the end the courts held that human genes were not patentable.|$|E
