500|$|Throughout December 2014, Banks {{released}} {{a series of}} videos in which she broke down tracks from Broke with Expensive Taste and revealed how each song came to be, dubbed the '16 Days of Azealia'. During the breakdown video for [...] "Chasing Time", Banks revealed that the song was conceived after the aforementioned occasion of her handing a completed version of the album in to her labels. In response to their request that Banks created something more current, she produced [...] "Chasing Time". This was further confirmed {{in an interview with}} Pitchfork Medias Jeremy Gordon, in which Banks said [...] "it got to a point where they were like, 'Azealia, we get it, you’re cool, but we've spent $2 million on this record, can you <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> one ?' So then I did 'Chasing Time', and I was just like, 'You know, this isn't gonna work out.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and drummer}} Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson issued {{an essay in}} 1999 that {{discussed}} the album's creation and analyzed its songs. He described the project as a [...] "vicarious fantasy", a [...] "new direction of soul for 2000", and [...] "the litmus test that will reveal the most for your personality". He addressed the inspiration behind Voodoo, saying [...] "It was a love for the dead state of black music, a love to show our idols how much they taught us [...] I hope you enjoy it. Just have an open mind to new shit. <b>Just</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> that." [...] Questlove discussed his expectations of a reaction from music listeners to the concept, saying in an interview for Entertainment Weekly upon the album's release, [...] "We knew this album would be a hard pill to swallow. People may want D to play into their R love-god fantasies—wearing Armani suits, singing something sweet in your ear—but he made {{a conscious effort to}} shake people up, to take a chance. It's not a middle-ground record—you're either going to love it or hate it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{basic concept}} of Pyst {{was to show}} what Myst Island (from the best-selling game) would look like after four million people (players) had visited and [...] "explored". [...] Pyst {{developer}} and comedian Peter Bergman wanted to give Myst players the ability to [...] "'experience the island {{in a whole new}} light". Palladium President Ed Bernstein wanted the game to be a [...] "transformative work that moved way beyond Myst", in order to avoid copyright issues with Myst publisher Broderbund on the grounds of being a parody work. However, a spokesman from Broderbund said the company was unfazed with the project, commenting [...] "We've seen imitators and they usually <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a good chuckle". Bergman discovered that the sense of comic timing he had become accustomed to in his live shows couldn't be replicated in the digital realm, and had to adapt accordingly. Firezine said that the game was illustratory of Bergman's ability to [...] "survey America's culture and obsessions like a maniacal monitor reflecting the absurdness of it all, while casting his iconoclastic eye to read the entrails of the present coarse [...] and our delirious future".|$|E
2500|$|The {{return of}} the troupe to Paris at the {{beginning}} of September, coincided with the publication in the NRF of Copeau's Un essai de rénovation Dramatique: le théâtre du Vieux-Colombier ("Essay on Dramatic Renewal: The Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier"), in which he set forth the principles of this project: first, the choice of place far from the despised Right Bank boulevard in a district closer to schools and the center of artistic life where the new theatre might attract an audience of students, intellectuals and artists with a subscription system that would assure reasonable prices; [...] second, a variety of productionsas many as three different productions a week, which would not only appeal to a wider public, but also would offer the actors the opportunity to play several different sorts of roles in quick succession, maintaining the suppleness of their interpretive skills; third, a repertoire both classic and modern would mark the offerings of the company: the classic plays of Jean Racine and Molièrenever put in modern dress [...] to keep them à la modeand the best plays of the previous thirty years. Too, Copeau wanted to entice into the theatre new playwrights, perhaps those who had despaired that the theatre would ever present works of quality. Fourth, he particularly held in disdain ham acting or cabotinage, so common in the commercial theatre. He proposed eventually a school for young actors {{in order to create a}} new cohort of actors whose taste and instincts would remain above compromise. Lastly, he proposed a simple stage freed from the overworked scenic machinery that had become commonplace: [...] "Pour l'œuvre nouvelle, qu'on nous laisse un plateau nu" [...] ("For our new undertaking, <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a bare platform"), he wrote (Registres I, p.32).|$|E

2500|$|An {{assertion}} (as {{opposed to}} a question, a doubt or a more expressive sense) is apophantic.

It's all the same revolt, in all the classes that have waited and taken advice. I think perhaps we want a more conscious life. We're tired of drudging and sleeping and dying. We're tired of seeing just a few people able to be individualists. We're tired of always deferring hope till the next generation. We're tired of hearing the politicians and priests and cautious reformers (and the husbands!) coax us, 'Be calm! Be patient! Wait!
