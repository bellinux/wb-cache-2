5|$|On the far right, Duke {{was pressed}} hard by columns of attacking Union soldiers. Seeing this, Col. Giltner sent his {{regiment}} to reinforce Duke. Before Giltner's reinforcements arrived, Duke {{and his men}} counterattacked the Union linerouting it and <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> withdrawal. Duke and Witcher then combined forces and charged the Union's extreme left flank, inflicting significant damage on a Union colored regiment.|$|E
5|$|As had Virginia Tech, Air Force {{began moving}} {{the ball on}} the ground. The Falcons were aided by two offsides {{penalties}} against the Hokies and drove into Tech territory. Once there, Weiss completed a 16-yard pass to Tom Coleman for a first down. Weiss picked up another first down by running the ball, pushing the Falcons inside the Tech red zone with 10:10 remaining. The Tech defense stiffened, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> fourth down at the two-yard line. Rather than kick a field goal, Fisher DeBerry elected to attempt the touchdown, and Mike Brown ran the needed twoyards. The score and following extra point gave Air Force a 177 lead with 6:00 remaining in the game.|$|E

50|$|In Gunbound, {{there are}} 11 force icons which {{could affect the}} {{projectile}} path or damage of a shot. These forces: are lightning (a circle with lightning symbol), tornado (<b>a</b> hurricane symbol), <b>force</b> (<b>a</b> sun symbol), thor (a thor symbol (that looks like a gun)), wind (a comet symbol), land (an ice pellet symbol), protection (a crescent moon symbol), ignorance (an eclipse symbol), dark <b>force</b> (<b>a</b> purple tornado symbol), joker <b>force</b> (<b>a</b> question mark symbol), and mirror <b>force</b> (<b>a</b> trapezoid mirror symbol).

5|$|Defensively, Virginia Tech dominated, intercepting {{the ball}} three times, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> fumble once, and earning one {{defensive}} touchdown. Two Louisville defenders {{had the best}} individual performances during the game, however. Brandon Johnson and Abe Brown had six tackles apiece, and Brown sacked Marcus Vick once for a loss of ten yards. The sack {{was one of three}} earned by the Louisville offense during the game. Virginia Tech's defense earned two sacks during the game, and the Hokies' leading tackler was Vince Hall, who recorded four and two assists on sacks of Louisville's Hunter Cantwell.|$|E
5|$|Eastern and red wolves {{are also}} {{products}} of {{varying degrees of}} wolf-coyote hybridization. The eastern wolf probably {{was a result of}} a wolf-coyote admixture, combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf populations. The red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf populations in the southeastern United States, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations to the extent that about 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E
5|$|Electoral {{legislation}} remained unchanged. Labor introduced {{bills for}} reform, {{but these were}} defeated {{in both houses of}} Parliament. The premier introduced electoral legislation that would have entrenched his government further than under the Playmander. As electoral legislation was part of the South Australian constitution, it required an absolute parliamentary majority (20 seats, under the current system) to be changed. The LCL relied on Stott in the house, so Labor could obstruct changes by keeping members away and <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> pair.|$|E

5|$|Greece and Turkey {{also joined}} the {{alliance}} in 1952, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> series of controversial negotiations, {{in which the}} United States and Britain were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure. While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Youngblood {{was part}} of a 9–1–1 Gators team that upset the Tennessee Volunteers in the Gator Bowl in coach Ray Graves's final game as coach at Florida.

Youngblood first gained national attention after an October 4, 1969, five-sack performance 21-6 win versus instate rival Florida State University. He set a school record for sacks (14) in 1969 and led the teams' defensive linemen with 66 tackles.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for what he}} hoped would be the final attack on The Gully, Vokes shifted the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade to occupy positions formerly belonging to the 1st Brigade. Vokes planned for an attack by The Carleton and York Regiment {{to be the last}} of the frontal assaults against The Gully. Should this attack fail, the 1st Brigade's Seaforth Highlanders and the Royal Canadian Regiment would move through Casa Berardi and outflank German defences, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> withdrawal from The Gully.|$|E
40|$|Mader first {{proved that}} high average degree <b>forces</b> <b>a</b> given graph as a minor. Often {{motivated}} by Hadwiger's Conjecture, much {{research has focused}} on the average degree required to <b>force</b> <b>a</b> complete graph as a minor. Subsequently, various authors have consider the average degree required to <b>force</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary graph $H$ as a minor. Here, we strengthen (under certain conditions) a recent result by Reed and Wood, giving better bounds on the average degree required to <b>force</b> <b>an</b> $H$-minor when $H$ is a sparse graph with many high degree vertices. This solves an open problem of Reed and Wood, and also generalises (to within a constant factor) known results when $H$ is an unbalanced complete bipartite graph...|$|R

5|$|In the 1890s, Rockefeller {{expanded}} into iron ore and ore transportation, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> collision with steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and their competition {{became a major}} subject of the newspapers and cartoonists. He went on a massive buying spree acquiring leases for crude oil production in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia, as the original Pennsylvania oil fields began to play out.

The daily management of the trust was turned over to John Dustin Archbold and Rockefeller bought a new estate, Pocantico Hills, north of New York City, turning more time to leisure activities including the new sports of bicycling and golf.|$|E

With two goals in the final, he equalled the amount of goals that he had scored in the entire Serie A season. Fiorentina responded in the 28th minute, when Josip Iličić chipped the defence and Juan Vargas volleyed {{the ball into the}} goal. In the last minute of the half, Alberto Aquilani put the ball into Napoli's goal, but it was disallowed for offside.|$|E

The Indians chose rookie Gene Bearden to start against Boston in the tie-breaker, despite only having one day of rest, as he had beaten the Red Sox twice that season, and the Red Sox chose Denny Galehouse, passing on Mel Parnell, who had beaten the Indians on three separate occasions that season.|$|E
5|$|The 1687 {{earthquake}} {{marked a}} turning point in the history of Lima as it coincided with a recession in trade, a reduction of silver production and economic competition by other cities such as Buenos Aires. To add to these problems, on October 28, 1746, a powerful earthquake severely damaged the city and destroyed Callao, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> massive rebuilding effort under Viceroy José Antonio Manso de Velasco.
