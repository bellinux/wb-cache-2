40|$|High density {{planting}} {{systems are}} {{a prerequisite to}} economise the use of land and labour costs of orchards. Dwarfing rootstocks controlling the vigour of the scion cultivars {{form the basis for}} such orchards (Wertheim and Webster, 2005). In the Netherlands, rootstock research is limited to and focussed on testing rootstocks selected abroad. For the Dutch pear growers the main selection criteria for new rootstocks are: 1) control of tree size; 2) production; 3) fruit size; 4) fruit quality; 5) production efficiency; 6) frost resistance. Additional criteria for Dutch <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> <b>nurseries</b> exporting trees to other countries are: 1) compatibility with scion cultivars; 2) suitability for growth in calcareous soils; 3) easy propagation. In all trials rootstock performance is compared to Quince MC, the most commonly used rootstocks for pears in the Netherlands. Recently, a number of Pyrus (Pyrus communis) and Quince (Cydonia oblonga) rootstocks have been tested with ‘Conference’ and ‘Doyenné du Comice’ as the scion cultivars. Generally, the production efficiency of the Pyrus rootstocks was much less than for Quince MC. Another disadvantage of the evaluated Pyrus rootstocks was their high sensitivity towards pear decline. Several rootstocks were rejected after examination of the graft union because of suspected compatibility problems. Of the tested Quince rootstocks C 132 shows promise because of its control of tree growth in combination with good fruit size and Eline® because of its reduction of fruit russeting in ‘Conference...|$|E
40|$|The {{fruit tree}} nursery {{accreditation}} scheme {{implemented by the}} Philippine Department of Agriculture (DA) has been promoted to enhance the supply of high quality fruit tree planting materials and {{reduce the number of}} dubious seedling market players. This paper examines the advantages of the fruit tree nursery accreditation scheme and draws implications for possible formulation of a scheme to accredit forest tree nurseries in the Philippines. Data were collected from interviews with accredited fruit tree nursery operators and the nursery accreditation officer-in-charge in Northern Mindanao. There has been {{an increase in the number}} of applicants for nursery accreditation each year since 2004, as a result of the advantages nursery operators observed from those who had already been accredited. A major advantage is that only accredited fruit tree nursery operators can join in the government procurement of seedlings through a bidding process which is always for substantial volumes. As a form of advertisement, accredited nurseries are posted on the government website thus creating a wide range of market opportunities which results in increased sales. Other advantages such as receiving free training in improving seedling production and occasionally receiving high quality propagation materials (scions and seedlings), subsidies for pesticides and fertilizers and free soil tests were enjoyed by accredited <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> <b>nurseries.</b> These opportunities encouraged other nursery operators to apply for accreditation. Accreditation by the DA places emphasis on maintaining high genetic quality of planting materials as well as the physical quality of the seedlings. Accrediting forestry nurseries is seen as a potential policy option that can expand the supply of high quality tree seedlings in the Philippines, as is the case with fruit tree seedlings...|$|E

Genetic engineering {{has the potential to}} revolutionise fruit tree breeding. The development of transgenic fruit cultivars is in progress. Over the past 20 years an international public sector research team has collaborated in the development of HoneySweet plum which is highly resistant to Plum pox virus (PPV) the most devastating disease of plums and other stone fruits. HoneySweet was deregulated in the USA in 2010. HoneySweet (aka C 5) has been evaluated for eleven years (2002 - 2012) in a regulated field trial in the Czech Republic for the resistance to PPV, Prune dwarf virus (PDV), and Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV), all of them being serious diseases of plum. Even under the high and permanent infection pressure produced through grafting, PPV has only been detected in HoneySweet trees in several leaves and fruits situated close to the point of inoculum grafting. The lack of infection spread in HoneySweet demonstrates its high level of PPV resistance. Co-infections of PPV with PDV and/or ACLSV had practically no influence on {{the quantity and quality of}} HoneySweet fruit which are large, sweet, and of a high eating quality.

40|$|Cameroon needs healthy {{citizens}} to archive emergence by 2035. Malnutrition and undernourishment {{is the highest}} burden in the World in recent times and a silent crisis facing most rural communities in forest areas of Cameroon. Its abstruseness makes extremely fragile political, social and economic planning to foster development in such areas. Therefore, it is time we bring appropriate understanding and new strategies on unpacking the complexities of food and nutritional security and define practical solutions to food insecurity. Working {{in the context of}} increasing deforestation, this thesis brings evidence on the situation of household food insecurity (FIS) access experience in forest areas which is not reported in current discussions at the national level. It further investigates the knowledge and awareness of households on the availability, accessibility, utilisation, vulnerability and consumption of nutrient rich food items using the example of fruits from trees. Thus, the aim of this research was to investigate strategies for addressing household FIS through increased domestic supply and consumption of fruits from trees in the context of deforestation in Cameroon. Data were collected through four rounds of structured interviews completed between August 2013 and October 2014. Analysis was done using simple citations and ordering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Likert scale, χ 2 -test of association and Cramer's V coefficient to test the strength of the association and means and ANOVA. The HFIAS approach used to determine household FIS. Only 1 % of the population were food secure and the moderately deforested zone showed the worst trends in food insecurity. Therefore, the effect of deforestation was nuanced. Diverse fruit trees were registered. Households said they required fruits only 2. 4 ± 1. 5 times per week. Recently, the intake of 400 g of fruit per person per day for good health was announced as a priority of international recognition. However, households were not aware of the importance and frequency of fruit consumption with less than 50 % of households eating fruits daily during the harvesting season. <b>Fruit</b> <b>tree</b> <b>nurseries</b> where scarce and seeds where obtained from local sources. Fruit tree diseases where rampant and up to 50 % harvest lost was registered for some fruits species. This study has shown that food availability does not necessarily mean adequate food intake. Three opinions about fruit trees and the prevalence of food insecurity in Cameroon has been raised in this thesis. First, there is ineffectiveness in the eradication of FIS because even in agricultural conducive environments, hunger and food insecurity are still prevalent at high rates. Therefore, effective and efficient targeting of food insecured groups need to be promoted in all clusters of the population. Secondly, the national nutrition program is neglecting sensitisation on food consumption patterns and therefore people are not making use of nutrient rich foods even when this maybe found around their environments - taking the case of fruits from trees. Thus, very few people ate fruits and at irregular frequencies of consumption. Thus, there is need to design special campaign programs to promote the consumption of fruits from trees. Thirdly, the word-of-mouth or neighbour-to-neighbour dissemination approach on fruit trees planting has not been efficient across communities. As such nurseries where scarce and people obtained fruit trees plants from natural regeneration or found them on the field when establishing the field. Therefore, in this research, it is postulated that no matter the nature of efforts and level of intervention, what is certain is that addressing FIS requires effective targeting of the vulnerable population and the implementation of novel and practical approaches on promoting access to and consumption of fruits in the right frequencies. This research further revealed that poor eating habits was a problem and lack of knowledge about the frequency and intake of nutrient rich food was serious. For instance, people were not aware on the recommended frequency of fruit consumption and people ate infested fruit while reserving the healthy ones for sale. This is the trap of the food insecurity problem in some regions – knowledge about foods and ways of food utilisation. This is neither a problem of availability nor accessibility, but rather a problem of lack of knowledge and lack of sensitisation. From FAO reports on the state of food insecurity in the world and other studies of food intake in most developing nation, poor food consumption is a global problem in most poor regions and even in rich areas affected by obesity. Thus, {{there is a need to}} establish a high level policy framework maybe in the form of a convention or an intergovernmental panel at the level of the United Nations and/or the African Union on ‘reducing malnutrition in all its forms (rates, drivers and consequences on human health and the environment) ’. This structure will promote setting priorities, strategies, monitoring on peoples eating habits, setting nutritional standards, and principles and indicators for observing under nutrition, over nutrition and associated problems within all population strata...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In <b>fruit</b> {{and shade}} <b>tree</b> <b>nurseries,</b> {{there is a}} need to count and measure caliper for trees {{frequently}} so as to have an accurate inventory sufficiently before harvest since disease, pests and climate can change the yield from year to year. In some <b>tree</b> <b>nurseries</b> it is common practice to count the entire stock three times a year and to caliper them once a year. Both tasks are very labor intensive, involving crews of workers counting trees by hand over several weeks. Experience indicates that calipering and counting millions of trees manually can be error prone. There is a strong need to automate these tasks in the <b>tree</b> <b>nursery</b> industry to decrease labor cost and to improve inventory management. We have developed a device to count trees and to measure caliper while the trees are in the field. The device is designed to be mounted on a carrier passing through rows of <b>trees</b> in a <b>nursery.</b> Tedious tasks are reduced to a simple drive through that could be done simultaneously with tasks such as spraying or mowing.

40|$|The {{longevity}} of a pear orchard incomparison with an apple orchard is much longer. A 10 -year-old apple orchard {{is considered an}} old orchard with prob-lems of insufficient fruit quality (fruit size and/or fruit color) and should be replaced. A high density pear orchard {{at the age of}} 10 years is still a young orchard that comes into optimal productivity for a period of at least 20 years. The higher the plant density, the more difficult it will be to keep the orchard in the productive phase. In this paper we discuss different planting systems for high density pear orchards and the problems of excessive vegetative shoot growth that often occur during an “off ” year after frost damage. Crucial in the management of high densi-ty pear plantings is the definition of good flower bud quality with a high potential for fruit set. PLANT MATERIAL For pear trees planted in high density planting systems the quality of the planting material should be high. It should be a 2 -year-old tree with six to eight laterals ob-tained by pruning back the 1 -year-old <b>trees</b> in the <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> <b>nursery.</b> There is an impor-tant difference in productivity between a 1 -year-old feathered tree and a 2 -year-old feathered tree during the first year after planting. When a 1 -year-old whip is plant-ed, the productivity will be delayed by a pe-riod of 2 years during which the frame of the tree has to be developed. For intensive high density pear plantings only 2 -year-old trees are recommended. All the laterals should not be kept at the start but should be reduced to the final number wanted in the planting system, e. g., two in the free spin-dle or four in the V-hedge system. Delaying this reduction in number of laterals to a later date, when the trees are 4 to 5 years old, is risky and can cause a problem of a silver leaf attack. Many times this silver leaf attack is a reaction to a physiological stress situation (heavy pruning cuts) and cannot be related to the fungal attack of Stereum purpureum...|$|R

The experiment was performed according to a predetermined methodology for the selection of varieties, well-defined dosage of the agents, development of young plants, concentration of the agents and the method of application. The trees were treated in a standard way within the nursery working. The photo documentation was taken continuously, the first documentation ten days after the last treatment in June, the second in mid-July and the last before the ploughing out in October. The experiment was evaluated according to predetermined criteria, especially by number of branches in the tree crowns. These data were adapted into chart evaluating the effectiveness of products and graphs were prepared for each variety and quality category of the yields. From these processed results, the products promoting branching without nipping off can be recommended for practical use on specific varieties. In this experiment, the most effective substance was 6 -benzyladenine acid contained in the product Globaryll. Still, as a result of its use, the trees formed branches of the second and third grade and the crowns were too dense. This effect could probably have been avoided by using a lower concentration or single application of the agent.
