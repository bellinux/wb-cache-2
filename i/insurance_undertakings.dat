40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} selected competencies of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), namely the power to resolve disputes between national supervisory authorities i n the framework of a binding mediation and to issue non-binding guidelines, and the impact which exercising those powers by the EIOPA has on the competences of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), a public authority responsible for {{the supervision of the}} Polish ﬁ nancial market. In the ﬁ rst part of the article the powers of the EIOPA to resolve disputes in a binding mediation process are described, and the limited possibilities that the EIOPA has to initiate this procedure are emphasized, since as a consequence of that the current mediation procedure encourages national supervisory authorities to resolve their disputes themselves. Next the principles of taking decisions by the EIOPA Board of Supervisors in the mediation process are described and attention is drawn to the discriminatory nature of those rules where the dispute relates to decisions of the group supervisor. The article also highlights potential consequences of decisions taken by the EIOPA within the binding mediation and their impact on administrative decisions taken by national supervisory authorities. The second part of the article provides an analysis of EIOPA’s powers to issue guidelines. The non-binding nature of the guidelines, which are described as soft law, has been reviewed. It is pointed that the European Union law provides for certain mechanisms which enable the EIOPA to enforce implementation of the guidelines by national competent authorities. As a next step, EIOPA guidelines on preparing for the implementation of Solvency II and the powers of the KNF to apply those guidelines have been reviewed. In addition to that, justiﬁ cation for vesting the KNF with the power to issue recommendations or guidelines addressed to <b>insurance</b> and reinsurance <b>undertakings,</b> in the context of analogous competences possessed by the EIOPA have been discussed. 191251525 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|R

40|$|The European Directive Solvency II has {{increased}} the request of stochastic Asset-Liability Management models for <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The Directive has established that <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> can develop their own “internal models” {{for the evaluation of}} values and risks in the contracts.

Main computational kernels arising in models employed in this framework are stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and high-dimensional integrals.

40|$|Since {{the dawn}} of the European Union, <b>insurance</b> and banking <b>undertakings</b> claimed to be subject to a special status vis-a-vis the {{application}} of EU competition law, due to the quasi social nature of the services they provide. Within the financial services industry, anti-trust concerns do arise in relation to mergers and acquisitions, possible abuses of dominant position and state aid; however Art. 101 TFEU and the regulation of forms of co-operation arguably represent the paramount and most intricate aspects of the application of the EU competition rules to the financial services sector. This {{is due to the fact}} that the insurance and banking industries historically have been characterised by intense forms of horizontal co-operation between undertakings deemed necessary for the correct functioning of the financial services industry. On a general level, any agreement establishing a homogeneous pricing structure vis- a-vis consumers represents a blatant violation of Art. 101 TFEU giving rise to serious anti-trust concerns. Nevertheless, as will be explored in this thesis, in the financial services sector the Commission has often allowed what the doctrine has correctly defined as "forms of horizontal agreements concerning a relevant cost element making up the final price vis-a-vis customers through its decisions relating I See Faull & Nikpay, "The EC Law of Competition " OUP 2007, p. 636. 2 to interbankfees in payment systems and through the enactment of a block exemption for the insurance industry. Art. 101 thus seems to manifest a common element for these two industries, presenting interesting and intricate teleological quandaries. This thesis endeavours to break the impasse down into questions to which an answer may be provided: Ought Art. 101 to apply to the financial services sector at all? If so, to what extent? Is there any justification for a block exemption in the insurance sector? Indeed, should the banking sector too benefit from a block exemption? This thesis endeavours to answer the above questions and thereby to contribute to the identification of an ideal regulatory framework for forms of horizontal co- operation in the financial services sector.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. The first part {{involves}} the new solvency directive for the insurance industry in the European Union, Solvency II, which will be implemented in 2012. The second part involves valuation strategies under the new directive. First, I investigate the concept of solvency and introduce the current solvency directive, the Solvency I directive. Then I investigate the Solvency II directive especially for life <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> within the European Union, which Norway have agreed to follow. I describe the technical specifications of the Solvency II directive, including its definitions and formulas, and discuss modifications which have to be implemented for Norwegian life <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The Solvency II directive requires that the undertakings valuate both the asset side, and liability side in a market consistent way. I therefore investigate a method of achieving a market consistent valuation of both sides. This method links the insurance cash flow to financial instruments. Then by finding the market values of the financial instruments, I can find the value of the insurance portfolio...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{regulation}} reasons, life <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> {{have long}} been struggling with interest rate variations. In the post-ﬁnancial-crisis era, most life insurance ﬁrms in Western countries are facing two major challenges, the one is the dropdown of interest rates {{and the other is}} the increase of longevity. Many supervisory authorities have warned life <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> in their countries that their current portfolios are not adaquate to generate enough returns for future payments to the insured, because most of their assets are made of ﬁxed-income products. The consequence of low interest rates and increasing longevity is that premiums are becoming more expensive and the company s technical provisions are becoming higher than before, which will reduce life <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> competitive conditions compared to other ﬁnancial institutions. The varying nature and crucial importance of interest rates make it unrealistic to assume them as constant in calculating prospective reserves, especially when it is taken into account the fact that most life insurance products last decades long or even life-long. This thesis explores the possibility of calculating prospective reserves when interest rates are assumed varying. Since stochastic interest rates are represented in bond markets, a unit-linked scheme will be utilized to connect the insurance market to the bond market. A more realistic assumption than varying interest rates is varying interest rates with jumps. L´evy processes are a good candidate for modelling stochastic interest rates with jumps, and hence will be applied in this thesis. However, the permission of jumps in the pricing model will destroy the market-completeness assumption, making it necessary to use a speciﬁc criterion for selecting a risk-neutral probability measure for discounting future cash ﬂows. In this thesis, an Esscher transform will be applied since it preserves the L´evy process. The result of the recursive formula for calculating prospective reserves with stochastic interest rates with jumps is an integro-partial diﬀerential equation which in general does not have an analytical solution...|$|E

40|$|The last {{decades have}} been characterised by {{financial}} liberalisation and internationalisation of financial markets. Still, {{the financial sector}} has remained more tightly regulated than most others. Due to financial institutions‟, and especially banks‟, crucial position within financial markets and their systemic nature, financial liberalisation has walked {{hand in hand with}} stricter industry regulation. In the EU a certain overall level of harmonisation is sought in all Member States, also within the financial sector, extending to Norway through its EEA Membership and the EEA Agreement. An important part of this harmonisation, although often set aside in favour of the more pressing questions of capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, is the regulation of the taking-up of businesses and pursuit of holdings within the financial sector. Through a long line of Internal Market directives the European Commission has attempted to provide harmonised prudential assessment regulation and authorisation practices for the taking up and pursuit of businesses within the sector. This article discusses Norwegian private ownership regulation in regards to the taking up and pursuit of the businesses of credit institutions and (life) <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> and its legitimacy under EEA law. In chapters 2 and 3 we review the legal method of interpretation and the relevant regulatory scenery.

40|$|Abstract. We address {{computational}} problems {{deriving from}} Solvency II compliance {{in the context}} of Italian life insurance. Solvency II re-quires <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> to perform market consistent valuation of technical provisions and continuous monitoring of risks. We examine the case of profit sharing policies with minimum guarantees, which is the most diffused type of life policy in Italy. Market consistent valuation of the complex cash flows generated by these contracts entails modelling of management actions and the use of numerical techniques in a stochastic framework, typically Monte Carlo simulation on a fine grained time grid. Fulfillment of the subsequent highly-demanding computational tasks is possible only by implementing valuation procedures in parallel and dis-tributed architectures. In this work we introduce DISAR, a Solvency II compliant system designed to work on a grid of conventional computers, and discuss its performances. ...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{insurance}} sector {{has grown in}} importance. While there is a plethora of academic literature on the needs for a banking regulation, literature on insurance regulation is scarce and mainly focused on asymmetry issues. In this paper, we describe the reasons for an insurance regulation. Recent developments faced by insurers modified the risks encountered by the sector, especially liquidity risk and systemic risk. The purpose of the discussion presented here is also to outline the specificities of the new framework for the regulation of European <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings,</b> Solvency II, as it is currently discussed to provide an appropriate response to the changing needs {{of insurance}} regulation. Our analysis leads us to conclude that Solvency II answers well to the developing insurance sector. However, caution is warranted for some areas such as evaluation of embedded options and guarantees, risk transfer and financial conglomerates. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{equalisation}} {{has been}} implemented {{in a number}} of countries as a means of providing explicit risk-adjusted transfers between health <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> to improve efficiency within the health insurance market, and make health insurance affordable. Two such countries are Australia and Ireland. In this article, a simulation exercise is carried out to compare the effectiveness of the two countries risk equalisation schemes in meeting the policy objectives of encouraging insurers to be efficient and discouraging them from engaging in risk selection. The results of the analysis show that the Australian scheme is less effective than the Irish scheme in reducing the incentive for risk selection and in encouraging insurers to be efficient. The results provide evidence that direct standardisation mechanisms (as used in Ireland) can lead to superior outcomes as compared to indirect standardisation mechanisms (as used in Australia) in terms of promoting efficiency and deterring risk selection...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{development}} of the new prudential system for the supervision of <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings,</b> the so-called Solvency II project, a common approach, to the calculation of minimum capital requirements, is to apply predetermined factors to measures exposure to risk, that are taken from the insurer s annual accounts. Pillar Two recognizes the importance of a company specific approach based on Internal Risk Models fitted closely with the supervisor s view of key performance criteria. A risk theoretical simulation model is then applied for a Property&Casualty multi-line insurer with the aim to predict the risk capital regarding only premium risk, related to future claims arising during and after the time horizon for the solvency assessment. Different elliptical and Archimedean copula functions are applied separately in order to analyse the risk-profile of a non-life insurer with correlated lines of business. At this regard Internal Model results have been compared with the common shock correlation proposed by International Actuarial Association...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the current}} {{regulatory}} regime for <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings,</b> Solvency I, the required capital margin {{does not depend}} on the allocation of investments, i. e. it is not sensitive to market risk arising from the volatility of market prices for e. g. equity, bond or real estate investments. To improve the protection of policyholders and create a unified regulatory regime in all countries of the European Economic Area (EEA), a risk-sensitive, forward-looking and principle-based regulatory accord for <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> called Solvency II will replace the current regime by 01. 01. 2016. Unlike Solvency I, Solvency II requires the backing up of any investment in risky assets with risk capital rather than imposing investment limits. Own funds eligible to cover the solvency capital requirements under Solvency II shall be based on the difference of market-consistently valuated assets and liabilities in the Solvency II balance sheet. In this thesis, I first summarize academic contributions as well as opinions from industry representatives on the expected consequences of the current calibration of the Solvency II standard formula. The accuracy of the calibration itself is another focal point of this work. This work contains four scientific papers. The first paper examines the presence of contagion effects between Eurozone countries in the period 2008 - 2012. In a market-consistent valuation approach like Solvency II contagion effects intensify the volatility of own funds and therefore of the solvency ratio of insurers. The intensity of contagion peaked in 2010 and first half of 2011 but decreased subsequently which {{is likely to be a}} consequence of bailout measures by the EU and the IMF and ECB interventions. The second and third paper address the zero risk charge for sovereign debt issued by EU member states assumed under the Solvency II standard formula. If one accepts German bond yields to be a risk-free asset, using modern cointegration techniques I showed that bonds of only one third of EU member countries can be perceived as risk-free as well. The fourth paper provides evidence for convergence in the shock-response-behavior of the stock indices of Germany, UK and France during the past decades, which in turn indicates support for the assumption of a perfect tail correlation between listed equity in the Solvency II standard formula...|$|E
