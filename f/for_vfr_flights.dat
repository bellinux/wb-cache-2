50|$|The use of {{a pattern}} at airfields is for air safety. By using a {{consistent}} flight pattern pilots will know from where to expect other air traffic, {{and be able to}} see it and avoid it. Pilots flying under visual flight rules (VFR) may not be separated by air traffic control, so this consistent predictable pattern is a vital way to keep things orderly. At tower-controlled airports air traffic control (ATC) may provide traffic advisories <b>for</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> on a work-load permitting basis.|$|E
50|$|Unlike in the United States, even <b>for</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flights,</b> {{pilots are}} {{required}} to file a flight plan or have a flight itinerary with a responsible person for any flight greater than 25 nm from the departure aerodrome. Also, in Canada, flight plans are opened automatically at the estimated time of departure (ETD). Flight information centres play a prominent role managing flight plans, collecting position reports from pilots en route, and initiating commsearch procedures to locate pilots who have not closed flight plans.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} the use of SVFR is when a flight wishes to leave an airport in a control zone, to fly VFR in {{uncontrolled}} airspace, when the visibility is below the minimum <b>for</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> in the control zone but not below the lower minimum <b>for</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> in uncontrolled airspace.

5000|$|Flight {{plans are}} {{documents}} filed by a pilot or flight dispatcher {{with the local}} Civil Aviation Authority (e.g. FAA in the USA) prior to departure which indicate the plane's planned route or flight path. Flight plan format is specified in the ICAO Doc 4444. They generally include basic information such as departure and arrival points, estimated time en route, alternate airports in case of bad weather, type of flight (whether instrument flight rules IFR or visual flight rules VFR), the pilot's information, number of people on board and information about the aircraft itself. In most countries, flight plans are required for flights under IFR, but may be optional for flying VFR unless crossing international borders. Flight plans are highly recommended, especially when flying over inhospitable areas, such as water, as they provide a way of alerting rescuers if the flight is overdue. In the United States and Canada, when an aircraft is crossing the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), either an IFR or a special type of VFR flight plan called a DVFR (Defense VFR) flight plan must be filed.For IFR flights, flight plans are used by air traffic control to initiate tracking and routing services. <b>For</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flights,</b> their only purpose is to provide needed information should search and rescue operations be required, or for use by air traffic control when flying in a [...] "Special Flight Rules Area".|$|E
5000|$|To put {{instrument}} flight rules into context, {{a brief overview}} of visual flight rules (VFR) is necessary. It is possible and fairly straightforward, in relatively clear weather conditions, to fly a plane solely by reference to outside visual cues, such as the horizon to maintain orientation, nearby buildings and terrain features for navigation, and other aircraft to maintain separation. This is known as operating the aircraft under VFR, and is the most common mode of operation for small aircraft. However, it is safe to fly VFR only when these outside references can be clearly seen from a sufficient distance; when flying through or above clouds, or in fog, rain, dust or similar low-level weather conditions, these references can be obscured. Thus, cloud ceiling and flight visibility are the most important variables for safe operations during all phases of flight. [...] The minimum weather conditions for ceiling and visibility <b>for</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are defined in FAR Part 91.155, and vary {{depending on the type of}} airspace in which the aircraft is operating, and on whether the flight is conducted during daytime or nighttime. However, typical daytime VFR minimums for most airspace is 3 statute miles of flight visibility and a distance from clouds of 500' below, 1,000' above, and 2,000' feet horizontally. [...] Flight conditions reported as equal to or greater than these VFR minimums are referred to as visual meteorological conditions (VMC).|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{publication}} {{is to increase the}} awareness of pilots in the use of GNSS. The Winter Training Brochure is oriented towards a brief and clear explanation of the basic principles and requirements for the correct and safe use of GNSS devices during the flight, with regard to the target group, pilots and instructors, different age, experience and skill categories. The Winter Training Brochure is divided into three main parts, Part 1 addresses the basic theoretical bases and GNSS principles common for VFR and IFR flights, Part 2 deals with the principles of GNSS use <b>for</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flights,</b> Part 3 deals with the principles of GNSS use for IFR flights...|$|E

50|$|VFR {{require a}} pilot {{to be able}} to see outside the cockpit, to control the aircraft's altitude, navigate, and avoid {{obstacles}} and other aircraft. Governing agencies establish specific requirements <b>for</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flight,</b> including minimum visibility, and distance from clouds, to ensure that aircraft operating under VFR are visible from enough distance to ensure safety.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} determined that due to {{the high rate of}} descent of the DC-9, its pilots were not able to see the other plane in time to avoid a collision.

5000|$|Meteorological {{conditions}} {{that meet the}} minimum requirements <b>for</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> are termed visual meteorological conditions (VMC). If they are not met, the conditions are considered instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), and a flight may only operate under IFR. IFR operations have specific training requirements and certification required of the pilot, and increased equipment requirements for the aircraft. Additionally, an IFR flight plan must usually be filed in advance.|$|R
50|$|All {{aircraft}} entering class B airspace must obtain ATC clearance {{prior to}} entry {{and must be}} prepared for denial of clearance. Aircraft must be equipped with a two-way radio for communications with ATC and an operating Mode C transponder, furthermore aircraft overflying the upper limit of any class B airspace must have an operating Mode C transponder. Visual <b>flight</b> rules (<b>VFR)</b> <b>flights</b> may proceed under their own navigation after obtaining clearance but must obey any explicit instructions given by ATC. Some class B airspaces include special transition routes <b>for</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> that require communication with ATC but may not require an explicit clearance. Other class B airspaces include VFR corridors through which <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> may pass without clearance (and without technically entering the class B airspace).|$|R

50|$|In the United States, {{instruments}} {{required for}} IFR flight {{in addition to}} those that are required <b>for</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> are: heading indicator, sensitive altimeter adjustable for barometric pressure, clock with a sweep-second pointer or digital equivalent, attitude indicator, radios and suitable avionics for the route to be flown, alternator or generator, gyroscopic rate-of-turn indicator that is either a turn coordinator or the turn and bank indicator. From 1999 single-engine helicopters could not be FAA-certified for IFR, and Helicopter Association International estimates that 326 lives were lost in 133 accidents that would likely not have happened if those helicopters had been flying in IFR.|$|R

In most {{areas of the}} United States, class E airspace extends from 1200 ft AGL up to but not including 18000 ft MSL, the lower limit of class A airspace. There are areas where class E airspace begins at either the surface or 700 AGL, these areas are used to transition between the terminal and en-route environments (around non-towered airports). These areas are designated on sectional charts. Most airspace in the United States is class E. The airspace above FL600 is also class E. No ATC clearance or radio communication is required <b>for</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> in class E airspace. VFR visibility and cloud clearance requirements {{are the same as}} for class C and D airspaces when below 10000 ft MSL. Above 10,000 ft MSL, the visibility requirement is extended to 5 mi and the cloud clearance requirement is extended to 1000 ft below clouds, 1000 ft above, and 1 mi laterally.|$|R
40|$|<b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> into IMC {{conditions}} {{accounts for}} over 10 % of general aviation fatalities each year. Recent {{research suggests that}} pilots may not properly assess weather conditions.

In the current investigation twenty-four GA pilots made visibility and ceiling estimates of simulated weather conditions either with or without a GWIS display. Pilots generally overestimated weather conditions and their judgments were influenced by the GWIS. The results revealed an interaction between ceiling and visibility that suggests a new model <b>for</b> understanding <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> into IMC. The current results suggest an important area for future research into understanding pilots decisions to continue into deteriorating weather conditions. Results are discussed in terms of advancing aviation decision making models <b>for</b> understanding <b>VFR</b> into IMC <b>flight,</b> and the design of GWIS symbology to foster accurate assessments...|$|R

5000|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{applicant}} again successfully satisfied the examiner {{that they were}} adequately prepared to continue, they will enter the aircraft. The examiner will usually give the applicant a list or oral briefing on what they want the applicant to do during the flight. For example, [...] "I want you to prepare <b>for</b> a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> to Podunck County Airport {{at an altitude of}} 3,500 feet, and explain to me what steps you're taking along the way." [...] The examiner will then begin to assess the applicant as they proceed. At some point, however, the examiner may suddenly throw in distractors such as loss of radio communications, loss of instruments, flight into non-visual weather condition, or other emergency situations that the applicant must then respond to, all the while continuing the safe operation of the flight. After the emergency maneuvers are completed, the examiner will then have the applicant make several different landing approaches as well as different take off modes.|$|R
