40|$|The Vienna Abstract Machine (VAM) is a Prolog machine {{developed}} at the TU Wien. In contrast to the standard implementation technique (Warren Abstract Machine – WAM), an inference in VAM is performed by unifying the goal and head immediately, instead of bypassing arguments through a register interface. We present two implementations for VAM: VAM 2 P and VAM 1 P. VAM 2 P is well suited for an intermediate code emulator (e. g. direct threaded code) which uses two instruction pointers for both goal <b>code</b> and <b>head</b> <b>code.</b> During an inference VAM 2 P fetches one instruction from the goal code, and one instruction from the <b>head</b> <b>code</b> and executes the combined instruction. More optimization is therefore possible, since information about the calling goal {{and the head of}} the clause is available at the same time. VAM performs cheap shallow backtracking, needs less dereferencing and trailing and implements a faster cut. In a Prolog with the occur-check, VAM omits many unnecessary operations. VAM 1 P is designed for native code compilation. It combines instructions at compile time and supports several optimizations, such as fast last-call optimization. In this paper we present the VAM in detail and compare it with existing machines. ...|$|R

This framework works in three aspects. First, it performs verification whenever a packet is received. Next, whenever a node joins in a cluster then the framework uses cluster <b>head</b> <b>code</b> (CHC) {{in order to determine}} the presence of jammer (whether the node wishes to join in a cluster that is legitimate node or jammer node). Finally, the framework monitors the behavior of both the existing node and the newly joined node periodically to determine the presence of jamming.|$|R

40|$|Bats {{are highly}} agile animals {{by virtue of}} their flight and {{echolocation}} behaviors, and they are acknowledged to be “spatiotemporal integration specialists. ” In order to avoid obstacles, scavenge food, and capture prey, bats must be able to navigate a three-dimensional space. In flight, bats must perform high speed navigation through obstacles using a blend of sensory modalities including vision and echolocation. While some bat species exhibit structural adaptations to their cochleae as an adaptation to the demands of echolocation, there is an absence architectural adaptation of the vestibular labyrinth that would accommodate the increased demands for high frequency <b>head</b> movement <b>coding</b> associated with agile movement. The present study tested the hypothesis that there may exist cellular adaptations within the vestibular epithelia consistent with increased capability for high fidelity <b>head</b> movement <b>coding.</b> This was accomplished using immunohistochemical analyses focusing primarily in the striolae of the utricles of Rousettus aegyptiacus and Mus musculus, regions bounded by the presence of calretinin (Calb 2) positive calyces. Hair cell counts revealed increased proportions of type I hair cells (hair cells surrounded by calyces) in Rousettus when compared to Mus (72. 6 % ï¿½ 3. 5 % and 57. 2 % ï¿½ 2. 7 %, respectively, p< 10 - 5). Additionally, Rousettus exhibits increases in the proportion of complex calyces in the striola when compared to Mus. Ocm, a calcium binding protein expressed in vestibular hair cells, is also observed to have expanded expression in Rousettus and Mus both in the striola as well as the extrastriolar regions. These novel findings indicate that vestibular epithelia of Rousettus exhibit cellular adaptations over Mus that are consistent with increases in <b>head</b> movement <b>coding</b> capability associated with agile movement in flight...|$|R
30|$|Jamming {{attack is}} a serious {{security}} threat in wireless sensor networks. Therefore, {{it is important to}} frame a mechanism to protect wireless sensor networks from various jamming attacks. Jammer intrusion detection and jamming detection are two separate issues. In this paper, a novel jammer detection framework to detect the intrusion of jammer and the presence of jamming in a cluster-based wireless sensor network is proposed. The proposed framework is novel in three aspects: whenever the cluster head receives a packet, it first verifies whether the source node is a legitimate, new node, or a jammer node. Second, when the source node is declared as a new one in the first step, then the framework validates whether the new node is legitimate node in the previous cluster or a jammer node by using cluster <b>head</b> <b>code.</b> Third, the framework observes the behavior of the newly joined node and the existing nodes to identify whether the nodes in the cluster is jammed or not. Additionally, it also classifies the types of jamming, if the presence of jamming is detected. Simulation result shows that the proposed framework performs extremely well and achieves jamming detection rate as high as 99.88 %.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In the 20 th century, Russian {{biomedical}} science {{experienced a}} decline from the blossom {{of the early}} years to a drastic state. Through {{the first decades of}} the USSR, it was transformed to suit the ideological requirements of a totalitarian state and biased directives of communist leaders. Later, depressing economic conditions and isolation from the international research community further impeded its development. Contemporary Russia has inherited a system of medical education quite different from the west as well as counterproductive regulations for the allocation of research funding. The methodology of medical and epidemiological research in Russia is largely outdated. Epidemiology continues to focus on infectious disease and results of the best studies tend to be published in international periodicals. MEDLINE continues to be the best database to search for Russian biomedical publications, despite only a small proportion being indexed. The database of the Moscow Central Medical Library is the largest national database of medical periodicals, but does not provide abstracts and full subject <b>heading</b> <b>codes,</b> and it does not cover even the entire collection of the Library. New databases and catalogs (e. g. Panteleimon) that have appeared recently are incomplete and do not enable effective searching. </p...|$|R

30|$|To {{understand}} jammer intrusion detection, it {{is assumed}} that a legitimate member moves from one cluster to another cluster. At this juncture, the jammer impersonates as a legitimate member and enters into a new cluster posing to be as legitimate member. For example, when a member M 1 moves from cluster C 1 to cluster C 2, then according to existing reassociation procedure, C 2 has to validate with C 1, whether M 1 is a legitimate member in C 1 or not. If C 2 receives a reply from C 1 stating that M 1 is a legitimate node in C 1, then C 2 ascertains that M 1 is a legitimate member. At this point of time, the jammer node poses to be M 1 enters into the cluster C 3. In order to check the legitimateness of M 1, C 3 queries C 1 and obviously receives a reply that M 1 is a legitimate node in C 1. By posing to be a moving legitimate node, jammer node cleverly enters into C 3. This problem has to be addressed. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, the idea of cluster <b>head</b> <b>code</b> (CHC) is deployed and it is described in Section 3.1. 1. The jammer node is also referred as rouge node within the WSN. The reason to consider the rouge/jammer node in the WSN is given as follows: when a member M 1 moves from cluster C 1 to cluster C 2, the jammer node posing to be M 1 enters into the cluster C 3. After entering into C 3, the jammer node can jam the members of C 3 that are within the communication range of the jammer node.|$|R

40|$|Humans show a {{remarkable}} ability to discriminate others' gaze direction, {{even though a}} given direction can be conveyed by many physically dissimilar configurations of different eye positions and head views. For example, eye contact can be signaled by a rightward glance in a left-turned head or by direct gaze in a front-facing head. Such acute gaze discrimination implies considerable perceptual invariance. Previous human research found that superior temporal sulcus (STS) responds preferentially to gaze shifts [1], but the underlying representation that supports such general responsiveness remains poorly understood. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of human {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data, we tested whether STS contains a higher-order, <b>head</b> view-invariant <b>code</b> for gaze direction. The results revealed a finely graded gaze direction code in right anterior STS that was invariant to head view and physical image features. Further analyses revealed similar gaze effects in left anterior STS and precuneus. Our results suggest that anterior STS codes the direction of another's attention regardless of how this information is conveyed and demonstrate how high-level face areas carry out fine-grained, perceptually relevant discrimination through invariance to other face features...|$|R
