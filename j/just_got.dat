5|$|This {{problem is}} not {{exclusive}} to electric vehicles. In 2007 research at the Technical University Munich showed that ordinary vehicles in background noise are often detected too late for safe accident avoidance. The researchers measured the distances of 35 approaching vehicles to a pedestrian in the moment when they <b>just</b> <b>got</b> audible in a stationary background noise. These distances were then compared to the stopping distances of the respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory masking.|$|E
5|$|England {{adopted an}} {{aggressive}} {{strategy in the}} second Test, but could not avoid a second defeat. Yardley frequently changed his bowlers to unsettle the Australians in their first innings, and took two for 35 himself as England briefly held the advantage. However, the lower order batsmen mounted a recovery, Yardley being criticised for his reluctance to bowl Doug Wright. The England captain then arrested a batting collapse by adding 87 with Denis Compton, scoring 44 himself, but Australia led by 135 on first innings. Yardley took two wickets in two balls in Australia's second innings, narrowly missing a hat-trick when Keith Miller only <b>just</b> <b>got</b> his bat down on the ball to avoid being bowled, and had figures of two for 36, but Australia scored 460 for seven and bowled England out for 186. In between Tests, Yardley scored his only century of the season, but his contributions to the third Test were minimal. He scored 22 and bowled four wicketless overs. However, the home side fought back in the match, for which Len Hutton was dropped. England scored 363 and bowled out Australia for 221. They scored 174 for three before declaring, but rain intervened to prevent Yardley pushing for a win.|$|E
25|$|Santa Maria {{is one of}} the {{municipalities}} in Bulacan with a high {{population growth}} rate due to in migration. Its rapid population growth contributes largely to the establishment of more commercial and trading activities as some people see this as an opportunity for business. In 2004, the registered business totalled to 4,042 with employment size of 6,168 individuals. The number <b>just</b> <b>got</b> better in 2005 as the registered businesses rose to 5,754 and the employment size to 18,968 individuals.

25|$|In the end Leinster {{topped the}} table, having led {{for most of}} the season. Glasgow had a late surge to finish 2nd {{overtaking}} Munster and Ulster in the process. All four teams showed they were worthy contenders in the next round with Leinster needing to score a late try to beat Ulster 13–9 in Dublin while Glasgow <b>just</b> <b>got</b> past Munster in Scotstoun by one point to win 16–15. The final in the R.D.S. was also a close game {{for most of the}} match with Leinster forced to defend for long periods. However they eventually pulled clear, adding two late scores which made the final result look somewhat lopsided at 34–12.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, Karam's 15th studio album, Kibir'el Hob (Love <b>Just</b> <b>Got</b> Greater) was officially released. The album gained {{widespread}} attention through its rigorous advertising campaign, {{which included the}} billboard posters, many television appearances , and music video clips for singles. Kibir'el Hob topped the highest selling album chart in Lebanon for Rotana during the Christmas sales period, and remained in the number one position through the New Year. In mid April 2006, Karam released a third and last single from the Kibir'el Hob album, accompanied by a video clip, and proved {{to be among the}} most popular Arabic songs of the year 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{sense of}} {{something}} being missing on Aliens was greater {{for me than}} on The Abyss, where the film <b>just</b> <b>got</b> consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.|$|E

25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire <b>just</b> <b>got</b> bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E
25|$|These were {{followed}} in later years, by other extensive factories filled with valuable machinery. Adjoining the saw mill mentioned, {{was a large}} woolen factory, which had <b>just</b> <b>got</b> into active operation when it was swept away by a most destructive fire in 1863, which also consumed the sawmill and its contents, and also a large planing mill and sash and door factory just erected by Mr. Henry Lye in close proximity. This great loss for a time checked {{the progress of the}} village, and paralyzed the enterprise of several active and industrious citizens. Another large factory erected for a cotton mill, a wool carding and knitting factory, and a bit larger saw mill than the former one, had in the meantime been erected {{on the south side of}} the river, just below the bridge, and these important structures with their valuable machinery, continue in active operation, and not only reflect much credit upon the enterprise of the place, but contribute much towards its prosperity.|$|E
25|$|Chan started 2014 by {{claiming}} three individual gold medals {{and a silver}} at the 2014 Southeast Asian Age Group Swimming Championships in Singapore. Swimming in the 14–16 aged group, Chan won the 100 metre freestyle in 56.87 and the 50 metre butterfly in 27.91, both new championship record and personal best times. She also took out the 50 metre freestyle in 26.31 narrowly missing the championship record of 26.28 set by Thailand's Jenjira Srisaard in 2012. Chan won her silver medal in the 200 metre freestyle. Finishing 2.12 seconds behind Vietnam's Nguyễn Thị Ánh Viên, Chan stopped the clock at 2:04.44 inside the old championship record of 2:04.65 set by Benjaporn Sriphanomthorn of Thailand in 2011. Chan was also part of a Thailand clean sweep, taking out all three female relays in new championship record times. In the 4 × 100 metre freestyle Chan, Rachel Tseng, Christie Chue and Hannah Quek recorded a time of 3:54.66. This also broke national under 17's record by one hundredth of a second. In the 4 × 200 metre freestyle, Chan, Tseng, Chue and Jing Wen Quah smashed the meet record by over 9 seconds, lowering it to 8:30.84 and in the final event of the meet Chan with Tseng, Chue and Tan Jing-E <b>just</b> <b>got</b> home over Thailand in the 4 × 100 metre medley relay, posting a time of 4:20.25. This time also shaved 0.12 seconds off the under 17's record.|$|E

500|$|Back in Scranton, Jim and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} named the {{reluctant}} heads of the Party Planning Committee by Michael due to previous fights between Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Angela (Angela Kinsey). Jim and Dwight prove terrible at the job, especially when an upset Kelly (Mindy Kaling) chastises them for forgetting her birthday. They {{try to make it}} up to her by throwing a party but they do a poor job, choosing horrible decorations and forgetting Kelly's age. Dwight reads her file and learns Kelly spent time in juvenile hall, but is disappointed to learn it does not affect her job performance. Meanwhile, Andy (Ed Helms) finds himself attracted to Julia, a female potential client who is talking with Stanley (Leslie David Baker). Andy repeatedly acts awkwardly in front of Julia, and accidentally sets off her car alarm while trying to look inside and find out what music she likes. Andy admits his attraction to her to Stanley, who then gives the potential client over to Andy in exchange for two of his clients. [...] After walking her out to the car, Andy tries to kiss her, but is immediately rebuked. Andy apologizes and mentions that he <b>just</b> <b>got</b> out of a relationship.

500|$|When {{producers}} realised that Paul's behaviour {{had gone}} too far, they considered killing him off. Dennis commented [...] "As an actor, I had the best time because this character <b>just</b> <b>got</b> more evil and more sneaky, more of a cad and a womaniser and it just escalated where {{it got to the}} point where it <b>just</b> <b>got</b> silly. It was ridiculous for the supposed reality of the show." [...] The actor also said that he accepted the producers decision to kill his character off when they explained that they did not know where to take him. However, the show's then executive producer Ric Pellizzeri decided to save the character and redeem him by giving him a brain tumour. Following the removal of the brain tumour, Paul mellowed in his evil ways. Of Paul's dramatic change to his personality, post brain tumour, Dennis compared the differences stating: [...] "He's changed back to where he was 18 odd years ago. What he has become is the same Paul he was back then when he was a very ambitious young entrepreneur with Lassiters and Robinson Corporation. But the difference now is that he is older and wiser and therefore a lot more shrewd and a lot more careful. Post brain tumor, he is no longer evil, more ruthless than evil. Ruthless with a conscience and emotion." ...|$|E
