A troposphere tomographic method has been proposed considering the signal rays penetrating from the side of the area of interest to solve the problem of the low utilisation rate of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations. Given the method above needs the establishment of a unit scale factor model using the radiosonde data at only one location in the research area, an improved approach is proposed by considering the reasonability of modelling data and the diversity of the modelling parameters for building a more accurate unit scale factor model. The new established model is established using grid point data derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and evenly distributed in the tomographic area, which can enhance the number of calculated initial water vapour density values with high accuracy. We validated the improved method with respect to the previous methods, as well as the result from a radiosonde using data from 12 stations from the Hong Kong Satellite Positioning Reference Station Network. The obtained result shows that the number of initial values estimated by the new model is increased by 6. 83  %, while the internal and <b>external</b> <b>accuracies</b> are 0. 08 and 0. 24  g m − 3, respectively.

In-tegration of distributed energy resources, in particular renew-ables, introduces uncertainties in traditional load forecasting which is pivotal towards capitalizing upon the Smart Grid opportunities. This calls for an active contribution of the grid stakeholders and involvement of many locally available assets that can help achieving such goals. However, resources that can actively contribute to reduce the load uncertainties {{also need to be}} measurable and therefore predictable. This works presents a system that enables the realisation of Self-Forecasting EneRgy-load Stakeholders (SFERS) that can achieve highly-predictable loads on its own and report them as such to <b>external</b> parties. <b>Accuracy</b> in self-forecast is achieved by absorbing their unpredictability within locally available assets.

40|$|SummaryMultisensory {{plasticity}} {{enables us}} to dynamically adapt sensory cues {{to one another and}} to the environment. Without external feedback, “unsupervised” multisensory calibration reduces cue conflict in a manner largely independent of cue reliability. But environmental feedback regarding cue accuracy (“supervised”) also affects calibration. Here we measured the combined influence of cue accuracy and cue reliability on supervised multisensory calibration, using discrepant visual and vestibular motion stimuli. When the less reliable cue was inaccurate, it alone got calibrated. However, when the more reliable cue was inaccurate, cues were yoked and calibrated together in the same direction. Strikingly, the less reliable cue shifted away from external feedback, becoming less accurate. A computational model in which supervised and unsupervised calibration work in parallel, where the former only relies on the multisensory percept, but the latter can calibrate cues individually, accounts for the observed behavior. In combination, they could ultimately achieve the optimal solution of both <b>external</b> <b>accuracy</b> and internal consistency...|$|E
