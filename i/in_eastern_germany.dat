5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and capitalism, which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), his critique of Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E
25|$|There are, however, marked {{differences}} between the regions of the former West Germany and East Germany: significantly more children are {{born out of wedlock}} <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> than in western Germany: in 2012, <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> 61.6% of births were to unmarried women, but in western Germany only 28.4%.|$|E

25|$|Immigrants from Pakistan, India, China and Vietnam perform {{exceptionally}} well. <b>In</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany,</b> Vietnamese and Chinese of lower-class backgrounds outperform {{students from}} European backgrounds {{despite the fact}} that in most cases their parents are poorer and less educated than the parents of their European-born peers. Teachers <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> have also been shown to be more motivated than teachers in western Germany. That might be another reason for this Asian achievement.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of social class on educational achievement {{is much greater}} in western Germany than it is <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> (former GDR). An analysis of PISA data on Gymnasium pupils for the year 2000 showed that, while in western Germany the child of an academic was 7.26 times as likely {{as that of a}} skilled worker to attend, <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> a child from an academic family was only 2.78 times as likely as a working class child to attend. The reasons for this were unclear. Some people believed that immigrants were responsible, because more uneducated immigrant families lived in western than <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany.</b> This assumption however could not be confirmed. The difference between east and west was even stronger when only ethnic German children were studied.|$|E

25|$|The Second World War {{ended in}} Europe with Germany's defeat in May 1945. By this time, all of Eastern {{and much of}} Central Europe was under Soviet occupation.

25|$|Around 2950 BCE {{there was}} a {{transition}} from the Funnelbeaker farming culture to the Corded Ware pastoralist culture, a large archeological horizon appearing in western and central Europe, {{that is associated with}} the advance of Indo-European languages.

25|$|In {{many other}} cases the Germanised {{versions}} {{are out of}} etymological context.

25|$|The {{evacuation}} of the about 50,000 prisoners from the Stutthof camp system in northern Poland began in January 1945.

The rest of the prisoners were marched {{in the direction of}} Lauenburg <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany.</b> They were cut off by the advancing Soviet forces. The Germans forced the surviving prisoners back to Stutthof. Marching in severe winter conditions and treated brutally by SS guards, thousands died during the march.|$|E
25|$|Gerhard Schröder was re-elected as {{chancellor}} by {{the parliament}} in a coalition with the Greens, who had increased their vote share marginally. Many commentators faulted Stoiber's {{reaction to the}} floods <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany,</b> {{in the run-up to}} the election, as a contributory factor in his party's poor electoral result and defeat. In addition, Schröder distinguished himself from his opponent by taking an active stance against the upcoming United States-led Iraq War. His extensive campaigning on this stance was widely seen as swinging the election to the SPD in the weeks running up to the election.|$|E
25|$|The {{evacuation}} of prisoners from the Stutthof camp system in northern Poland began on 25 January 1945.

About 5,000 prisoners from Stutthof subcamps were marched to the Baltic Sea coast, forced into the water, and machine-gunned. The rest of the prisoners were marched in the direction of Lauenburg <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany.</b> Cut off by advancing Soviet forces the Germans forced the surviving prisoners back to Stutthof.

25|$|Once again a major concert draw, {{at least}} <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany,</b> the Puhdys toured frequently, {{releasing}} In flagranti, another live album, in 1996; however, despite {{a couple of}} non-album singles (including the official anthems for the Eisbären Berlin ice hockey and Hansa Rostock football teams) it was another three years before the next studio album, Frei wie die Geier (Free Like Vultures 1997). After this, the 59-year-old Jeske called it quits, citing ill health, and left the band at a concert on his 60th birthday. He subsequently moved to the Philippines, the homeland of his young wife.|$|E
25|$|This was {{a serious}} blow to Protestant ambitions in the region. As the {{rebellion}} collapsed, the widespread confiscation of property and suppression of the Bohemian nobility ensured the country {{would return to the}} Catholic side after more than two centuries of Hussite and other religious dissent. The Spanish, seeking to outflank the Dutch in preparation for renewal of the Eighty Years' War, took Frederick's lands, the Electorate of the Palatinate. The first phase of the war <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> ended 31 December 1621, when the prince of Transylvania and the emperor signed the Peace of Nikolsburg, which gave Transylvania a number of territories in Royal Hungary.|$|E
25|$|As anticipated, {{the strike}} {{affected}} train service nationwide. However, the company brought in 1,000 managers and other employees to keep trains running. Still, more than 40 {{percent of all}} freight trains were halted. While 50 percent of regional passenger trains in western Germany were running, only one in 10 regional passenger trains operated <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany.</b> Disruptions in local service varied. In Berlin and Munich, commuter service was only minimally interrupted, {{but by the end}} of the day only a third of all trains had run. But in Hamburg, Frankfurt and Stuttgart, major cutbacks in train schedules occurred. In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, trains ran every hour. Two-thirds of the country's high-speed InterCityExpress trains were running normally.|$|E

25|$|The {{division}} {{remained with}} the 5th Shock Army's 26th Guards Rifle Corps <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany.</b> By {{the northern hemisphere}} summer of 1946, it was withdrawn to Stalingrad in the North Caucasus Military District, where it {{became part of the}} 29th Rifle Corps and was downsized into the 18th Separate Rifle Brigade. The brigade was soon transferred to the 6th Rifle Corps. Between 1949 and 1953, the corps was part of the Don Military District. In October 1953, it was expanded into the 68th Mechanized Division, part of the 6th Rifle Corps. On 4 June 1957, the division was converted into the 117th Motor Rifle Division with the 6th Army Corps (the former 6th Rifle Corps). On 19 February 1965, it was renumbered as the 266th Motor Rifle Division, restoring its original World War II designation.|$|E
25|$|In late 1944, Soviet forces battled {{fiercely}} {{to capture}} Hungary in the Budapest Offensive, {{but could not}} take it, which became a topic so sensitive to Stalin that he refused to allow his commanders to speak of it. The Germans held out in the subsequent Battle of Budapest until February 1945, when the remaining Hungarians signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. Victory at Budapest permitted the Red Army to launch the Vienna Offensive in April 1945. To the northeast, the taking of Belarus and western Ukraine permitted the Soviets to launch the massive Vistula–Oder Offensive, where German intelligence had incorrectly guessed the Soviets would have a 3-to-1 numerical superiority advantage that was actually 5-to-1 (over 2 million Red Army personnel attacking 450,000 German defenders), the successful culmination of {{which resulted in the}} Red Army advancing from the Vistula River in Poland to the German Oder River <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Germany.</b>|$|E
25|$|To fight Christian, Ferdinand II {{employed}} the military help of Albrecht von Wallenstein, a Bohemian nobleman {{who had made}} himself rich from the confiscated estates of his Protestant countrymen.

Christian, who knew nothing of Wallenstein's forces when he invaded, was forced to retire before the combined forces of Wallenstein and Tilly. Christian's mishaps continued when all of the allies he thought he had were forced aside: France {{was in the midst of}} a civil war, Sweden was at war with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and neither Brandenburg nor Saxony was interested in changes to the tenuous peace <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany.</b> Moreover, neither of the substantial British contingents arrived in time to prevent Wallenstein defeating Mansfeld's army at the Battle of Dessau Bridge (1626) or Tilly's victory at the Battle of Lutter (1626). Mansfeld died some months later of illness, apparently tuberculosis, in Dalmatia.|$|E
