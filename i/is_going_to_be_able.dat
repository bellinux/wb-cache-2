50|$|The system {{relies on}} radar and {{point-to-point}} beacons {{to control and}} manage the flow of air traffic. These are all World-War-II-era technologies that {{make it difficult for}} the system to expand or to adjust to changes in system operations. If the aviation infrastructure <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to meet the needs expected in the 21st century, it needs to be sufficiently scalable to support additional demand, and flexible enough to accommodate changes in the aviation industry as well as the introduction of new aircraft.

That, in a nutshell, is the objective of NextGen.|$|E
5000|$|The {{downside}} to adjustable sights is the inherent {{fragility of the}} moving parts. A fixed sight is a solid piece of metal, usually steel, and if firmly attached to the gun, little <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to damage it beyond usefulness. Adjustable sights, on the other hand, are bulkier, and have parts that must move relative to the gun. Solid impact on an adjustable sight will usually knock it out of adjustment, if not knock it right off the gun. Because of this, guns for self defense or military use either have fixed sights, or sights with [...] "wings" [...] on the sides for protection (such as those on the M4 carbine).|$|E

Both cost money to implement—the licenses are not free. DTCP encrypts video transmitted over a digital bus called IEEE 1394 (or [...] "FireWire"). HDCP encrypts video transmitted over a different—and video-specific—bus called Digital Visual Interface ("DVI").

5000|$|The A.V.

It engages with {{almost all of the}} storylines that {{have been a part of}} this season so far (notably absent is Gotham’s most rewarding storyline to date, the continuing growth of Bruce Wayne and his badass butler Alfred) while moving its central pieces, specifically the mob bosses, into place for a finale. In any other season, this episode would set the stage for the thirteenth and final episode of the season. Gotham, originally scheduled for 16 episodes, still has 10 more to go though, and it’s unclear how the show <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to sustain the (very) slight momentum this episode built." ...|$|E

Roy has no idea how he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to teach the boy anything and to make matters worse, Sir Robert Butler (David Fox) a local, cut throat businessman, is plotting to take over the ranch.

In the end, in spite of their differences, Roy, Jane and Levi defeat Butler and forge a family in the process.|$|E

[...] If we can get the case re-opened, we can go to the judge and say, 'There wasn't any reason to convict this child. There was no evidence to present to the jury. There was no transcript. This case needs to be re-opened. This is an injustice that needs to be righted.' I'm pretty optimistic that if we can get the witnesses we need to come forward, we will be successful in court. We hopefully have a witness that's going to say — that's non-family, non-relative witness — who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to tie all this in and say that they were basically an alibi witness.

And it was said by the family that there was a deathbed confession." [...] Frierson said that the rumored culprit came from a well-known, prominent white family.
