25|$|Patrick {{decides to}} {{continue}} working at General Hospital, and relocates to Port Charles. Robin also decides {{to stay in the}} place she called home for most of her life. The two often disagree on patients' treatment, with Patrick leaning toward more invasive surgeries and Robin wanting to use drug therapies. The opposing physicians quarrel at the hospital on a daily basis. But it is Noah and Patrick's non-existent father/son relationship that helps develop Patrick and Robin's relationship. When he was a teenager, Patrick's mother died during a surgery that Noah was performing. Noah could not forgive himself and turned to alcohol as a result. He became a neglectful father and his relationship with Patrick suffered severely. At the same time, Robin developed her own set of father issues with the re-emergence of a not-so-dead Robert Scorpio. Early on, Robin and Patrick connected because of their <b>dead</b> <b>beat</b> nonexistent fathers. Though her father left shortly after he returned and never fully healed their broken relationship, Robin tried to mend the fence between Patrick and Noah and in a way acted as mediator. Robin and Patrick learn more about each other's pasts and soon Robin is able to convince Patrick to talk to his father. In conversation, Patrick admits his love for his father and inspires Noah to go to rehab.|$|E

The same effort that would get us Dominion Home Rule will get us a republic." [...] At no time had the Dáil or the IRA asked for a conference or a truce.|$|E

40|$|Reconfigurable {{circuits}} alternatively {{acting as}} Random Number Generators (RNGs) or Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) represent a promising approach to true random bit generation since {{they can provide}} high quality random values almost for free whenever a system already embeds an ADC. In their usage, one needs to consider that entering the RNG-mode requires some minor interruption of operation, since the internal chaos-based random source gets initialised at the last ADC input. Hence, the first generated values maintain some dependence on a potentially known value and a few <b>dead</b> <b>beats</b> are needed by the chaotic system to reach a regime where this correlation vanishes. This delay {{has so far been}} quantified only empirically. Here, a formal bound is provided, with relation to the required performance level and the system noise floor...|$|R
