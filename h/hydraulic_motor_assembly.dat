40|$|An energy {{producing}} device, {{for example}} a submersible vehicle for descending or ascending to different depths within water or ocean, is disclosed. The vehicle comprises a temperature-responsive material {{to which a}} hydraulic fluid is associated. A pressurized storage compartment stores the fluid {{as soon as the}} temperature-responsive material changes density. The storage compartment is connected with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor,</b> and a valve allows fluid passage from the storage compartment to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor.</b> An energy storage component, e. g. a battery, is connected with the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> and is charged by the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> when the <b>hydraulic</b> fluid passes through the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor.</b> Upon passage in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor,</b> the fluid is stored in a further storage compartment and is then sent back to the area of the temperature-responsive material...|$|R
50|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> is {{the rotary}} {{counterpart}} of the hydraulic cylinder. Conceptually, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> should be interchangeable with the hydraulic pump, {{due to the}} fact it performs the opposite function. However, most hydraulic pumps cannot be used as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motors</b> because they cannot be backdriven. Also, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> is usually designed for the working pressure at both sides of the motor. Another difference is that a motor can be reversed by a reversing valve.|$|R

40|$|Today’s {{high lift}} systems of civil {{transport}} aircraft {{are driven by}} Power Control Units using valve controlled constant displacement <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motors.</b> This concept leads to com-plex valve blocks, attended by high power losses to realise discrete speed control, positioning and pressure maintaining functionality. The concept of secondary controlled <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motors</b> with variable displacement offers reduction in flow consumption without pressure losses and decreases {{the complexity of the}} valve block design. Instead of controlling flow of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> with valves, torque is adjusted to the load by varying displacement. An electronic control circuit allows flexible digital control concepts e. g. load independent speed control, pressure maintaining function-ality, smooth start-up sequences and continuous positioning of the mechanical transmission system. This paper introduces the concept of today’s Power Control Units, the principle and mathematical model of secondary controlled <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motors</b> and the cascade control loop structure. A new hydraulic concept for Power Control Units using secondary controlled <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motors</b> is presented. Theoretical, simulated and experimental results show typical operation sequences under load and a comparison of power requirement to conventional systems.

40|$|I n a {{hydrostatic}} transmission system {{the speed of}} the fixed displacement <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> can be controlled by varying either the pump displacement or the pump speed. The change of pump speed can be achieved via an inverter which governs the speed of an induction motor. In this paper, both the pump-controlled <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> system and the inverter-controlled <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> system are studied. A microcomputer-based self-tuning adaptive controller was designed and applied to both systems. A series of simulations and experi-ments was pe&rmed.

40|$|A {{new kind}} of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> with offset swining {{planetary}} drive of bevel gears and the application in Capstan is presented; the researched of the calculation of {{the efficiency of the}} mechanism is made. Compared to the former structure, {{new kind of}} structure has many advantages over that of the old structure. The hydraulic driving system in the traditional derrick car is: <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> drives a reducer, and then the reducer in turn drives a capstan. Another hydraulic driving system is: an axial piston motor and an internal cycloid pinwheel drive are applied, so that the reducer and the capstan are combined into one so that simplified the transmission system. In the third version, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> is applied, which can be considered as the combination of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> with axial piston and the planetary reducer and then drives the capstan, so that simplified the transmission system as well. The new kind of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> with offset swing planetary drive of bevel gears, which combined the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor,</b> the internal planetary reducer with bevel gears, and the capstan together, is the most compact structure. It is of more advantage in the occasion when space is extremely limited. In the paper, two kind of construction of this mechanism is presented, and the analysis of the efficiency of this kind of transmission is made as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{swash plate}} pump-controlled <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> {{system has been}} {{presented}} in this work. The flow rate of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> system and then the output speed could be controlled by adjusting the swash plate angle. Actuating the swash plate using DC servomotor could enhance dynamic performance of the pump, and then better improve the performance of overall <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> system. In this study, another speed control configuration has been introduced and the angular velocity of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor</b> has been controlled using both PI (proportional and integral) and FL (fuzzy logic) controllers. However, due to the nonlinear nature and time-varying dynamics of the considered system, PI controllers are sometimes insufficient to overcome such nonlinearities because they have linear characteristics. Therefore, this classical controller sometimes fails to compensate the change in system parameters unless its parameters (PI controller) are repeatedly tuned. Unlike classical control methods, the fuzzy controller is designed with linguistic terms to cope with nonlinearities. Results of computer simulation showed that FLC {{has the potential to}} reduce the adverse effects of changing system parameters...|$|R
