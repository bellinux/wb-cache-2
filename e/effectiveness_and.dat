40|$|This study investigates how control, through trust <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness</b> uncertainty, affects learners’ {{willingness}} {{to depend on}} a virtual learning community (VLC). Three variables, perceived accreditation, perceived feedback, and perceived cooperative norms, were incorporated to represent different types of control. The research hypotheses were tested on a sample of 264 survey participants using Partial Least Squares (PLS). The results indicate that cooperative norms and feedback engender trust in the VLC, that accreditation and cooperative norms reduce <b>effectiveness</b> uncertainty, <b>and</b> that trust increases learners' {{willingness to}} depend on VLC. The relationships between trust <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness</b> uncertainty, between <b>effectiveness</b> uncertainty <b>and</b> willingness to depend, between feedback <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness</b> uncertainty, <b>and</b> between accreditation and trust are unconfirmed...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the attacks, many governments across the world passed {{legislation}} to combat terrorism. In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted. The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany. The second addressed the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>and</b> communication of intelligence and law enforcement. Canada passed the Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, that nation's first anti-terrorism law. The United Kingdom passed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002.|$|E

5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent <b>effectiveness,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was the only}} immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to research for alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded and there was no study on Myrmecia sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown to be safe and effective against Myrmecia venom.|$|E
5|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is a first-line {{treatment for}} mild and moderate acne {{due to its}} <b>effectiveness</b> <b>and</b> mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals are thought {{to interfere with the}} bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Designed in {{the early}} 1930s, {{it was one of}} the three main Luftwaffe bomber types used in the first three years of the war. The Do 17 made its combat debut in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War, {{operating}} in the Condor Legion in various roles. Along with the Heinkel He 111 it was the main bomber type of the German air arm in 1939–1940. The Dornier was used throughout the early war, and saw action in significant numbers in every major campaign theatre as a front line aircraft until the end of 1941, when its <b>effectiveness</b> <b>and</b> usage was curtailed as its bomb load and range were limited.|$|E

5|$|Discussions on {{improving}} the UN's <b>effectiveness</b> <b>and</b> responsiveness to international security threats often include {{reform of the}} UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting {{the use of the}} veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, bulkers were {{involved}} in an alarming number of shipwrecks. This led ship-owners to commission a study seeking to explain the effect of various factors on the crew's <b>effectiveness</b> <b>and</b> competence. The study showed that crew performance aboard bulk carriers was the lowest of all groups studied. Among bulker crews, the best performance was found aboard younger and larger ships. Crews on better-maintained ships performed better, as did crews on ships where fewer languages were spoken.|$|E

5|$|In a 2011 {{paper for}} the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, authors Anna Eaglin and Shaowen Bardzell {{discussed}} the Magic Wand {{within the context}} of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose. A 2012 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy evaluated seven vibrators for use with clinical therapy for sexual stimulation. They found that the Magic Wand displayed a high degree of movement and oscillation. The researchers suggested that their data could be used by therapists to select the optimum vibrator which could deliver both <b>effectiveness</b> <b>and</b> sensitivity for their clients.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} {{and development of}} organizations depends on achievement of requisite holistic efficiency <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of their operations and bahaviour. But in theory (of organization and management) and business practice do not exist common understanding of efficiency <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> their relations <b>and</b> sinergies. When we try to investigate their definitions and relations we {{must take into account}} problems of many conflicts, which reflect their “different non-optimalty (unsuitability, inapproapriateness) ”. This contribution discusses three theses: 1) how to more (requisitely) holistically understand relations between efficiency <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness</b> in the frame of business (its working and functioning), 2) how to understand their relations from the viewpoint of conflicts, and 3) one can create solution to remove a problem of different conflicts between efficiency <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness</b> in business...|$|R
5|$|The Latin American lesbian {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but has encountered similar problems in <b>effectiveness</b> <b>and</b> cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|The barbarisation theory, {{ultimately}} {{derived from}} Edward Gibbon's 18th-century magnum opus, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, contains two propositions. (1) That the late army recruited much {{greater numbers of}} barbarian-born troops than {{the army of the}} Principate; and (2) that the greater number of barbarian recruits resulted in a major decline of the army's <b>effectiveness</b> <b>and</b> was a leading factor in the collapse of the Western Roman empire. As discussed above, proposition (1) is probably correct, although it should be borne in mind that probably about three-quarters of the late army's recruits remained Roman-born. This section considers proposition (2).|$|E
