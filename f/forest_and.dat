5|$|During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration {{chose to}} make Clark State Forest a {{training}} {{center for the}} Civilian Conservation Corps, and also made it Indiana's largest CCC cantonment in November1933. They created artificial lakes within Clark State <b>Forest,</b> <b>and</b> built many bridges, to aid in water conservation, provide beauty spots within the <b>forest,</b> <b>and</b> teach forestry skills {{to members of the}} Civilian Conservation Corps. The state forest's proximity to the Jeffersonville Quartermaster Depot was key in the decision to focus so much attention on it.|$|E

5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii fruits singly or {{in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} grass or among leaf litter. It is {{typically}} found in eucalypt <b>forest</b> <b>and</b> subtropical rainforests. It has been recorded from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. In southwest Australia it is found in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forests, where fruiting usually occurs in late autumn and early winter. The fungus appears to prefer disturbed ground, as it is often found at roadsides by forests, on lawns, grassy areas of parks, and among the slash of thinned karri regrowth forests. It is common in river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) woodlands. M.clelandii also occurs in New Zealand, where it is found in mixed mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), kānuka (Kunzea ericoides), and kauri (Agathis) <b>forest,</b> <b>and</b> in conifer plantations. It is the smallest and most slender of the Macrolepiota species that occur there.|$|E
