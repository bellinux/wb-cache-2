5|$|Danilo Di Luca {{tried to}} {{attack from the}} pink jersey group a few times {{at the foot of}} the climb, but Menchov {{answered}} each time. When Ivan Basso and Carlos Sastre attacked, Menchov and Di Luca let them go, seeming fixed solely on one another. Sastre's attack proved to be the crucial one, as he seemed quite fresh for having been climbing for over seven hours, staying clear of the pink jersey and blowing past Popovych to claim the stage win. With the time gained on the road as well as bonus seconds at the line, Sastre moved up to third in the overall classification. Menchov outsprinted Di Luca to the finish line, gaining one second on the road and four bonus seconds to slightly pad his lead over Di Luca. Thomas Lövkvist, who had been in the white jersey as best young rider, was dropped very early on in this stage and finished 24 minutes behind the stage winner. <b>He</b> <b>wound</b> up dropping all the way to fifth in the youth classification, with Quick Step rider Kevin Seeldraeyers, 15th overall, assuming the white jersey.|$|E

The decision to host the 2014 IAAF World Relays event was also made without their input. Oliver agreed to a vote of no confidence at a BAAA general meeting in response.|$|E

25|$|Nicklaus {{attended}} Ohio State from 1957 to 1961. He {{majored in}} pre-pharmacy {{his first three}} years, with good grades, and intended to follow his father into that profession after graduation. As his golf achievements mounted, Nicklaus changed his mind on his career path, switching programs to study insurance, as he planned at that stage to remain a career amateur in golf, and to make his living by selling insurance. For a time {{he worked in the}} insurance field while also attending college. He married Barbara Bash at age 20 in July 1960, and their first of five children (Jack, Jr.) was born in September 1961, but as of late October, Nicklaus was still intent on becoming the first amateur to win the Masters Tournament.

25|$|Barruel’s Memoirs is {{considered}} one of the founding documents of the right-wing interpretation of the French Revolution. It became popular immediately after it was published and was read and commented on by most of the important literary and political journals of the day. The four volumes of the text were published in a number of languages and created a debate about the role of the philosophes, their ideas, and the Enlightenment in the French Revolution. They remained in print well into the 20th century and contributed to the historical interpretation of the late 18th century in France. The success of Barruels work is testimony to the anti-philosophical discourse that spread in the aftermath of the revolution. Barruel left behind a construction of the Enlightenment that was destined to influence subsequent interpretations. <b>He</b> <b>wound</b> accusations tightly around his foes and tied them into positions from which they could not escape. The text created a link between the Enlightenment and the Revolution and this connection remains a topic of historical debate.|$|E

Tatum was {{a fan of the}} G.I. Joe franchise while growing up, and expressed interest in playing Snake Eyes although Paramount wanted him for Duke.|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{considered}} {{that a great}} part of the episode's merits were due to George R. R. Martin's script. Sepinwall felt that [...] "Martin didn't get the easiest draw when <b>he</b> <b>wound</b> up having to dramatize the events depicted in 'The Pointy End,'" [...] but still loved the results. Mo Ryan concluded that anyone who was doubting whether Martin had forgotten about writing television scripts should now put their doubts to rest. The [...] "expert" [...] review from the A.V. Club by Todd VanDerWerff noted [...] "a definite sense of Martin's hand at work here. Characters that have never quite worked onscreen—like Sansa—suddenly feel much more alive. Characters that have been working—like Tyrion and Arya—get lots of fun stuff to play that never once feels labored." ...|$|E
