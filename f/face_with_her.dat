5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man to come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E

25|$|As Jesus labors {{to carry}} a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, a woman avoids the escort of soldiers, and wipes Jesus' <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> veil. Jesus is beaten and pressed by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into {{carrying}} the cross with him. At {{the end of their}} travel, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified. The very act seems to affect the weather conditions of the earth itself.|$|E

50|$|The {{appearance}} of Goddess Kaalratri {{can be seen}} as bearing doom for evil-doers. But she always bears good fruits for her devotees and should avoid fear when <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> for she removes the darkness of worry from life of such devotees. Her worship on the seventh day of Navratri is given especially high importance by Yogis and Sādhakas.|$|R

In the evening he appears in her open bedroom, forcefully embracing and kissing her passionately, the sexually charged scene fading to black.|$|E
25|$|Athena wove {{the scene}} of her victory over Poseidon in the contest for the {{patronage}} of Athens. Arachne's tapestry featured twenty-one episodes of the deities' infidelity, including Zeus being unfaithful with Leda, with Europa, and with Danaë. Athena admitted that Arachne's work was flawless, but was outraged at Arachne's offensive choice of subject, which displayed the failings and transgressions of the deities. Finally, losing her temper, Athena destroyed Arachne's tapestry and loom, striking it with her shuttle. Athena then struck Arachne across the <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> staff four times. Arachne hung herself in despair, but Athena took pity on her and brought her {{back from the dead}} {{in the form of a}} spider.|$|E
25|$|Before 1898, {{devotion to}} the Holy Face of Jesus used an image based on the Veil of Veronica, where legend recounts that Veronica from Jerusalem {{encountered}} Jesus along the Via Dolorosa {{on the way to}} Calvary. When she paused to wipe the sweat from Jesus's <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> veil, the image was imprinted on the cloth. The establishment of these images as Catholic devotions traces back to Sister Marie of St Peter and the Venerable Leo Dupont who started and promoted them from 1844 to 1874 in Tours France, and Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli who associated the image from the Shroud of Turin with the devotion in 1936 in Milan Italy.|$|E
60|$|Marie had <b>her</b> <b>face</b> covered <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{handkerchief}} at this appeal, {{and began}} sobbing and using <b>her</b> smelling-bottle, <b>with</b> great vehemence.|$|R

Flashes of thorns, {{as well as the}} knots in the rope, are interpreted by Jon Freeman of Rolling Stone to be symbolic of the struggles Scott's character <b>faces,</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> eventual disentanglement representing her rising above the tragedy.|$|R

25|$|Lee {{reaches the}} hotel where Clementine is captive where he comes face to <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> captor, who reveals {{that he was the}} owner of the station wagon that the group ransacked after leaving the dairy and lost his family to walkers as a result. Seeking revenge, the {{stranger}} found Clementine on his walkie-talkie and manipulated her into keeping tabs on the group under the guise that he had her parents and had been following them ever since. Realizing that the man is insane, Lee, with Clementine's help, kills him. As Lee and Clementine leave the hotel, Clementine spots her parents, both of whom have turned into walkers, and Lee falls unconscious. Awakening soon after, he realizes he is near conversion, and instructs her to escape the city and meet Omid and Christa at the edge of town. The player can choose to have Lee order Clementine to either kill him or leave him to become a walker, or can opt to do nothing, in which case Clementine will choose based on the culmination of the player's choices within the game.|$|E
25|$|Del Rio finally {{received}} his title shot on June 16 at Payback, {{and during the}} match, a double-turn occurred; Del Rio turned heel once again by repeatedly and ruthlessly targeting Ziggler's head after his recent concussion to defeat Ziggler and regain the World Heavyweight Championship. Del Rio later explained that he targeted Ziggler's head the same way Ziggler targeted Del Rio's injured leg when Ziggler cashed in Money in the Bank to win the title from Del Rio. On July 14 at Money in the Bank, Del Rio defeated Ziggler by disqualification to retain the World Heavyweight Title, after Ziggler's girlfriend AJ Lee hit Del Rio in the <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> Divas Championship belt.

On the August 9 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio again lost to Christian in a non-title match. On August 18 at SummerSlam, Del Rio successfully defended the World Heavyweight Title against Christian. Upon Rodriguez's return, he aligned himself with Rob Van Dam, accompanying him to matches and helping him defeat Del Rio in a non-title match to earn a shot at the World Heavyweight Title. On the September 13 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Rodriguez in a single match. On September 15 Night of Champions, Van Dam defeated Del Rio by disqualification after Del Rio refused to relinquish the cross armbreaker, retaining the World Heavyweight Championship in result.

Del Rio {{received his}} rematch for the title on November 24 at Survivor Series, but again lost to Cena.|$|E
500|$|Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund. Bergman's {{official}} website calls Ilsa her [...] "most famous and enduring role". The Swedish actress's Hollywood debut in Intermezzo had been well received, but her subsequent films were not major successes until Casablanca. Film critic Roger Ebert called her [...] "luminous", and {{commented on the}} chemistry between her and Bogart: [...] "she paints his <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> eyes". Other actresses considered {{for the role of}} Ilsa included Ann Sheridan, Hedy Lamarr, Luise Rainer and Michèle Morgan. Producer Hal Wallis obtained the services of Bergman, who was contracted to David O. Selznick, by lending Olivia de Havilland in exchange.|$|E

50|$|However, her {{effects were}} said to be more practical: as abbess of Samding, it is said that she stopped the {{invasion}} of the Dzungars, who were described as terrified of her great siddhi powers.

500|$|The video commences with {{formally}} dressed spectators {{entering a}} museum as a curator introduces [...] "a creature so rare {{it was believed}} to be extinct. In captivity for the first time, the rarest creature on Earth, Avis Cyrus. White curtains are pulled down to reveal Cyrus, dressed in a black leotard and expansive black CGI wings, asleep in a giant bird nest locked inside a giant cage. Cyrus rises and approaches the audience, but a camera flash startles her and causes her to shield her <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> wings. The music starts, and Cyrus unveils herself again and joins a large group of feathered dancers. As Cyrus sings, she and the dancers escape the cage and prowl the museum, shattering museum exhibits as they pass them. They perform provocative dances both inside the cage and in darkened museum halls. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus lying down, dressed in a silver corset attached to a bed of peacock feathers, or writhing alone in her nest in the cage. The video ends with Cyrus back in her cage and the museum empty and trashed.|$|E
500|$|Phoenix, {{along with}} then-ally Melina, {{took part in}} the Playboy BunnyMania Lumberjack match at WrestleMania XXIV, where she {{defeated}} the team of Ashley and Maria. On April 14, 2008 Phoenix faced Mickie James with her Women's Championship on the line and lost, ending her reign as champion. Phoenix received a rematch on the May 5 episode of Raw in a lumberjill match, but lost after Melina unintentionally hit her in the <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> boot. On the May 12 episode of Raw, Melina and Phoenix partnered to face Maria and James. During the match, Melina unintentionally knocked Phoenix off of the ring apron, resulting in Phoenix abandoning Melina, which allowed James and Maria to pick up the win. Later that night, Melina and Phoenix brawled in a backstage segment, ending their alliance. At Judgment Day, Phoenix failed to regain the Women's Championship in a Triple Threat match after James pinned Melina to retain the title. At One Night Stand, Phoenix defeated Melina in the first women's [...] "I Quit" [...] match in WWE history.

500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers her <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but she says with a smile to give her a little time.|$|E
5000|$|Conversely, the {{exemplary}} stepmother {{prefers the}} stepson {{to her own}} child, in recognition that his seniority makes him superior. The [...] "righteous stepmother of Qi", <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> son and stepson having been found by a murdered man, and both having confessed to shield the other, argues for her son's execution because her husband had ordered her to look after her stepson, and her son is the junior brother; the king pardoned them both for her devotion to duty.|$|R

A six-month order was granted, unopposed by Graner. Shortly after the first one expired, Staci Dean was granted a second protection order, saying Graner {{had come to her}} house, thrown her against some furniture, thrown her on the bed, grabbed her arm and hit her <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> arm. Three years later, Dean called police after Graner came to her house and attacked her. Dean said Graner had [...] "yanked me out of bed by my hair, dragging me and all the covers into the hall and tried to throw me down the steps." [...] Afterwards, Graner called a friend of Dean's and allegedly said, [...] "I have nothing if she's not my wife, she's dead."

[...] Jackson contacted Kahn directly to direct the video, saying [...] "I was star struck on Janet for sure, {{because that was the}} first time that I really dealt with someone that was in my youth. I studied Janet Jackson videos growing up. So to finally see myself face to <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> and working with her and her calling me on a first name basis and calling my home and tracking me down on my cell phone… like her leaving messages, it was the weirdest thing." [...] Kahn continued [...] "And Janet, she really is elegant, she’s like royalty. Even though she’s talking to you and trying to be normal, she’s not – she’s Janet Jackson – and you can never get that out of your head.
