5|$|Despite {{the knee}} injury, Croyle {{received}} interest from members the Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference, including Louisiana State and Florida State. Croyle showed interest in playing for Florida State {{due in part}} because of the team's offensive coordinator, Mark Richt. Croyle initially showed little interest in playing for Alabama after their head coach, Mike DuBose had recently been fired, but once Richt took the head coaching job with the Georgia Bulldogs, Croyle followed in his father's footsteps. On the night before he was to announce his college decision to play for Florida State, Croyle announced that he would instead play for the Alabama Crimson Tide. <b>Interestingly</b> <b>enough,</b> the Crimson Tide were not fazed by Croyle’s rather serious ligament tear, for they felt he would heal well enough that his talent still warranted a spot on the roster. Croyle graduated early from high school and enrolled at the University of Alabama in January 2001. After red-shirting his freshman year at Alabama, Croyle earned a spot as the top backup in his second season behind senior starter Tyler Watts. Croyle's coaches voted for him as the Ozzie Newsome Most Improved Freshman after starting two games in 2002. After the 2002 season, Alabama head coach Dennis Franchione resigned to take the same position at Texas A. Washington State head coach Mike Price was hired to replace Franchione in January 2003.|$|E

LaBonge admits that he caused Maleeni's head to fall off, and says that he will give Alvarez the money he is owed if he helps him with his magic. Mulder and Scully learn that Maleeni has an {{identical}} twin brother, Albert. Albert, <b>interestingly</b> <b>enough</b> is even wearing a neckbrace, which he says he got {{in a car accident}} in Mexico. Mulder tells him he thinks he did the magic act, but the man shows that he has no legs, which he also lost in Mexico in the car accident. Back at work, Alvarez threatens Pinchbeck that he will kill him if he does not get his money. LaBonge then frames Alvarez for a robbery by attacking a security truck disguised as Alvarez. Mulder soon finds out that Pinchbeck is the real Maleeni and that he faked having no legs. After confronting Pinchbeck, he admits that he faked his own death in order to get out of Alvarez's debt. Pinchbeck admits that he found his brother dead of a heart attack at home and used his body as a double. Pinchbeck is promptly arrested, as is LaBonge, who brings a gun to a bar, in an attempt to purposely get arrested. In addition, Alvarez is arrested because of the attempted robbery LaBonge did earlier.|$|E

Inflows of FDI increased rapidly from 1990 till 1998, slowing down thereafter. Domestic R&D investment accelerated after 1998. Regional industrial growth benefits from both interregional R&D spillovers and after 1998 from international FDI spillovers. However, in contrast to R&D spillovers, FDI spillovers contribute conditionally, mainly in areas where local R&D stocks are high <b>enough.</b> <b>Interestingly,</b> indirect interregional FDI spillover effects are negative.

40|$|Volatility is {{a widely}} {{recognized}} measure of market risk. As volatility is not observed {{it has to be}} estimated from market prices, i. e., as the implied volatility from option prices. The volatility index VIX making volatility a tradeable asset in its own right is computed from near- and next-term put and call options on the S&P 500 with more than 23 days and less than 37 days to expiration and non-vanishing bid. In the present paper we quantify the information content of the constituents of the VIX about the volatility of the S&P 500 in terms of the Fisher information matrix. Assuming that observed option prices are centered on the theoretical price provided by Heston's model perturbed by additive Gaussian noise we relate their Fisher information matrix to the Greeks in the Heston model. We find that the prices of options contained in the VIX basket allow for reliable estimates of the volatility of the S&P 500 with negligible uncertainty as long as volatility is large <b>enough.</b> <b>Interestingly,</b> if volatility drops below a critical value of roughly 3 %, inferences from option prices become imprecise because Vega, the derivative of a European option w. r. t. volatility, and thereby the Fisher information nearly vanishes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how should firms allocate their advertising budgets between consumers {{who have a}} high preference for their products (strong segment) and those who prefer competing products (weak segment). Targeted advertising transmits relevant information to otherwise uninformed consumers and it {{is used as a}} price discrimination device. With targeted advertising and price discrimination, we find that, when the attractiveness of the weak segment is low, each firm advertises more intensively in its strong segment than in its weak segment. The same result arises when the attractiveness of the weak segment is high and advertising is expensive <b>enough.</b> <b>Interestingly,</b> when the attractiveness of the weak segment is high but advertising costs are sufficiently low, it is optimal for each firm to advertise more intensively in its weak segment than in its strong segment. The paper also investigates how advertising strategies and equilibrium profits are affected by price discrimination. In comparison to uniform pricing, firms can increase or reduce the intensity of advertising targeted to each segment when price discrimination is allowed. Further, when the attractiveness of the weak market is high, price discrimination boosts firms´ profits provided that advertising costs are sufficiently low. The reverse happens when advertising costs are high.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in the clusters formed by a Poisson ensemble of Markovian loops on infinite graphs. This model was introduced and studied in [LeJ 12] and [LL 12]. It is a model with long range correlations with two parameters α and κ. The non-negative parameter α measures the amount of loops, and κ plays the role of killing on vertices penalizing (κ> 0) or favoring (κ < 0) appearance of large loops. It was shown in [LL 12] that for any fixed κ and large enough α, there exists an infinite cluster in the loop percolation on Zd. In the present article, we show a non-trivial phase transition on the integer lattice Zd (d ≥ 3) for κ = 0. More precisely, we show that there is no loop percolation for κ = 0 and α small <b>enough.</b> <b>Interestingly,</b> we observe a critical like behavior on the whole sub-critical domain of α, namely, for κ = 0 and any sub-critical value of α, the probability of one-arm event decays at most polynomially. For d ≥ 5, we prove that there exists a non-trivial threshold for the finiteness of the expected cluster size. For α below this threshold, we calculate, up to a constant factor, the decay of the probability of one-arm event, two point function, and the tail distribution of the cluster size. These rates are comparable with the ones obtained from a single large loop and only depend on the dimension. For d = 3 or 4, we give better lower bounds on the decay of the probability of one-arm event, which show importance of small loops for long connections. In addition, we show that the one-arm exponent in dimension 3 depends on the intensity α. ...|$|R

This problem, which will be called the randomized shortest path problem, is introduced in this paper. The global degree of randomness of the routing policy will be quantified by the expected Shannon entropy spread into the network, and is provided a priori by the designer.

40|$|This letter {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} designing the transition probabilities of a finite Markov chain (the policy) {{in order to minimize}} the expected cost for reaching a destination node from a source node while maintaining a fixed level of entropy spread throughout the network (the exploration). It is motivated by the following scenario. Suppose you have to route agents through a network in some optimal way, for instance, by minimizing the total travel cost-nothing particular up to now-you could use a standard shortest-path algorithm. Suppose, however, that you want to avoid pure deterministic routing policies in order, for instance, to allow some continual exploration of the network, avoid congestion, or avoid complete predictability of your routing strategy. In other words, you want to introduce some randomness or unpredictability in the routing policy (i. e., the routing policy is randomized). This problem, which will be called the randomized shortest-path problem (RSP), is investigated in this work. The global level of randomness of the routing policy is quantified by the expected Shannon entropy spread throughout the network and is provided a priori by the designer. Then, necessary conditions to compute the optimal randomized policy-minimizing the expected routing cost-are derived. Iterating these necessary conditions, reminiscent of Bellman's value iteration equations, allows computing an optimal policy, that is, a set of transition probabilities in each node. <b>Interestingly</b> and surprisingly <b>enough,</b> this first model, while formulated in a totally different framework, is equivalent to Akamatsu's model (1996), appearing in transportation science, for a special choice of the entropy constraint.

For instance, it is shown that the unique optimal policy can be obtained by solving a simple linear system of equations. This second model is therefore more convincing because of its computational efficiency and soundness. Finally, simulation results obtained on simple, illustrative examples show that the models behave as expected...|$|R
