5|$|Absent Miyamoto's direction, the {{development}} team used elements new and {{inconsistent with the}} series as Super Mario Land shrunk elements of the series to fit the portable device's small screen. Yokoi, the head of R, served as producer, and Satoru Okada served as director. They had previously developed Metroid (1986) and Kid Icarus (1986) together, and the two subsequently designed the Game Boy—Yokoi on <b>its</b> <b>industrial</b> design, and Okada on its engineering. Their Super Mario Land was planned as the portable console's showcase title until Henk Rogers brought Tetris to Nintendo of America and convinced Minoru Arakawa that the addictive computer game would help Nintendo reach the largest audience. The company subsequently chose to bundle Tetris with every Game Boy purchase.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Europe {{had more}} than 40 million refugees, its economy had {{collapsed}} and 70 percent of <b>its</b> <b>industrial</b> infrastructure was destroyed. Between twelve and fourteen million ethnic Germans fled or were expelled from east-central Europe to Germany. During the Cold War, the West German government estimated a death toll of 2.2 million civilians due to the flight and expulsion of Germans and through forced labour in the Soviet Union. This figure remained unchallenged until the 1990s, when some historians put the death toll at 500,000–600,000 confirmed deaths. In 2006, the German government reaffirmed its position that 2.0–2.5 million deaths occurred.|$|E
5|$|Ayer {{was devastated}} by {{a fire in}} 1872, but <b>its</b> <b>industrial</b> {{connections}} allowed {{for a period of}} rebuilding and even prosperity after. Most buildings in the Ayer Main Street Historic District were built during that time. When the Hoosac Tunnel opened in 1875, trains through Ayer could run on the Fitchburg and the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad as far west as Troy, New York. With service to Troy, Boston, Nashua, Worcester, Lowell, and Greenville, Ayer Junction (soon shortened to Ayer) was a major rail interchange and the most important station on the Fitchburg Railroad between Concord and Fitchburg.|$|E
5|$|Carmarthenshire {{is mainly}} an {{agricultural}} county, {{apart from the}} southeastern part which at one time was heavily industrialised with coal mining, steel-making and tin-plating. In {{the north of the}} county the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century. Nowadays the economy of the county depends on agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism. With the decline in <b>its</b> <b>industrial</b> base and the low profitability of the livestock sector, Carmarthenshire is economically one of the worst-performing regions in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Scottish {{industry}} {{came out}} of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of <b>its</b> <b>industrial</b> activity, absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships. Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 25 per cent, and unemployment temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition; the average height of 13-year-olds in Glasgow increased by 2inches.|$|E
5|$|The insect {{was once}} {{commonly}} {{found throughout the}} Palearctic and was recognised across Eurasia, from France and England to China, but it was mainly in Central Europe where it was common enough to make <b>its</b> <b>industrial</b> use economically viable. Excessive economic exploitation {{as well as the}} shrinking and degradation of its habitat have made the Polish cochineal a rare species. In 1994, it was included in the Ukrainian Red Book of endangered species. In Poland, where it was still common in the 1960s, there is insufficient data to determine its conservation status, and no protective measures are in place.|$|E

5|$|During {{the post-war}} boom, {{the methods used}} to set up {{business}} in South Australia were unique. Playford's government would charge little to no business tax, supply cheap electricity, land and water, and have the Housing Trust build the factories and workers' homes. Consumer goods and automotive factories were created in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide; mining, steel and shipbuilding industries appeared in the 'Iron Triangle' towns of Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta. Prices and wages were kept relatively low to enable continued investment, and South Australia was slower than the other states to abolish these wartime measures to increase <b>its</b> <b>industrial</b> competitiveness. The government initiatives managed to overcome the large logistic burden, as Adelaide and South Australia were far from the markets where the goods would be sold.|$|E
5|$|Poland {{suffered}} catastrophic {{damage to}} its infrastructure during the war, which {{caused it to}} lag even further behind the West in <b>its</b> <b>industrial</b> output. The losses in national resources and infrastructure amounted to over 30% of the pre-war potential. Poland's capital of Warsaw {{was among the most}} devastated cities – over 80 percent destroyed {{in the aftermath of the}} Warsaw Uprising of 1944. Nonetheless, resulting from forced migration, there was a rapid increase in population to 23.9 million shown in the first post-war census of 14 February 1946. The Polish state acquired more highly developed western territories and lost the more economically backward eastern regions. Already in 1948 the prewar level of industrial production was exceeded in global and per capita terms during the first Three-Year Plan (Plan Trzyletni) fueled by the collective desire to rebuild shattered lives.|$|E
5|$|The EES had sizable {{and growing}} {{support from the}} state of Georgia and <b>its</b> <b>Industrial</b> Development Council, which {{developed}} products and methods and provided technical assistance for Georgia industry. However, due in part to efforts made by Boyd and previous station director Gerald Rosselot, the station increasingly relied on electronics research funding from the federal government. In 1971, funding to both Georgia Tech's academic units and the EES began to suffer due to a sharp decline in state funds combined with cuts to federal science, research, and education funding {{after the end of the}} Space Race funding boom. Similar institutions, such as the Battelle Memorial Institute, Stanford Research Institute, and the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute had weathered this storm by becoming exceedingly good at obtaining research contracts.|$|E

5|$|Simpson's {{selection}} of Boyd as interim president {{was influenced by}} Boyd's previous experience as an academic administrator, his experience {{as director of the}} Engineering Experiment Station, and Boyd's ongoing position on the station's board of directors. The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether the Engineering Experiment Station should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money.

5|$|The boomtown of Chadderton reached <b>its</b> <b>industrial</b> zenith in the 1910s, {{with over}} 50cotton mills within the town limits. A social {{consequence}} of this industrial growth was a densely populated metropolitan landscape, home to an extensive and enlarged working class community living in an urban sprawl of low quality terraced houses. However, Chadderton developed an abundance of civic institutions including public street lighting, Carnegie library, public swimming baths and council with its own town hall. The development of the town meant that the district council made initial steps to petition the Crown for honorific borough status for Chadderton in the 1930s. However, the Great Depression, and the First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns and textile goods increased during the mid-20th century, Chadderton's textile sector declined to a halt; cotton spinning reduced dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s and by 1997 only two mills were operational. In spite of efforts {{to increase the efficiency}} and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998. Many of the redundant mills have now been demolished. Non-textile based industries continued on throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, particularly in the form of aircraft and chemical manufacture at plants in south Chadderton and Foxdenton respectively.|$|E
