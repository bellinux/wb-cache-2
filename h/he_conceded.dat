He took four catches and conceded 17 byes as Australia won by eight wickets.|$|E
5|$|John Muir climbed Mount Rainier in 1888, and {{although}} he enjoyed the view, <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> that it was best appreciated from below. Muir {{was one of many}} who advocated protecting the mountain. In 1893, the area was set aside as part of the Pacific Forest Reserve in order to protect its physical and economic resources, primarily timber and watersheds.|$|E
5|$|Banksiamyces is {{classified}} in the Helotiaceae, a widespread but poorly known family of fungi, many species of which are saprobic on herbaceous or woody tissues. The placement in the Helotiaceae is tentative, and no molecular analysis has yet been performed that might clarify the phylogenetic relationships of Banksiamyces to other taxa in the Helotiales order. Based on physical similarity, Wen-Ying Zhuang included Banksiamyces under Encoelia in his 1998 study of the Encoelioideae subfamily of the Helotiaceae. <b>He</b> <b>conceded,</b> however, {{that he had not}} examined any specimens.|$|E

5|$|Between Tests, Australia played Northamptonshire and Yorkshire, and Tallon was rested {{for both}} matches. The first was won by an innings {{and the second}} was drawn. Saggers scored four against Northamptonshire and 22 against Yorkshire. After not making a {{dismissal}} against Northamptonshire, he took two catches and two stumpings in the latter match. <b>He</b> <b>conceded</b> 14 and 10 byes in the two matches respectively.|$|E
5|$|Given {{began the}} 2016–17 season as first choice 'keeper due to Butland being sidelined. On 27 August 2016, <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> an unfortunate own goal in a 1–0 away defeat to Everton. Given had palmed a Leighton Baines penalty onto the post but the ball rebounded against {{his head and}} went over the line. After conceding four goals against Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace in September, Given lost {{his place in the}} side to Lee Grant. He was {{released}} by Stoke {{at the end of the}} 2016–17 season.|$|E
5|$|Halcombe {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut during the 192627 season, playing four matches for South Australia. He made his debut against Queensland. He was unbeaten without scoring {{in his first}} innings as South Australia made 579. Halcombe then took 2/37 as Queensland made 251 and were forced to follow on. <b>He</b> <b>conceded</b> 58 runs without taking a wicket in the second innings, but his team nevertheless won by ten wickets.|$|E

5|$|Having {{graduated}} {{through the}} club's youth academy, Tomlinson made his senior debut for Crewe Alexandra in a Second Division clash with Oldham Athletic on 25 January 2003, replacing Danny Milosevic on 51 {{minutes after the}} Australian suffered an injury. <b>He</b> <b>conceded</b> a goal to Chris Armstrong after his view was obscured {{by a group of}} players, though Crewe ran out 3–1 winners at Boundary Park. At {{the end of the season}} he signed his first professional contract, and Crewe were promoted into the First Division as runners up in the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|He was {{subsequently}} dropped for the ODI series, playing {{in only one}} match in which <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> 67 runs without picking up a wicket in 8 overs. However, he did manage to post his first ODI half-century, scoring 64, defiantly holding up his end as India were bowled out for 213, sealing a 106-run loss. Greg Chappell became {{the coach of the}} Indian team following the Pakistan series and identified Pathan as a potential all-rounder. He started to hone Pathan's batting skills, which had up to this point yielded 275 Test runs at 19.64.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, George {{published}} a revised arrangement that placed B.attenuata in the subgenus Banksia {{because of its}} flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Cyrtostylis, a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. <b>He</b> <b>conceded</b> its large emarginate cotyledons (having a notch in their apex) were quite different from other members, {{and that it had}} similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member B.elegans. He felt B.attenuata to have affinities to B.lindleyana and B.media.|$|E

5000|$|Caruba {{was also}} {{critical}} of the United Nations, calling it the [...] "epicenter of modern Antisemitism" [...] and saying [...] "the UN {{has no right to}} exist", although <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> that without it Israel never would have become a legal state and country.|$|R
5|$|King John I {{accepted}} Ottoman suzerainty in 1529, {{but in the}} Treaty of Nagyvárad of 1538 <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> {{the right}} of the Habsburgs to succeed him after his death. At that point his voivodes, Stephen Majláth and Emeric Balassa, decided to separate Transylvania from the kingdom in order to save the province from an Ottoman invasion. Although other leading Transylvanian noblemen soon joined them, King John I overcame their rebellion in some weeks.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the tour}} was over, Weinberg {{said he would}} {{continue}} to appear with his various own bands, including doing weddings and bar and bat mitzvahs just as he had earlier in his career. He also liked to watch his son Jay play with Slipknot, although <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> he did so from a safe zone where he would not get knocked down by the audience.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{play for}} Northamptonshire, he was less effective. Hampered by a knee injury, which necessitated surgery after the English season, and {{suffering}} from many dropped catches, he took 50 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 26.14, but his performance compared unfavourably with other bowlers on the team. He was more effective in the NatWest Trophy, a one-day competition that Northamptonshire won that season, in which <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> fewer than two runs per over across five games.|$|E
5000|$|The Tchaikovsky biographer Dr. David Brown {{maintains}} that Galina's account [...] "contains much hearsay {{and a good}} deal that is romantically heightened."

5000|$|... "If I {{suffered}} an injury and couldn't play, I might act in another movie," [...] <b>he</b> <b>concedes.</b> [...] Glanzelius {{also stated that}} he does not care if he ever does another movie. [...] Nonetheless, his dream of being a soccer player was never fulfilled.|$|R

5|$|Southall {{applied for}} the vacant position, but Bobby Gould was chosen instead, who in turn named Southall and Ian Rush as his assistants. He tried Danny Coyne, Andy Marriott and Tony Roberts in goal in {{friendly}} games, but selected Southall for the World Cup qualifying wins over San Marino. A month away from his 39th birthday, he won his final cap against Turkey on 20 August 1997; the Turks won 6–4. Southall only played the first half as Gould blamed him for the three goals <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> – his replacement Paul Jones went on to concede three himself in the second half. His 92 Welsh caps are a national record, <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> 126 goals, {{for an average of}} 1.34 per match. The 1958 FIFA World Cup was the only time until {{the end of his career}} that Wales qualified for a major tournament and the British Home Championship was played for the final time in 1984, therefore the majority of Southall's caps came in friendlies or qualifying games.|$|E
5|$|With {{the signing}} of Danish goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard, Manchester United allowed Amos to join Oldham Athletic on loan for the {{remainder}} of the season on 7 January 2011, although he would continue to train with Manchester United once a week. He made his debut against Swindon Town the next day and kept a clean sheet. However, three days later, <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> all six goals in a 6–0 defeat at home to Southampton; he allowed Adam Lallana's 20-yard shot underneath his body for the second goal, and he was rounded by Lee Barnard for the sixth.|$|E
5|$|After {{appearing}} for Newcastle in pre-season against Darlington, Orlando City, Leeds United and Fiorentina, as well {{as being}} named among the substitutes for the opening match of the Premier League season against Arsenal, Forster rejoined Celtic, on loan {{for the remainder of the}} season, on 17 August 2011. He helped Celtic draw 0–0 against FC Sion at home, but then lost 3–1 in the away leg, only for UEFA to reinstate Celtic into the Europa League with 3–0 wins in both legs after Sion were found to be fielding ineligible players, thus allowing Forster to keep his only clean sheets in Europe for the season, as <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> in all the five group matches he played in.|$|E

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed {{to play for the}} hosts. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Johnson coming for Doug Ring. Tallon made two as Australia declared at 8/489. <b>He</b> <b>conceded</b> seven byes and did not make a dismissal as the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the highly}} {{productive}} lead-up, Davidson faltered {{in his first}} outing as Australia's Test spearhead. <b>He</b> <b>conceded</b> 1/115 in only 32 overs in the first innings as South Africa reached 9/470 in the First Test in Johannesburg. With Australia 102 behind on the first innings, Davidson's tour nearly ended. Unable {{to cope with the}} 10 pm curfew imposed by team manager Jack Norton, Davidson and roommate Les Favell absconded and went sightseeing. By the time they had returned, Norton had confiscated their keys and left them a note asking them to report. The pair then went to sleep at the home of some supporters who had hosted the team for dinner the previous day.|$|E
5|$|In April 1977 {{he went to}} play as a named superstar in the North American Soccer League (NASL) for Fort Lauderdale Strikers. The Strikers {{won their}} {{division}} in 1977, and Banks was named NASL Goalkeeper of the Year after <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> only 29 goals in 26 games – the best defensive record in the NASL. He also played one League of Ireland game for St Patrick's Athletic, keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 win over Shamrock Rovers at Richmond Park on 2 October 1977. He returned to Fort Lauderdale and played 11 games in the 1978 season.|$|E
