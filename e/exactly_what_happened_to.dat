5|$|In 2004, Nesbitt {{appeared}} in Wall of Silence, a fact-based drama about {{the aftermath of}} the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy's father, who tries to break down the wall of silence in the local community to discover <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> his son. He had only just completed Bloody Sunday when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the part because he found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe's fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe's South London speech, as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single-drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January 2004. The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year.|$|E

25|$|In {{the history}} of Myth, one {{particularly}} celebrated legend is that of Connacht, who, one thousand years ago, saved the world from a race of flesh-eating monsters called the Myrkridia, which had hunted humanity to near extinction over the previous millennium. Coming from the eastern land of Gower {{at the same time}} a comet appeared in the western skies, Connacht was the first human to fight the Myrkridia and survive. However, not only did he survive, he defeated them, ultimately imprisoning them in a magical prison known as the Tain, built for him by the Dwarven smiths of Muirthemne. With the Myrkridia gone, Connacht became Emperor of the Cath Bruig, presiding over a prosperous era known as the Age of Light. However, many years later, he disappeared from the historical records. It is unknown <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him, although one theory suggests he went in search of powerful magical artifacts, fearful of the ramifications if such items should fall into the wrong hands. Whatever the truth about his disappearance, Connacht was never seen again.|$|E
500|$|All of Stefan Hutchinson's Halloween {{comic books}} {{take place in}} the Halloween H20 timeline, which retconned Halloween 4–6 from continuity. Hutchinson {{comments}} that, while the retcon was unpopular with [...] "a lot of fans" [...] for ignoring previous movies, he preferred the [...] "simplicity of this storyline, over the needlessly convoluted mythology that the last two films had created". However, he admits that one of the downsides of the H20 timeline is that fans do not know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Dr. Sam Loomis after Halloween II. To remedy this, Hutchinson pitched Halloween: Sam as a way of paying tribute to the character. Written by Hutchinson and featuring illustrations from Autopsiss Marcus Smith, Sam is a prose short story available exclusively for download at the website HalloweenComics.com. It explores the life of Dr. Loomis, including his backstory and relationship with Elizabeth Worthington, a journalist he met during World War II. In 1995, Michael Myers visits the ailing Dr. Loomis in hospital, and murders Elizabeth in front of him. Loomis attempts to stop him, but dies of a coronary failure.|$|E
500|$|The Experiment is a pop rock album, {{featuring}} {{guitar and}} synth riffs, and incorporates elements of dance-pop, pop rap and power pop.

Rumble said that this was because he and Campbell made sure that the album [...] "sounded big [...] it could compete on the world stage". Thematically, The Experiment is [...] "about love, heartbreak, getting what he wants and knowing he is in charge of his own destiny", although [...] "Let You Down" [...] is [...] "quite dark and weighty". Many of the song's discuss Rumble's own life experiences; some are reflective while others [...] "just try to get other people enthused about what they're doing with their lives".

[...] Indeed this is <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> many of them, and in this respect La Grotte's chansons are like the later air de cour, which featured a voice accompanied by a lute.

2500|$|... "Spotty Powder" [...] {{was first}} {{published}} as a short story in 1973. In 2005, The Times reprinted [...] "Spotty Powder" [...] as a [...] "lost" [...] chapter, saying it {{had been found in}} Dahl's desk, written backwards in mirror writing (the way Leonardo da Vinci wrote his journal). This chapter describes Spotty Powder, which looks and tastes like sugar, but causes bright red pox-like spots to appear on faces and necks five seconds after ingestion, so children who eat Spotty Powder do not have to go to school. The spots fade on their own a few hours later. After learning the purpose of Spotty Powder, the humourless, smug Miranda Piker and her equally humourless father (a schoolmaster) are enraged and disappear into the Spotty Powder room to sabotage the machine. Soon after entering, they are heard making what Mrs Piker interpreted as screams. Mr Wonka assures her (after making a brief joke where he claims that headmasters are one of the occasional ingredients) it was only laughter. <b>Exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> them is not revealed in the extract.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Consumers are {{becoming}} acutely {{attentive to the}} factors that influence food safety and food wholesomeness. The food industry is well regulated, yet there is still illness that results from contaminated fresh food products. Recent food contamination outbreaks and concerns with how food is grown have created an almost hypersensitive food consumer. The TempTime Corporation is a leading international manufacturer in time-temperature sensitive indicators for fresh food products. This company’s aim is to provide consumers with more information about <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> their product from the initial packaging of the product to the time of consumption. Their product, called Fresh-Check®, {{is about the size of}} a postage stamp, and is affixed to the outer packaging of fresh food products. It is used in conjunction with the use-by-date to ensure a safe and fresh product. This paper focuses on consumer perceptions of the Fresh-Check indicator in Belgium. We employed the contingent valuation survey method to capture Belgian consumer’s overall perception, willingness to pay, preference, and acceptance for Temp-Time’s Fresh-Check ® indicator on fresh food products...|$|R

6000|$|... "I ordered my mahowt to keep {{near one}} of the noosemen, whom I knew to be expert {{in the use of the}} giant-lasso. His name was Ramjee. Both Ramjee and his driver were {{screaming}} and yelling at the pitch of their voices, and the latter was applying his mungri with tremendous energy. The elephant they were after was a small female. It is always necessary that the chasing elephant should be much heavier than the one chased, else evil results follow, as we soon found. Presently the khedda elephant was alongside. Ramjee lifted the great loop in both hands, and leaned over till he almost touched the wild animal. Frequently this noosing fails from various reasons. For one thing, the wild creatures are often very clever at evading the noose: sometimes they push it away with their trunks; occasionally they step right through it, and now and then get only half through it, so that it forms a sort of tow rope, and the other end of this rope being made fast to the neck of the tame elephant, the wild one drags it along violently, unless the tame one is much heavier than itself. This is <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Ramjee. He dropped the noose beautifully over the creature's head, but before it could be hauled tight--which was accomplished by checking the tame animal--the active creature had got its forelegs through. The loop caught, however, on its hind quarters, and away it went, dragging the tame elephant after it, Ramjee shrieking wildly for help. Two of the other tame elephants, not yet engaged, were sent to his assistance. These easily threw two more nooses over the wild creature, and, after a good run, she was finally exhausted, secured with ropes, and driven back to camp, there to be subjected to coercive treatment until she should become tame.|$|E
60|$|This is <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> a bold sailor called Bjarne, {{the son of}} Herjulf, a {{few years}} after the Greenland colony was founded. In 986 he put out from Iceland to join his father, who was in Greenland, the purpose being that, after the good old Norse custom, they might drink their Christmas ale together. Neither Bjarne nor his men had ever sailed the Greenland sea before, but, like bold mariners, they relied upon their {{seafaring}} instinct to guide them to its coast. As Bjarne's ship was driven westward, great mists fell upon the face of the waters. There was neither sun nor stars, but day after day only the thick wet fog that clung to the cold surface of the heaving sea. To-day travellers even on a palatial steamship, who spend a few hours shuddering in the chill grey fog of the North Atlantic, chafing at delay, may form some idea of voyages such as that of Bjarne Herjulf and his men. These Vikings went on undaunted towards the west. At last, after many days, they saw land, but when they drew near they saw {{that it was not a}} rugged treeless region, such as they knew Greenland to be, but a country covered with forests, a country of low coasts rising inland to small hills, and with no mountains in sight. Accordingly, Bjarne said that this was not Greenland, and he would not stop, but turned the vessel to the north. After two days they sighted land again, still on the left side, and again it was flat and thick with trees. The sea had fallen calm, and Bjarne's men desired to land and see this new country, and take wood and water into the ship. But Bjarne would not. So they held on their course, and presently a wind from the south-west carried them onward for three days and three nights. Then again they saw land, but this time it was high and mountainous, with great shining caps of snow. And again Bjarne said, 'This is not the land I seek.' They did not go ashore, but sailing close to the coast they presently found that the land was an island. When they stood out to sea again, the south wind rose to a gale that swept them towards the north, with sail reefed down and with their ship leaping through the foaming surges. Three days and nights they ran before the gale. On the fourth day land rose before them, and this time it was Greenland. There Bjarne found his father, and there, when not at sea, he settled for the rest of his days.|$|E
