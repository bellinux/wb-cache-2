40|$|Issue: Practical rubber {{compounds}} {{require the}} incorporation of petroleum oils and plasticizers to make them processable. Best Practice: Rubber polymers are high viscosity liquids. Inorganic fillers and carbon black are added to reinforce the rubber polymer. This increases the viscosity even further. To reduce the viscosity, improve processing and flow and reduce cost softeners (oils and plasticizers) {{are added to the}} rubber compound. Almost all rubber compounds are softened. Levels used vary from 5 - 10 phr for high performance treads like aircraft and off the road tires to several hundred phr in highly oil extended EPDM hose and <b>extruded</b> <b>goods.</b> Plasticizing oils are arbitrarily divided into aliphatic, napththenic, and aromatic classes. The most widely used class is the aromatic oil. It is commonly added to passenger and truck tire treads, carcasses, and sidewalls as well as other components. Napththenic oils are added to white sidewalls and other components requiring non-staining properties. The recent trend in lowering the low rolling resistance of passenger tires has resulted in more napththenic oil being used in treads and carcasses. It should be noted that in the recycled rubber material, there is a residual oil from the original compounds in tires and non-tire products. A small amount of oil may volatize in service. However most of it is stil...|$|E

40|$|Crosslinked {{polyethylene}} (XLPE) {{remains the}} material of choice for modern high voltage <b>extruded</b> cables possessing <b>good</b> thermal stability and excellent electrical properties. However, increasing pressure to limit the environmental effects of human activity and to promote recycling has forced researchers to look to new materials to replace XLPE in the medium to long term. Recently, a number of propylene based systems have been developed through copolymerization with novel catalyst systems which may offer novel alternatives to polyethylene. Such systems offer higher operating temperatures together with potentially desirable thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. In this paper we report {{on a range of}} propylene based materials and assess their suitability for cable applications through the use of thermal, mechanical and electrical testing.

40|$|Abstract. Copper has {{widespread}} use as engineering material, {{because of its}} structural and functional properties, notably high thermal and electrical conductivity. A major drawback of this base metal and its alloys is a relatively low hardness. This precludes its utilization in applications in which both high conductivity and high strength/hardness are needed, e. g. in injection moulds for plastics. Nanostructured metals and nanocomposites are ways to address the low hardness problem, provided the nanostructured material is thermally stable during processing and service. In the present research, composite powders, with 5 to 30 at % nanodiamond, were consolidated into bulk samples. The copper-nanodiamond composite powders were vacuum encapsulated and extruded at 600 ºC. A {{significant proportion of the}} initial hardness in the powders is retained after extrusion. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the <b>extruded</b> material indicates <b>good</b> bonding between the nanodiamond particles and the copper matrix. Raman spectroscopy on the consolidated samples evidences the presence of graphite, possibly due to partial disintegration of ultradisperse nanodiamond agglomerates...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the broad}} {{acceptance}} of sour cassava starch biscuits in Brazil and the nutritional quality of quinoa flour, this study aimed {{to evaluate the}} effect of extrusion temperature, screw speed, moisture, and amount of quinoa flour on the physical properties of puffed snacks. Extrusion process was carried out using a single-screw extruder in a factorial central composite design with four factors. Effects of moisture and amount of quinoa flour on the expansion index and specific volume of snacks were observed. There was a pronounced increase in water solubility index of blends with the extrusion process with significant effects of all process parameters on the WSI. Higher water absorption index (WAI) was observed under high temperature, low moisture, and lower quinoa flour amount. Temperature and amount of quinoa flour influenced {{the color of the}} snacks. A positive quadratic effect of quinoa flour on hardness of products was observed. Blends of sour cassava starch and quinoa flour have good potential for use as raw material in production of <b>extruded</b> snacks with <b>good</b> physical properties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, many {{researchers}} {{are involved in}} studies aimed to the explanation of some peculiar aspects regarding manufacturing processes. In this paper, an experimental campaign {{was carried out in}} order to reproduce tube extrusion starting from a cylindrical billet. In particular, the development of a proper equipment is presented: the aim was to measure both the total load, by using the testing machine load cell, and the local pressure value on the porthole. The latter task was carried out performing a proper system based on the use of a small load-cell. The tube was <b>extruded</b> with a <b>good</b> surface quality and the external area does not show any welding line evidence. Pure Lead was used for the experimental analysis; this material was chosen due to its high ductility which allows to carry out the process at room temperature. The material was characterized by compression tests at different strain rates and the obtained material law was used to perform a numerical analysis using SFTC Deform 3 D numerical code. The Numerical analysis was carried out to show both the advantages and drawbacks of the modern FE codes when extrusion processes are investigated...|$|R
40|$|Although Brazil is {{a country}} of {{tradition}} in both the production and consumption of coffee, {{the most of the}} coffee is consumed as a beverage, which reduces greatly the competitiveness on international market, for reducing the chances of supplying the product under other forms of consumption. Owing to that, the aim of this study was developing a precooked mixed flour containing coffee powder and rice for use in coffee flavored products. Mixtures of rice and coffee in the proportions of 900 : 100, 850 : 150 and 800 : 200 g, respectively, were processed in a single screw extruder (Brabender DS- 20, Duisburg, German) and the effect of the extrusion process on the variables moisture content (16 %, 18 % and 20 %) and temperature in the third extruding zone (140 °C, 160 °C and 180 °C) was studied. The results for expansion index ranged from 2. 91 to 11. 11 mm in diameter; the water absorption index from 4. 59 to 6. 33 g gel/g sample and the water solubility index varied from 4. 05 % to 8. 57 %. These results showed that, despite coffee powder influenced the variables studied, the expanded product after milling resulted in a <b>extruded</b> mixture with <b>good</b> absorption and water solubility indices, which favors the use of the precooked mixed flour for human consumption...|$|R
40|$|Extruded Mg- 1 Mn- 2 Zn-xNd alloys (x = 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 mass %) {{have been}} {{developed}} for their potential use as biomaterials. The extrusion on the alloys was performed at temperature of 623 K with an extrusion ratio of 14. 7 under an average extrusion speed of 4 mm/s. The microstructure, mechanical property, corrosion behavior and biocompatibility of the extruded Mg-Mn-Zn-Nd alloys have been investigated in this study. The microstructure was examined using X-ray diffraction analysis and optical microscopy. The mechanical properties were determined from uniaxial tensile and compressive tests. The corrosion behavior was investigated using electrochemical measurement. The biocompatibility was evaluated using osteoblast-like SaOS 2 cells. The experimental results indicate that all extruded Mg- 1 Mn- 2 Zn-xNd alloys are composed of both α phase of Mg and a compound of Mg 7 Zn 3 with very fine microstructures, and show good ductility and much higher mechanical strength than that of cast pure Mg and natural bone. The tensile strength and elongation of the extruded alloys increase with an increase in neodymium content. Their compressive strength does not change significantly with an increase in neodymium content. The <b>extruded</b> alloys show <b>good</b> biocompatibility and much higher corrosion resistance than that of cast pure Mg. The extruded Mg- 1 Mn- 2 Zn- 1. 0 Nd alloy shows a great potential for biomedical applications due to the combination of enhanced mechanical properties, high corrosion resistance and good biocompatibility...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{considered the}} production of improved stabilized lateritic Bricks (ISLB) with enhanced mechanical properties. The research data were derived from laboratory experiments which include capillary test, erosion test, abrasion test, density test and compressive strength test. Three batches of 290 mm x 140 mm x 100 mm brick samples were produced which are: the Adobe Unstabilized Lateritic Bricks (AULB), Improved Stabilized Lateritic Brick (ISLB) and the Control Stabilized Lateritic Bricks (CSLB). Brick stabilization was maintained at 5 % by weight of cement. Compaction of the bricks were carried out manually; the moulded bricks were carefully <b>extruded</b> in <b>good</b> shape and placed on clean, hard flat surface to allowed to dry under normal atmospheric temperature and pressure. The ISLB was divided into four groups of 12 bricks samples immersed in solution of zycosil and water in the following proportion by volume: (1 : 100),(1 : 200),(1 : 300) and (1 : 400) for 30 minutes and dried under normal atmospheric temperature and pressure before curing commenced. The result of the capillary test on bricks samples after 24 hours showed that AULB and CSLB has (0. 35 and 0. 15) kg weight difference equivalent of (0. 00599 and 0. 00256) kg/m 2 /min suction rate while the ISLB have 0. 05 kg weight difference equivalent to 0. 000855 kg/m 2 /min suction rate. The result of erosion test for brick durability ranked between very firm for ISLB of 1 : 100, 1 : 200 and 1 : 300 Zycosil Water Solution (ZWS), firm for ISLB of 1 : 400 ZWS; firm for CSLB and loose for AULB. The abrasion test result showed that the ISLB have abrasion value of (1, 2, 2 and 2) % while the CSLB and AULB have (3 and 12) % abrasion value. The density of ISLB are (1933. 50, 1921. 18, 1916. 26 and 1908. 87) kgm- 3 at 28 days while the density of CSLB and AULB were (1926. 11 and 1800. 49) kgm- 3. Density results conform to minimum specification requirement for lateritic bricks of bulk density of 1810 kgm- 3 as recommended by the Nigeria Building and Road Research Institute (NBRRI). Compressive strength test for the ISLB are (3. 16, 3. 10, 3. 07 and 3. 08) Nmm- 2 at 28 days while the compressive strength test for CSLB and AULB stood at (3. 15 and 2. 41) Nm- 2 which conforms to NBRRI recommended value of compressive strength ranges of (3 to 3. 5) Nmm- 2 at 5 % stabilization level. It was concluded that the mechanical properties of improved stabilized lateritic brick are better than CSLB and AULB in terms of capillary rise, erosion, abrasion, density and compressive strength...|$|R
