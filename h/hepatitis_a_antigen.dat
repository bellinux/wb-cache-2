40|$|To compare {{serological}} tests for antibody to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>antigen</b> (anti-HA), we tested 15 paired serum specimens, submitted under code, from individuals {{infected with the}} MS- 1 strain of hepatitis A virus. Immune electron microscopy (IEM), immune adherence hemagglutination (IAHA), and solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) tests for anti-HA were performed with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>antigen</b> (HA Ag) derived from human stool; results were also compared with previously reported titers determined by IAHA with HA Ag derived from marmoset liver. Antibody titers (IAHA and RIA) and ratings (IEM) determined with stool-derived HA Ag compared favorably, and a seroresponse to HA Ag was detected by all three methods for every serum pair tested. Differences in titers were noted between IAHA tests with liver-derived and with stool-derived HA Ag, but the discrepancies could {{be accounted for by}} differences in test technique.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of parenterally transmitted hepatitis was probably first recorded in 1885 by Lurman who reported {{the occurrence of}} jaundice among personnel of a Bremen factory after revaccination against smallpox. Of 1289 individuals vaccinated in one day, 191 developed jaundice 2 to 8 months after administration of glycerinated human lymph preparations. The illness usually began with fatigue,anorexia and gastrointestinal complaints followed by jaundice and often pruritus; it generally lasted a total of 4 to 6 weeks. Personnel vaccinated on another day with another vaccine preparation {{as well as those}} who left the job before revaccination were not affected, Comparison of the water supply, domicile, alcohol abuse and vaccine exposure indicated the latter as the probable cause of the outbreak (1, 2, 3). In 1945 MacCallum postulated that, on the basis of differences in incubation period and mode of transmission, two different agents cause hepatitis: <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> and <b>hepatitis</b> B. He was not able to isolate the infectious agents (4). In 1967 Krugman and Giles confirmed the existence of two types of hepatitis:one with a short and one with a long incubation period (5). In 1965 Blumberg had already discovered <b>an</b> <b>antigen</b> in the serum of an Australian aboriginal which he called 'Australia antigen' (6). In 1968 Prince identified <b>an</b> <b>antigen</b> in the serum of patients with post-transfusion <b>hepatitis,</b> <b>an</b> <b>antigen</b> which he called SH antigen (7). The antigens discovered by Blumberg and Prince were found to be identical and represent the hepatitis B surface antigen. Between 1968 and 1973 the other principal viral antigens <HBeAg,HBcAg) and their antibodies were identified (8, 9). The electron microscopy features of the virus were described by Dane in 1970. In the blood of infected patients the large complete virus particle (diameter 42 nm), small 22 nm spherical surface antigen particles and tubular forms (length 100 nm,diameter 22 nm) were found (10). Infection with the hepatitis B virus is characterized not only by production of infectious complete virus particles (Dane particles) but also by an enhanced production of incomplete viral particles made up entirely of HBsAg without HBcAg, DNA-polymerase activity or HBV-DN...|$|R

40|$|Resulting {{directly}} from the discovery of virus-related antigens, rapid progress has marked {{the last decade of}} viral hepatitis research.

40|$|A set of {{precipitin}} reactions {{was performed}} by immune electron microscopy (IEM) with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>antigen</b> (HA Ag) and varying quantities of antibody to HA A q (anti-HA).

These data, together with a highly significant correlation between IEM ratings and immune adherence hemagglutination (IAHA) titers on 92 coded serum samples, confirm that quantitative serology development can be performed by IEM. To demonstrate the different kinetics of antibody development by IEM and IAHA, we used both techniques to test for anti-HA in longitudinally collected sera from a chimpanzee experimentally infected with hepatitis A virus. Detection of anti-HA was possible by IEM during acute hepatitis, but IAHA anti-HA was not observed until approximately 4 weeks later.

40|$|The marked {{increase}} in the total serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) is a characteristic feature of acute hepatitis A. To study {{the nature of this}} IgM, we assayed serial titers of IgM antibodies against various antigens during and after acute hepatitis A.

Two control groups of patients with chronic hepatitis B (control B group) or C (control C group) were also chosen. All control groups were pair-matched by age and sex with the corresponding case group. Results. Fulminant <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> was never observed, and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> had a severe course in 1 patient in the case B group and in 1 patient in the control A group.

The HA Ag was detected for 4 to 5 weeks; the last IF-positive biopsy was obtained after SGPT activity had returned to normal. In the two other chimpanzees, HA Ag could be detected only in the biopsy taken at the time of SGPT elevation.

We amplified β-chain TCR transcripts by nonpalindromic adaptor (NPA) -PCR–Vβ-specific PCR. TCR transcripts from only five Vβ families (Vβ 13, Vβ 3, Vβ 17, Vβ 8, and Vβ 20) were detected in CSF. The amplified products were combined, cloned, and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed in the CSF substantial proportions of identical β-chain of TCR transcripts, demonstrating oligoclonal populations of T cells. Seventeen of 35 (48 %) transcripts were 100 % identical, demonstrating a major Vβ 13. 3 Dβ 2. 1 Jβ 1. 3 clonal expansion. Six of 35 (17 %) transcripts were also 100 % identical, revealing a second Vβ 13 clonal expansion (Vβ 13. 1 Dβ 2. 1 Jβ 1. 2). Clonal expansions were also found within the Vβ 3 family (transcript Vβ 3. 1 Dβ 2. 1 Jβ 1. 5 accounted for 5 of 35 transcripts [14 %]) and within the Vβ 20 family (transcript Vβ 20. 1 Dβ 1. 1 Jβ 2. 4 accounted for 3 of 35 transcripts [8 %]).

It could be shown {{that the majority of the}} hepatitis A-associated particles band at 1. 34 g/ml in CsCl and, like poliovirus, sediment at about 160 S. In addition, a distinct <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>antigen</b> was observed, which banded at 1. 305 g/ml and sedimented between 50 and 90 S. A further component accumulated in the density range of between 1. 38 and 1. 44 g/ml. However, it seemed to be rather labile. Upon reisolation from CsCl and sedimentation in sucrose, it resolved into a 160 S, a 90 to 100 S, and a 50 S form. The size of the 160 S particles (27 to 29 nm) could be readily distinguished from that of the parvovirus (22 to 24 nm). It is concluded, therefore, that hepatitis A-associated virus particles are more likely to be classified with the picornaviruses than with the parvoviruses...|$|E
40|$|Immunopotentiating reconstituted {{influenza}} virosomes (IRIV) are 150 -nm proteoliposomes {{composed of}} influenza surface glycoproteins and {{a mixture of}} natural and synthetic phospholipids. Due to size, structure and composition of the IRIVs, they serve as an antigen carrier system for efficacious vaccination, as was demonstrated for hepatitis A and influenza. This paper reviews the unique properties of IRIVs and describes the in vivo biodistribution of model antigens using 14 C-labeled IRIVs and 125 I-labeled streptavidin. IRIV formulated streptavidin induced a strong depot effect after intra muscular (i. m.) vaccination of mice, whereas soluble streptavidin was soon eliminated via the kidney of the animals. A mixture of antigen and IRIVs yielded higher antibody titers after i. m. inoculation than streptavidin alone. The highest immunostimulation was achieved by the binding of the antigen to the investigated adjuvant. The potential penetration of inactivated hepatitis A virions into lipid membranes was assessed by measuring the area increase of a lipid monolayer kept at a constant surface pressure corresponding to that of lipid bilayer vesicles. The monolayers were composed of phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) (75 / 25 mol/mol), thus resembling the lipid composition of the IRIV. The results suggested that the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>antigen</b> may spontaneously bind to the reconstituted IRIV membranes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> {{virus is}} a member of the Picornaviridae family and is a {{principal}} agent of acute hepatitis worldwide, causing from mild to severe illness. Although the incidence of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> is in decline, the risk of this disease is still high in the Mediterranean area. Detection of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> in the environment is difficult because this virus needs a prolonged incubation in cell culture, therefore we used <b>an</b> <b>antigen</b> capture PCR (AC-PCR) followed by a hybridization on membrane to identify HAV in wastewater samples. The raw sewage, concentrated by ultrafiltration, showed 8 positive samples out of 10 (80 %), while after the oxidation step of the sewage, 2 out of 10 (20 %) and 3 out of 10 (30 %) were found positive respectively after concentration by electronegative (HAWP Millipore) and electropositive (1 MDS Cuno-Div.) membranes. In the final effluent the positivity was 1 out of 10 (10 %) for the electronegative membranes and 3 out of 10 (30 %) for the electropositive membranes. Our results indicate: i) the possibility of HAV to cross the wastewater treatment plant and contaminate water and food (such as mussels); ii) PCR-hybridization as a rapid method for HAV identification in the environment...|$|R
