These inference engines support <b>forward</b> <b>reasoning</b> or {{backward reasoning}} to infer conclusions via modus ponens. The recursive reasoning methods they employ are termed ‘forward chaining’ and ‘backward chaining’, respectively. Although reasoning systems widely support deductive inference, some systems employ abductive, inductive, defeasible {{and other types}} of reasoning. Heuristics may also be employed to determine acceptable solutions to intractable problems.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a novel understanding of delays in reaching agreements {{based on the}} idea of strategic uncertainty—i. e., the idea that a Bargainer may face uncertainty about her opponent’s play, even if there is no uncertainty about the structure of the game. It considers a particular form of strategic uncertainty, called on path strategic certainty. On path strategic certainty is the assumption that strategic uncertainty can only arise after surprise moves in the negotiation process. The paper shows that Bargainers who engage in <b>forward</b> induction <b>reasoning</b> can face strategic uncertainty after surprise moves. Moreover, rational Bargainers who engage in <b>forward</b> induction <b>reasoning</b> and satisfy on path strategic certainty may experience delays in reaching agreements, even if they engage in <b>forward</b> induction <b>reasoning.</b> The paper goes on to characterize the behavioral implications of rationality, <b>forward</b> induction <b>reasoning,</b> and on path strategic certainty. Bargaining is an important feature of many economic and political phenomena. Understanding how negotiators form agreements is instrumental to understanding employment contracts, legislative outcomes, sovereign debt, etc. In each of these applications, we observe an importan...|$|R

A map indicates the facility has been mostly cleared by evacuating personnel during {{the beginning of the}} Great Dark, but two areas of interest are not marked as cleared: the garage, and the chron-jump section. This last part attracts Doc Tanner's attention: [...] "chron-jump" [...] was the name given to the government department responsible for [...] "trawling" [...] him forward in time from 1896. The companions agree to investigate the section. When they arrive they find it still functional, prepared to execute a trawling of three targets from just scant weeks before the beginning of the Great Dark. The companions decide to make an attempt to bring the targets <b>forward,</b> <b>reasoning</b> that it may save people who would otherwise die in the nuclear holocaust. The first attempt is unsuccessful, producing an unpleasant collection of disconnected body parts and gore. The second target arrives intact and alive, but curiously she is bound in a straitjacket. Careful examination of the information on the computer reveals that she is a clinically insane mass murderer, convicted of torturing, castrating, and murdering dozens of young boys. Disgusted, Ryan kills her with a shot to the head. The third trawling attempt is successful as well, bringing forward a 19-year-old man named Michael, a member of an isolated Christian monastic order who has been trained in the fictional martial art of Tao-Tain-Do. Brother Michael is skeptical of the story the companions tell him, but accepts that his situation is beyond his control. Reluctantly, he follows them.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{strategies}} in reasoning about mental states of others, {{a process that}} requires theory of mind. It {{is a first step}} in studying the cognitive basis of such reasoning, as strategies affect tradeoffs between cognitive resources. Participants were presented with a two-player game that required reasoning about the mental states of the opponent. Game theory literature discerns two candidate strategies that participants could use in this game: either <b>forward</b> <b>reasoning</b> or backward reasoning. <b>Forward</b> <b>reasoning</b> proceeds from the first decision point to the last, whereas backward reasoning proceeds in the opposite direction. Backward reasoning is the only optimal strategy, because the optimal outcome is known at each decision point. Nevertheless, we argue that participants prefer <b>forward</b> <b>reasoning</b> because it is similar to causal reasoning. Causal reasoning, in turn, is prevalent in human reasoning. Eye movements were measured to discern between forward and backward progressions of fixations. The observed fixation sequences corresponded best with <b>forward</b> <b>reasoning.</b> Early in games, the probability of observing a forward progression of fixations is higher than the probability of observing a backward progression. Later in games, the probabilities of forward and backward progressions are similar, which seems to imply that participants were either applying backward reasoning or jumping back to previous decision points while applying <b>forward</b> <b>reasoning.</b> Thus, the game-theoretical favorite strategy, backward reasoning, does seem to exist in human reasoning. However, participants preferred the more familiar, practiced, and prevalent strategy: <b>forward</b> <b>reasoning.</b> © 2012 Meijering et al...|$|E

40|$|A compilative {{approach}} for <b>forward</b> <b>reasoning</b> of horn rules in Prolog is presented. Pure horn rules - given as Prolog clauses - {{are to be}} used for forward and backward reasoning. These rules are translated into Prolog clauses, denoting one <b>forward</b> <b>reasoning</b> step. Forward chaining is triggered by an initial fact, from which the consequences are derived. Premises of forward rules are verified by Prolog 2 ̆ 7 s backward proof procedure using the original clauses. Thus, without any changes to the Prolog interpreter integrated bidirectional reasoning of the original horn rules is possible. Breadth-first and depth-first reasoning strategies with enumeration and collection of conclusions are implemented. In order to translate forward clauses into WAM operations several improvements are introduced. To avoid inefficient changes of program code derived facts are recorded in a special storage area called retain stack. Subsumption of a new conclusion by previously derived facts is tested by a built-in procedure.

We combine this with <b>forward</b> <b>reasoning</b> in a bidirectional two-filter approach.
