5000|$|Also in 1929, {{flying out}} of Metropolitan Airport (now Van Nuys Airport) in Los Angeles, she and Bobbi Trout (who functioned as co-pilot) set the first {{official}} women's record for endurance with mid-air refueling. They were aloft 42½ hours in a Sunbeam biplane powered by a 300-horsepower J-6 Wright engine. Smith did the contact flying while Trout handled the fueling hoses. Their refueling craft, a Curtiss Pigeon with a Liberty L-12 engine, was piloted by Paul Whittier with Pete Reinhart handling the hose. Smith and Trout were hoping for a record of at least 100 hours, and shooting for 164 hours (nearly a week), {{but this was not}} to be. The two craft were not terribly well suited to the task at hand. The Pigeon was chosen for its large cargo capacity to carry fuel, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>outdated</b> aircraft with a temperamental engine for which spare parts were not easily obtained. In refueling position, the Pigeon's pilot could not see the Sunbeam at all, so {{there was no way to}} signal about any engine problems that would mean sudden loss of altitude. The Sunbeam was not a notably stable aircraft; in Smith's words, [...] "it had to be flown every single minute with the concentration of a test flight." [...] Furthermore, the two craft were mismatched in terms of velocity: whenever they were refueling, the Pigeon had to fly near its top speed while the Sunbeam slowed down to just above its stalling speed.|$|E

National and international (WHO, CLSI) guidelines recommend that the order of draw of blood during phlebotomy should be blood culture/sterile tubes, then plain tubes/gel tubes, then tubes containing additives.

40|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century the {{understanding}} of society was that the rights of the state to survive outweighed the rights of the individual. This communitarian understanding was reflected in military tactics such as the sacrifice of soldiers through the extensive use of trench warfare in the battle of the Somme in 1916. Over the past century there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> shift in the understanding of society to the point where there is much more of a focus on the rights of individuals. Trench warfare tactics would be inconceivable for military commanders in 2016, where remote warfare tactics, such as the use of drones, <b>are</b> utilised in <b>an</b> attempt to reduce the number of casualties amongst soldiers. The justification for the duty to obey all orders has previously been that the rights of the state to survive outweigh the rights of individual soldiers. Given the shift in the understanding of society with regards to the importance of the individual vis-à-vis the rights of the state, the question this thesis examines, is “Does the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have a compelling justification for the duty to obey orders”? An examination of the “unlimited liability contract” is conducted in order to discern whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>outdated</b> historical understanding of unrestricted service and the duty to obey orders in the ADF. After dismissing the position of Michael Walzer of soldiers as being mere servants of the state, a novel understanding of soldiers as supra civis, that is super citizens, who willingly take on the extra responsibilities of citizenship, is proposed. Further justifications given by the ADF in regards to the duty to obey orders are also examined. Five potential options for how the ADF may understand the duty to obey orders are also analysed. In order to gain a deeper understanding of these options the F- 111 deseal/reseal case study is examined in light of each of the five potential options. Finally, a recommendation for how the ADF might understand the doctrine of the duty to obey orders is given...|$|R

In this Article, I argue that this perception <b>is</b> inaccurate. First, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> based on <b>an</b> <b>outdated</b> data set, primarily damages cases from the 1990 s. More recent plaintiffs have been comparatively more successful in establishing civil liability. Second, the published assessments focus on too-limited data set.

Legal sanctions have also included licensure discipline and other administrative sanctions. In short, the legal risks of providing unwanted life-sustaining treatment are not as rare, meager, and inconsequential as often depicted. In fact, sanctions for administering unwanted treatment are significant and growing. The right to refuse life-sustaining treatment has been established for decades. But, as with many principles in bioethics, like the related doctrine of informed consent, there remains a wide chasm between legal and ethical principles, on the one hand, and the reality of clinical practice, on the other. In contrast to other commentators, I have aimed to establish that the prospect for enforcement and protection of patient rights is not as dismal as commentators often depict.

Already back in the 1800 s, there were rules in the so-called Lego Charter concerning protection of workers, mainly servants.

These agreements were the order of priority clauses had to intend to ensure employees' working lives. Exceptions {{had to be done}} by ensuring that individual employees' dependents.  In 1974 the Act on employment entry and had intended to protect older workers. The case The rules of this law was entrusted to this dispositive which was forced to adapt to different conditions in different branches.

40|$|Throughout {{many years}} of systems {{engineering}} development, a plethora of research has <b>been</b> conducted in <b>an</b> academia regarding legacy systems and legacy modernization. Their works have been resulted in papers, journals, and other products. According to some authors, legacy systems can <b>be</b> defined as <b>a</b> complex and critical system that work well, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> developed with <b>an</b> <b>outdated</b> technology (software and hardware). They resist of modification and evolution, difficult to understand, and there is scarcity of experts/knowledge, and are inflexible towards new business requirements. The reports from the academic field clearly indicate the legacy systems as the systems that bring difficulties. The problems such as difficult to maintain, limited supplier/vendor, lack of experts/knowledge and integration issues are common in legacy systems. In addition, the old system also has their lifetime {{and at some point}} they cannot be expanded anymore. Hence, there is momentum to modernize legacy systems in order to support organizations’ business requirements. From industrial perspective, business requirements are also evolving and they need more flexible, robust, and agile systems. Organizations cannot depend on their old systems any longer since they are difficult to maintain and the knowledge around <b>it</b> <b>are</b> diminishing. The problems mentioned above are having serious impact on the organization and hence, contributing towards higher maintenance costs. However, many multinational organizations now are still running their business in their legacy systems for so many reasons. A survey in 2008 in the United States revealed that more than 50 % of their <b>IT</b> systems <b>are</b> classified as legacy systems. Furthermore, Gartner Group in 1997 reported that 80 % of the world's business ran on COBOL with over 200 billion lines of code in existence and with an estimated 5 billion lines of new code annually. In addition, the TIOBE index also reports that COBOL {{as one of the most}} popular languages ever used. Based on this fact, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> clear that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> different way of perceiving the legacy systems in academia and in industry. Therefore, this research aims at finding the different perception of legacy systems between academia and industry. The Grounded Theory method has been used to interview legacy experts from the industry and the results were validated through survey with 104 participants through online surveys during 3, 5 weeks. The study revealed that the legacy systems are not merely about IT, but also involve business and organization aspect. Academies tend to see the legacy systems from a technical point of view which leads to bad impression of the systems. However, professional in the industry see the legacy system more from the business value of the system. Consequently, problems from the technical side of the legacy systems are not really the problems for professionals in industry unless the problems disturb their business process...|$|R
