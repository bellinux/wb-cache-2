5|$|Functional {{genomics}} using RNAi is {{a particularly}} attractive technique for genomic mapping and annotation in plants because many plants are polyploid, which presents substantial challenges for more traditional genetic engineering methods. For example, RNAi has been successfully used for functional genomics studies in bread wheat (which is <b>hexaploid)</b> {{as well as more}} common plant model systems Arabidopsis and maize.|$|E
5|$|Plant Hybridization is more commonplace {{compared}} to animal hybridization. Many crop species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid wheats: some have {{four sets of}} chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (<b>hexaploid),</b> while other wheat species have (like most eukaryotic organisms) two sets (diploid), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as Triticale, × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a <b>hexaploid</b> hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) and grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} London plane (Platanus × acerifolia). Among many natural plant hybrids is Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division, and Oenothera lamarckiana, a flower that {{was the subject of}} important experiments by Hugo de Vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy.|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} cytogenetic {{study was}} undertaken across a contact zone between Themeda triandra {{populations in the}} Transvaal Bushveld {{to the north of}} the Magaliesberg, and Highveld populations to the south. Fifteen collection points were chosen and three plants collected at each point. The northern-most collection point contained only tetraploids and those on the Highveld only <b>hexaploids.</b> In the vicinity of the Magaliesberg Mountain range, contact between the tetraploids and <b>hexaploids</b> produced pentaploid and decaploid hybrids. Meiotic pairing association analyses showed that both the tetraploids and <b>hexaploids</b> formed apomictic clones, of which some were widely distributed and others were more limited. This indicates that facultative apomixis occurs among both the tetra- and <b>hexaploids</b> and gives rise to genotypic and genomic segregants thus producing variation and forming new apomictic clones. The possible evolution of Themeda triandra in southern Africa is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} make a survey of the {{distribution}} of polyploids in Aster age-ratoides subsp. leiophyllus var. leiophyllus in the Kanto District and surrounding area, 23 populations including 247 clones were studied karyologically. Intravarietic polyploidy that consisted of diploidy (2 n= 18), triploidy (2 n= 27), tetraploidy (2 n= 36) and hexaploidy (2 n= 54) were validated in this taxon in these areas. The <b>hexaploids</b> distribute widely in the central region of the District, with the diploids, triploids and tetraploids encircling the <b>hexaploids.</b> L^ -chromosomes of this taxon were classified into 16 types by the difference of length of: (1) satellite, (2) short arm minus satellite and (3) long arm. The polymorphism of the L^ -chromosomes were more noticeable in the <b>hexaploids</b> than in either the diploids or the tetraploids. Aneuploidy by the possesing of B-chromosomes was found in diploids, tetraploids and <b>hexaploids</b> in 16 populations among the 23 populations studied and 17 types were distinguished. Four types were found {{for the first time in}} this study. In the north Kanto District the primary derivative B-chromosomes were frequently observed and in the south Kanto District the secondary derivative B-chromosomes were observed...|$|R

5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile <b>hexaploid.</b> The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hexaploid</b> wheats {{evolved in}} farmers' fields. Either domesticated emmer or durum wheat hybridized {{with yet another}} wild diploid grass (Aegilops tauschii) to make the <b>hexaploid</b> wheats, spelt wheat and bread wheat.

Diploids occurred mainly in the eastern and southern coastal areas, <b>hexaploids</b> on the highveld and tetraploids in between, but with some overlap. The meiosis analysis suggests {{that the majority of the}} polyploids are segmental allopolyploids and that different homeologous genomes occur in this polyploid complex. It is likely that a certain amount of karyotype differentiation must have occurred between different diploid populations of this species...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands {{two groups}} of plants can be {{distinguished}} in Ornithogalum umbellatum L. s. l., which differ morphologically and cytologically. The first group consists of triploids and some tetraploids, the second of penta- and <b>hexaploids</b> and also some tetraploids. The characters of the triploids (2 n = 27) are: bulbs higher than broad; bulbils few and oblong; more than 15 leaves (up to 5 mm broad) per bulb; inflorescences few-flowered (5 — 12 flowers); pedicels not deflected after anthesis. The characters of the penta- and <b>hexaploids</b> (2 n = 45, 54 respectively) are: bulbs broader than high; bulbils many, small and round; leaves up to 12 (5 — 8 mm broad); inflorescences many-flowered (usually more than 14 per inflorescence); pedicels always deflected after anthesis. The seed-set is extremely low in all cytotypes. Taxonomically the most plausible solution seems to assign the triploids to O. umbellatum L., the penta- and <b>hexaploids</b> to O. divergens Bor. The latter taxon was probably introduced from S. or C. Europe and often occurs in the Netherlands near estates and country seats. Perhaps they {{can be considered as}} „stinseplants”...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims Despite {{extensive}} {{study of}} polyploidy, its origin, and ecogeographical differences between polyploids and their diploid progenitors, {{few studies have}} addressed ploidy-level structure and patterns of ecogeographical differentiation at various spatial scales using detailed sampling procedures. The pattern of coexistence of polyploids in the geophyte Allium oleraceum at the landscape and locality scale and their ecology were studied. †Methods Flow cytometry and root-tip squashes were used to identify the ploidy level of 4347 plants from 325 populations sampled from the Czech Republic using a stratified random sampling procedure. Ecological differ-entiation among ploidy levels was tested by comparing sets of environmental variables recorded at each locality. †Key Results Across the entire sampling area, pentaploids (2 n 5 x 40) predominated, while <b>hexaploids</b> (2 n 6 x 48) and tetraploids (2 n 4 x 32) were less frequent. The distribution of tetra- and <b>hexaploids</b> was par-tially sympatric (in the eastern part) to parapatric (in {{the western part of}} the Czech Republic) whereas pentaploids were sympatric with other cytotypes. Plants of different ploidy levels were found to be ecologically differentiated and the ruderal character of cytotypes increased in the direction 4 x! 5 x! 6 x with the largest realized niche differences between tetra- and <b>hexaploids.</b> Most populations contained only one ploidy level (77 %), 22 % had two (all possible combinations) and 1 % were composed of three ploidy levels.

25|$|Many genera {{and species}} of Triticeae are allopolyploids, having more {{chromosomes}} than seen in typical diploids. Typical allopolyploids are tetraploid or <b>hexaploid,</b> XXYY or XXYYZZ. The creation of polyploid species results from natural random events tolerated by polyploid-capable plants. Natural allopolyploid plants may have selective advantages and some may permit the recombination of distantly related genetic material.

40|$|Wheat {{improves}} some traits when inoculated with Azospirillum. However, inconsistent {{results have}} been observed in field experiments. The ability of Azospirillum brasilense Cd to adhere to wheat was tested in a germplasm panel consisting {{of a number of}} bread wheat cultivars, synthetic <b>hexaploids,</b> synthetic derivatives, and a partial set of single chromosome substitution lines to determine the plant genetic role. Seeds of genotypes were grown in modified Hoagland's medium at seedling stage and then roots were inoculated with the bacteria and adhered cells were counted. The majority of the bread wheat cultivars and synthetic derivatives and some of the synthetic <b>hexaploids</b> were able to support bacterial adhesion. Neither the age of the seedling nor the imposition of either salinity stress or nitrogen starvation had any effect on the extent of adhesion. A pedigree analysis revealed that the root-adhered A. brasilense cultivars shared common ancestor(s), and the substitution line analysis suggested that the genes underlying the trait were located on chromosomes 5 D and 6 D. The present results are consistent with the notion that the D genome is the source of genetic variation for the capacity of A. brasilense to adhere to the seedling roots...|$|R
25|$|Some {{animal and}} plant species are {{polyploid}} : They have more than two sets of homologous chromosomes. Plants important in agriculture such as tobacco or wheat are often polyploid, compared to their ancestral species. Wheat has a haploid number of seven chromosomes, still seen in some cultivars {{as well as the}} wild progenitors. The more-common pasta and bread wheat types are polyploid, having 28 (tetraploid) and 42 (<b>hexaploid)</b> chromosomes, compared to the 14 (diploid) chromosomes in the wild wheat.|$|E

Domesticated oats appear relatively late, and far from the Near East, in Bronze Age Europe. Oats, like rye, are usually considered a secondary crop, i.e., derived from a weed of the primary cereal domesticates wheat and barley. As these cereals spread westwards into cooler, wetter areas, this may have favored the oat weed component, and have led to its domestication.|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} {{reciprocal crosses}} between the tetraploid Selenicereus megalanthus and the diploidHylocereus species,H. undatus and H. polyrhizus. S. megalanthus 3 H. undatus {{gave rise to}} viable <b>hexaploids</b> and 6 x-aneuploid hybrids {{rather than to the}} expected triploids. No genuine hybrids were obtained in the reciprocal cross. The pollen diameter of the tetraploid S. megalanthus varied widely, indicating the occurrence of unreduced gametes, while that of H. undatus pollen was very uniform, indicating an extremely low frequency of unreduced gametes. This finding suggests that the <b>hexaploids</b> were formed by chromosome doubling after the formation of the hybrid triploid zygote rather than by fusion of unreduced gametes of the two species. During the past 15 years, a number of cactus species have been introduced into Israel from northern South America, Central America, and Mexico (Nerd and Mizrahi 1997).
