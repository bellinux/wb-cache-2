In this work, he looked at indulgences in the Catholic Church. The letter showed a profound knowledge of theology and dogma. It analyzed the historical beginnings of indulgences and their development and cited decrees and bulls written about abuses of indulgences. In this work, Espejo staunchly supported {{the authority of the}} Pope.|$|E
5|$|The {{generic name}} is a {{combination}} of the Latin prefix semi, meaning half, and noun cassis, meaning helmet. The specific name of this taxon, granulata, is derived from the Latin noun <b>grana</b> meaning grain. Here it is used in the diminutive form, meaning granulated, or covered in granules, i.e. small grains or pellets, referring to the shell sculpture.|$|E
25|$|In higher plants thylakoids are {{organized}} into a granum-stroma membrane assembly. A granum (plural <b>grana)</b> is {{a stack of}} thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 <b>grana.</b> <b>Grana</b> are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergranal thylakoids or lamellae. <b>Grana</b> thylakoids and stroma thylakoids can be distinguished by their different protein composition. <b>Grana</b> contribute to chloroplasts' large surface area to volume ratio. Different interpretations of electron tomography imaging of thylakoid membranes has resulted in two models for <b>grana</b> structure. Both posit that lamellae intersect <b>grana</b> stacks in parallel sheets, though whether these sheets intersect in planes perpendicular to the <b>grana</b> stack axis, or are arranged in a right-handed helix is debated.|$|E

30|$|Recently, Kirk [5] has {{extended}} this result to the abstract setting {{of a certain}} class of metric spaces: the CAT(0) spaces. In the proof, the author uses a homotopy result due to <b>Granas</b> [6], which is known as continuation method for contractive maps. In fact, the jump from a Banach space setting to the metric space setting was given by <b>Granas</b> himself in [6] (for {{more information on this}} topic see, for instance, [7 – 9]). After <b>Granas,</b> Frigon [8] gave a similar result for weakly contractive maps.|$|R
25|$|Using a light microscope, it is {{just barely}} {{possible}} to see tiny green granules—which were named <b>grana.</b> With electron microscopy, it became possible to see the thylakoid system in more detail, revealing it to consist of stacks of flat thylakoids which made up the <b>grana,</b> and long interconnecting stromal thylakoids which linked different <b>grana.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the helical {{thylakoid}} model, <b>grana</b> {{consist of}} a stack of flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes. Each granum can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids, though <b>grana</b> with 10–20 thylakoids are most common. Wrapped around the <b>grana</b> are helicoid stromal thylakoids, also known as frets or lamellar thylakoids. The helices ascend at an angle of 20–25°, connecting to each granal thylakoid at a bridge-like slit junction. The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple <b>grana,</b> or narrow to tube-like bridges between <b>grana.</b> While {{different parts of the}} thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins, the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of thylakoids—granal thylakoids, which are {{arranged}} in <b>grana,</b> and stromal thylakoids, which are in contact with the stroma. Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around <b>grana.</b> The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex. This allows them to stack tightly, forming <b>grana</b> with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, while Tunisia was {{gradually}} {{opening up to}} European influences and also undergoing its pressure, the sovereign Ahmed Bey the First inaugurated a policy of reforms. By virtue of an act correcting the Tunisian-Tuscan Treaty of 1822, signed on 2 November 1846, the <b>Granas</b> established in Tunisia after the treaty or those who came to settle there, obtained the right to retain their status as Tuscans without any time limit, {{which is not the}} case with the <b>Granas</b> who arrived before 1822. This provision encouraged many <b>Granas</b> of Italian origin to emigrate to Tunisia, where they constituted a foreign minority - 90 persons in 1848, reinforced by a few French and British Jews the protection of the Consul of Tuscany and settled in the Franc district of Tunis unlike the former <b>Granas</b> settled in the Hara; Those who arrived after the Italian unification also benefited from the application of this provision.|$|R

25|$|The {{number of}} {{thylakoid}}s {{and the total}} thylakoid area of a chloroplast is influenced by light exposure. Shaded chloroplasts contain larger and more <b>grana</b> with more thylakoid membrane area than chloroplasts exposed to bright light, which have smaller and fewer <b>grana</b> and less thylakoid area. Thylakoid extent can change within minutes of light exposure or removal.|$|E
25|$|A {{thylakoid}} is a membrane-bound compartment inside chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. They are {{the site}} of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. Thylakoids consist of a thylakoid membrane surrounding a thylakoid lumen. Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form stacks of disks referred to as <b>grana</b> (singular: granum). <b>Grana</b> are connected by intergranal or stroma thylakoids, which join granum stacks together as a single functional compartment.|$|E
25|$|Photosystem II {{is located}} {{mostly in the}} <b>grana</b> thylakoids, whereas photosystem I and ATP synthase are mostly located in the stroma thylakoids and the outer layers of <b>grana.</b> The {{cytochrome}} b6f complex is distributed evenly throughout thylakoid membranes. Due to the separate location of the two photosystems in the thylakoid membrane system, mobile electron carriers are required to shuttle electrons between them. These carriers are plastoquinone and plastocyanin. Plastoquinone shuttles electrons from photosystem II to the cytochrome b6f complex, whereas plastocyanin carries electrons from the cytochrome b6f complex to photosystem I.|$|E
5000|$|The {{socio-cultural}} {{and economic}} {{differences between these}} two communities have increased in the nineteenth century. The <b>Granas,</b> due to their European origins and higher standard of living, but also to their economic, family and cultural ties with Livorno, {{found it difficult to}} cope with their indigenous coreligionists, the Twansa, who were considered less [...] "civilized". The <b>Granas</b> were an important contributions whereas they represented only a minority of the Jews of Tunisia. On the other hand, indigenous elites didn't wish to give up their power to newcomers, unlike their Maghreb neighbors, probably due to the later arrival of the <b>Granas</b> in Tunisia. The <b>Granas</b> also differed geographically from the Twansa, settling in the European district of Tunis, thus avoiding the Hara, and more culturally approach the Europeans than their co-religionists. However, the two groups keep the same rites and uses with only a few variants and, outside Tunis, the same community institutions continue to serve all the faithful. Moreover, all the Jews remain under the authority of a single qaid chosen from the Twansa, presumably to avoid interference with foreigners.|$|R

25|$|In shoots, proplastids from shoot apical meristems can {{gradually}} {{develop into}} chloroplasts in photosynthetic leaf tissues as the leaf matures, if {{exposed to the}} required light.

25|$|Cochineal dye {{was used}} by the Aztec and Maya peoples of Central and North America. Eleven cities conquered by Montezuma in the 15th century paid a yearly tribute of 2000 {{decorated}} cotton blankets and 40 bags of cochineal dye each. Production of cochineal is depicted in Codex Osuna. During the colonial period, the production of cochineal (<b>grana</b> fina) grew rapidly. Produced almost exclusively in Oaxaca by indigenous producers, cochineal became Mexico's second-most valued export after silver. Soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, it began to be exported to Spain, and by the 17th century was a commodity traded as far away as India. The dyestuff was consumed throughout Europe and was so highly prized, its price was regularly quoted on the London and Amsterdam Commodity Exchanges. In 1777, French botanist Nicolas-Joseph Thiéry de Menonville, presenting himself as a botanizing physician, smuggled the insects and pads of the Opuntia cactus to Saint Domingue. This particular collection failed to thrive and ultimately died out, leaving the Mexican monopoly intact. After the Mexican War of Independence in 1810–1821, the Mexican monopoly on cochineal came to an end. Large-scale production of cochineal emerged, especially in Guatemala and the Canary Islands; it was also cultivated in Spain and North Africa.|$|E

5000|$|Grandia IIs story {{focuses around}} Ryudo, a sarcastic [...] "Geohound" [...] (mercenaries who take {{undesirable}} jobs). He receives {{a mission to}} guard a sister of <b>Granas,</b> Elena, during a rite to reseal an ancient evil god. However, the rite runs into difficulties, leading to a much longer quest to escort Elena across the continent to meet Pope Zera, leader of the Church of <b>Granas.</b> The failed sealing attempt is also tied into {{the emergence of a}} strange woman known as Millenia, and a series of disturbing events at towns along the way to the <b>Granas</b> Cathedral. This sequel used a new, fully 3D engine to seamlessly render landscapes and battle scenes. The core battle system functionality stayed the same between Grandia and Grandia II, although it became impossible to cancel an action merely with normal attacks. The magic system was also changed, whereby magical eggs (usable by any character) were used to cast magic rather than having spells linked directly to each character.|$|R
