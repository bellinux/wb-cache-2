5|$|Winning 52 games, the Pistons comfortably {{entered the}} 1987 NBA Playoffs. They swept the Washington Bullets and soundly beat the Atlanta Hawks in five games, but bowed out in seven matches against the archrival Boston Celtics {{in what was}} {{called one of the}} {{physically}} and mentally toughest series ever. Rodman feuded with Celtics guard Dennis Johnson and taunted Johnson in the closing seconds when <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> <b>his</b> right hand over his own head. When the Celtics took Game Seven, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture.|$|E

He then took the bone and waved it the other way, reviving the dead mountain goats and bringing them back to life.|$|E

2500|$|Gagarin is memorialized in music, {{including}} {{a cycle of}} Soviet patriotic songs The Constellation Gagarin (...) was written by Alexandra Pakhmutova and Nikolai Dobronravov in 1970–1971.

2500|$|The {{people have}} a {{tradition}} {{in connection with this}} region which they implicitly believe.

[...] Thus they account for the sterility of Daouria, where it is said [...] "no corn will grow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blake {{noted that}} {{two or three}} white {{passengers}} were standing, as {{the front of the}} bus had filled to capacity.

6000|$|STEPHEN: (Looks {{up to the}} sky) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of selfpretence. Personally, I detest action. (<b>He</b> <b>waves</b> <b>his</b> hand) Hand {{hurts me}} slightly. Enfin ce sont vos oignons. (To Cissy Caffrey) Some trouble is on here. What is it precisely? ...|$|R

50|$|Heimbach's most {{important}} work is his {{painting of the}} homage to Frederik III in 1660. The painting is an almost photographic report. The artist has put himself in the foreground next to the inscription section; <b>he</b> <b>waves</b> <b>his</b> hat triumphantly. Heimbach left Denmark in 1667; he probably died in Oldenburg.|$|R
60|$|MURRAY (smiling). Oh--you--yes! (Then seriously.) I don't {{care for}} the atmosphere, though. (<b>He</b> <b>waves</b> <b>his</b> hand towards the {{partition}} looking out on the porch.)
