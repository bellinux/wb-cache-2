5|$|The book {{begins by}} looking at religion, {{specifically}} God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> mystic illumination. He {{goes on to say}} that the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.|$|E
5|$|The bells {{that draw}} the knights to the Grail {{ceremony}} at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of Parsifal in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed {{as a substitute}} for church bells. For the first performances, the bells were combined with tam-tam and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams tuned to the pitch of the four chime notes and another tam-tam on which a roll is executed by using a drumstick. In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with tubular bells or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> the destruction of Klingsor's castle.|$|E

The Battle of Ebro, fall of Catalonia and collapsing discipline produced a massive shrinking of the Republican troops. In late February 1939 their army was 400,000 compared to more than double that number of Nationalists. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> their final victory, the latter commanded over 900,000 troops.|$|E

25|$|Opposing {{the tidal}} {{deceleration}} of Earth is a mechanism {{that is in}} fact accelerating the rotation. Earth is not a sphere, but rather an ellipsoid that is flattened at the poles. SLR has shown that this flattening is decreasing. The explanation is that during the ice age large masses of ice collected at the poles, and depressed the underlying rocks. The ice mass started disappearing over 10000 years ago, but Earth's crust is still not in hydrostatic equilibrium and is still rebounding (the relaxation time {{is estimated to be}} about 4000 years). As a consequence, the polar diameter of Earth increases, and the equatorial diameter decreases (Earth's volume must remain the same). This means that mass moves closer to the rotation axis of Earth, and that Earth's moment of inertia decreases. This process alone leads to an increase of the rotation rate (phenomenon of a spinning figure skater who spins ever faster as they retract their arms). From the observed change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia the acceleration of rotation can be computed: the average value over the historical period must have been about −0.6 ms/century. This largely explains the historical observations.|$|E
500|$|In the {{illustration}} of Peter {{standing by the}} locked door, the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles {{is presented in the}} verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, [...] "Peter began to cry" [...] is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter’s emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright against the door, one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but his tears, his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader’s identification with him. Here, verbal narrative and illustration work in harmony rather than in disharmony. Scott suggests Potter’s tale has encouraged many generations of children to [...] "self-indulgence, disobedience, transgression of social boundaries and ethics, and assertion of their wild, unpredictable nature against the constrictions of civilized living." ...|$|E

No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident!

500|$|Burwell and Fleming say the book's subtext {{is about}} aging, as {{symbolized by the}} writer's {{attraction}} to the younger fertile woman, and Hemingway used fertility imagery to symbolize [...] "the aging writer's anxiety {{about his ability to}} write". [...] The images of the old elephant symbolize the aging and unproductive writer, and Burwell approves Patrick Hemingway's decision to retain those pieces of the manuscript. Hemingway scholar Hilary Justice writes the work shows an emphasis on [...] "the writer not writing", [...] which for Hemingway would have been a fate worse than aging. Thus, she says, True at First Light invokes a paradox with [...] "an aging writer for whom writing is becoming increasingly difficult <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> writing about the not-writing author". Writing, for Hemingway, had always been difficult. He revised his work endlessly and stuck to the practice of writing [...] "one true sentence" [...] and stopping each writing session when he still had more to write. Tom Jenks, editor of an earlier posthumously published book The Garden of Eden, says Hemingway shows the worst of his writing in True at First Light: presenting himself as a [...] "self-pitying, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing" [...] persona in a book that {{is no more than a}} mass of fragmentary material. Jenks thinks Hemingway is simply aimlessly writing and the plot lacks the tension notable in his earliest works such as The Sun Also Rises. However, he thinks Hemingway had good material to work with and some skeletal thematic structures show promise.|$|E
