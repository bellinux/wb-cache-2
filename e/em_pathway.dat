The highest hydrogen yields of 82 to 90 % of theoretical maximum (3. 3 to 3. 6 mol H 2 per mol glucose) were obtained at low growth rates when a relatively larger part of the consumed glucose is used for maintenance.

However, the practical applications of biocatalytic chemical conversions are often restricted due to their complexities involving the unpredictability of product yield and the troublesome controls in fermentation processes. One of the possible strategies to overcome these limitations is to eliminate the use of living microorganisms and to use only enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway. Use of recombinant mesophiles producing thermophilic enzymes at high temperature results in denaturation of indigenous proteins and elimination of undesired side reactions; consequently, highly selective and stable biocatalytic modules can be readily prepared. By rationally combining those modules together, artificial synthetic pathways specialized for chemical manufacturing could be designed and constructed. Results A chimeric Embden-Meyerhof (<b>EM)</b> <b>pathway</b> with balanced consumption and regeneration of ATP and ADP was constructed by using nine recombinant E. coli strains overproducing either {{one of the seven}} glycolytic enzymes of Thermus thermophilus, the cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase of Pyrococcus horikoshii, or the non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase of Thermococcus kodakarensis. By coupling this pathway with the Thermus malate/lactate dehydrogenase, a stoichiometric amount of lactate was produced from glucose with an overall ATP turnover number of 31. Conclusions In this study, a novel and simple technology for flexible design of a bespoke metabolic pathway was developed.

Recent advances in metabolomic analysis allow clarification of the intracellular metabolic states of microorganisms (Toya and Shimizu 2013) and this approach has shown that pure cultures of G. sulfurreducens activate the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and down-regulate gluconeogenesis under conditions compatible with electricity generation (Song et al. 2016). Metabolomic analysis can also be applied to microflora to understand the metabolic state of a bacterial community as a whole. In microflora used for methane fermentation, the Embden-Meyerhof (<b>EM)</b> <b>pathway</b> is inhibited and simultaneously the reductive branch of the TCA cycle is stimulated when the pH is decreased from 7.5 to 5.0, and methane fermentation is inhibited (Sasaki et al. 2014).

Geobacter cells reportedly down-regulate gluconeogenesis during electricity generation (Meng et al. 2013; Song et al. 2016). Because G. sulfurreducens cells cannot directly utilize glucose (Mahadevan et al. 2006), we can separate the phases of current production by microflora into an acetate-producing phase from starch via glycolysis, and a current-producing phase from acetate via the TCA cycle. Thus, intracellular metabolites related to glycolysis {{would be affected}} by carbon flux from starch-derived glucose in microorganisms other than Geobacter cells. In contrast, the intracellular concentrations of acetyl-CoA were higher at pH 5.5 and 4.0 than at pH 7.0, implying that the accumulation of organic acids at pH 5.5 and 4.0 inhibited carbon flux via acetyl-CoA (Fig.  3). The same profiles were observed in microflora used for methane fermentation from glucose (Sasaki et al. 2014).|$|R

Cells were incubated {{in a medium}} containing 5 mM-glucose, 0. 4 mM-palmitate, 1 mM-lactate and 0. 5 mM-glutamine. Administration of TNF in vivo increased glucose use in Kupffer cells by 70 %. Glucose oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and flux in the Embden-Meyerhof (<b>EM)</b> <b>pathway</b> were elevated by 40 and 80 % respectively. Treatment in vitro with 1 microM-phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) resulted in a similar percentage increase in glucose use by Kupffer cells prepared from either saline- or TNF-treated rats. However, PMA increased {{the activity of the}} hexose monophosphate shunt (HMS) by 3 - and 10 -fold in cells isolated from saline- or TNF-infused animals respectively. A phagocyte stimulus in vitro, opsonized zymosan, increased glucose use by 30 % and doubled the flux through the HMS in Kupffer cells from saline-infused animals. The activity of the HMS in response to zymosan was increased by 400 % after TNF treatment. In endothelial cells, basal glucose utilization was not altered by TNF treatment. PMA increased HMS activity in endothelial cells to a similar degree after saline or TNF infusion. Zymosan, however, increased HMS activity only in endothelial cells from TNF-treated rats. Oxidation of palmitate or glutamine was not affected by TNF treatment either under basal conditions or after challenge in vitro. Our data indicate that, after phagocytosis in vitro or protein kinase C activation, glucose use and flux through the HMS increase in Kupffer cells. This is accompanied by increased glycolytic flux, with no changes in glucose oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. After TNF exposure, followed by a secondary stimulus, the enhanced glucose use by Kupffer cells is primarily channelled through the HMS pathway. These data suggest that the increased glucose use in vivo by Kupffer cells found after immune-stimulated conditions may subserve primarily the increased need for NADPH and HMS intermediates...|$|E

MC 3 T 3 cells were pretreated with EM (0 – 10 [*]μg/mL) and then stimulated with PMMA (1 [*]mg/mL). Cell viability was evaluated by both a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay and cell counts. Cell differentiation was determined by activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Gene expression was measured via real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Results. We found that exposure to PMMA particles reduced cellular viability and osteogenetic potential in MC 3 T 3 cell line. EM treatment mitigated the effects of PMMA particles on the proliferation, viability and differentiation of MC 3 T 3 cells. PMMA decreased the gene expression of Runx 2, osterix and osteocalcin, which can be partially restored by EM treatment. Furthermore, EM suppressed PMMA- induced increase of NF-κB gene expression.

5000|$|CAP {{has yet to}} be cultured, but {{the ability}} to enrich lab-scale EBPR {{communities}} with up to 80% CAP [...] has enabled research into its metabolism using meta-omic approaches. [...] EBPR is generally associated with three stages: anaerobic, aerobic, and settling. For CAP to dominate in EBPR reactors, they must be able to thrive under these conditions. During the anaerobic phase, CAP can take up volatile fatty acids and store these simple carbon sources intracellularly as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). At the same time, intracellular polyphosphate is degraded to form ATP, releasing phosphate into the medium. During the subsequent aerobic phase, PHAs are used for energy production and phosphate is taken up from the medium to form polyphosphate. [...] Genomic reconstruction from an EBPR reactor enriched with CAP IIA revealed it to contain two different types of phosphate transporters, the high-affinity Pst and low-affinity Pit transporters, as well as using the Embden-Meyerhof (<b>EM)</b> glycogen degradation <b>pathway.</b> [...] Furthermore, the CAP IIA genome contains nitrogen and CO2 fixation genes, which indicate CAP has adapted to environments limited in carbon and nitrogen. One interesting discrepancy between the genomic data and reactor performance data was the lack of a functional respiratory nitrate reductase gene. Previous work had shown CAP could use nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor, but the genomic data indicate the periplasmic nitrate reductase gene could not function in the electron transport chain, as it lacked the necessary quinol reductase subunit. To resolve these issues, lab-scale EBPR reactors enriched with CAP IA and CAP IIA were tested for their nitrate-reduction capabilities. [...] Interestingly, CAP IA was able to couple nitrate reduction to phosphate uptake, while the genomically characterised CAP IIA could not.|$|R
40|$|Conference paper {{presented}} at the MODSIM 07, International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, held December 2007, University of Canterbury, New Zealand. Flavonoids are ubiquitous secondary plant metabolites that play a variety of roles in the reproduction and protection of plants. Anthocyanin is a major subgroup of flavonoids that assist plants in attracting pollinators and seed dispersers by providing red to blue pigmentation in flowers and fruits. The compounds are water soluble and occur mostly as glucosylated pigments in fruits, leaves and flowers. A self-contained flavonoid subnetwork, consisting of 137 metabolites and 117 reactions, is extracted from the AraCyc database which contains biochemical pathway information of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). Arabidopsis is used in this study because of the vast metabolic information available for it as well as {{the fact that it is}} very similar to most other plants so should make a good representation of flowering plants. Using the stoichiometric matrix to mathematically represent the connections between the reactions, and convex analysis to identify all possible and feasible metabolic routes at a steady state, 199 elementary modes (<b>EMs)</b> or <b>pathways</b> are derived from the subnetwork. Eighty of these lead to the formation of flavonoid compounds. The rest lead to other compounds such as lignin and phenylpropanoid esters, whose association and interplay with flavonoid production is an interesting result to be further investigated. The study uses the subnetwork to investigate the structural functionality of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (ABP). Two anthocyanin compounds, pelargonidin and cyanidin glucosides, are present in Arabidopsis and six EMs lead to their formation. By identifying the enzymes related to the reactions involved in the six EMs, the structural functionality of the enzyme related genes in the ABP are studied. Genes that play important roles in multiple phenotypic traits are identified and their relationship with other EMs in the flavonoid subnetwork investigated. Analysis is also done to identify and study those genes which, when deleted, would result in the non-production of anthocyanin compounds. Emergent properties of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, such as reaction participation and minimal cut sets are used for the investigations. The reaction participation looks at the multiple phenotypic trait of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway genes by determining the number of times the enzyme product of each gene appears in the set of 80 elementary modes responsible for the formation of flavonoid compounds. The results show that, in terms of their sequence in the pathway, genes that occur early in the pathway are involved in more EMs, and thus the formation of other flavonoids, than those found later in the ABP, which are more specific to the anthocyanin compounds. A general observation about the flavonoid subnetwork is that it has a remarkably small number of elementary modes compared to other metabolic networks of similar size in other organisms. This suggests a highly constrained network, which could be due to fact that it deals with secondary metabolites. The results are discussed in more detail in the main paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{understanding}} {{the complexity of}} a metabolic network structure, flux distribution is the key information to observe as it holds direct representation of cellular phenotype. To examine this, the study on genetically perturbed conditions (e. g. gene deletion/knockout) {{is one of the}} useful methods, which significantly contributes to metabolic engineering and biotechnology applications. Currently, metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is proven to be suitable mechanism for specific gene knockout studies, yet the method involves exhaustive computational effort since the calculation are derived by a stoichiometric model of major intracellular reactions and applying mass balances to the intracellular metabolites. Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) is widely used to investigate the metabolic fluxes of a variety of cells. MFA is based on the stoichiometric matrix of metabolic reactions and their thermodynamic constraints. The matrix is derived from a metabolic network map, where the rows and columns represent metabolites, chemical/transport reactions, respectively. MFA is very effective in {{understanding the}} mechanism of how metabolic networks generate a variety of cellular functions and in rationally planning a gene deletion/amplification strategy for strain improvements. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is used to predict the steady-state flux distribution of genetically modified cells under different culture conditions. Minimization of Metabolic Adjustment (MOMA) was developed to predict the flux distributions of gene deletion mutants. FBA and MOMA often lead to incorrect predictions in situations where the constraints associated with regulation of gene expression or activity of the gene products are dominant, because they apply the Boolean logics or its related simple logics to gene regulations and enzyme activities. On the other hand, network-based pathway analyses, elementary modes (<b>EMs)</b> and extreme <b>pathways</b> emerge as alternative ways for constructing a mathematical model of metabolic networks with gene regulations. EM analysis was suggested to be convenient for integrating an enzyme activity profile into the flux distribution. Enzyme Control Fluxes (ECFs) uses the relative enzyme activity profile of a mutant to wild type to predict its flux distribution. In facilitating the analysis of metabolic flux distributions, the support of computational approaches is significantly essential. In addition, the availability of real sample data particularly for further observation, a large number of knockout mutant data provides assistance in enhancing the process. We had presented Genetic Modification Flux (GMF) that predicts the flux distribution of a broad range of genetically modified mutants. The feasibility of GMF to predict the flux distribution of genetic modification mutants is validated on various metabolic network models. The prediction using GMF shows higher prediction accuracy as compared to FBA and MOMA. To enhance the feasibility and usability of GMF, we developed two versions of simulator application with metabolic network database to predict flux distribution of genetically modified mutants. 112 data sets of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) were registered as standard models. 1 : INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND| 2 : MATERIALS AND METHODS| 3 : RESULT AND DISCUSSION| 4 : CONCLUSION九州工業大学平成 28 年...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{makes use}} of the genome-scale metabolic information of the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) plant {{to better understand the}} systemic behaviour of a multicellular cell, using mathematical and in silico methods. To avoid combinatorial explosion resulting from the large network size, an appropriate subnetwork is first extracted. This results in an Arabidopsis flavonoid subnetwork that is self-contained, in the sense that all its exchange fluxes are accounted for and it is representative of flavonoid metabolism in the context of whole cell metabolism. This subnetwork is verified by comparing its compounds and reactions with a recently reconstructed and verified Arabidopsis network. The research focusses on anthocyanins, a major flavonoids subgroup responsible for colour pigmentation in plants. To determine the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (ABP), elementary modes (<b>EMs)</b> or non-decomposable <b>pathways</b> that allow the system to operate at steady state, are calculated. These EMs are classified into groups and those responsible for the formation of anthocyanin compounds are taken to constitute the ABP. The central analysis approach in the research is that of minimal cut sets (MCSs), a fairly new metabolic pathway analysis (MPA) concept. A review of various development stages of the MCS concept and its relationship to other similar approaches is given {{for the first time in}} this thesis. MCSs provide a mathematically complete list of candidate genes for eliminating a certain objective function from a holistic perspective, without needing prior knowledge of genes. They are used to identify target genes for loss of colour pigmentation in plants. Other methods, such as reaction participation, are then used to study the implications that the elimination of these target genes would have on other processes in the cell. MCSs are also used to look at the fragility coefficient of the ABP genes and how crucial they are to the pathway. These analyses provide quantitative support for experimental results e. g., gene connectivity determines the number of EMs the ABP genes are connected to, and backs the pleiotropic characteristics of the “early” ABP genes and how it relates to where they occur in the pathway. The research also uses flux balance analysis (FBA) to simulate fluxes (reaction rates) for the different MCSs eliminating anthocyanin compounds. The FBA provides a quantitative measure of the relative impact that the different MCSs would have on the production and processes of other flavonoids and related compounds. Certain simulation outcomes correspond to experimental observations, e. g., the simulated fluxes from eliminating the MCS containing the CHS gene, support the observation that the suppression of the anthocyanin pathway, via CHS silencing, dramatically reduces flavonoids but does not affect scent (benzenoids) production. The research also develops a method for determining which genes are being expressed in a tissue, using EMs and MCSs in conjunction with information about compound products. This involves developing an algorithm and writing a program to determine which reactions are being expressed in a tissue. The algorithm and program worked both on an example network and on the flavonoid network used to determine reactions taking place in the Arabidopsis flower. Information obtained from the results includes identifying reactions that are critical to the flower as well as reaction sets that would represent gene sets. The program still needs further development to incorporate analytical clustering methods and a user-friendly interface...|$|R

Alisertib (ALS, MLN 8237) is a selective Aurora kinase A inhibitor that displays anticancer effects on several types of cancer. However, the role of ALS in the treatment of OS remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ALS on the cell growth, apoptosis, autophagy, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the underlying mechanisms in two human OS cell lines U- 2 OS and MG- 63. The results showed that ALS had potent growth inhibitory, pro-apoptotic, pro-autophagic, and EMT inhibitory effects on U- 2 OS and MG- 63 cells. ALS remarkably induced G 2 /M arrest and down-regulated the expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2 and cyclin B 1 in both U- 2 OS and MG- 63 cells. ALS markedly induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis with {{a significant increase in the}} expression of key pro-apoptotic proteins and a decrease in main anti-apoptotic proteins. Furthermore, ALS promoted autophagic cell death via the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /protein kinase B (Akt) /mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p 38 MAPK) signaling pathways, and activation of 5 &# 39;-AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. Inducers or inhibitors of apoptosis or autophagy simultaneously altered ALS-induced apoptotic and autophagic death in both U- 2 OS and MG- 63 cells, suggesting a crosstalk between these two primary modes of programmed cell death. Moreover, ALS suppressed EMT-like phenotypes with a marked increase in the expression of E-cadherin but a decrease in N-cadherin in U- 2 OS and MG- 63 cells. ALS treatment also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation but inhibited the expression levels of sirtuin 1 and nuclear factor-erythroid- 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) in both cell lines. Taken together, these findings show that ALS promotes apoptosis and autophagy but inhibits EMT via PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR, p 38 MAPK, and AMPK signaling pathways with involvement of ROS- and sirtuin 1 -associated pathways in U- 2 OS and MG- 63 cells. ALS is a promising anticancer agent in OS treatment and further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in OS chemotherapy.

The major human diseases like as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and cancer are involved in failure of human metabolic systems. Therefore, metabolism is an important biological process, but these are complex and highly interconnected each others. Metabolic network maps are represented by a complex chain of chemical reactions and are highly associated between genes, proteins and enzymes; consequently mathematical and/or computational approaches are necessary for integration of them. Heterogeneous biological data, including genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome are integrated into a pathway-based metabolic model to predict a flux distribution of genetically modified cells under particular conditions. The integration of heterogeneous biological data and model building have become essential activities in biological research as technological advancements continue to empower the measurement of biological data of increasing diversity and scale. But the challenge becomes how to integrate this data to maximize the amount of useful biological {{information that can be}} extracted. Metabolic pathway analysis is theoretically effective in integrating heterogeneous biological data into metabolic network and to offer great opportunities for studying functional and structural properties of metabolic pathways. Metabolic pathway analysis has focused on two approaches, namely, elementary modes (<b>EMs)</b> and extreme <b>pathways</b> (Expas). <b>EM</b> analysis is potentially effective in integrating transcriptome or proteome data into metabolic network analyses and a minimal set of reactions that can maintain the steady state level, while Expa analysis is a subset of EM that contains two additional conditions and one of them condition to make all Expas systematically independent. The EM coefficients (EMCs) indicate the quantitative contribution of their associated EMs and that can be estimated by maximizing as a particular objective function. A serious problem of EM/ Expa analysis is that the computational time increases exponentially with an increase in network sizes, which makes the computation of the all EMs/Expas expensive and impracticable for large- or genome-scale networks. Another major problem is that many organisms still does not have provide any specific objective biological function for estimating the EMCs to predict the flux distribution relate to the optimum physiological states and EMs can be described by different scalar products or many possible vectors of each EM, but the predicted flux distributions must be independent of them. To address such aforementioned problems, in this thesis we present a fast and efficient algorithm, called complementary EM (cEM) analysis, {{to reduce the number of}} EMs/Expas. To achieve the computational time improvement, we employ the EM decomposition method that explores major EMs or linear combinations of them which are responsible for the metabolic flux distributions. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is used to generate many possible ranges of metabolic flux distributions as the input data, which is necessary for the EM decomposition method. The maximum entropy principle (MEP) is used as an objective function for estimating the coefficients of cEMs, to renounce the scalar product problem of EMs. MEP is widely used for flux prediction in particular cases where no biological objective function is available and most advantages that it does not depend on the scalar product of each EM. To demonstrate the feasibility of cEM analysis, we compared it with EM/Expa analysis by using a simulation study with an artificial metabolic network model and real metabolic network analysis by two medium-scale metabolic network model of E. coli and a genome scale model for head and neck cancer cells. The cEM analysis greatly reduces the number of EM, computational time and memory cost for the genome-scale metabolic network. Application of cEM analysis to Genetic Modification of Flux (GMF) accurately predicts the flux distributions of genetic mutants under particular conditions. Use of cEMs analysis, to plans a genetic engineering strategy for genome-scale metabolic network model for producing useful compounds.
