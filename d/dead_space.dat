5|$|Scientists have debated {{as to how}} sauropods {{were able}} to breathe with their large body sizes and long necks, which would have {{increased}} the amount of <b>dead</b> <b>space.</b> They likely had an avian respiratory system, which is more efficient than a mammalian and reptilian system. Reconstructions of the neck and thorax of Diplodocus show great pneumaticity, which could {{have played a role}} in respiration as it does in birds.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased <b>dead</b> <b>space,</b> or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} academic {{discussion of the}} extent to which Norman keeps were designed with a military or political function in mind, particularly in England. Earlier analyses of Norman keeps focused on their military design, and historians such as R. Brown Cathcart King proposed that square keeps were adopted because of their military superiority over timber keeps. Most of these Norman keeps were certainly extremely physically robust, even though the characteristic pilaster buttresses added little real architectural strength to the design. Many of the weaknesses inherent to their design were irrelevant during the early part of their history. The corners of square keeps were theoretically vulnerable to siege engines and galleried mining, but before the introduction of the trebuchet at the end of the 12th century, early artillery stood little practical chance of damaging the keeps, and galleried mining was rarely practised. Similarly, the corners of a square keep created <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> that defenders could not fire at, but missile fire in castle sieges was less important until the introduction of the crossbow in the middle of the 12th century, when arrowslits began to be introduced.|$|E

This limits the <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> to between the non return valves and the user's mouth and/or nose. The additional <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> can be minimized by keeping the volume of this external <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> as small as possible, but this should not unduly increase work of breathing.|$|E

50|$|The {{effective}} insulating value {{depends on}} the number of adjacent <b>dead</b> air <b>spaces,</b> layers of foil and where they are installed. If the foil is laminated to rigid foam insulation, the total insulating value is obtained by adding the RSI of the foam insulation to the RSI of the <b>dead</b> air <b>space</b> and the foil. If there is no air space or clear bubble layer, the RSI value of the film is zero.|$|R
25|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>space</b> in a {{breathing}} apparatus is {{space in the}} apparatus in which the breathing gas must flow in both directions as the user breathes in and out, increasing the necessary respiratory effort {{to get the same}} amount of usable air or breathing gas, and risking accumulation of carbon dioxide from shallow breaths. It is in effect an external extension of the physiological <b>dead</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

25|$|The trachea {{is an area}} of dead space: the oxygen-poor air it {{contains}} at the end of exhalation is the first air to re-enter the posterior air sacs and lungs. In comparison to the mammalian respiratory tract, the <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> volume in a bird is, on average, 4.5times greater than it is in mammals of the same size. Birds with long necks will inevitably have long tracheae, and must therefore take deeper breaths than mammals do to make allowances for their greater <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> volumes. In some birds (e.g. the whooper swan, Cygnus cygnus, the white spoonbill, Platalea leucorodia, the whooping crane, Grus americana, and the helmeted curassow, Pauxi pauxi) the trachea, which some cranes can be 1.5m long, is coiled back and forth within the body, drastically increasing the <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> ventilation. The purpose of this extraordinary feature is unknown.|$|E
30|$|With {{respect to}} our {{previous}} study [28], the new readout {{system can be}} triggered by lower signals, thus sampling the light distribution in a larger cluster of SiPMs. The SiPM arrays adopted here have been optimized to reduce the inactive spaces between SiPMs. In addition, {{the architecture of the}} detector allows to place the detectors side by side, without <b>dead</b> <b>spaces.</b> Finally, in this study, a LUT has been created for each parameter to determine the DOI. This method allows to finely model the asymmetry parameter for each DOI, and it can be calibrated using the natural background of the scintillator.|$|R

This includes, for example, ensuring that they are easy to dismantle, have level surfaces and seals that can be rinsed from the rear, no <b>dead</b> <b>spaces,</b> ergonomic shapes, a small range of parts and detectable materials/materials suitable for food use. Relatively aggressive ambient conditions, such as reactive detergents, reactive or abrasive filling media, intensive high-pressure cleaning and extreme ambient temperatures, are also faced.|$|R

Treatment required performing a hemipelvectomy.

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{a very simple}} operated system by which single breath CO diffusing capacity {{can be measured in}} anesthetized dogs. All controls and the automatic system are operated pneumatically. Cams forming {{an integral part of the}} pistons of the inspiratory and expiratory syringes activate push buttons which control the valves, enabling <b>dead</b> <b>spaces</b> to be flushed, a specific volume of air to be injected into the dog's lungs, and expiratory samples to be taken. Their results, due account being taken of the dogs' weight, are in the upper range of normal values published in earlier studies; the reproducibility of the method is good.

25|$|Designing Stirling engine heat {{exchangers}} is {{a balance between}} high heat transfer with low viscous pumping losses, and low <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> (unswept internal volume).

25|$|Air passes unidirectionally {{through the}} lungs during both {{exhalation}} and inspiration, causing, {{except for the}} oxygen-poor <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> air left in the trachea after exhalation and breathed in {{at the beginning of}} inhalation, little to no mixing of new oxygen-rich air with spent oxygen-poor air (as occurs in mammalian lungs), changing only (from oxygen-rich to oxygen-poor) as it moves (unidirectionally) through the parabronchi.|$|E
50|$|Lieutenant Tanigawa {{had built}} his {{defenses}} around eight light and two heavy machine guns sited {{at the base}} of the hill. In trenches and pits riflemen well-supplied with grenades covered the <b>dead</b> <b>spaces</b> in front of the machine guns.
