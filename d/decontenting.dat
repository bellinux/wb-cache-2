5000|$|This {{generation}} of Focus incorporated a redesigned cabin, changed materials, {{and a new}} [...] "infotainment" [...] system. Following the industry trend towards <b>decontenting,</b> and {{in keeping with the}} sedan's downmarket [...] "economy car" [...] image vs. the [...] "premium" [...] hatchback, the earlier sedan's space-saving gas strut trunk hinges are replaced with cheaper, intrusive goose neck hinges. The Focus also has Ford's patented capless fuel tank, which doesn't require a cap to prevent siphoning.|$|E
25|$|The 501A was {{released}} in 1954 {{as a replacement for}} the original 501 with similar trim and equipment, but which sold for DM14,180, a price reduction of more than eight hundred Deutsche Mark from the original 501. The 501B was a <b>decontented</b> version that sold for DM500 less than the 501A. Both the 501A and 501B used a revised M337 engine.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} sold as the Honda Partner (series GJ3/GJ4) panel van between March 10, 2006 and August 2010 in Japan. Essentially a <b>decontented</b> {{version of the}} Airwave, the Partner {{utilized}} a different 1.5 L engine, the L15A I-DSi (unlike the VTEC engine in the Airwave), mated to a five-speed automatic transmission identical to that found in the North American market Fit.|$|R

5000|$|In 2001 Muji, the {{well-known}} Japanese [...] "non-brand" [...] issued a limited release of 1,000 badgeless and <b>decontented</b> Nissan Marches, only available online. It {{was intended as}} an exercise to test their online marketing systems and was sold as the [...] "Muji Car 1000" [...] (ムジ・カー 1000). The rear seat is upholstered in vinyl, the hubcaps are minimal, and the car was only offered in [...] "marble white". The Muji Car 1000 has a four-speed automatic transmission and the 1 litre CG10DE engine.|$|R
25|$|In 1954, the 501 {{was given}} an improved, more {{powerful}} version of its six-cylinder engine and split into two models, the 501A at basically the same trim level and a price reduction of DM1,000, and a <b>decontented</b> 501B at a further price reduction of DM1,000 below the 501A's price. In addition, the 502, basically a 501 with an even higher trim level and a 2.6L aluminium V8 engine designed by Bőning and Fiedler, was introduced to lead BMW's luxury sedan range. The expanded line for 1954 doubled the sales of BMW's luxury cars.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, {{shares in}} “Muji Tsunan Campsite” were {{registered}} as over-the-counter shares of Japan Securities Dealers Association. In 1998, Ryōhin Keikaku {{listed on the}} second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. From 2001 onwards, it was listed on the first section. In April 2001 they issued the Muji Car 1000 (ムジ・カー 1000), a limited release of 1,000 badgeless and <b>decontented</b> Nissan Marches, only available online. Intended as an exercise to test their online marketing systems it was developed together with Nissan. The spartanly equipped little car (with the rear seat upholstered in vinyl, for instance) was only offered in [...] "marble white".|$|R
2500|$|In March 1978 the Swingback {{version was}} added, a two-door sedan which {{received}} a larger, opening rear window. The large rear window necessitated a slightly smaller {{opening to the}} engine compartment, but {{this was more than}} made up for by allowing for access to the rear luggage compartment from the outside. In March 1979, the Rex underwent a very minor facelift, the most visible results being new rims and slightly differing bumpers and a small spoiler in front. Then, in response to the very low priced Suzuki Alto, a <b>decontented</b> version of the Van called [...] "Family Rex" [...] was added in October 1979. It was priced at a very low ¥480,000 (under US$2,000 at the time). An automatic clutch version was added in March 1980.|$|R
50|$|Late in 1977 saw the {{introduction}} of the Subaru BRAT as a 1978 model. This was a two-seater body with a pickup truck bed, with two seats welded into the bed to evade the so-called chicken tax on light commercial vehicles. It brought the US lineup to eight models in three trim levels. Most were in the volume DL trim except a base two-door, and the GF hardtop and 4WD models which shared a higher specification. For 1979, a <b>decontented</b> DL 4WD wagon and Brat were added along with fancier GL four-door sedan and 2WD wagon models bringing the total to twelve, the original fully equipped 4WDs also getting the DL designation. The original Brat was updated in 1981 with a dual-range 4WD transmission and 1.8 L EA81 engine. This was sold alongside the second generation Leone introduced in 1979 until 1982.|$|R
