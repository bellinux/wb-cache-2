When Samuel Carter Hall was choosing works to illustrate his newly launched The Art Journal, he considered {{it important to}} promote new British artists, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> illustrations which some readers considered pornographic or offensive. In 1849 Hall secured reproduction rights to the 157 paintings which Vernon had given to the nation but declined to distribute reproductions of Candaules, despite his willingness to publish reproductions of other provocative Etty nudes such as Female Bathers Surprised by a Swan.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E

50|$|Not {{long after}} the meeting with Furtseva, Shostakovich called the {{ministry}} about Carmen Suite. He told Furtseva that he considered the ballet both a masterly transcription and highly effective dance music. At this time, Shostakovich was First Secretary of the Composer's union of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR); this made him effectively leader of that union. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were not <b>meant</b> as an official call and regardless of his official position still being subservient to hers, the fact it was Shostakovich calling might have still carried some cachet. Because of this personal intervention, the ban was lifted. Plisetskaya confessed in her autobiography that without Shostakovich's help, the ban on Carmen Suite might have remained permanent.|$|R
5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912.

It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act.

5|$|The German High Command did {{not want}} to exploit the victory at Sedan and Bulson until the German {{infantry}} divisions had caught up with the three Panzer divisions.

Guderian decided to push for the Channel, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> ignoring the High Command and Hitler himself. Guderian ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to hold the Sedan bridgehead, while the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions struck north west, towards the Channel. Now that they were pushing largely at an 'open door', the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions advanced into the undefended French rear with speed.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{campaign}} issue was the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the hand-picked candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, whose business practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted the state's reputation for violence to end <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> siding with the tobacco industry against the state's farmers.|$|E

In this paper we describe the use of films inmaking audiences aware of issues related to organ-donation. We review how films have dealtwith the issue of organ transplantation over the years and suggest that a positive portrayal oforgan transplantation in films and other media channels will allay negative attitudes in peopleand may act as catalysts of behavior change. This can motivate more people to donate organsposthumously. The portrayals of the act itself, its sequelae for the recipient and the donor’sfamilies will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Government {{involvement}} {{is the main}} cause for the EDI acceptance in Southeast Asian countries (United Nation of Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific - UNESCAP, 1996). This is {{significantly different from the}} EDI developments in the western countries in which private sector involvement in EDI is substantial (UNESCAP, 1996). As an initial step to spur EDI implementation in private sector, the Malaysian Government has imposed all companies that engage in international trade to implement EDI by doing electronic customs declarations through CIS (Customs Information System) DagangNet. For this, the Government also spent over RM 300 million to fully implement EDI nationwide (Star, 2003 December 3). Nevertheless, such implementation is not successful and it has been claimed that “EDI is not yet fully implemented even though it had been initiated since late 1990 s, besides electronic data is also still not recognized for legal customs declaration purposes <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was <b>meant</b> for paperless and electronic customs declarations” (Star, 2003 December 3). To date, there are dual customs declarations, both electronic and manual, in practices where the sole typical electronic transaction is registration of the customs form (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11). This is in contrast with electronic customs declarations by other countries such as Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore where there is a full electronic declaration including electronic payment for declarations charges (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11; Chau, 2001) ...|$|R
60|$|After {{that no more}} steamers came along, nor did I expect them. Warnings must by {{this time}} have been flying in all directions. But we {{had no reason to}} be {{dissatisfied}} with our first day. Between the Maplin Sands and the Nore we had sunk five ships of a total tonnage of about fifty thousand tons. Already the London markets would begin to feel the pinch. And Lloyd's--poor old Lloyd's--what a demented state it would be in! I could imagine the London evening papers and the howling in Fleet Street. We saw the result of our actions, for it was quite laughable to see the torpedo-boats buzzing like angry wasps out of Sheerness in the evening. They were darting in every direction across the estuary, and the aeroplanes and hydroplanes were like flights of crows, black dots against the red western sky. They quartered the whole river mouth, until they discovered us at last. Some sharp-sighted fellow with a telescope on board of a destroyer got a sight of our periscope, and came for us full speed. No doubt he would very gladly have rammed us, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had <b>meant</b> his own destruction, but that was not part of our programme at all. I sank her and ran her east-south-east with an occasional rise. Finally we brought her to, not very far from the Kentish coast, and the search- lights of our pursuers were far on the western skyline. There we lay quietly all night, for a submarine at night {{is nothing more than a}} very third-rate surface torpedo-boat. Besides, we were all weary and needed rest. Do not forget, you captains of men, when you grease and trim your pumps and compressors and rotators, that the human machine needs some tending also.|$|R
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} {{artillery}} would not break the Polish, General von Toll devised {{a new plan}} of attack. He decided to disregard Paskevich's order not to assault Warsaw. Although dusk was nearing, von Toll ordered an all-out assault on both the western and southern fronts. As {{there was no time}} for proper artillery preparation, von Toll wanted to overwhelm the defenders by sheer numerical superiority, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> increased casualties from Polish artillery. To distract the Polish artillery at Czyste and prevent it from firing at the Russian columns attacking Forts 21 and 22, Muraviev's forces were to lead the attack directly towards the Jerozolimskie Gate. Before 15:00, von Toll dispatched General Neidhardt to Paskevich to receive his blessing for the new plan, but Paskevich categorically refused, and ordered his subordinate to continue shelling the Polish forts with artillery at least until 16:00. As the Russian commander-in-chief was away, von Toll decided to act despite Paskevich's orders.|$|E
5|$|In November 1851, the General Assembly convened {{to elect}} a {{successor}} to Senator Joseph R. Underwood. Underwood, whose term would expire in 1853, desired re-election, and Whigs Charles S. Morehead and George Robertson had also announced their respective candidacies. Crittenden, whose term as attorney general also expired in 1853, had publicly announced that he wished {{to return to the}} Senate after his service in President Fillmore's cabinet, and upon learning this, Underwood and Morehead both withdrew from the race. Robertson was not expected to seriously challenge Crittenden, but following the withdrawals of the other candidates, Archibald Dixon entered the race. Historically an ally of Crittenden, Dixon's entrance into the race after Crittenden's announcement showed that he had switched his allegiance from Crittenden to Clay. Democrats, desirous to defeat Crittenden and embarrass the Whigs, pledged to vote against him at all costs, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> electing Dixon. Crittenden's friends, therefore, held back his name from nomination to spare him almost certain defeat. Balloting deadlocked for several days, with Clay supporters throwing their support to Dixon, Robertson, and Lieutenant Governor John B. Thompson, a compromise candidate. Another compromise was proposed whereby Clay, his health failing, would resign his Senate seat, creating two Senate vacancies and allowing both Dixon and Crittenden to be elected, but Clay refused to cooperate. Finally, on the night of December 11, 1851, the Whigs met in caucus and agreed to withdraw both Dixon and Crittenden and elect Thompson.|$|E
5|$|The bill's passage was {{met with}} concern by Catholic authorities, {{including}} Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call for freedom of conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> losing their jobs. Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify {{as members of the}} Catholic Faith. Sociologists believe {{this may be due to}} the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality. A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.|$|E

JLVLANY CIVILIANS AND MANY OFFICERS—whose duty it is to know better —still cling to the idea that the great majority of enlisted men are naive lowbrows who will look at printed matter only under compulsion. This is a complete misconception. Lowbrows in the Army may prefer to read comics, movie magazines and western stories, but they do read. In the absence of the daily sporting page and comic strips they will turn to magazines and books, and they will be bored and depressed when they can't get them. There are many highbrows in the Army, too, who are even more dependent on books, and good books, for recreation and relaxation. The great majority are between these two extremes. Reading, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> only <b>meant</b> reading the morning and evening papers and three or four magazine articles a week, plus an occasional popular book, was part of their daily life as civilians. It remains part of their daily life as soldiers, {{and in the case of}} soldiers overseas, a very im-portant port. Moreover, men who rarely looked at a book before have become habitual readers in die Army. This, too, is especially true of soldiers overseas. Because of physical isolation, conditions of weather and ter-rain, the foreign language of the native population, or the nature of their work, they are often cut off from other forms of recreation. They turn to reading in their leisure time and in the long waiting periods that are the curse of so many Army jobs—ground crews "sweating out" a bombing mission, truck drivers waiting for a load, combat troops waiting for "H-Hour. " The problem of getting books to soldiers overseas has been met by die Army Special Services Division, headed by Major General Joseph W. Byron, in a variety of ways. The Library Branch of die Special Services Division is the War Department agency with the over-all responsibility for providing reading material and library service for soldiers. I...|$|R
