30|$|In conclusion, ZnO {{nanowires}} {{were prepared}} by a low-pressure {{chemical vapor deposition}} process and bridged on the interdigitated Au electrodes. NDR in the I–V curves of ZnO nanowires bridging the interdigitated Au electrodes has been observed. NDR performance can be controlled by the bias voltage. The NDR peak voltage and peak current are influenced strongly by the value of starting voltage. The origin of this NDR is the charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>effect</b> between ZnO nanowires and metal electrodes rather than the conventional resonant tunneling mechanism. The weak nanoscale contact between ZnO nanowires and metal electrodes forms the parasitic capacitor. The frequency-dependent C–V measurements further demonstrated the charging and discharging processes. Such NDR effect in the metal/nanowires/metal structure has important potential applications in nanowire-based switches, oscillators, and resonators.|$|E

40|$|Observational {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} when El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events typically reach their peak amplitude in boreal winter, the associated zonal wind anomalies abruptly shift southward so that the maximum anomalous zonal wind is located around 5 degrees- 7 degrees S. Here, an analysis utilizing multiple wind products identifies a clear ENSO phase nonlinearity in the extent of this meridional wind movement and its dynamically linked changes in equatorial heat content. It is shown that the meridional wind movement and its <b>discharging</b> <b>effect</b> increase with increasing El Nino amplitude, while both remain relatively small regardless of La Nina amplitude. This result implies that asymmetries in {{the extent of the}} meridional wind shift may contribute to the observed asymmetry in the duration of El Nino and La Nina events.

40|$|Biometric {{identification}} for forensic {{investigations and}} security continues {{to depend on}} classic fingerprinting in many instances. Existing techniques rely on either visible deposits or hidden (latent) fingerprints resulting from the transfer of residues from the finger to the surface. However, one {{of the limitations of}} classic fingerprinting, for use as forensic evidence, is in determining a time sequence of events. It is extremely difficult to establish a timeline, from fingerprint evidence alone. We present the capability of a new technique which images the electrical charge deposited by tribocharging when a finger contacts an electrically insulated surface. The method is applicable to insulating surfaces and has been tested on PVC, PTFE, Acetate and PVDF sheets. The latent electrostatic charge pattern is detected using a novel, microscopic, electric potential sensor. The sensor is capable of imaging static charge distributions non-invasively, with no <b>discharging</b> <b>effect</b> on the sample. We present data showing the decay of the charge image with time, over a period up to 14 days. This capability has two major implications.

40|$|The {{dolus eventualis}} is an {{institute}} created doctrinally and jurisprudentially, {{on the border}} with conscious negligence, traditionally used by the jurisprudence {{to meet the needs of}} criminal policy in the presence of dangerous illegal activities. Recently, however, a new jurisprudence trend has been developed in order to apply the category of dolus eventualis also to other risk-based licit activities (eg, medical-surgical activity, traffic circulation and risky productive activities) in which, previously, it was considered almost automatically coincident guilt and failure in event prediction. The sentence with which the Court of Assizes of Turin has condemned the ceo of ThyssenKrupp ast for multiple manslaughter and arson – following the accident in which seven workers of the industry in Turin were killed – is the expression of this orientation of the courts. Addressing the mismanagement of the employer, the Assize of Turin has consistently applied the principle of effective delegation of tasks, considering ineffective a delegation that lacks in managerial and financial autonomy and that is not equipped with <b>discharging</b> <b>effect</b> against the employer’s responsibility for accident prevention. But in shaping the intentional responsibility (deceit) only for the ceo, courts have applied a jurisprudential track related to the dolus eventualis by the so-called Frank’s formula. According to this formula, the prediction of the possible event integrates the concept of deceit even if forecasting the same event as it certainly would not have retained the action-agent and would not take the significance of a decisive contrasting pattern. However, the so-called Frank’s formula is not convincing in any case: whether if we consider it as explanation of intentional responsibility, whether if we use it as tool to be used as proof of the intent. As matter of fact, that formula implies the replacement of a mere hypothesis of the real psychological attitude of the agent, which, even when used as a survey criterion and not as evidence, results in unnecessary and impossible probatio diabolica, producing risks of regression toward an “authorial” criminal law. The purely hypothetical nature of the justice, in fact, allows us to access the agent characteristics more then the intent of the fact. If you do not want sharing the doctrine based on the idea that the acceptance of risk can’t be considered the common element between dolus eventualis and conscious negligence. This represent an intent that fails, despite the odds, the subject acts (or omits to act) with the certainty of avoiding the event, the solution might be to predict, next to the intentional responsibility, a form of tort liability risk knowingly taken along the lines of recklessness in the criminal justice system of the various institutions of the English system or took en danger délibérée envisaged in the new French penal code and conscious desprecio por la vida de los Demas of the Spanish penal code...|$|E
