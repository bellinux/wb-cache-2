5|$|These studies, {{together}} with other analyses within each of these two orders, allowed the redistribution of the original genera of Liliaceae s.l. <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> families across the Liliales and Asparagales, as illustrated in Cladogram 1. This redistribution resulted in considerable changes both in the suprafamilial positioning of Liliaceae within the overall APG classification (as shown in Table 1 below), {{as well as the}} subfamilial structure (see Suprageneric subdivisions).|$|E
5|$|Jazz {{influenced}} many performers of all {{the major}} styles of later popular music, though jazz itself never again became such {{a major part of}} American popular music as during the swing era. The later 20th-century American jazz scene did, however, produce some popular crossover stars, such as Miles Davis. In the middle of the 20th century, jazz evolved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> subgenres, beginning with bebop. Bebop is a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, improvisation based on harmonic structure rather than melody, and use of the flatted fifth. Bebop was developed in the early and mid-1940s, later evolving into styles like hard bop and free jazz. Innovators of the style included Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, who arose from small jazz clubs in New York City.|$|E

5|$|Nanostructures of ZnO can be {{synthesized}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> morphologies including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can {{be obtained}} with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90°C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition (such as the zinc concentration and pH) or to the thermal treatment (such as the temperature and heating rate).|$|E
5|$|The Himalayas lies in {{the north}} {{of the state and the}} Bay of Bengal is at the south.

5|$|Joehana's {{works were}} commercially successful, and often {{adapted to the}} stage. His Rasiah nu Goreng Patut, for instance, was adapted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> forms, {{including}} as a Malay-language lenong, and a stage performance of Tjarios Eulis Atjih is recorded in Ciamis. Three films have been adapted from novels by Joehana, two from Tjarios Eulis Atjih and one from Rasiah nu Goreng Patut. The first, Eulis Atjih, was directed and produced by G. Krugers and released in 1927 to popular success. The second, generally referred to as Karnadi Anemer Bangkong, was adapted from Rasiah nu Goreng Patut by Krugers and released in the early 1930s; it {{is known to have}} been a commercial failure, reportedly raising controversy for depicting a Muslim man eating frog meat. The third adaptation of a Joehana novel, also titled Eulis Atjih, was completed by Rd Ariffien in 1954. Stage performances of Rasiah nu Goreng Patut continued as late as 1980, though by that time the work was considered by the general public as part of folklore.|$|E
