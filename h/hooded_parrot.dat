50|$|An Australian endemic, the <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> inhabits to {{semi-arid}} {{areas of}} northeast Northern Territory, and {{is separated from}} the golden-shouldered parrot by the Carpentarian faunal barrier.|$|E
50|$|Though {{this species}} has {{disappeared}} {{from most of}} its original range, it remains common in protected areas. The <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> is evaluated as Least Concern on IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> breeds readily {{in captivity}} {{but it can}} be aggressive, which precludes keeping it in a mixed aviary with other parrot species. It became much more popular in captivity in Australia in the 1980s. A yellow {{mutation}} has been bred.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International principally because it is home to a population of endangered Gouldian finches. It also supports chestnut-backed buttonquails, bush stone-curlews, varied lorikeets, northern rosellas, <b>hooded</b> <b>parrots,</b> white-gaped, yellow-tinted, bar-breasted and banded honeyeaters, masked and long-tailed finches, and silver-crowned friarbirds. [...] Other birds occasionally recorded from the IBA include the Australasian bittern, partridge pigeon, yellow-rumped munia and the northern subspecies of the crested shrike-tit.|$|R

5000|$|The archipelago, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Hart Island, has been identified by BirdLife International as a 110 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) because it contains over 1% of the world populations of short-tailed shearwaters (with an estimated maximum of 890,740 breeding pairs), white-faced storm-petrels (22,750 breeding pairs) and pied oystercatchers (about 250 individuals). [...] Other birds nesting in the IBA include little penguins (over 1000 pairs), Pacific gulls (about eight pairs), Caspian terns (about 250 pairs) and crested terns (at least 3000 pairs), as well as eastern reef egrets, ospreys, white-bellied sea eagles and <b>hooded</b> plovers. Rock <b>parrots</b> occur on Lounds Island and probably Smooth Island.|$|R
5000|$|Norwegian naturalist Robert Collett {{described}} the <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> in 1898. Its species name is the Latin word dissimilis [...] "different" [...] and either refers to its sexual dimorphism or its different appearance from its closest relative. Black-hooded parrot {{is an alternative}} name.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> (Psephotellus dissimilis) is {{a species}} of parrot native to the Northern Territory in Australia. It is found in savannah and open {{woodland}} {{and is one of}} two extant species in its genus that breed in termite mounds. It has declined from much of its original range.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> digs {{cavities}} in termite mounds. It generally chooses conical termite mounds, only {{successful in}} flat two dimensional mounds if it digs {{at the edge}} {{rather than on the}} face of the mound. Excavation takes around three weeks. The tunnel is roughly horizontal and around 50 to 80 cm long.|$|E
50|$|One {{of three}} species known as antbed parrots, the <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> {{is closely related}} to (and {{sometimes}} considered a subspecies of) the golden-shouldered parrot (Psephotus chrysopterygius). A genetic study revealed its ancestors most likely diverged from ancestors of the latter species in the late Miocene or early Pliocene {{at the conclusion of the}} 'Hill Gap'.|$|E
50|$|The {{golden-shouldered parrot}} (Psephotellus chrysopterygius) {{is a rare}} bird of {{southern}} Cape York Peninsula, in Queensland, Australia. A small parrot related to the more common red-rumped parrot, it {{is considered to be}} a superspecies with the <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> (P. dissimilis) of the Northern Territory and the apparently extinct paradise parrot of Queensland and New South Wales.|$|E
50|$|The male <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> can be {{distinguished}} from the similar looking male golden-shouldered parrot mainly {{by the absence of}} a pale frontal band, a larger yellow patch on the wings, and absence of the red on the abdomen. The female is very similar to the female Yellow-shouldered parrot being identified by the absence of a pale frontal band and an absence of red on the abdomen.|$|E
5000|$|The swamp is {{classified}} as an Important Bird Area. [...] It is a major breeding area for magpie geese. Other abundant waterbirds include wandering whistling ducks, Pacific black ducks and green pygmy geese. There are breeding colonies of royal spoonbills, little pied and little black cormorants, and darters. Land adjacent to the swamp supports {{one of the largest}} breeding populations of the <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> outside the Katherine area.|$|E
50|$|Some 11,246 km2 of Kakadu's savanna {{habitats}} {{has been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of the endangered Gouldian finch, the vulnerable red goshawk, the near threatened partridge pigeon and chestnut-backed button-quail, and the restricted-range <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> and rainbow pitta. The Kakadu Savanna IBA also supports varied lorikeets, northern rosellas, silver-crowned friarbirds, white-gaped, yellow-tinted, white-lined, bar-breasted and banded honeyeaters, sandstone shrike-thrushes, white-browed robins, canary white-eyes, and masked and long-tailed finches.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> is a {{medium-sized}} parrot, up to 26 cm long, weighing 50 to 60 g. The male has a black head, bluish-grey beak, dark-brown irises, and its wings have a yellow patch. Its upper-parts are brown, its lower parts are turquoise blue, its back is brown, the tail is olive green tipped pale blue, and its legs are pink-grey. The female is a dull-green parrot with a grey-brown head and pink undertail coverts. Juveniles {{are similar to}} the female.|$|E
50|$|From Darwin Dahl and Holm {{went to the}} Uniya Mission Station on the Daly River {{where they}} stayed for several months, making long trips by dinghy on the river and {{collecting}} specimens. They later travelled to the Victoria and Alligator Rivers where they collected two new pigeons and a parrot. The new birds were the chestnut-quilled rock-pigeon, the Arnhem Land subspecies of the banded fruit-dove, and the <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot,</b> all described by R. Collett in 1898 in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> has a close {{ecological}} {{relationship with}} the moth species Trisyntopa neossophila. The female moth lays eggs in the parrot nesting cavity, so that the eggs hatch {{at the same time}} as the baby hooded parrots. The moth larvae live in small tunnels at the base of the cavity and emerge to eat the dark material of parrot feces, leaving the white uric acid deposits. They build a silk layer across the base of the cavity to protect themselves from chicks. They pupate in the cavity walls once the juvenile parrots leave the nest.|$|E
50|$|Threatened or {{significant}} animal species recorded from Wongalara include the masked owl, Gouldian finch, crested shrike-tit, <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot,</b> red goshawk, northern quoll, kakadu dunnart and freshwater crocodile.Scientists {{come to the}} sanctuary {{during the dry season}} to trap and study mammals and conduct other research projects. By 2013 a 1000 km2 section of the property has been fenced to protect wildlife from feral pests. Feral cattle, buffalo, horses and pigs have all been excluded from the property. These animals all compete with natives for food and destroy the landscape and thin the vegetation. The cost of the 160 km fence is 500,000 with plans to fence the entire property creating the largest feral herbivore-free area in Australia.|$|E

40|$|Trisyntopa neossophila Edwards (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae) is {{an unusual}} moth whose {{breeding}} cycle is closely synchronised with a termite mound nesting parrot of northern Australia; the <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot</b> (Psephotus dissimilis Collet). T. neossophila {{is one of three}} coprophagous, nest dwelling moths in the genus Trisyntopa Lower 1918. True coprophagy is rare in the Lepidoptera, although some species occasionally consume faeces to gain rare nutrients. We present observations of the life cycle of T. neossophila, a moth that lays its eggs in the nest of a <b>hooded</b> <b>parrot,</b> so that larvae hatch in synchrony with the hatching of the parrot 2 Ì† 7 s eggs. The larvae spend their larval period in the nest and exclusively consume the excrement of the nestling parrots. When the parrot chicks fledge, the larvae move to the walls of the nest cavity to pupate, emerging the following wet season to repeat the process during the next parrot breeding season...|$|E
