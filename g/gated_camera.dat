40|$|The {{so-called}} {{roll bar}} measurement uses a heavy metal material, optically thick to x-rays, {{to form a}} shadow of the x-ray origination spot. This spot is where an energetic electron beam interacts with a high Z target. The material (the "roll bar") is slightly curved to avoid alignment problems. The roll bar is constructed and positioned so that the x-rays are shadowed in the horizontal and vertical directions, so information is obtained in two dimensions. If a beam profile is assumed (or measured by other means), the equivalent x-ray spot size can be calculated from the x-ray shadow cast by the roll bar. Thus the ellipticity of the beam can be calculated, assuming the ellipse of the x-ray spot is aligned with the roll bar.

40|$|Abstract: The paper reports {{development}} of an FPGA-based control for a range-gated imaging system where real-time image and video processing is desired. The imaging system uses a pulsed laser for illumination and a <b>gated</b> <b>camera</b> for capturing images at desired distances. We demonstrate that FPGA can control the most important functions of the system, i. e. timing and synchronization of gating. In addition, FPGA can perform various image processing tasks, both in the image domain (enhancement of individual gated images) and the time domain (e. g. fusion of several gated images, ambient light removal). The results show that FPGA-based control is a feasible solution for gated imaging systems working under tight time and visibility requirements in real-time applications.

Conclusions about the performance of the camera system have been done, based on resolution and contrast measurements during the field trials.

40|$|The {{electron}} gun of the CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF 3) produces 15. 6 µs long pulses with an energy of 140 keV and a current {{that can be}} as high as 9 A. For the nominal beam operation a 5. 4 A beam current is generated and sent downstream into the bunching system {{and the rest of the}} accelerator. The corresponding beam charge will induce a thermal load that most of the materials, considered as radiators, would not withstand. With this problem in mind, we have built a beam imaging system, installed just after the gun and equipped with two screens. The first one is a phosphorescent screen which yields a high signal and can be for low beam currents. The second screen, a thin graphite foil, is used as a forward OTR radiator and can stand the full beam intensity. Moreover, the time resolution of OTR is very good, in the femtosecond range.

40|$|AbstractThe Japan Spallation Neutron Source (JSNS) at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) was {{developed}} as a 1 - MW spallation neutron source. A Ag-In-Cd alloy {{was used as the}} decoupler material in two decoupled moderators. Although the Ag-In-Cd decoupler brings about superior neutronic performance, it has the disadvantage of high residual radioactivity. A Au-In- Cd alloy has been proposed as a solution to this problem. Recently, we successfully produced a ternary Au-In-Cd alloy. The alloy composition was 74. 9 at% Au, 0. 5 at% In, and 24. 6 at% Cd. The distribution of the elements in the alloy was first determined by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. However, it was difficult to measure the In distribution by EDX because the amount of In is very small, and its spectrum {{is similar to that of}} Cd. Therefore, pulsed neutron imaging using both a time <b>gated</b> <b>camera</b> system and a multi-channel plate detector was performed to measure the elements in the Au-In-Cd alloy.
