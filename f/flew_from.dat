5|$|King George V died on 20 January 1936, and Edward {{ascended the}} throne as King Edward VIII. The next day, {{accompanied}} by Simpson, he broke with custom {{by watching the}} proclamation of his own accession from a window of St James's Palace. He became the first monarch of the British Empire to fly in an aircraft when he <b>flew</b> <b>from</b> Sandringham to London for his Accession Council.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron {{was formed}} as a {{transport}} unit at RAAF Base Richmond near Sydney on 15 September 1943. Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons, the squadron conducted its first operation on 17 December, when one of its aircraft <b>flew</b> <b>from</b> Richmond to RAAF Base Darwin.

25|$|Merchant ships often fly a flag {{identifying}} which company {{owns the}} vessel. This was formerly <b>flown</b> <b>from</b> the mainmast {{but is now}} usually <b>flown</b> <b>from</b> the jackstaff.|$|R
50|$|The blue {{corporal}} has {{a single}} brood per year. It mates on the wing. The female, guarded by the male, who hovers above her, deposits her eggs immediately after mating, dipping her abdomen into the water to do so. She spreads her eggs out, spacing them several meters apart {{around the perimeter of}} a pond; overall, she lays few eggs in any one site. The young develop synchronously, which increases the amount of intraspecific competition between them. The blue corporal overwinters as a final instar nymph, and the entire population of an area emerges over a one-month period in early spring. The flight period varies with latitude. For example, it <b>flies</b> <b>from</b> November to May in Florida, while in Louisiana it <b>flies</b> <b>from</b> February to May. Further north, it emerges later. In South Carolina, it <b>flies</b> <b>from</b> late March until early May, while in Kansas it <b>flies</b> <b>from</b> April to May. In Ohio and Kentucky, it <b>flies</b> <b>from</b> April to June, and in New Jersey, it <b>flies</b> <b>from</b> April to July.|$|R

Production Hunters were fitted with either the Avon or the Sapphire engine.|$|E
5|$|Again, on {{the same}} day, the Vichy French {{government}} issued orders for the naval base and city of Gibraltar to be bombarded. As a result, six bomber squadrons of the Vichy French Air Force (Armée de l'Air de Vichy) and four squadrons of the Vichy French Navy (Marine nationale de Vichy) were employed in the operation. The 64 bombers <b>flew</b> <b>from</b> bases in Oran, Tafaroui (in Algeria), Meknes, Mediouna, and Port Lyautey (in Morocco). The French action was approved by both the German Armistice Commission and the Italian Armistice Commission.|$|E
5|$|Andrey Lugovoy {{has said}} he <b>flew</b> <b>from</b> London to Moscow on a 3 November flight. He stated he arrived in London on 31 October to attend the {{football}} match between Arsenal and CSKA Moscow on 1 November. When the news broke that a radioactive substance {{had been used to}} murder Litvinenko, a team of scientists rushed to find out how far the contamination had spread. It led them on a trail involving hundreds of people and dozens of locations.|$|E
50|$|Destination open-jaw, where a {{passenger}} <b>flies</b> <b>from</b> one city to another, but {{returns to the}} original city from a different place. For example, depart London to New York, but on the return trip <b>fly</b> <b>from</b> Boston to London.|$|R

Bassist Matt Snell joined in early 2006. Later that year, Bathory contacted former Motograter vocalist Ivan Moody, sending him some of the material the band had recorded {{and asked him to}} audition for the vocalist position. Moody <b>flew</b> <b>from</b> his home in Denver, Colorado to Los Angeles and quickly began recording material with the band.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, President Richard Nixon {{stopped at}} Loring on 3 July in Air Force One (SAM 27000) as he {{returned}} from a summit in Moscow, where he and Leonid Breshnev had signed the Threshold Test Ban Treaty.

5|$|Later in 1962, United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara visited South Vietnam and {{was taken}} on an {{inspection}} tour of the country, accompanied by Diệm and Thảo. Perhaps because Thảo divulged the tour details to Vietcong guerrillas, each of McNamara's stopovers was punctuated by bloody attacks on nearby ARVN installations. For example, when McNamara was in Bình Dương Province, five government soldiers were killed. As he <b>flew</b> <b>from</b> Đà Lạt north to Đà Nẵng near the Demilitarized Zone, he was greeted by a Vietcong bombing of a southbound troop train, which killed 27 and wounded 30 Civil Guard members.|$|E
5|$|Military flights {{also used}} Fairbanks as a base. In 1920, {{the first flight}} from the {{continental}} United States to Alaska used Fairbanks as a base. In 1934, a flight of Martin B-10 bombers <b>flew</b> <b>from</b> Washington, D.C. to Fairbanks, ostensibly to demonstrate the feasibility of long-range bomber deployments. In reality, the bombers flew photographic missions intended to scout locations for military airfields {{to be built in}} the territory.|$|E
5|$|Olds, whose B-17s were {{deployed}} to Olmsted Field in Harrisburg, {{was given the}} assignment of locating the Rex as far at sea as possible, and assigned Major Vincent J. Meloy, the commanding officer of the 20th Bomb Squadron, to act as nominal head of the Black Force. Olds selected three aircraft from the 49th Bomb Squadron for the mission. On the afternoon of 11 May 1937, Olds and his crews <b>flew</b> <b>from</b> Olmsted to the staging base at Mitchel Field on Long Island.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1950, in {{the middle}} of a holiday in Italy, Pontecorvo {{abruptly}} <b>flew</b> <b>from</b> Rome for Stockholm with his wife and three sons without informing friends or relatives. On 2 September he was helped by Soviet agents to enter the Soviet Union from Finland. His abrupt disappearance caused much concern to many of the western intelligence services, especially those of Britain, Canada and the United States, that were worried about the escape of atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, and of Finland and Sweden, through which Pontecorvo and Marianne had been allowed to travel without valid passports and visas.|$|E
5|$|On 12 December 1964, Barrel Roll was {{approved}} by Souvanna Phouma. The program originally consisted of only two U.S bombing sorties per week that were to be conducted {{by no more than}} four aircraft in each strike. Due {{to the nature of the}} American agreement with the Thai government (most U.S. strike aircraft <b>flew</b> <b>from</b> bases in Thailand), the aircraft had to first fly to South Vietnam, land, and then take off again for Laos. By 24 December, six armed reconnaissance missions were being conducted per day, but the hoped for reaction from Hanoi did not materialize.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1998, Braathens bought Malmö Aviation, that <b>flew</b> <b>from</b> Stockholm-Bromma Airport to Göteborg Landvetter Airport and Malmö Airport.

In 1997, it had 772,000 passengers, 450 employees, a revenue of SEK900 {{million and a}} profit of SEK40 million. The airline cost SEK600 million and the deal gave Braathens and Malmö Aviation a 25% domestic market share in Sweden.|$|E
