HandCrafting Justice also supported the women financially through their employment, allowing them to provide for their families and to improve their own lives. HandCrafting Justice, Inc. (HCJ) Board of Directors announced that HCJ would be closing on January 31, 2016. The fair trade ministry of Sisters of the Good Shepherd in the USA announced the news on January 14. HandCrafting Justice sold much of its remaining U.S. inventory in January through online <b>discount</b> <b>sales.</b> Buyers purchased what was left at cost and the remaining goods have been donated to charity. With the affirmation of the Good Shepherd Membership Board and the Board of Directors, the Attorney General will be asked to release any remaining funds to the Good Shepherd Mission Development Office in Rome to continue the work of capacity building for women. The HandCrafting Justice website has closed and has a statement thanking all of the benefactors who have supported HCJ over the years. The website also carries a statement notifying visitors that HandCrafting Justice is closed and the office is closed.

Thus, an experiment involving 613 students was conducted. The hypotheses predicted that a product with discount promotion would relate positively with impulsivity, as well as with a hedonic perception about the good offered, and negatively with the perception of financial risk associated with the product offered with discount. A positive moderation was expected of the perceived attractiveness of the announced discount promotion on the intentions of behaviors. The results confirmed the hypothesis, indicating positive effects of impulsivity and hedonic perception by purchasing the discounted products, in addition to the negative link between the intention of purchasing discounted products and the perception of a financial risk. The moderating effects were not confirmed. Final considerations conclude the work...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We exploit {{a natural}} {{experiment}} in Denmark to investigate when forced sales lead to fire <b>sale</b> <b>discounts.</b> Forced <b>sales</b> result from sudden deaths of house owners in an institutional {{environment in which}} beneficiaries are forced to settle the estate, and hence sell the house, within 12 months. We identify 6, 329 forced sales by suddenly deceased house owners, and find that forced sales bring in lower prices than do comparable houses as the deadline winds down: We find no <b>discounts</b> for <b>sales</b> long before the deadline, and discounts of 12. 5 % for sales shortly before the deadline. Market conditions also affect the average discount. Discounts are larger when house prices contract and in thin markets where demand is lower. We also find larger <b>discounts</b> when the <b>sale</b> {{is more likely to}} be a fire sale, either because the estate or the beneficiaries are financially constrained. Overall, our results characterize market conditions under which forced sales lead to fire <b>sale</b> <b>discounts...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper uses data on {{purchases}} of Nordic Swan Eco-labeled toilet paper and paper towels by individual Danish households {{to analyze the}} determinants of demand for eco-labeled goods and the decision process underlying it. Among several models that are estimated, a double-hurdle model that distinguishes between factors influencing the discrete decision to participate by purchasing an eco-labeled good and the continuous decision about the quantity of the eco-labeled good to be purchased is found to fit the data best. We find that prices as well as consumer tastes and preferences, proxied by their socio-demographic characteristics, have a much stronger impact on the participation decision than on quantity consumed for both Swan-labeled toilet paper and paper towels. The quantity consumed of Swan-labeled goods, on the other hand, is strongly affected by factors such as availability of Swan goods in shops, <b>discount</b> <b>sales</b> on Swan goods, and household size.

40|$|Consumer {{responses}} to clearance sales, {{both in terms}} of consumer satisfaction with the decision process and in terms of subsequent store choice behavior, are explored in the paper through four controlled experiments conducted involving clearance sales in a consumer choice and decision satisfaction context. The results suggest that consumer response to clearance sales is driven to a large extent by two factors: the effect of a clearance sale on the available options of goods and the degree of store loyalty. Response to a clearance sale was found to be a function of two primary forces-the degree to which a consumer was personally committed to the <b>discount</b> <b>sales</b> alternative, and changes in the difficulty of making a decision due to limitation of buying options. Overall, the discussion of results of the four studies presented in the paper demonstrates that consumer response to clearance sales, {{both in terms of}} decision satisfaction levels and observed store-loyalty behavior, are strongly influenced by the variables of price sensitivity, attractiveness of products, store-loyalty and perceived value on available brands.
