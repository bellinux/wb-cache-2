5|$|Like Pedra Branca, the Sultan of Johor {{held the}} {{original}} ancient title to Middle Rocks. As Singapore had not exercised any {{rights as a}} sovereign over Middle Rocks, the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty over this maritime feature. As for South Ledge, the ICJ noted that it fell within the apparently overlapping territorial waters of mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As the Court had not been mandated to <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of delimitation {{with respect to the}} territorial waters of Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question, it simply held that sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, the US Eighth Army {{issued an}} {{operational}} directive to all UN ground forces in Korea for their planned withdrawal {{east of the}} Naktong River. UN units would then establish main defensive positions behind {{what was to be}} called the Pusan Perimeter. The intent was to <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> on retreating and hold off the Korean People's Army while the U.S. Army built up its forces and launch a counteroffensive. The US 25th Infantry Division held the southernmost flank at Masan, while the 24th Infantry Division withdrew to Koch'ang. The 1st Cavalry Division withdrew to Waegwan. US forces demolished all bridges over the Naktong River in the retreat. At one bridge in the 1st Cavalry Division sector, the division commander attempted several times to clear refugees from the bridge but they continued to cross it despite warnings and several attempts to clear the bridge. Eventually the commander was forced to demolish the bridge, taking several hundred refugees with it.|$|E

25|$|A muzzle gag {{works in}} a similar way as an over-the-mouth gag, only that they are usually made of leather, are {{fastened}} around the head with buckles and straps, and cover {{the lower part of the}} face. It is so called because it resembles a muzzle used on animals, with a flexible pad which straps over the mouth, and sometimes also around the cheeks and chin. Muzzle gags have a strong psychological effect on some people, because of the association of being restrained in a way generally associated with animals. Restricting movement of the jaw and covering the cheeks can both increase the efficiency of a gag. It is difficult to <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between a muzzle gag and a head harness with an attached gag.|$|E

25|$|The US and Western Europe have strict {{codes of}} ethics and {{regulations}} in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells, {{though there is a}} vast difference in the regulatory framework. Through the creation of human-chimera comes the question: where does society now <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and man. Legal debate would be {{the next step in the}} process to determine whether certain chimera should be granted legal rights. Along with issues regarding the rights of chimera, individuals have expressed concern whether or not creating human-chimera diminishes the dignity of being human.|$|E

500|$|Aerosmith's next {{album was}} 1977's <b>Draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>Line.</b> The album's {{recording}} {{was affected by}} {{the excesses of the}} band members, but the record still had memorable moments. The title track charted just shy of the Top 40 and remains a live staple, and [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] also charted. The album went on to sell 2 million copies. The band toured extensively in support of the album, however drug abuse and the fast-paced life of touring and recording began affecting their performances. Lead singer Steven Tyler and lead guitarist Joe Perry became known as [...] "the Toxic Twins" [...] because of their notorious abuse of drugs on and off the stage. While continuing to tour and record into the late 1970s, Aerosmith acted in the movie version of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Their cover of the Beatles hit [...] "Come Together" [...] was included in the album's soundtrack and would be the band's last Top 40 hit for nearly 10 years. The live release Live! Bootleg, originally released as a double album, was put out in 1978 and captured the band's rawness during the heyday of the <b>Draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> tour.

500|$|Like many {{of their}} 1970s contemporaries {{including}} Led Zeppelin and Alice Cooper, the members of Aerosmith were prone to excess and debauchery. Drug consumption was rampant; the recording sessions for 1976's Rocks and 1977's <b>Draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> were especially noted for their substance indulgence, including heroin. In the words of Bebe Buell, [...] "They [...] were like a gang of kids with their own planes, Porsches, millions of dollars, limitless resources. [...] Mick Jagger and Jimmy Page had control, but these boys did not care. They won the prize, hands down, for the rowdiest rock 'n' roll band in that era. No question." ...|$|E
