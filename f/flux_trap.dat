The reactor operates at a ten megawatt power level. Samples are placed in three strategically positioned canisters situated in the <b>flux</b> <b>trap</b> zone of the nuclear reactor core. Heat is removed from the core by water flowing through it, as well as through the <b>flux</b> <b>trap.</b> The trap consists of three vertical cylinders 4 meters long which are encased inside one bigger cylinder, inside every cylinder there is one canister, where the samples are placed. Pool water at a high mass flow rate is pumped inside and around the cylinders to partially cool the reactor core (the main portion of the flow is directly through the core). The purpose of the research is to model the MURR using Fluent Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, to visually project the pool water flow and heat transfer in the <b>flux</b> <b>trap</b> to enable possible improved positioning of the irradiation samples.

University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) is the highest power university research reactor in America. It has been supplying various radioisotopes for more than 20 years. The <b>flux</b> <b>trap,</b> locating in the center island tube, has the highest flux for sample irradiating with an ability of 6 x 1014 n/cm 2 /s. It is very important for the MURR to be able to predict the reactivity worth of sample loading in the <b>flux</b> <b>trap,</b> as well as the production of specific isotopes. The research develops MURR <b>Flux</b> <b>Trap</b> Model (MFTM) which simulates the reactor core and <b>flux</b> <b>trap</b> area, solves the neutron transport equation and calculates the loading worth based on the Monte Carol method, proceeds with burnup and decay calculation, and predicts the requested isotope production. MCNP part of the MFTM model carries out neutron transport calculations and predicts the reactivity worth of sample loading in the <b>flux</b> <b>trap</b> while MonteBurns part of the model calculates isotope production from the target sample irradiated in the <b>flux</b> <b>trap</b> by solving the general nuclide depletion equation. Different sample loadings and their measurement data have been provided by the MURR for benchmarking the model during the developing period. The discrepancy between the model and the corresponding experimental data has been analyzed. Over-prediction of the negative worth of KCl samples was determined to be the cause of most of the deviation between the model and experimentally measured results. The original MCNP model has been refined with the consideration of the self-shielding effect and burnup effect. The modified model has yielded better predictions approaching the experimental values. The MCNP and MonteBurns models were integrated into an automatic analytic tool with Visual Basic language for efficient usage by the MURR.

40|$|Worldwide, {{there is}} limited test reactor {{capacity}} to perform the required irradiation experiments on advanced fast reactor materials and fuel designs. This is particularly true in the U. S., which no longer has an operating fast reactor but depends upon two aging thermal reactors for testing the behavior of various materials in an irradiation environment. The MIT research reactor is planning for a new core to end the need for highly enriched uranium and operate the reactor with uranium enrichments under 20 %. This study explores {{the use of the}} central region in the newly proposed MIT reactor core to boost the production of fast neutrons, thus making the new core more beneficial for materials testing. The Fast <b>Flux</b> <b>Trap</b> introduces a region of fissile material surrounding a central irradiation facility which is cooled by liquid lead-bismuth eutectic. This arrangement maximizes the fast neutron production by avoiding neutron moderation in the center. The fissile material, arranged in a tight hexagonal pin array, can be uranium enriched in either 235 U or 233 U, to the limit allowable for non-proliferation. Insertion of the Fast <b>Flux</b> <b>Trap</b> in the proposed low enriched uranium core operated at a 10 MW power level, can provide a 252 %- 271 % higher fast neutron flux than the previously proposed designs with low enriched fuel for the MIT research reactor and a 235 %- 253 % higher fast neutron flux than the existing highly enriched uranium MITR-II core at 5 MW. (cont.) This new core fast flux capability is within a factor of 2 to 4 of the much larger national test reactors, the Advanced Test Reactor and the High Flux Isotope Reactor, and hence can allow the MIT research reactor to be more useful for fast irradiation. The work covered both steady state and transient events involving the Fast <b>Flux</b> <b>Trap,</b> using the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) transport code. It was shown that the power distribution within the Fast <b>Flux</b> <b>Trap</b> pins as well as the plates {{in the rest of the}} core will be satisfactory; or in other words, no excessive power peaking will develop. The limits of the Fast <b>Flux</b> <b>Trap</b> lifetime were found to exceed the expected licensing time of the new core. Furthermore, the reactivity implications of metallic coolant leaks, water flooding of the Fast <b>Flux</b> <b>Trap</b> and various possible test materials were all found to be acceptable. The loss of flow following a pump trip event was analyzed using the RELAP 5 - 3 D code, and found not to result in excessive temperatures with regards to materials strength and corrosion resistance. While the specific design developed in this dissertation is particular to the MIT research reactor core, the Fast <b>Flux</b> <b>Trap</b> design concept can potentially be applied in other reactor cores so that other thermal spectrum research and test reactor facilities can benefit from this enhanced capability. by Tyler Shawn Ellis.

40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) is a {{high power}} and high neutron flux {{research}} reactor operating in the United States. Powered with highly enriched uranium (HEU), the ATR has a maximum thermal power rating of 250 MWth. Because of the high total core power and high neutron flux, the ATR is an ideal candidate for assessing the feasibility of converting an HEU driven reactor to a low-enriched core. An optimized low-enriched uranium (LEU) (U- 10 Mo) core conversion case, which can meet the project requirements, has been selected. However, LEU contains a significant quantity of high density U- 238 (80. 3 wt. %), which will harden the neutron spectrum in the core region. Based on the reference ATR HEU and the optimized LEU full core plate-by-plate (PBP) models, the present work investigates and compares the neutron spectra differences in the fuel element (FE), Northeast <b>flux</b> <b>trap</b> (NEFT), Southeast <b>flux</b> <b>trap</b> (SEFT), and East <b>flux</b> <b>trap</b> (EFT) positions. A detailed PBP MCNP ATR core model was developed and validated for fuel cycle burnup comparison analysis. The current ATR core with HEU U 235 enrichment of 93. 0 wt. % {{was used as the}} reference model. Each HEU fuel element contains 19 fuel plates with a fuel meat thickness of 0. 508 mm (20 mil). In this work, an optimized LEU (U- 10 Mo) core conversion case with a nominal fuel meat thickness of 0. 330 mm (13 mil) and the U- 235 enrichment of 19. 7 wt. % was used to calculate the impact of the neutron spectrum in FE and FT positions. MCNP-calculated results show that the neutron spectrum in the LEU FE is slightly harder than in the HEU FE, as expected. However, when neutrons transport through water coolant and beryllium (Be), the neutrons are thermalized to an equilibrium neutron spectrum as a function of water volume fraction in the investigated FT positions. As a result, the neutron spectrum differences of the HEU and LEU in the NEFT, SEFT, and EFT are negligible. To demonstrate that the LEU core fuel cycle performance can meet the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) safety requirements, additional studies will be necessary to evaluate and compare safety parameters such as void reactivity and Doppler coefficients, control components worth (outer shim control cylinders, safety rods and regulating rod), and shutdown margins between the HEU and LEU cores...|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} {{introduced by}} the geomagnetic field in several regions of a coaxial gun plasma device is described. It is shown that the annihilation of the swept-up geomagnetic <b>flux,</b> <b>trapped</b> within the highly compressed turbulent plasma, provides an explanation for varied performance and experimental results. The {{results indicate that the}} device should be aligned along the direction of the local geomagnetic field or enclosed in a mu-metal shield...|$|R
