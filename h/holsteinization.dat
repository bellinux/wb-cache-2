40|$|The aim of Master work is {{to valuate}} Lithuanian black and white cows {{productivity}} and milk composition considering the blood dimensions of holstein breed. All data had been made through statistical analysis by EXCEL computation {{as well as by}} statistical package „R“ ([URL] in the LVA Laboratory of Animals Research of Breeding Worth and Selection. It was stated that the average of the <b>Holsteinization</b> grade of the researched cows in stock was 79, 38 percent, and only 7, 1 percent of the researched cows average of the <b>Holsteinization</b> grade didn’t reach 50 percent. Intermediate correlation between the milk productivity and milk protein was found an unfavourable but statistical reliable coherence (r=- 0, 346, p< 0, 001) The highest milk productivity was by cows with <b>Holsteinization</b> grade of 87, 5 - 98, 5 percent, the best milk fat consistence in percent 62, 5 - 74, 0 percent of <b>Holsteinization</b> grade cows, and the best milk protein consistence was by cows with <b>Holsteinization</b> grade reaching up to 50 percent. Having developed <b>holsteinization</b> grade in a stock, the percent of cows productivity was set the little statistical reliable coherence (r= 0, 224, p< 0, 01). The greatest number of somatic cells (532, 7 thousand/ml.) was found in milk of cows which had the <b>holsteinization</b> grade to 50 and 50, 0 - 62, 4 percent...|$|E
40|$|In the 1970 s and 1980 s Dutch farmers {{replaced}} their dual-purpose Friesian cows with Holsteins, {{a highly}} specialized American dairy breed. The changeover {{was related to}} a major turnabout in breeding practices that involved the adoption of quantitative genetics. Dutch commercial breeders had long resisted the quantitative approach to breeding that scientists had been recommending since World War II. After about 1970, however, they gave up their resistance: the art of breeding, it was said, finally became a science. In historical overviews this turnabout is {{seen as part of}} what is called the “modernization project” in Dutch agriculture that the government instigated after the war. Economic developments are assumed to have necessitated this project, and specialization of production is seen as a natural consequence. This essay argues that the idea that the art of breeding was turned into a science is to a certain extent misleading. Furthermore, it aims to show that economic pressures and government policies cannot adequately explain the turn toward Holsteins. A better understanding can be obtained by framing the <b>Holsteinization</b> process {{as the result of a}} changeover in breeding culture—that is, in the ensemble of shared convictions, beliefs, conventions, methods, practices, and the like that characterized practical cattle breeding and that involved scientific, technical, economic, aesthetic, normative, and commercial considerations...|$|E
