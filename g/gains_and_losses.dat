40|$|Controlling the {{balanced}} <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> in a PT-symmetric {{system is a}} rather challenging task. Utilizing Floquet theory, we explore the constructive role of periodic modulation in controlling the <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> of a PT-symmetric optical coupler. It is found that the <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> of the system can be manipulated by applying a periodic modulation. Further, such an original non-Hermitian system can even be modulated into an effective Hermitian system derived by the high-frequency Floquet method. Therefore, compared with other PT symmetry control schemes, our protocol can modulate the unbroken PT-symmetric range to a wider parameter region. Our results provide a promising approach for controlling the <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> of a realistic system. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{evolutionary}} {{analysis of}} presence and absence profiles (phyletic patterns) {{is widely used}} in biology. It is assumed that the observed phyletic pattern {{is the result of}} <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> dynamics along a phylogenetic tree. Examples of characters that are represented by phyletic patterns include restriction sites, gene families, introns and indels, to name a few. Here, we present a user-friendly web server that accurately infers branch-specific <b>and</b> site-specific <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> events. The novel inference methodology is based on a stochastic mapping approach utilizing models that reliably capture the underlying evolutionary processes. A variety of features are available including the ability to analyze the data with various evolutionary models, to infer <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> events using either stochastic mapping or maximum parsimony, <b>and</b> to estimate <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> rates for each character analyzed...|$|R

25|$|For various reasons, an {{approach}} based on cardinal utility, where the utility has a meaning beyond just giving a ranking of alternatives, is not common in contemporary economics. However, once one adopts that approach, one can take intensities of preferences into consideration, or one can compare (i) <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> of utility or (ii) levels of utility, across different individuals. In particular, Harsanyi (1955) gives a justification of utilitarianism (which evaluates alternatives {{in terms of}} the sum of individual utilities), originating from Jeremy Bentham. Hammond (1976) gives a justification of the maximin principle (which evaluates alternatives {{in terms of the}} utility of the worst-off individual), originating from John Rawls.|$|E
40|$|Introns that {{interrupt}} eukaryotic protein-coding sequences {{are generally}} {{thought to be}} nonfunctional. However, for reasons still poorly understood, positions of many introns are highly conserved in evolution. Previous reconstructions of intron <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> events during eukaryotic evolution {{used a variety of}} simplified evolutionary models that yielded contradicting conclusions and are not suited to reveal some of the key underlying processes. We combine a comprehensive probabilistic model and an extended data set, including 391 conserved genes from 19 eukaryotes, to uncover previously unnoticed aspects of intron evolution—in particular, to assign intron <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> rates to individual genes. The rates of intron <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> in a gene show moderate positive correlation. A gene’s intron gain rate shows a highly significant negative correlation with the coding-sequence evolution rate; intron loss rate also significantly, but positively, correlates with the sequence evolution rate. Correlations of the opposite signs, albeit less significant ones, are observed between intron <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> rates <b>and</b> gene expression level. It is proposed that intron evolution includes a neutral component, which is manifest in the positive correlation between the <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> rates <b>and</b> a selection-driven component as reflected in the links between intron <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> sequence evolution. The increased intron <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> decreased intron <b>loss</b> in evolutionarily conserved genes indicate that intron insertion often might be adaptive, whereas some of the intron losses might be deleterious. This apparent functional importance of introns is likely to be due, at least in part, to their multiple effects on gene expression...|$|R
