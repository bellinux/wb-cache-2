5|$|Emulsions are {{a type of}} colloid {{in which}} surface tension plays a role.

5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost no frosts. The species can occur <b>in</b> <b>pure</b> stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved paperbark).|$|E
5|$|Isolated vacancy is {{the most}} studied defect in diamond, both {{experimentally}} and theoretically.

5|$|The alkali metals, due {{to their}} high reactivity, do not occur {{naturally}} <b>in</b> <b>pure</b> form in nature.

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the Technical University of Berlin, Wigner worked {{as an assistant to}} Karl Weissenberg and Richard Becker at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and David Hilbert at the University of Göttingen. Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into physics, particularly the theory of symmetry in physics. Along the way he performed ground-breaking work <b>in</b> <b>pure</b> mathematics, in which he authored a number of mathematical theorems. In particular, Wigner's theorem is a cornerstone in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. He is also known for his research into the structure of the atomic nucleus. In 1930, Princeton University recruited Wigner, along with John von Neumann, and he moved to the United States.|$|E

In its rediscounting actions the BNA was not engaged <b>in</b> <b>pure</b> lender of last resort actions, following Bagehot's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate.

40|$|Numerical and {{analytical}} {{investigations of the}} hydraulic fracture propagation problem, from a cased and cemented wellbore, have been pursued in this communication. A two-dimensional plane model has been used. Pure bond and pure slip boundary conditions, along the steel/cement and the cement/rock interfaces have been implemented, as two extreme cases. Both the in-plane and the anti-plane problems have been considered. Analytical and numerical methods have been applied {{to the problem of}} a straight fracture, while in the curved crack case only a numerical solution has been adopted. Crack turning is found to depend on the elastic properties of the rock <b>in</b> the <b>pure</b> bond case, while <b>in</b> the <b>pure</b> slip case no turning occurs. Results indicate that <b>in</b> the <b>pure</b> slip case, a larger pressure than that of the pure bond case, is required at the first propagation step. Results related to a starter (i. e. at the first propagation step) crack lying parallel to the plane of the maximum remote principal stress while the elastic modulus of the rock varies, indicate that bigger values, for both the pressure and the mode I crack opening displacement (COD) at the open hole, develop <b>in</b> the <b>pure</b> slip case than <b>in</b> the <b>pure</b> bond case. Results concerning a starter crack, inclined at varying angles with respect to the plane of the maximum remote principal stress, show that the mode II COD at the open hole is bigger <b>in</b> the <b>pure</b> bond case than <b>in</b> the <b>pure</b> slip case, for all the angles of inclination.

5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare can {{be grown}} <b>in</b> <b>pure</b> culture on agar-containing plates {{supplemented}} with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six weeks from the initial inoculation. The mycelium is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae that extend above {{the surface of the}} agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6mm and 15mm from the initial inoculum spot, with each zone roughly 4mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated <b>in</b> <b>pure</b> form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E

5|$|Of all metals <b>in</b> <b>pure</b> form, {{tungsten}} has {{the highest}} melting point (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|Regardless {{of whether}} Calabi–Yau compactifications of string theory provide a correct {{description}} of nature, {{the existence of}} the mirror duality between different string theories has significant mathematical consequences. The Calabi–Yau manifolds used in string theory are of interest <b>in</b> <b>pure</b> mathematics, and mirror symmetry allows mathematicians to solve problems in enumerative algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the numbers of solutions to geometric questions. A classical problem of enumerative geometry is to enumerate the rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold such as the one illustrated above. By applying mirror symmetry, mathematicians have translated this problem into an equivalent problem for the mirror Calabi–Yau, which turns out to be easier to solve.|$|E
