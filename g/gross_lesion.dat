40|$|We {{surveyed}} the reefs of Grande Terre, New Caledonia, for coral diseases in 2010 and 2013. Lesions encountered in hard and soft corals were systematically described at the gross and microscopic level. We sampled paired and normal tissues from 101 and 65 colonies in 2010 and 2013, respectively, comprising 51 species of corals from 27 genera. Tissue loss {{was the most}} common <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> sampled (40 %) followed by discoloration (28 %), growth anomalies (13 %), bleaching (10 %), and flatworm infestation (1 %). When grouped by gross lesions, the diversity of microscopic lesions as measured by Shannon-Wiener index was highest for tissue loss, followed by discoloration, bleaching, and growth anomaly. Our findings document an extension of the range of certain diseases such as Porites trematodiasis and endolithic hypermycosis (dark spots) to the Western Pacific as well as the presence of a putative cnidarian endosymbiont. We also expand the range of species infected by cell-associated microbial aggregates, and confirm the trend that these aggregates predominate in dominant genera of corals in the Indo-Pacific. This study highlights the importance of including histopathology as an integral component of baseline coral disease surveys, because a given <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> might be associated with multiple potential causative agents.

40|$|Background: Bovine Tuberculosis (bTN) {{elimination}} {{programs are}} based on test-and-slaughter strategies. No diagnostic test used in the control of Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB), a zoonotic disease, is a perfect gold standard having a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100 %. Methods: To find relevant data to assess diagnostic accuracy of one variant of the tuberculin test, the Single Intradermal Comparative Cervical Tuberculin Test (SICCT) used in the diagnosis of bTB a systematic literature search was performed. To estimate diagnostic test accuracies of the SICCT, a Bayesian latent class analysis has been undertaken. Results: Only one eligible study was found. Assuming bacterial isolation has a specificity of 100 %, specificity of <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> detection and histopathology were estimated as 90 % and 97 % respectively. Estimates of {{the sensitivity of the}} Single Intradermal Comparative Cervical Tuberculin Test (SICCT), <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> detection, histopathology and bacteriological isolation were 80 %, 89 %, 93 % and 98 % respectively. The design of this study precluded estimating the SICCT specificity, although official UK surveillance data indicates specificity greater than 99. 67 %. Conclusion: Studies to estimate the diagnostic performance of key tests for bTB are lacking, yet essential for an informed debate in regard to bTB public health policy...|$|E
40|$|Mice {{infected}} {{with a single}} worm pair of a Japanese, a Philippine and a Formosan strain of Schistosoma j ponicum were examined to determine the frequency of movement of worms within the mesenteric veins eight to 76 weeks after infection.

40|$|The {{effect of}} breed of chicken on {{infection}} with an arthrotropic avian reovirus (strain R 2) was studied by oral or footpad inoculation of day-old chicks of the SPF light-hybrid, commercial White Leghorn egg-layer, and commercial Ross I broiler breeds, observed to 12 weeks of age. Although most inoculated birds {{of all three}} breeds developed swelling of one or both legs below the hock joint at 3 to 4 weeks of age, <b>gross</b> <b>lesions</b> of tenosynovitis became progressively more severe and extended above the joints only in broilers, whereas in most orally-infected SPF and commercial light chickens <b>gross</b> <b>lesions</b> were intermittently severe and regressed with time. Cloacal virus shedding continued up to 2 weeks in the lighter breeds and 3 weeks after infection in broilers. From {{a small proportion of}} infected chickens, reovirus was also recovered from heart, pancreas and caecal tonsils. In all breeds, the tissue in which virus persisted longest was the hock joint/tendon. There was a poor correlation between isolation of virus and the presence of <b>gross</b> <b>lesions</b> in chickens of 12 weeks of age, especially in broilers. Virus-neutralization tests demonstrated that seroconversion in the lighter breeds occurred mainly at 3 weeks, and in broilers at 4 weeks after infection.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of high stocking density as a predisposing factor in an experimental model of necrotic enteritis in broiler chicks. The experimental challenge model included an oral inoculation with 10 -fold dose of attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and multiple oral inoculations with a specific strain of Clostridium perfringens. Two hundred and forty as hatched day-old broiler chicks were randomly allocated to four treatment groups according to the following experimental design: group N, with normal stocking density (15 birds/m(2)) and no challenge; group D, with high stocking density (30 birds/m(2)) and no challenge; group P, with normal stocking density and positive challenge; and group DP, with high stocking density and positive challenge. From each bird, the intestine, gizzard and liver were collected and scored for gross lesions. The intestinal digesta was collected for pH and viscosity determination. One caecum from each bird was taken for microbiological analysis. The statistical analysis and evaluation of the experimental data revealed significant interaction effects between "stocking density" and "challenge", regarding <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> scores in intestine and liver, pH values in jejunum, ileum and caeca as well as C. perfringens counts in the caeca (P <= 0. 05). High stocking density in challenged birds increased the <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> score in the intestine (P <= 0. 05), contrary to unchallenged birds. It can be concluded that high stocking density affects unfavourably the welfare and gut health of broiler chicks, predisposes to necrotic enteritis in a subclinical experimental model and increases further its importance as a management factor for the poultry industry...|$|E
