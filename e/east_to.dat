5|$|A westward freeway {{extension}} of MD 177 was under construction from MD 3 (Glen Burnie Bypass) <b>east</b> <b>to</b> MD 2 by 1963. The freeway opened as MD 177 in 1964 with intermediate interchanges at MD 174 and Oakwood Road. In 1966, the freeway was extended slightly <b>east</b> <b>to</b> terminate at Mountain Road at an intersection {{at the site}} of today's ramps to and from westbound MD 100. By 1967, an {{extension of}} the freeway <b>east</b> <b>to</b> beyond Jacobsville was proposed. The eastward freeway extension opened in 1971; however, the extension and the freeway west to MD 3 were designated MD 100. MD 177 was expanded to a divided highway from MD 2 to MD 10 when the latter freeway was extended south from MD 648 to MD 100 between 1987 and 1989. The divided highway was extended <b>east</b> <b>to</b> Lipin's Corner in 1997. Since the late 1970s, heavy traffic on MD 177 east of MD 100 has spurred efforts to build a bypass of the Lake Shore section or widen the highway, projects that have been opposed by residents who fear increased development on the peninsula. Congestion on the highway was eased significantly when lane use signals were added to allow the center lane of the highway to become a travel lane during rush hours in July 1999.|$|E

5|$|At its height, the Mongolian empire {{stretched}} from Shanhaiguan in the <b>east</b> <b>to</b> Budapest in the west, from Rus' {{in the north}} to Tibet in the south. This meant that an extremely {{large part of the}} continent was united under one political authority. As a result, the trade routes used by merchants became safe for travel, resulting in an overall growth and expansion of trade from China in the <b>east</b> <b>to</b> Britain in the west. Thus, the Pax Mongolica greatly influenced many civilizations in Eurasia during the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|E
