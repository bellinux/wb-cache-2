5|$|Because of its stiffness, {{light weight}} and <b>dimensional</b> <b>stability</b> {{over a wide}} {{temperature}} range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium. Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized. A small number of extreme high-end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium. From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons. The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term <b>dimensional</b> <b>stability</b> are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the linear stability {{of a family of}} exact collapsing similarity solutions to the aggregation equation ρt = ∇ · (ρ∇K ∗ ρ) in Rd, d ≥ 2, where K(r) = r γ /γ with γ> 2. It was previously observed 1 that radially symmetric solutions are attracted to a self-similar collapsing shell profile in infinite time for γ> 2. In this paper we compute the stability of the similarity solution and show that the collapsing shell solution is stable for 2 4, we show that the shell solution is always unstable and destabilizes into clusters that form a simplex which we observe to be the long time attractor. We then classify the stability of these simplex solutions and prove that two <b>dimensional</b> (in-) <b>stability</b> implies n <b>dimensional</b> (in-) <b>stability...</b>|$|R

The specific gravity, surface hardness and dynamic bending strength of the composite were apparently increased {{with an increase in}} the polymer loading, but the polymerization of the {{vinylidene chloride monomer}} in wood by - radiation had negligible effect on the bending strength, modulus of elasticity in bending and internal friction.

25|$|Glass {{plates were}} the medium for most {{original}} camera photography {{from the late}} 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized amateur photography, early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old. Because of the superior <b>dimensional</b> <b>stability</b> of glass, the use of plates for some scientific applications, such as astrophotography, continued into the 1990s, and in the niche field of laser holography, it has persisted into the 2010s.|$|E

40|$|A new fluorene-based {{bisphenol}} monomer containing two pendant phenyl groups, 9, 9 -bis(3 -phenyl- 4 -hydroxy) phenyl-fluorene, was readily synthesized in {{high yield}} by a one-step reaction from inexpensive starting materials.

Presence of CNT in ABS filaments and 3 D-printed parts resulted in a significant enhancement of the tensile modulus and strength, accompanied by a reduction of the elongation at break. As documented by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, the stiffening effect of CNTs in ABS is particularly pronounced at high temperatures.

25|$|There {{are quite}} a few {{different}} dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), FR-4 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester).

25|$|Such {{copolymers}} are advantageous {{for certain}} molding applications, such as thermoforming, {{which is used}} for example to make tray or blister packaging from co-PET film, or amorphous PET sheet (A-PET/PETA) or PETG sheet. On the other hand, crystallization is important in other applications where mechanical and <b>dimensional</b> <b>stability</b> are important, such as seat belts. For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of isophthalic acid, CHDM, diethylene glycol (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely. As a result, bottles are obtainable via stretch blow molding ("SBM"), which are both clear and crystalline enough to be an adequate barrier to aromas and even gases, such as carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages.|$|E
500|$|In {{the lumber}} {{industry}} Acer rubrum {{is considered a}} [...] "soft maple", a designation it shares, commercially, with silver maple (A. saccharinum). In this context, the term [...] "soft" [...] is more comparative, than descriptive; i.e., [...] "soft maple", while softer than it's harder cousin, sugar maple (A. saccharum), is still a fairly hard wood, being comparable to Black Cherry (Prunus serotina) in this regard. [...] Like A. saccharum, the wood of red maple is close-grained, but its texture is softer, less dense, and has not as desirable an appearance, particularly under a clear finish. [...] However, the wood from Acer rubrum while being typically less expensive than hard maple, also has greater <b>dimensional</b> <b>stability</b> than that of A. saccharum, and also machines and stains easier. Thus, high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple, {{particularly when it comes}} to making stain/paint-grade furniture.

Although the apparent density of the composite board was 0.48 [*]g/cm 3, its strength {{was found to be}} equivalent to that of 18 -type particleboard as described in JIS A 5908. The board’s parallel/perpendicular anisotropy in strength was 0.9. The modulus of rupture (MOR) of the composite board increased with board density only up to a certain density, beyond which the MOR was constant. On the other hand, the thickness swelling of both corrugated particleboard and the composite board was smaller than that of flat-type particleboard, satisfying the JIS A 5908 standard of 12 %. Linear expansion (soaking in water of ordinary temperature for 24 [*]h) of corrugated particleboard was 0.7 %– 0.9 % in the parallel direction and 2.1 %– 3.1 % in the perpendicular direction; hence, anisotropy in linear expansion existed in the corrugated particleboard. The linear expansion of the composite board was 0.6 %– 0.9 % in the parallel direction and 1.8 %– 2.5 % in the perpendicular direction. Although the LE of the composite board was lower than that of corrugated particleboard, it is necessary to improve the LE of composite board for practical use.|$|R

These cements can be produced at temperatures 300 °C lower than normal portland cement and they also can be synthesized using industrial process wastes and by-products such as fly ash, blast furnace slag, chemical gypsum and other waste materials containing reactive sulfate and alumina. Cements designed to contain C 4 A 3, Beta. C 2 S and C or C 4 A 3, calcium sulfosilicate, C 5 S 2, and C have been synthesized using (a) pure analytical reagent (AR) calcium carbonate or commercial limestone {{as the source of}} CaO; (b) fly ash, blast furnace slag, bauxite, clay or aluminaas the source of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2; and (c) natural gypsu, phosphogypsum or desulphogypsum as the source of sulfate. Ettringite, C 6 A 3 H 32, generated by the hydration of C 4 A 3 and C is responsible for the high early strength of these cements.
