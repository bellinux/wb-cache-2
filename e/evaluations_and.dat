5|$|In 2012, {{during the}} {{contract}} {{negotiations between the}} city the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), compromise {{could not be reached}} over issues like health insurance increases, teacher <b>evaluations,</b> <b>and</b> seniority pay increases. On August 8, 2012, the CTU voted 90% to authorize a strike. On September 10, the CTU began a strike after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding. On September 14, the CTU reached a tentative agreement with the city which included preferences for teachers who have been laid off due to a school closing to be hired in another school and student test scores having less of a role in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned. This tentative agreement did not hold, and the strike continued, after which Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work. On September 17, Emanuel's efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week. Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012, and students began their return to the schools the following day.|$|E
40|$|Increasingly, organisations are {{expected}} to demonstrate, and document, the differences their services are making for children, families and communities (McCoy, Rose, & Connolly, 2013; 2014). <b>Evaluation</b> <b>and</b> research helps {{to respond to this}} demand. Evidence gained through these activities helps to identify whether programs have achieved what was intended and enables organisations to be transparent and accountable. To develop effective <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> research functions, organisations needs a strong culture of <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> research; a culture in which evidence is deliberately sought in order to better implement and deliver programs. Without such a culture any efforts to build effective <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> research activities will be undermined (Mayne, 2010).
