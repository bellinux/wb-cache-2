5|$|Early in Tyler's {{final year}} at Washington, {{injuries}} to the Huskies' halfbacks prompted head coach Don James {{to move him}} there from fullback.

With the score tied at zero in the first quarter, Tyler fumbled at the one-yard line; Michigan {{went on to win the}} game 23–6. The running back was drafted 222nd overall (first in the ninth round) by the New Orleans Saints in the 1981 NFL Draft. He played two seasons with the Saints, appearing in all 23 games over those two seasons. Before the 1983 NFL season, the Saints cut him in order to meet the limit on how many players a team may have.

500|$|Cox often filed {{fraudulent}} mortgage documents, and {{in several}} cases was able to mortgage properties for five to six times their actual worth. In this practice, known as [...] "shotgunning" [...] {{in the real estate}} community, Cox either himself forged or had accomplices attain inflated appraisals to increase the value of the mortgages. One of his accomplices was a <b>detention</b> <b>officer,</b> who acquired 14 properties worth nearly $600,000, while making $35,568 a year in his job. Cox took advantage of the Hillsborough County school district by selling it a property for much more than its appraised value, and arranged financing on a $90,000 house for future Florida Representative Janet Cruz. He recorded that sale for $233,000, and hired Cruz to do some rezoning research. Cruz claims she was unaware he inflated the sale price, and that she was never paid for her research. When a female accomplice rented a house in Pinellas County as part of Cox's schemes, then faked ownership of the property, the owner found out about the fraud. A title company manager had become suspicious of a loan Cox's accomplice was applying for on the house and called the property's real owner.

5000|$|In October 2009, a {{courtroom}} video was posted on YouTube, showing an MCSO <b>Detention</b> <b>Officer</b> removing documents from a defense attorney's files. <b>Detention</b> <b>Officer</b> [...] Adam Stoddard was subsequently found in contempt-of-court for violating attorney-client privilege, {{and ordered to}} hold a press conference, to publicly apologize for his actions. [...] On the deadline set by the court, <b>Detention</b> <b>Officer</b> Stoddard, under orders from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, declined to apologize and was jailed. Arpaio argued that only he could order his Detention Officers actions and the court had no authority to enforce any action against his officer, a position that the Appeals Court rejected in Stoddard's appeal. The Appeals Court did order that Judge Donahoe's order to make an apology be stricken and replaced with a fine. [...] The next day, 20 MCSO detention officers failed to report for work at the downtown Phoenix Superior Court, and a bomb threat was called in, causing the building to be evacuated. The same afternoon, more than 150 deputies and detention officers gathered outside the courthouse and reiterated {{their support for the}} jailed <b>detention</b> <b>officer.</b> The MCSO appealed the contempt order, and pending the outcome of the appeal, the deputy was released from jail. Ultimately, the contempt-of-court ruling was upheld, however the court of appeals threw out the penalty (that the officer apologize), and sent the case back to superior court for the imposition of a fine.|$|E

[...] Arpaio's office repeatedly claimed Norberg was also high on methamphetamine, but a blood toxicology performed post-mortem was inconclusive. According to a toxological report, Norberg did have methamphetamine in his urine, though [...] "there would be no direct effect caused by the methamphetamine on Norberg's behavior {{at the time of the}} incident". During his internment, evidence suggests <b>detention</b> <b>officers</b> shocked Norberg several times with a stun-gun. According to an investigation by Amnesty International, Norberg was already handcuffed and face down when officers dragged him from his cell and placed him in a restraint chair with a towel covering his face. After Norberg's corpse was discovered, <b>detention</b> <b>officers</b> accused Norberg of attacking them as they were trying to restrain him.
