Complexes with a {{terminal}} phosphanido (M‐PR 2) functionality bound {{to a single}} late transition metal center have been proposed as intermediates in relevant processes such as dehydrocoupling and hydrophosphanation reactions. The former provides {{an easy way to}} <b>diphosphanes,</b> phosphacycles and unique oligophosphanes. The later represents an atom‐economical route to a very important class of compounds such as organophosphanes. Moreover, safety, selectivity and 'green synthesis' are major advantages of dehydrocoupling and hydrophosphination catalysis. First, we will showcase the isolation of mononuclear hydrido phosphanido rhodium complexes resulting from the oxidative‐addition of secondary phosphanes, a key step postulated in both processes, but rarely observed. Then, the nucleophilicity of the terminal phosphanido group in [RhTp(H) (PMe 3) (PPh 2) ] was tested by reaction with activated olefins, which results in effective catalytic hydrophosphanation reactions under mild conditions. Second, effective catalytic dehydrocoupling of secondary phosphanes was achieved employing terminal phosphanido rhodium complexes such as 1. More importantly, the hydrophosphanation of ethylene was also observed, a surprising result since non‐activated olefins are essentially absent in this type of reactions. Finally, reliable evidence for the prominent role of mononuclear rhodium phosphanido species in these catalytic P‐P and P‐C bond formation reactions will also be provided, as well as mechanistic information that could help to the development of new catalysts for the ‘green syntheses’ of phosphanes and <b>diphosphanes.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Sequential evaporation of two <b>diphosphane</b> ligands is the sole fragmentation channel for the 1 + cation that yields product ions {{with one or two}} unsaturated W−Br functional groups, respectively. Conversely, evaporation of one <b>diphosphane</b> ligand followed by two water molecules is observed for cation 2 +. Complementary deuterium-labeling experiments in conjunction with computational studies provide deep insight into the thermodynamically favored product ion structures found along the fragmentation pathways. From these results, the formation of a series of cluster cations with W—Br, W—OH, and W═O functional groups either on saturated or unsaturated metal sites is proposed. The effect of the properties of these cluster cations, among them chemical composition and coordinative saturation, on their reactivity toward methanol is discussed...|$|E

The molybdenum-THF complex Mo(dippp) (CO) (2) (NO) (THF) ]BAr(4) (F) ] 3 a; Ar(F) = 3, 5 -(CF(3)) (2) -C(6) H(3) ], obtained by the reaction of 2 a with H(Et(2) O) (2) ]BAr(4) (F) ], was exemplarily tested in the hydrogenation of the imine PhCH= N(alpha-naphthyl). Replacement of the BAr(4) (F) ](-) counterion by the more stable B(C(6) F(5)) (4) ](-) anion greatly increased the catalytic activity. The use of in situ mixtures of the hydrides 2 a- 2 d and H(Et(2) O) (2) ]B(C(6) F(5)) (4) ] improved the hydrogenation activity. The hydride 2 b in combination with H(Et 2 O) 2] B(C 6 F 5) 4] exhibited the highest TOF value of 123 h(- 1) in the reduction of PhCH= N(alpha-naphthyl). The hydrogenation of the imines PhCH=NPh, p-ClC(6) H(4) CH=NPh, p-ClC(6) H(4) CH=N-p-C(6) H(4) Cl, PhCH=NCH(Ph) (2) and PhCH=NMes showed TOF values of 34, 74, 41, 18 and 84 h(- 1) at room temperature and a H(2) pressure of 30 bar.

40|$|The homolytic P-P bond fission in {{a series}} of sterically {{congested}} tetraaminodiphosphanes (R 2 N) (2) P-P-(NR 2) (2) ({ 4 }(2) -{ 9 }(2), two of which were newly synthesized and fully characterized) into diaminophosphanyl radicals (R 2 N) (2) P-center dot (4 - 9) was monitored by VT EPR spectroscopy. Determination of the radical concentration from the EPR spectra permitted to calculate free dissociation energies Delta G(Diss) (295) as well as dissociation enthalpies Delta H-Diss and entropies Delta S-Diss, respectively. Large positive values of Delta G(Diss) (295) indicate that the degree of dissociation is in most cases low, and the concentration of persistent radicals - even if they are spectroscopically observable at ambient temperature - remains small. Appreciable dissociation was established only for the sterically highly congested acyclic derivative { 9 }(2). Analysis of the trends in experimental data in connection with DFT studies indicate that radical formation is favoured by large entropy contributions and the energetic effect of structural relaxation (geometrical distortions and conformational changes in acyclic derivatives) in the radicals, and disfavoured by attractive dispersion forces. Comparison of the energetics of formation for CC-saturated N-heterocyclic <b>diphosphanes</b> and the 7 pi-radical 3 c indicates that the effect of energetic stabilization by pi-electron delocalization in the latter is visible, but stands back behind those of steric and entropic contributions. Evaluation of spectroscopic and computational data indicates that diaminophosphanyl radicals exhibit, in contrast to aminophosphenium cations, no strong energetic preference for a planar arrangement of the (R 2 N) (2) P unit...|$|R
