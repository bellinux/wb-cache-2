In order to identify the activity zone, the learned blocks are grouped into a set of clusters, where each cluster represents a set of connected <b>floor</b> <b>blocks.</b> A simple postprocessing step similar to erosion and dilation is performed on each cluster. First, single <b>floor</b> <b>block</b> gaps are filled, and head location means are computed by interpolation from neighboring blocks. Then, clusters containing single blocks are removed.

50|$|The current campus {{consists}} of seven blocks ranging {{from five to}} seven <b>floors</b> high, with <b>blocks</b> 1 to 6 arranged in a rectangular fashion. Students can travel to adjacent blocks by linked walkways or footbridges.

(For instance, the 6th <b>floor</b> of <b>Block</b> 1 {{is equivalent to the}} 3rd <b>floor</b> of <b>Block</b> 4) Up until 2011, the 7th block was mainly isolated {{from the rest of the}} campus and was used for PTA and examination purposes, along with acting as storage for certain gym equipment. The block has since been renovated for greater stability and repainted in white to match the rest of the campus, and its role has been expanded to provide working facilities for staff and a sixth form common room.|$|R
