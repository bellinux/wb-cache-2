5|$|In all {{butterflies}} (with {{the exception}} of male Euschemoninae) and in Bombycoidea moths (with {{the exception of}} the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of <b>frenulum</b> and retinaculum to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite the absence of a specific mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in unison. This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the <b>frenulum</b> and retinaculum are completely lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{a complex}} structure, containing external and internal components. It consists of the glans (including the <b>frenulum</b> of clitoris, which is a <b>frenulum</b> on the under-surface of the glans and is created by the two medial parts of the labia minora), the clitoral body (which is composed of two erectile bodies known as the corpora cavernosa), two clitoral crura, the clitoral hood (formed by the labia minora) and the vestibular or clitoral bulbs. The clitoral body is {{commonly referred to as}} the shaft (or internal shaft), while the length of the clitoris between the glans and the body may also be referred to as the shaft (or external shaft) because, like the shaft as a whole, it supports the glans, and its shape can be seen and felt through the clitoral hood.|$|E
5|$|The more {{primitive}} groups have an enlarged lobe-like {{area near the}} basal posterior margin (i.e. {{at the base of}} the forewing) called a jugum, that folds under the hindwing during flight. Other groups have a <b>frenulum</b> on the hindwing that hooks under a retinaculum on the forewing.|$|E
5|$|The sublingua in lemuriform {{primates}} {{is fully}} developed and particularly unique. Tarsiers, which are most {{closely related to}} monkeys and apes (collectively called simians), also have a well-developed but non-specialized sublingua. Simians, however, {{do not have a}} sublingua, although some, such as titis have a highly specialized frenal lamella (plica sublingualis). All primates have a plica sublingualis, and the fimbria linguae (plica fimbriata) found under the tongue of apes may be a vestigial version, although that is still disputed. The structure and appearance of the sublingua, frenal lamella, lingual <b>frenulum,</b> and other sublingual tissue vary greatly between primates, and as a result, their terminology is often confused.|$|E
25|$|The <b>frenulum</b> is {{too short}} to allow {{complete}} retraction of the foreskin (a condition called <b>frenulum</b> breve).|$|E
25|$|Other {{groups have}} a <b>frenulum</b> on the hindwing that hooks under a {{retinaculum}} on the forewing.|$|E
25|$|A {{congenital}} {{disorder of}} the tongue is that of ankyloglossia also known as tongue-tie. The tongue {{is tied to the}} floor of the mouth by a very short and thickened <b>frenulum</b> and this affects speech, eating, and swallowing.|$|E
25|$|Many geometrids have slender abdomens {{and broad}} wings {{which are usually}} held flat with the hind wings visible. As such, they appear rather butterfly-like, but in most respects they are typical moths; the {{majority}} fly at night, they possess a <b>frenulum</b> to link the wings, and the antennae of the males are often feathered. They tend to blend into the background, often with intricate, wavy patterns on their wings. In some species, females have reduced wings (e.g. winter moth and fall cankerworm).|$|E
25|$|However, the Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion, {{states that}} many Hellenistic Jews {{attempted}} to restore their foreskins, and that similar {{action was taken}} during the Hadrianic persecution, {{a period in which}} a prohibition against circumcision was issued. Thus, the writers of the dictionary hypothesize that the more severe method practiced today was probably begun in order to prevent the possibility of restoring the foreskin after circumcision, and therefore the rabbis added the requirement of cutting the foreskin in periah. The <b>frenulum</b> may also be cut away at the same time, in a procedure called frenectomy.|$|E
500|$|The sublingua {{is thought}} to have evolved from {{specialized}} folds of tissue below the tongue, which can be seen in some marsupials and other mammals. Simians do not have a sublingua, but the fimbria linguae found on the underside of ape tongues may be a vestigial version of the sublingua. Because of widely variable appearance of sublingual tissue in primates, the term [...] "sublingua" [...] is often confused with the frenal lamella, lingual <b>frenulum,</b> and other sublingual tissues.|$|E
500|$|In many insect species, the forewing and hindwing are coupled together, which {{improves}} the aerodynamic efficiency of flight. The most common coupling mechanism (e.g., Hymenoptera and Trichoptera) is {{a row of}} small hooks on the forward margin of the hindwing, or [...] "hamuli", which lock onto the forewing, keeping them held together (hamulate coupling). In some other insect species (e.g., Mecoptera, Lepidoptera, and some Trichoptera) the jugal lobe of the forewing covers {{a portion of the}} hindwing (jugal coupling), or the margins of the forewing and hindwing overlap broadly (amplexiform coupling), or the hindwing bristles, or <b>frenulum,</b> hook under the retaining structure or retinaculum on the forewing.|$|E
500|$|The {{clitoris}} and penis {{are generally}} the same anatomical structure, although the distal portion (or opening) of the urethra is absent in the clitoris {{of humans and}} most other animals. The idea that males have clitorises was suggested in 1987 by researcher Josephine Lowndes Sevely, who theorized that the male corpora cavernosa (a pair of sponge-like regions of erectile tissue which contain most of the blood in the penis during penile erection) are the true counterpart of the clitoris. She argued that [...] "the male clitoris" [...] is directly beneath {{the rim of the}} glans penis, where the <b>frenulum</b> of prepuce of the penis (a fold of the prepuce) is located, and proposed that this area be called the [...] "Lownde's crown." [...] Her theory and proposal, though acknowledged in anatomical literature, did not materialize in anatomy books. Modern anatomical texts instead show that the clitoris displays a hood that is the equivalent of the penis's foreskin, which covers the glans, and a shaft that is attached to the glans; the male corpora cavernosa are homologous to the corpus cavernosum clitoridis (the female cavernosa); the corpus spongiosum is homologous to the vestibular bulbs beneath the labia minora, and the scrotum is homologous to the labia minora and labia majora.|$|E
2500|$|Ventral slit (sub{{incision}}) is an incision {{along the}} lower {{length of the}} foreskin {{from the tip of}} the <b>frenulum</b> {{to the base of the}} glans, removing the <b>frenulum</b> in the process. [...] Often used when <b>frenulum</b> breve occurs alongside the phimosis.|$|E
2500|$|Many moths have a <b>frenulum</b> {{which is}} a {{filament}} arising from the hindwing and coupling (matching up) with barbs on the forewing. The <b>frenulum</b> can be observed only when a specimen is in hand. Some moths have a lobe on the forewing called a jugum that helps in coupling with the hindwing. [...] Butterflies, however, lack these structures.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{butterflies}} (except the male of one species of hesperiid) {{and in the}} Bombycoidea (except the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of <b>frenulum</b> and retinaculum to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged [...] humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite {{the absence of a}} specific mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in unison. This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the <b>frenulum</b> and retinaculum are completely lost.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{strands of}} study and {{research}} (see P Whelan, F Grewel [...] and E Douglas) which show that certain foreskin conditions (paraphimosis and <b>frenulum</b> breve) when left unacknowledged, and therefore untreated, cause psychosexual problems - especially when mixed with courtship and other individual and environmental factors from childhood - wracking with self-doubt, and leading ultimately to psychosis. [...] Once having successfully overcome the condition(s), however, {{the effect of the}} traumas can recur on the birth of a son, and later. [...] This is a dangerous situation and liable to cause much confusion and disturbance, or worse, and provides an explanation of the story of Abraham, covenant of circumcision and the binding of Isaac, i.e. psychosis and foreskin management intention and, ultimately, the saving nature of faith. [...] The conclusions in Acts 15, when logically interpreted (see E Douglas), raises understanding of these adverse anatomical conditions: paraphimosis (symptom: strangling the head of the penis); and slender <b>frenulum</b> breve (symptom: blood from rupture of <b>frenulum</b> blood vessels), and advises avoidance of them. [...] It raises awareness of the issues but carefully refrains from being prescriptive as to the means of management. This allows room for modern methods of management, e.g. frenuloplasty. The psychological effects of these conditions, while little understood, are real, and are visible in literature and art.|$|E
2500|$|The eggs of hedylid moths have {{an upright}} {{configuration}} and are variable in shape: in Macrosoma inermis they are particularly narrow and spindle-shaped resembling those of some Pieridae {{and in the}} case of M. tipulata they are more barrel-shaped, like certain Nymphalidae. The larvae resemble probably convergently those of Apaturinae. Adult hedylids resemble geometer moths. They share many morphological and genetic characteristics both with the superfamilies Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea. The abdomen is very long and slim, like many Neotropical butterflies of the subfamilies Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, hence the name of one Macrosoma species [...] "heliconiaria". Unlike other butterflies however, the antennae are un-clubbed, but rather filiform or bipectinate. Unlike the family Geometridae, in which they had been placed by the geometer expert L.B.Prout, hedylids lack tympanic organs at the base of the abdomen, but have them on the wings (see under Behaviour). Unlike other butterflies, however, (except in the unique case of the remarkable Australian skipper butterfly Euschemon rafflesia whose males possess these structures), the single-spined <b>frenulum,</b> and retinaculum is not lost or reduced in males, except in three Macrosoma species where there is no functional wing coupling system; the retinaculum is always lost in females and the <b>frenulum</b> may be vestigial. The family have been fully catalogued and illustrated in an identification guide.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{symptoms}} {{can vary}} greatly between affected individuals, even those {{within the same}} family, symptoms normally begin in infancy and are typically a result of thickening skin and mucous membranes. [...] The first symptom is often a weak cry or a hoarse voice due to a thickening of the vocal cords. [...] The hoarse voice {{can be one of}} the most striking clinical manifestations of the disease. Lesions and scars also appear on the skin, usually the face and the distal parts of the limbs. This is often the result of poor wound healing and the scarring continues to increase as the patient ages, leaving the skin with a waxy appearance. [...] Skin may be easily damaged as a result of only a minor trauma or injury, leaving many blisters and additional scars. The skin is also usually very dry and wrinkly. [...] White or yellow infiltrates form on the lips, buccal mucosa, tonsils, uvula, epiglottis and <b>frenulum</b> of the tongue. This can lead to upper respiratory tract infection and sometimes requires tracheostomy to relieve the symptom. Too much thickening of the <b>frenulum</b> can restrict tongue movement and may result in speech impediments. Beading of the papules around the eyelids is a very common symptom and is often used as part of a diagnosis of the disease. [...] Some other dermatological symptoms that are sometimes seen but less common include hair loss, parotitis and other dental abnormalities, corneal ulceration, and focal degeneration of the macula.|$|E
2500|$|In many insect species, the forewing and hindwing are coupled together, which {{improves}} the aerodynamic efficiency of flight. The most common coupling mechanism (e.g., Hymenoptera and Trichoptera) is {{a row of}} small hooks on the forward margin of the hindwing, or [...] "hamuli", which lock onto the forewing, keeping them held together (hamulate coupling). In some other insect species (e.g., Mecoptera, Lepidoptera, and some Trichoptera) the jugal lobe of the forewing covers {{a portion of the}} hindwing (jugal coupling), or the margins of the forewing and hindwing overlap broadly (amplexiform coupling), or the hindwing bristles, or <b>frenulum,</b> hook under the retaining structure or retinalucum on the forewing.|$|E
2500|$|Antennae are {{generally}} not very feathery, even in the males. They lack tympanal organs, but {{members of the group}} Choerocampini have hearing organs on their heads. They have a <b>frenulum</b> and retinaculum to join hind wings and fore wings. [...] The thorax, abdomen, and wings are densely covered in scales. Some sphingids have a rudimental proboscis, but most have a very long one, which is used to feed on nectar from flowers. Most are crepuscular or nocturnal, but some species fly during the day. Both males and females are relatively long-lived (living 10 to 30 days). Prior to flight, most species shiver their flight muscles to warm them up, and, during flight, body temperatures may surpass [...]|$|E
2500|$|Adults are {{characterized}} by large size, heavy bodies covered in hair-like scales, lobed wings, reduced mouthparts, and small heads. They lack a <b>frenulum</b> but the hind wings overlap the forewings, producing the same effect of an unbroken wing surface. These moths are sometimes brightly colored and often have translucent eyespots or [...] "windows" [...] on their wings. [...] Sexual dimorphism varies by species, but males can generally be distinguished by their larger, broader antennae. Most adults possess wing spans between 1 and 6in (2.5 and 15cm), but some tropical species, such as the Atlas moth (Attacus atlas), may have wing spans up to 12in (30cm). Together with certain Noctuidae (chiefly Calpinae and Catocalinae, such as the genera Ascalapha, Erebus, or Thysania), the Saturniidae contain the largest Lepidoptera, {{and some of the}} largest insects alive today.|$|E
2500|$|The family Hepialidae is {{considered}} to be very primitive, with a number of structural differences to other moths including very short antennae and the lack of a functional proboscis or <b>frenulum</b> (see Kristensen, 1999: 61-62 for details). Like other Exoporia the sperm is transferred to the egg by an external channel between the ostium and the ovipore. Other nonditrysian moths have a common cloaca. The moths are homoneurous with similar forewings and hindwings, and are sometimes included as 'honorary' members of the Macrolepidoptera, though archaic they are. Strictly speaking, they are phylogenetically too basal and constitute Microlepidoptera, although hepialids range from very small moths to a wingspan record of 250mm in Zelotypia. Because of their sometimes large size and striking colour patterns, they have received more popular and taxonomic attention than most [...] "micros". Many species display strong sexual dimorphism, with males smaller but more boldly marked than females, or at high elevation, females of Pharmacis and Aoraia show [...] "brachypterous" [...] wing reduction.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>frenulum</b> veli, or <b>frenulum</b> of {{superior}} medullary velum, {{also known as}} the <b>frenulum</b> veli medullaris superioris, cerebellar <b>frenulum,</b> or <b>frenulum</b> cerebelli is a slightly raised white band passing from the inferior end of the medial longitudinal fissure, through the groove between the quadrigeminal bodies, and down to the superior medullary velum.|$|E
50|$|The skin of {{the lips}} is {{stratified}} squamous epithelium. The mucous membrane is represented by a large area in the sensory cortex, and is therefore highly sensitive. The <b>Frenulum</b> Labii Inferioris is the <b>frenulum</b> of the lower lip. The <b>Frenulum</b> Labii Superioris is the <b>frenulum</b> of the upper lip.|$|E
5000|$|The penile <b>frenulum</b> is {{comparable}} to the tongue's <b>frenulum</b> between the tongue's lower surface and the lower jaw, or the <b>frenulum</b> between the upper lip and the outside of the upper gum.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Frenulum</b> clitoridis (or crus glandis clitoridis): a <b>frenulum</b> {{surrounding}} the clitoris ...|$|E
5000|$|A lip <b>frenulum</b> {{piercing}} is a {{body piercing}} through the <b>frenulum</b> of either the upper or lower lip. A piercing through the upper lip <b>frenulum</b> is sometimes called a scrumper, or a smiley, {{because it can be}} visible when the wearer smiles. [...] Opposingly, the piercing through the lower lip <b>frenulum</b> is sometimes referred to as a frowny.|$|E
50|$|The <b>frenulum</b> of tongue or tongue web (also lingual <b>frenulum</b> or <b>frenulum</b> linguæ; also fraenulum) {{is a small}} fold of mucous {{membrane}} extending {{from the floor of}} the mouth to the midline of the underside of the tongue.|$|E
5000|$|Ventral slit (subter{{incision}}) is an incision {{along the}} lower {{length of the}} foreskin {{from the tip of}} the <b>frenulum</b> {{to the base of the}} glans, removing the <b>frenulum</b> in the process. Often used when <b>frenulum</b> breve occurs alongside the phimosis.|$|E
50|$|A frenectomy can be {{performed}} to remove the <b>frenulum</b> from the penis, which is a treatment for <b>frenulum</b> breve or frenular chordee. This {{is a form of}} genital frenectomy. The <b>frenulum</b> may be cut when a male is circumcised. This may also reduce the size of the frenular delta. The <b>frenulum</b> was reported to be cut in 26.7%, 20%, and 33.33% of circumcised patients in various surveys.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{treatment}} is to correct a rare complication of a <b>frenulum</b> breve which presents as scars on the <b>frenulum,</b> these scars cause pain and make normal sex very difficult and are caused by the rubbing of the <b>frenulum</b> whilst engaging in sexual activity. These scars only effect those with <b>frenulum</b> breve. The Frenuloplasty can be conducted under both general or local anesthesia.|$|E
5000|$|Oral tissue: Frenula of {{the mouth}} include the <b>frenulum</b> linguae under the tongue, the <b>frenulum</b> labii superioris inside the upper lip, the <b>frenulum</b> labii inferioris inside the lower lip, and the buccal frena which connect the cheeks to the gum. These can easily be torn by violent blows to the face or mouth, thus a torn <b>frenulum</b> is {{sometimes}} a warning sign of physical abuse.|$|E
50|$|An {{abnormally}} {{short or}} sensitive <b>frenulum</b> of the penis {{can make some}} types of sexual activity uncomfortable or even painful. This may be a complication of circumcision or a naturally occurring event. When it is a naturally occurring event, a short <b>frenulum</b> can restrict normal retraction of the foreskin during erection (a condition known as <b>frenulum</b> breve). The goal of treatment is to allow normal retraction of the foreskin. Circumcision may relieve this condition but is not indicated solely for treating <b>frenulum</b> breve. However, circumcision {{can also lead to}} an abnormally sensitive <b>frenulum.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Frenulum</b> breve may be {{complicated}} by tearing of the <b>frenulum</b> during sexual or other activity {{and is a}} cause of dyspareunia. It may lead to erroneous labelling of the sufferer as having psychosexual problems. The torn <b>frenulum</b> may result in healing with scar tissue that is less flexible after the incident causing further difficulties. However, this tearing can also solve the problem, healing such that the <b>frenulum</b> is longer and therefore no longer problematic. The diagnosis of <b>frenulum</b> breve is almost always confused with that of phimosis and a generally tight foreskin, since the symptom is difficulty retracting the foreskin. Most men with phimosis also have <b>frenulum</b> breve to a certain extent.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>frenulum</b> is {{too short}} to allow {{complete}} retraction of the foreskin (a condition called <b>frenulum</b> breve).|$|E
50|$|<b>Frenulum</b> breve is a {{condition}} in which the <b>frenulum</b> is short and restricts the movement of the foreskin, {{which may or may not}} interfere with normal sexual activity. The condition can be treated by frenuloplasty, frenectomy, or circumcision. <b>Frenulum</b> breve may contribute to frenular chordee, where the glans is pulled toward the vernal body of the penis. <b>Frenulum</b> breveu may also be treated by manually expanding the shaft skin by stretching.|$|E
