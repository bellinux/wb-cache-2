5|$|Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc {{was one of}} {{the first}} fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in {{commercial}} quantities, <b>especially</b> <b>by</b> New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young, as it does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.|$|E

5|$|Before {{this the}} church had {{maintained}} {{a distance from the}} Armenian revolutionary groups as the latter saw the former as a conservative institution. It was Khrimian who welcomed revolutionary activism, <b>especially</b> <b>by</b> the Dashnaktsutyun, the most influential Armenian party. According to Panossian, Khrimian thus radicalised, to a certain degree, the Armenian Church and as such secularised in its vision of the Armenian nation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the crusade, the {{countryside}} of Mecklenburg and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, <b>especially</b> <b>by</b> the troops of Henry the Lion.

These SAOs were joined into Republika Srpska on 9 January 1992.|$|E
5|$|In 1613, John Sigismund {{converted}} from Lutheranism to Calvinism, {{but failed to}} achieve {{the conversion of the}} estates by the rule of cuius regio, eius religio. Thus, on 5 February 1615, he granted the Lutherans religious freedom, while the electors court remained largely Calvinist.

The route was used extensively in the 1850s, <b>especially</b> <b>by</b> the Mormon companies.|$|E
