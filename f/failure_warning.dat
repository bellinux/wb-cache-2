The performance of the developed algorithms was examined through real data from a test to failure bearing.

When the gearbox operation occurs, characterized in health parameters deviate from the model, when the offset distance exceeds the threshold value, the system gives the warning. Finally, the health model was validated, experiments show that the method used in this paper can be found early signs of abnormal gearbox and give warning. The results show that the health model by the similar principle established can identify abnormal state timely and accurately, and warning given before a failure occurs, which makes it easier to advance plans to organize maintenance equipment and personnel, to provide a reference for on-site maintenance.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine data {{generated}} using high-resolution three-dimensional laser scanning monitoring of coastal rock cliffs. These data {{are used to}} identify spatial and temporal patterns in rockfall activity behavior prior to slope failure. Analysis of the data suggests that given sufficient measurement precision precursory behavior, here manifest as the rate of rockfall activity prior to failure, can be detected, measured, and monitored. Environmental conditions {{appear to have a}} diminishing influence on the occurrence of increasingly large slope failures. The monitoring data implies a time-dependent sequence in the occurrence of smaller rockfalls in the period leading to the largest failures recorded. This behavior is attributed to the mechanisms of strain accumulation in the rock mass resulting from brittle failure of the slope. The implication is that combining these data with models of failure mechanisms may allow failure time to be forecast from wide-area monitoring of precursory behavior. These findings have implications for the management of potentially unstable slopes, the understanding of slope failure mechanisms, and the generation of a new type of slope <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> systems...|$|E

It {{is the result of}} microscopic changes in material structure and is associated with deformation and defect growth. Until about 1973, acoustic emission technology was primarily employed in the non-destructive testing of such structures as pipelines, heat exchangers, storage tanks, pressure vessels, and coolant circuits of nuclear reactor plants. However, the applicability of this technique to the detection of defects in rotating equipment bearings was recognized and the results of prototype testing were published in 1973. These tests {{led to the development of}} a plant-wide, computerized acoustic incipient failure detection (IFD) system which was leased from a major aerospace contractor in 1975 and evaluated until early 1977. In late 1977, advanced, second generation IFD systems were employed. These systems incorporate features which greatly enhance component reliability and usefulness to plant operators.
