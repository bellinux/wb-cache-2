He described them as important, fruitful, and of frequent occurrence in math-ematics, {{pointing to the}} examples of negative, irrational, imaginary, ideal and transªnite numbers. In geometry, {{he had in mind}} the examples of points, lines, and planes at inªnity, whose introduction gives geometry a certain com-pleteness, by making theorems such as those of Pappus and Desargues univer-sally valid. In this article I will discuss how Hilbert transformed our view of the Pappus and Desargues theorems by showing that they express the underlying algebraic structure of projective geometry. I will compare this result with an-other of Hilbert’s great contributions, his calculus of ends. By studying the <b>ideal</b> <b>elements</b> of the hyperbolic plane, Hilbert similarly extracted algebraic structure from the axioms of hyperbolic geometry. Hilbert’s treatments of projective and hyperbolic geometry have another important common element: construction of real numbers.

40|$|In this Note I prove a {{representation}} theorem for Peirce algebras introduced in Brink, Britz and Schmidt (1994 b, 1994 a). I {{show that the}} class of full Peirce algebras is characterised by the class of complete and atomic Peirce algebras in which the set of relational atoms is restricted by two conditions. One requires simplicity. The other requires that each relational element can be uniquely {{expressed in terms of}} Boolean atoms, or equivalently, that each relational element can be uniquely expressed in terms of relational identity atoms or relational points. The result parallels the representation theorems of J'onsson and Tarski (1952), McKinsey (1940) and Schmidt and Strohlein (1985) for full relation algebras. To this end I investigate the interrelationship of identity <b>elements</b> and right <b>ideal</b> <b>elements</b> inside any relation algebra and the interrelationship of identity <b>elements,</b> right <b>ideal</b> <b>elements</b> and Boolean set elements inside Peirce algebras.

Further, he found in the Christian revelation the same characteristics as belonged to the universal revelation involved in conscience, viz., God's sovereign initiative and his living action in history. From this standpoint he argued against a purely psychological type of religion (agnosticisme religieux; as he termed it)--a tendency to which he saw even in A Sabatier and the symbolofidéisme of the Paris School—as giving up a real and unifying faith.

40|$|This article aims at {{clarifying}} the philosophical (=phenomenological) implication of Talcott Parsons’s analytical realism. Generally, his theory {{is understood as}} being confrontational to phenomenology; however, in his first book, The Structure of Social Action, Parsons positively referred to Husserl’s Logical Investigations. They shared a sense of crisis: Husserl {{thought that there was}} no certain basis in modern science, and Parsons had the feeling that there was no common theory to establish sociology as a science. Thus, both of them criticized the factual sciences of positivism (positivistic empiricism) and showed a strong orientation to the general theory. For this, they depended on conceptual realism (Platonic realism). According to Husserl, scientific knowledge will be arbitrary if the Ideal is not there as the norm of fact. He believed that in truth all people always see Ideas. Similarly, Parsons thought that in truth all people always act toward the Ideal, because the <b>Ideal</b> <b>element</b> is necessarily found through the logical framework of sociology, i. e., the action frame of reference.

We {{show that this}} po-Γ-semigroup is left regular {{if and only if}} M is a union of left simple sub-Γ-semigroups of M. The concept of left regular poe-semigroups has been introduced in [2] and extends the concept of left regular po-semigroups not having the greatest element “e ” in [1]. In [5], Lee and Jung showed that a poe-semigroup S in which every x 2 (x ∈ S) is a left <b>ideal</b> <b>element</b> is left regular if and only if there exists a family {Sα|α ∈ Y} of left simple subsemigroups of S such that S = ∪{Sα|α ∈ Y}. Recently, Kwon([3]) showed that a poe-Γ-semigroup is left regular if and only if M is a union of left simple sub-Γ-semigroups of M. Now we consider a po-Γ-semigroups which does not necessarily have a greatest element “e”. In this paper we prove that a po-Γ-semigroup M in which every xγx(x ∈ M,γ ∈ Γ) is a left <b>ideal</b> <b>element</b> is left regular if and only if M is a union of left simple sub-Γ-semigroups of M. M. K. Sen ([6]) introduced Γ-semigroups in 1981. M. K. Sen and N. K. Saha ([7],[8]) introduced Γ-semigroups different from the first definition of Γ-semigroups in the sense of Sen (1981).
