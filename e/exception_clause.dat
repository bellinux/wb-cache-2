Since the 1980s, women's rights groups lobbied for marital rape to be declared unlawful, but the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 still maintains the marital exemption by stating in its <b>exception</b> <b>clause</b> under Section 375, that: [...] "Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under ﬁfteen years of age, is not rape". While per-capita reported incidents are quite low compared to other countries, even developed countries, a new case is reported every 20 minutes.|$|E

While Stevens demonstrates the Court 2 ̆ 7 s reluctance {{to create a new}} category of speech outside of First Amendment protection, Stevens also stands for the proposition that borrowing the <b>exceptions</b> <b>clause</b> from the Court 2 ̆ 7 s obscenity standard will not adequately protect a statute from invalidation as overbroad. This Note discusses the use of the obscenity standard 2 ̆ 7 s <b>exceptions</b> <b>clause</b> in nonobscenity statutes and the Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of the <b>exceptions</b> <b>clause</b> in Stevens.

40|$|<b>Exception</b> <b>clauses</b> in {{treaties}} and their analogues in subfields of {{customary international law}} (such as the law on state responsibility) allow states to unilaterally 'derogate' from otherwise binding rules of international law, typically {{under the condition that}} the derogating action is necessary and proportionate. While necessity and proportionality thus undoubtedly {{play a central role in}} <b>exception</b> <b>clauses,</b> they have been curiously understudied and remain startlingly unclear; international courts have struggled to interpret necessity/proportionality. In addition, despite the wide-spread inclusion of necessity/proportionality in <b>exception</b> <b>clauses</b> across international law, comparative studies across contexts are exceedingly rare. This thesis studies the concepts of necessity and proportionality enshrined in <b>exception</b> <b>clauses</b> across a variety of {{treaties and}} subfields of international law â specifically, the law on state responsibility, the law on self-defence, and the general <b>exception</b> <b>clauses</b> in WTO law -, and in particular how they are applied and reviewed by international courts. The thesis explores the concepts of necessity and proportionality in general, clarifies how they are applied in the context of the surveyed rules, and reveals the degree to which necessity/proportionality overlap across the different contexts, demonstrating the existence of a unified core. It argues further that this unified core can be utilised to facilitate cross-interpretation between different contexts, which offers an original strategy to overcome some hitherto unresolved difficulties with respect to the interpretation of necessity/proportionality in <b>exception</b> <b>clauses.</b> The thesis is divided into two parts. Part I (chapters I-III) analyses and compares the concepts of necessity/proportionality as well as how compliance therewith is reviewed by international courts across the surveyed rules. Part II (chapter IV) explores cross-interpretation of necessity/proportionality across contexts with reference to its unified core content. </p...|$|R
40|$|Jurisdiction {{stripping}} {{is the new}} constitutional amendment, and the <b>Exceptions</b> <b>Clause</b> is the new Article V. But despite legal academia’s long-running obsessions {{with the}} meaning of constitutional amendment and the limits (if any) on Congress’s power to control federal jurisdiction, we still lack even {{a basic understanding of}} how these two forms of constitutional politicking interact. As legislators increasingly propose and pass jurisdiction-stripping legislation and pursue politically charged constitutional amendments, these constitutional processes have begun to step off of the pages of law reviews and into the halls of Congress. The looming collision between them makes it all the more essential that each be understood. This Article advances that understanding by exploring the connections between the amendment process and the <b>Exceptions</b> <b>Clause,</b> illuminating the meaning, impact, and limits of each. In order to properly identify constraints on the <b>Exceptions</b> <b>Clause,</b> courts and scholars must first have a robust understanding of how constitutional amendments impact and alter provisions of the existing Constitution. Part I of this Article thus begins by describing the impact of constitutional amendment, arguing that amendments—very few of which refer to the specific provisions of the Constitution they are meant to change—are not simply additions. They can (and generally do) alter the meaning of the original Constitution, including the <b>Exceptions</b> <b>Clause.</b> Building from the text and history of the Constitution and the amendments themselves, this Part argues that properly interpreting amendments requires courts to identify what, if anything, an amendment “amends. ” Part I concludes by suggesting how courts and scholars can better accomplish that interpretive task. The second Part of the Article applies this amendment theory to the <b>Exceptions</b> <b>Clause,</b> analyzing the degree to which subsequent amendments have implicitly altered the power it gives Congress over federal jurisdiction. Although scholars have long sensed the existence of internal and external “constraints” on congressional power under the Clause, none have systematically incorporated a robust theory of constitutional amendment to explain these limitations. By doing so, this Article thickens and supports the external constraints theory of Congress’s <b>Exceptions</b> <b>Clause</b> power, and may help shed light on two of legal academia’s central quests: clarifying the meaning of constitutional amendment and finding limits on the <b>Exceptions</b> <b>Clause...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{contracting}} {{activity of}} public administration in Colombia has generally allowed, {{by order of}} constitutional and legislative norms, {{the application of the}} principle of autonomy, so that those subjects within a public legal transaction can build and establish the conditions governing their contract. The scope of the principle of autonomy must be analyzed and subjected to reflection, especially considering the institution of <b>exception</b> <b>clauses</b> in common law used by State agencies and their legal relationship with contractors. The existence of <b>exception</b> <b>clauses</b> has been justified by the interests of the State (and in particular the public interest) without strictly analyzing the essence of the figure. The application of this institution in contractual relations of the State has advanced greatly, but it is still uncertain if {{the true nature of the}} figure is caused by the autonomy of the parties in order to celebrate the contract, or if it comes as privileges conferred and imposed by the legislator as a way to concise the principle of legality. This paper concludes that <b>exception</b> <b>clauses</b> in common law, clearly applied in contractual activity within public administration, consist of special privileges imposed by the legislator to State entities, and are therefore opposed to the essence of the clause and the principle of autonomy. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "shoe question" [...] on the pagoda {{has always}} been a {{sensitive}} issue to the Burmese people since colonial times. The Burmese people had always removed shoes at all Buddhist pagodas. Hiram Cox, the British envoy to the Burmese Court, in 1796, observed the tradition by not visiting the pagoda rather than take off his shoes. However, after the annexation of lower Burma, European visitors as well as troops posted at the pagoda openly flouted the tradition. U Dhammaloka publicly confronted a police officer over wearing shoes at the pagoda in 1902. It was not until 1919 that the British authorities finally issued a regulation prohibiting footwear in the precincts of the pagoda. However, they put in an exception that employees of the government on official business were allowed footwear. The regulation and its <b>exception</b> <b>clause</b> moved to stir up the people and {{played a role in the}} beginnings of the nationalist movement.

It is not even necessary to show that the attention of that particular person was actually drawn to it. It is somewhat like the 'reasonable man' test in tort: the party trying to rely on the clause needs to take reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the reasonable person.|$|E

5000|$|At common law, when {{goods are}} {{carried by sea}} by a “common carrier” (a public carrier), then, if the {{contract}} of carriage does not contain an <b>exception</b> <b>clause</b> relating to seaworthiness, there is an absolute undertaking that the vessel is seaworthy. Liability is “strict”**, meaning the carrier is liable {{even in the absence}} of negligence, as in Liver Alkali v Johnson. This does not mean the vessel need be capable of encountering any peril. The test of seaworthiness may be [...] "that the ship should be in a condition to encounter whatever perils of the sea a ship of that kind, and laden in that way, may be fairly expected to encounter in the voyage to be performed". However, the strict liability at common law is invariably modified in contracts of affreightment.

40|$|Scholars {{have long}} treated the <b>Exceptions</b> <b>Clause</b> of Article III {{as a serious}} threat to the Supreme Court’s central {{constitutional}} function: establishing definitive and uniform rules of federal law. This Article argues that scholars have overlooked an important function of the Clause. Congress has repeatedly used its broad “exceptions power” to facilitate, not to undermine, the Supreme Court’s constitutional role. Drawing on insights from social science, this Article asserts that Congress has an incentive to use its control over federal jurisdiction to promote the Court’s role in settling disputed federal questions. Notably, this argument has considerable historical support. When the Supreme Court’s mandatory appellate docket grew {{to the point that it}} was unmanageable for a single tribunal, Congress responded by exercising its authority under the <b>Exceptions</b> <b>Clause.</b> Congress made “exceptions” to the Court’s mandatory appellate jurisdiction and replaced it with discretionary review via writs of certiorari—precisely so that the Court could concentrate its limited resources on resolving important federal questions. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, Congress has often used its broad exceptions power to safeguard the Supreme Court’s role in the constitutional scheme...|$|R

[...] During Matlovich's September 1975 administrative discharge hearing, an Air Force attorney {{asked him if he}} would sign a document pledging to [...] "never practice homosexuality again" [...] in exchange for being allowed to remain in the Air Force. Matlovich refused. Despite his exemplary military record, tours of duty in Vietnam, and high performance evaluations, the panel ruled Matlovich unfit for service, and he was recommended for a General (Under Honorable Conditions) discharge. The base commander, Alton J. Thogersen, citing Matlovich's service record, recommended that it be upgraded to Honorable. The Secretary of the Air Force agreed, confirming Matlovich's discharge in October 1975.He sued for reinstatement, but the legal process was a long one, with the case moving back and forth between United States District and Circuit Courts. [...] When, by September 1980, the Air Force had failed to provide U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell an explanation of why Matlovich did not meet its criteria for exception (which by then had been eliminated but still could have applied to him), Gesell ordered him reinstated into the Air Force and promoted. The Air Force offered Matlovich a financial settlement instead. Convinced that the military would find some other reason to discharge him if he reentered the service, or that the conservative Supreme Court would rule against him should the Air Force appeal, Matlovich accepted.

40|$|In his 1969 Congress v. The Supreme Court, Raoul Berger {{evaluated}} the potential claims to supremacy of Congress and the Supreme Court under the <b>exceptions</b> <b>clause</b> of article III and found {{in favor of}} the Supreme Court. Berger explicated a narrow construction of Congress’ express power to make exceptions to the Court’s appellate jurisdiction, holding that Congress’ claimed power to curb judicial excess was at odds with the design of the Constitution and without historical foundation. From 1969 to 1980, Berger reaffirmed his initial reading of the legislative history of article III no less than four times, once in an elaborate response to Congress v. The Supreme Court’s initial reviewers. But over the last several years, Berger apparently grew increasingly frustrated with judicial arrogation of power and increasingly anxious to find a practical remedy for judicial abuse. Finally, in 1982 book-length assault on the work of the Court, Berger delievered a startling reversal of his long-held views on the scope of Congress’ authority, including explanation worthy (one might say) of similar efforts of the Court he has come to detest. This article is premised on the view that Berger’s personal odyssey is relevant on several grounds to the current debate in constitutional theory and history in which Berger prominently figures. First, Berger’s experience with this important issue provides one more illustration of the pitfalls that attend primary reliance upon legislative debate as the key evidence of legislative intent. Second, an analysis of the process of Berger’s own “transformation” of the meaning of the <b>exceptions</b> <b>clause</b> can assist us in determining the extent to which he has a coherent theory of, or even a consistent approach to, constitutional interpretation. Third, some of the methods which characterized Berger’s earliest study of the <b>exceptions</b> <b>clause,</b> implicitly rejected in Berger’s revision, were carried over to his study of the fourteenth amendment. Although a comprehensive treatment of the issue of the original understanding of the fourteenth amendment is necessarily {{beyond the scope of this}} article, illustrative samplings from the historical record suggest that readers have grounds for approaching Government by Judiciary with caution. Fourth, the grounds of justification offered for Berger’s change of position raise the issue whether Berger’s own work matches up to his invocation of the model of the scholar as one who stands above the result-orientation of the political sphere. Finally, Berger has frequently insisted that “scholarly integrity” is always an issue of relevance, as he asks readers to discount the scholarship of others based on samplings which he believes demonstrates the scholar’s lack of capacity to “sift historical materials. ” While, the author’s own view is that every scholarly work must ultimately be evaluated on its merits, to the extent that human nature and the press of time lead us to generalize, Berger’s work on the <b>exceptions</b> <b>clause</b> suggests that readers of his other works should carefully scrutinize the underlying sources to determine whether the inferences drawn are sound...|$|R
