25|$|Hamilton's Coppley Apparel Group <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> {{rare in the}} Canadian {{clothing}} industry - adding jobs. The company plans to expand its employment by almost 200 jobs - about 30 per cent - starting with 50 additional jobs this year in 2007. Coppley's growth burst will bring its workforce to about 750 people, {{the majority of them}} in Hamilton. The new jobs follow exploding sales growth as the company uses computer-aided custom tailoring of suits that give struggling retailers a much-needed cash-flow boost. Coppley, which has been a fixture in downtown Hamilton for more than 150 years, pioneered a method of using a computer, a grid and a digital camera to do the work of a master tailor, producing made-to-measure suits in as few as seven days - work that used to take six weeks.|$|E

In 2006, Peace Now director Yariv Oppenheimer reportedly urged the U.S. to pressure Israel into evacuating West Bank outposts, according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable. Oppenheimer {{was quoted as saying}} that Israel might [...] "evacuate a few outposts to show the U.S. that it <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something,</b> but in exchange it is trying to co-opt the settlers by retroactively approving some outposts and giving them a freer hand in building in the West Bank." ...|$|E

2500|$|Amnesia {{the damage}} or {{disruption}} of memory processes {{is a very}} popular subject in movies since 1915. [...] Although its portrayal is usually inaccurate, there are some exceptions. [...] Memento (2000) {{is said to be}} inspired by the condition of the famous amnesic patient known as HM. [...] The main character Leonard suffers from anterograde amnesia after a traumatic attack in which his wife dies. [...] He maintains his identity and shows very little retrograde amnesia. [...] He also displays some of the daily memory problems that are experiences by most amnesics, such as forgetting names or where he is going. Another fairly accurate portrayal of memory disturbances is the non-human character Dory in Finding Nemo (2003). [...] This fish, like Leonard, shows memory problems faced by most amnesics where she forgets names, has difficulty storing and recalling information, and often forgets what she is doing, or why she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Critics vary in terming Evanescence a rock {{or metal}} band, but most {{identify}} them as {{some form of}} gothic band. Publications such as The New York Times, Rough Guides and Rolling Stone have identified Evanescence as a gothic metal act, while other sources such as IGN and Spin have termed them gothic rock. They have been compared {{to a variety of}} bands from differing genres, such as nu metal ensembles like Linkin Park, gothic metal groups like Lacuna Coil, and symphonic metal acts like Nightwish and Within Temptation. David Browne of Blender offers an elaborate description of the band's music as [...] "goth Christian nü-metal with a twist of melancholic Enya." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters describes Evanescence's guitar riffs to be similar to nu metal. Adrian Jackson of My Dying Bride stated that he feels Evanescence <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> similar to his own gothic metal group, only in a more commercial direction. Other genres and influences used to describe the band's sound include industrial rock, alternative metal, hard rock, and progressive metal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principles}} of Rylands v Fletcher were initially applied in Scots law, {{first in the}} case of Mackintosh v Mackintosh, where a fire spreading from the defendant's land to the claimant's land caused property damage. Scots lawyers and judges applied Rylands differently from their English counterparts, however. While the rule is interpreted in England and Wales as being distinct from negligence and the rules of duty of care and liability applied there, the principle in Scotland was that [...] "negligence is still the ground of liability. The only difference is that in such cases the proprietor <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> upon his property which is in its nature dangerous and not necessary (or usual?) in the ordinary management of the particular kind of property, and he is therefore bound to observe a higher degree of diligence to prevent injury to his neighbour". The use of Rylands in Scots law, which was started in Mackintosh, finally came to an end in RHM Bakeries v Strathclyde Regional Council. Lord Fraser, as part of his judgment, stated that the idea of strict liability that was brought into play by Rylands was not a part of Scots law, and the idea that it ever had been valid was [...] "a heresy that ought to be extirpated".|$|E

2500|$|While Éire {{is simply}} the name for the island of Ireland in the Irish language, and {{sometimes}} used in English, Erin is a common poetic name for Ireland, as in Erin go bragh. The {{distinction between the two}} is one of the difference between cases of nouns in Irish. Éire is the nominative case, the case that (in the modern Gaelic languages) is used for nouns that are the subject of a sentence, i.e., the noun that <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> as well as the direct object of a sentence. Erin derives from Éirinn, the Irish dative case of Éire, which has replaced the nominative case in Déise Irish and some non-standard sub-dialects elsewhere, in Scottish Gaelic (where the usual word for Ireland is [...] ) and Manx (a form of Gaelic), where the word is spelled [...] "Nerin," [...] with the initial n- probably representing a fossilisation of the preposition in/an [...] "in" [...] (cf. Irish in Éirinn, Scottish an Èirinn/ann an Èirinn [...] "in Ireland"). The genitive case, Éireann, is used in the Gaelic forms of the titles of companies and institutions in Ireland e.g. Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail), Dáil Éireann (Irish Parliament), Poblacht na hÉireann (The Republic of Ireland) or Tuaisceart Éireann (Northern Ireland) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, {{the rock}} group Evanescence from Arkansas, United States also found {{commercial}} {{success with the}} release of their debut album Fallen. Their style represents a blend of gothic and alternative metal with critics drawing comparisons to other alternative metal acts like P.O.D. and Linkin Park. Further comparisons have since been drawn between Evanescence and gothic metal groups like Within Temptation and Lacuna Coil. Critic Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wryly notes that while Lacuna Coil [...] "had been tirelessly building a fanbase in Europe since the late 1990s with their listener-friendly brand of goth metal", they had been overshadowed by [...] "a bunch of corn-fed kids from Arkansas with a big publicity machine behind them [...] the very sound the Italian sextet had helped pioneer, and present it to the American suburban goth kids in a much more pop-oriented, dumbed down variation". Cammila Albertson of Allmusic similarly locates Evanescence as one step further from gothic metal, offering the description of the band as [...] "a pop version of an already diluted brand of metal". While Fernando Ribeiro of Moonspell contends that Evanescence is not a metal band, publications such as the New York Times, Rough Guides, Rolling Stone and Blender have nonetheless identified Evanescence as a gothic metal act. Adrian Jackson, former bassist My Dying Bride feels the American group <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> similar to My Dying Bride music, only in a more commercial direction. Gregor Mackintosh of Paradise Lost notes a generation gap between his group and Evanescence, suggesting that Paradise Lost has only influenced Evanescence indirectly through other acts like Lacuna Coil. The success of Evanescence has been recognized [...] for opening [...] "new grounds" [...] for gothic metal bands to [...] "explore and conquer".|$|E
