And <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> knew it was gonna happen, and I was really upset. Because I had just retired, I {{was trying to be}} a pop songwriter, not an artist." ...|$|E
500|$|Aguilera also commented {{about the}} album during an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest, [...] "It's really a fun, fun record. Really futuristic. I {{was inspired by a}} lot of electronic music, electronic artists, and so you'll hear all those elements". She added, [...] " [...] different textures and things with my voice that I was really playing around with and having fun with on this record that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> knew I could do, vocally". [...] "Bionic" [...] was recorded at three places: Dubsided recording studio in Los Angeles, California, Dreamland Studios and Mad Decent Mausoleum in Philadelphia. Aguilera's vocals were recorded at The Red Lips Room in Beverly Hills, California. The track was written by Aguilera, Kalenna Harper, John Hill and Switch. Hill and Switch also produced and provided musical instruments to [...] "Bionic".|$|E

[...] "There {{were a lot of}} cooks in the kitchen, a lot of voices around me, and I wanted to step away so I could hear my own voice again", McAdams said in 2013. [...] "Truthfully, I never really wanted to be a big movie star. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> wanted to work outside of Canada, or outside of the theatre." [...] During that period, McAdams turned down roles in the films The Devil Wears Prada (2006), Casino Royale (2006), [...] (2006) and Get Smart (2008). In February 2006, she made a one-off stage {{appearance}} in The Vagina Monologues at St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, Toronto to raise funds for V-Day. That same year, McAdams received a Rising Star Award nomination from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and hosted the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Sia {{released}} her fifth studio album, We Are Born, which peaked at number {{two on the}} ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association. Following the release of We Are Born, Sia decided to retire from the career as a recording artist and established {{a career as a}} songwriter. She wrote the song [...] "Titanium" [...] for American singer Alicia Keys, but it was later sent to David Guetta, who included Sia's original demo vocals on the song and released it as a single in 2011. [...] "Titanium" [...] was a commercial success worldwide, peaking within the top five of record charts in the United States, Australia and numerous European regions. However, Sia was not pleased with the success of the single: [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> knew it was gonna happen, and I was really upset. Because I had just retired, I was trying to be a pop songwriter, not an artist." [...] From 2011 to 2013, Sia became well known for writing songs for Beyoncé, Flo Rida, Christina Aguilera, and Rihanna.|$|E
500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home. Reagle told the Arizona Daily Wildcat that [...] "for me, {{to be such a}} total nut for animation since I was a kid, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> dreamed [...] It's like a dream I never had coming true." [...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, we want them to think that we got it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. In a lot of ways, I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else." [...] Scott Thompson has a cameo in the episode as Grady, a character that he first voiced in the season 14 episode [...] "Three Gays of the Condo".|$|E

2500|$|Rumours of the {{connection}} between the title of [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] and the initialism [...] "LSD" [...] began circulating shortly after the release of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band LP in June 1967. [...] Paul McCartney gave two interviews that same month admitting to having taken the drug. Lennon later said he was surprised at the idea that the song title was a hidden reference to LSD, countering that the song [...] "wasn't about that at all", and that it [...] "was purely unconscious that it came out to be LSD. Until someone pointed it out, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> thought of it. I mean, who would ever bother to look at initials of a title?... It's not an acid song." ...|$|E

I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, so he has to make YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{originally}} {{scheduled for}} release in 1989 (a novelization, written by science fiction author Robert Thurston, was published that year,) the film's theatrical run was initially delayed until April 1990 due to Empire International Pictures' bankruptcy during production. After more delays, Triumph Films released the film to theaters on November 21, 1990. When it peaked in its second weekend at the 13th spot, it grossed $464,441 in 333 theaters, averaging $1,394 per theater; it eventually earned a domestic total gross of $1,272,977. Its limited run in theaters prompted science fiction writer Gardner Dozois to remark that [...] "Robot Jox, a movie with a screenplay by Joe Haldeman, was supposedly released this year, but if it played through Philadelphia at all, it must have done so fast, because <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> saw a listing for it, let alone the movie itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Michaels {{expressed}} happiness at Hart's 2006 induction {{into the}} Hall of Fame, the Hart–Michaels relationship remained laced with antagonism. Michaels criticized Hart's behavior and conduct during {{his days in}} WWF in his 2005 autobiography, comparing the Screwjob to a [...] "mafia hit," [...] and Hart has stated in his 2007 autobiography that he would [...] "never forgive" [...] Michaels. In interviews prior to the induction ceremony, Hart asserted that he would walk out from the ceremony if he saw Michaels anywhere on the WrestleMania 22 weekend. Michaels {{decided to leave the}} Hall of Fame ceremony early to avoid a possible scene. Hart did not appear at the WrestleMania show in a mini-ceremony with the other inductees, explaining {{in an interview that he}} had never intended to attend or appear at the show. Hart would later return to WWE television on the June 11, 2007 edition of Raw, where he appeared in a taped promo spot mocking Mr. McMahon's [...] "appreciation night." [...] While he was able to reconcile to a degree with McMahon, Hart had never reconciled with Michaels. In a November 17, 2008 radio interview, Hart mocked Michaels' version of the incident, saying, [...] "Shawn's this Christian today; and in his book, he wrote that Vince took a dive and that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> hit him and I thought, 'This guy is such a liar'. I wonder what kind of Christian he is." [...] Asked if he had seen or spoken to Michaels since 1997, Hart said, [...] "No. And I hope I never do... for his sake." ...|$|E
