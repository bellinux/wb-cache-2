40|$|AbstractAt present, most {{commercial}} {{computer-aided manufacturing}} (CAM) systems are deficient in efficiency and performances on generating tool path during machining impellers. To solve the problem, this article develops a special software to plan cutting path for ruled surface impellers. An approximation algorithm to generate cutting path for machining integral ruled surface impellers is proposed. By fitting sampling data points of an impeller blade into a curve, {{a model of}} ruled surface blade of an impeller is built up. Furthermore, by calculating the points where the cutter axis vector intersects the free-form hub surface of an impeller, problems about, for instance, the ambiguity in calculation and machining the wide blade surface with a short <b>flute</b> <b>cutter</b> are solved. Finally, an integral impeller cutting path is planned by way of an integrated cutter location control algorithm. Simulation and machining tests with an impeller are performed on a 5 -axis computer numerically controlled (CNC) mill machine, which shows the feasibility of the proposed algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Application of mills with a {{curvilinear}} {{profile of}} the cutting edge (often called rough end mills) allows us to increase milling rate, but a roughness of the surface treated by such mills is higher, than after milling by the "ordinary" mills with the "smooth" cutting edge. Deterioration of a roughness {{is caused by a}} curvature of cutting edge. The shape and sizes of a profile are of crucial importance for forming roughness on a surface. A literary review revealed that depending on a {{profile of the}} cutting edge the roughness of the machined surface makes Ra 2 … 12, 5 μm. There is a developed parametrical computer model to visualize roughness formed on a surface after milling by the <b>fluting</b> <b>cutter</b> and curved cutting edge mill. The computer model also allows a 3 D chip type to be cut off from a work-piece by the mills with various cutting edge profiles. When developing the model it was assumed that the tilt angle of a cutting flute is equal 0 °, a trajectory of the tooth movement is a circle rather than a trochoidal curve. An experimental test of the model has shown that the radial beats of the mill teeth have a very significant effect on the extent of the roughness formed on the machined surface. After amendments - taking into consideration teeth beats - introduced into model the modeling error made less than 5 % that {{can be explained by the}} fact that profile parameters of the cutting edge of mills embedded in the model are inaccurate because of the tilt angle the cutting flutes. The analysis of the surface model has shown that after milling the work piece has a cellular structure. Each tooth with curved cutting edge forms the cell repeating with the next turn of a mill. The adjacent teeth form identical cells displaced in the feed path with respect to the cell formed by the previous tooth by the chip load Sz. Unlike processing by the ordinary mills with the "smooth" cutting edge in this case on a surface there is a surface texture not only in the feed path, but in the axial direction as well. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Flutes / teeth: The flutes of {{the milling}} bit are the deep helical grooves {{running up the}} cutter, while the sharp blade {{along the edge of}} the flute is known as the tooth. The tooth cuts the {{material}}, and chips of this material are pulled up the flute by the rotation of the cutter. There is almost always one tooth per <b>flute,</b> but some <b>cutters</b> have two teeth per flute. Often, the words flute and tooth are used interchangeably. Milling cutters may have from one to many teeth, with 2, 3 and 4 being most common. Typically, the more teeth a cutter has, the more rapidly it can remove material. So, a 4-tooth cutter can remove material at twice the rate of a 2-tooth cutter.|$|R
40|$|Tool steel {{materials}} have poor machinability, {{as the high}} hardness of the material will cause high cutting forces, premature failure of the cutting tools, and is also associated with machining induced tensile stresses within the work piece. Due to high experimental costs, there is no recent research on end milling tool steel, using full factorial experimental or numerical design. A 3 D FE-model of a precision end milling process with a two <b>flute</b> ball nose <b>cutter</b> were established in this paper. The FE-Model used a subroutine to model hardening realised through the Johnson-Cook model, additionally were a material removal criteria developed and implemented. Through full factorial numerical simulations the influence of cutting parameters on cutting force of H 13 tool steel was studied. Depth of cut {{was found to be}} the most influential machining parameter on cutting forces followed by feed rate and surface speed. Four milling experiments were carried out to validate the simulation results. It was found that the simulation and the experiments had a good agreement on the cutting forces. The validated FEA model can be used for further studies on residual stress or temperatures and to optimise the cutting process...|$|R

Three parameters namely spindle speed, feed rate {{and depth of}} cut were identified and ranges of the parameters for the present investigation were determined from preliminary experiments. Taguchi method based on L 9 orthogonal array was selected and experiments were conducted as per experimental layout plan.

40|$|American Society of Mechanical EngineersThe {{measurement}} of cutting force systems {{is one of}} the most frequently used techniques for the monitoring of machining processes. Its wide spread application ranges from tool condition identification, feedback control, cutting system design, to process optimization. To gain fundamental understanding of the force system in machining, this paper presents the work of establishing a closed form expression for the cutting force in end milling as an explicit function of cutting parameters and tool/workpiece geometry. Based on the theoretical local cutting force model, the generation of total cutting forces is formulated as the angular convolution of three uncorrelated cutting process component functions, namely the elemental cutting force function, the chip width density function, and the tooth sequence function. The elemental cutting force function is related to the chip formation process in an elemental cutting area and it is characterized by the chip thickness variation, specific cutting pressure constants, and entry/exit angles. The chip width density function defines the chip width per unit cutter rotation along a <b>cutter</b> <b>flute</b> within the range of axial depth of cut as the function of the angular position of each cutting point. The tooth sequence function represents the spacing between flutes as well as their cutting sequence as the cutter rotates. The analysis of cutting forces is extended into the Fourier domain by taking the frequency multiplication of the transforms of the three component functions. Fourier series coefficients of the cutting forces are shown to be algebraic functions of various tool parameters and cutting conditions. Simulation results are presented in the frequency domain to illustrate the effects of process parameters. A series of end milling experiments are performed and their results discussed to validate the analytical model...|$|R
40|$|The {{end milling}} process is used {{extensively}} in a gamut of manufacturing areas. It accounts {{for up to}} 40 % {{of the cost of}} fabrication of non-electrical parts for a high performance aircraft. This economically justifies the effort to find ways to reduce inaccuracy caused in milling by workpiece deformation, fixture deflection and cutter deflection {{to improve the quality of}} parts. The process is also used extensively for roughing and finishing of dies. However, the conventional die manufacturing process, which uses the milling process, is too time consuming because of the extensive CNC programming involved. Furthermore skilled labor required for CNC programming accounts for the high cost of die manufacturing. Therefore new processes need to be developed that will eliminate CNC programming and possibly reduce the usage of the milling process thereby reducing the cost and time required to produce parts;An analytical non-linear optimization model has been developed which can determine the maximum inaccuracy due to workpiece deformation and the optimal clamping forces that are required to minimize work piece deformation while ensuring that the workpiece will not slip during machining. However, this model assumes rigid fixturing elements and is only suitable for simple workpiece shapes;A finite element model and a simple novel algorithm has been developed which has the same objective as the analytical non-linear optimization model. This model can be used for any complex shaped workpiece or fixture. The model also takes into account the flexibility of fixtures;Inaccuracy in machining is also caused by deflection of the tool. A study of the deflection of a milling cutter due to the action of the cutting forces was performed. An analytical equation was developed to determine the deflection of an end mill under a cutting force. The equation was verified by modeling the complete geometry of a four <b>flute</b> milling <b>cutter</b> using the finite element analysis module of I-DEAS software. The deflections obtained by the finite element model were exactly the same as those obtained by using the analytical equation. Previous researchers modeled the milling cutter as a simple cylinder which resulted in some error in the result;Three die manufacturing processes are proposed, namely, the casting prototype process, the EDM milling process and the copy milling process. All three processes use rapid prototyping to eliminate costly and time consuming CNC programming. All the three processes are economical compared to conventional processes provided there are large number of surfaces on the part. If the part has very few surfaces the conventional process will require less time for CNC programming making it more efficient. The Casting prototype process does not use milling whereas the EDM milling uses milling for rough machining. These two process would minimize inaccuracy in parts by eliminating milling or using milling to remove the rough stock only. The copy milling process uses milling but the models developed here can be used to minimize error in this process. All three processes have the additional advantage that they are more time efficient and economical than the conventional process of making dies...|$|R

Each experiment was conducted three times and the surface roughness and chip thickness was measured by a surface analyser of Surf Test- 211 series (Mitutoyo) and Digital Micrometer (Mitutoyo) with least count 0. 001 mm respectively. The selection of orthogonal array {{is concerned with the}} total degree of freedom of process parameters. Total degree of freedom (DOF) associated with three parameters is equal to 6 (3 X 2). The degree of freedom for the orthogonal array should be greater than or at least equal to that of the process parameters. There by, a L 9 orthogonal array having degree of freedom equal to (9 - 1 = 8) 8 has been considered. But in present case each experiment is conducted three times, therefore total degree of freedom (9 X 3 - 1 = 26) 26 has been considered. Finally, confirmation test (ANOVA) was conducted to compare the predicted values with the experimental values confirm its effectiveness in the analysis of surface roughness and chip thickness.

40|$|Carbon fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} (CFRP) {{have seen}} {{a significant increase in}} use over the years thanks to their specific properties. Despite continuous improvements in the production methods of laminated parts, a trimming operation is still necessary to achieve the functional dimensions required by engineering specifications. Laminates made of carbon fibers are very abrasive and cause rapid tool wear, and require high cutting temperatures. This creates damage to the epoxy matrix, whose glass-transition temperature is often recognized to be about 180 °C. This study aims to highlight the influence of the cutting temperature generated by tool wear on the surface finish and mechanical properties obtained from tensile tests. Trimming operations were performed on a quasi-isotropic 24 -ply carbon/epoxy laminate, of 3. 6 mm thickness, with a 6 <b>flutes</b> diamond-coated (CVD) <b>cutter.</b> The test specimens of 6 mm and 12 mm wide were obtained by trimming. The reduced width of the coupons allowed amplification of the effect of defects on the measured properties by increasing the proportion of coupon cross-section occupied by the defects. A new tool and a tool in an advanced state of wear were used to generate different cutting temperatures. Results showed a cutting temperature of 300 °C for the new tool and 475 °C for the worn tool. The analysis revealed that the specimens machined with the new tool have no thermal damage and the cut is clean. The plies oriented at − 45 ° presented the worst surface finish according to the failure mode of the fiber. For the worn tool, the surface was degraded and the matrix was carbonized. After cutting, observations showed a degraded resin spread on the machined surface, which reduced the surface roughness and hid the cutting defects. In support of these observations, the tensile tests showed no variation of the mechanical properties for the 12 mm-wide specimens, but did show a 10 % loss in mechanical properties for the 6 mm-wide specimens. These results suggest that the thermal defects caused by tool wear affect tensile properties, but only from a certain coupon width below which the machining defects increase their influence on the properties...|$|R
