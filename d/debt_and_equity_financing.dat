We find that the market of FDI finance for SMEs is subject to considerable capital market imperfections. The information problems and lack of collateral that often characterize international investment, the home bias of financiers and the capital gearing method used by banks to evaluate small firms' foreign projects give rise to financial constraints.

The results indicate that external financing of investments is not a function of institutions, although the form of external finance is. The authors identify two explanations for this. First, legal and financial institutions affect different types of external finance in offsetting ways. Second, firm size is an important determinant of whether firms can have access to different types of external finance.

40|$|Much of {{the recent}} growth and {{development}} literature {{is based on the}} notion that economies may exhibit multiple equilibria, due to coordination failures. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to analyze which economic institutions may solve such failures. We examine the role of banks as `catalysts' for industrialization. When there are limits to contracting, and complementarities exist among investments of different firms, we derive coordination costs endogenously and show that banks can acts as catalysts provided that: (i) they are sufficiently large to mobilize a critical mass of firms, and (ii) they possess sufficient market power to make profits from coordination. We also show that the costs of coordination depend critically on the contracting instruments available to banks. In particular, allowing banks to hold <b>equity</b> reduces <b>and</b> sometimes eliminates the cost of coordination. We use our results to interpret the patterns of early industrialization of Belgium, Germany, and Italy in the late 19 th century.

The surviving TBSFs exhibited considerable demand for external finance since 2007, particularly for working capital and early stage R&D, sought mainly from banks, but also with younger TBSFs seeking business angel finance and innovation grants and more mature TBSFs seeking venture capital <b>finance.</b> However, both <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> <b>equity</b> <b>finance</b> have become harder to access for TBSFs, particularly for early stage funding and for more R&D intensive firms, hampering their growth potential.

This paper therefore aims to examine infrastructure projects’ characteristics and how socio-political and economic investment environments interplay to influence the degree of private sector participation (PPP) in infrastructure delivery in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach Using World Bank Public-private infrastructure advisory facility (PPIAF) and private participation in infrastructure (PPI) project database data from 1994 to 2013, binary logistic regression was used to: determine {{the probability of a}} higher or lower degree of PPP; and examine the significance of factors that are determinants of private investments. Findings The findings reveal that the private sector is more likely to invest in a higher degree of PPP infrastructure projects through greenfield and concession vehicles as opposed to management and leasing contracts. From the extant literature, drivers of PPP included infrastructure project characteristics and the social–economic–political health of the host country. However, the significance, direction and magnitude of these drivers vary.

40|$|Although the {{interaction}} between taxation and corporate finance decisions has been widely studied, empirical findings show conflicting results so far. Different outcomes may be ascribed to differences in the theoretical models, {{in the definition of}} the variables of interest, in the source of variability of data (across firms and over time), and in the econometric methods. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the relationship between fiscal variables <b>and</b> corporate <b>debt</b> choices by tackling any cause of differences listed above. We can do this thanks to the availability of a large and very detailed data-set on Italian manufacturing companies over a long period with quite a lot of changes in the tax legislation. We find that both the relative price of <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> <b>equity</b> <b>finance</b> (the trade-off fiscal effect) and the net-of-tax cash flow (the pecking-order fiscal effect) are significant and robust ways through which corporate taxation affects financing decisions. Non-debt tax shields (another trade-off fiscal effect) are also important in explaining borrowing. The time dimension of data plays a substantial role in modelling the dynamic relationships and in giving variability to cost of capital data. In this context, various OLS estimation methods usually employed by the empirical literature are not consistent; we suggest the use of IV or GMM depending on the sample size...|$|R

40|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was {{projected}} to raise corporate taxes {{by more than}} $ 120 billion over the 1986 - 1991 period. Actual federal corporate tax receipts {{in the last five}} years have fallen far short of these projections. This paper explores the factors that have contributed to this shortfall. The most important factor is lower-than-expected corporate profits. The underperformance of corporate profits can be attributed to three principal causes. First, the predicted rates of corporate profits when the 1986 Tax Reform Act was enacted were high by historical standards. The U. S. economy in the late 1980 s did not experience total returns on corporate capital, the combined return to <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> <b>debt</b> investors, as high as the forecasts would have suggested. Second, corporate interest payments were significantly higher, as a share of corporate operating income or GNP, in the late 1980 s than in the years leading up to the Tax Reform Act. This reduced the corporate tax base, and may in substantial part ultimately be attributable to the marginal incentive effects for <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> <b>equity</b> <b>finance</b> provided in the 1986 Tax Reform Act. Third, also quite likely in reaction to recent tax changes, the last few years have seen rapid growth in the income reported by Subchapter S corporations. This income is taxed under the individual income tax. The rise of S corporations has therefore contributed to the erosion of the corporate income tax. ...|$|R
