5|$|In April 1934, {{following}} the moving of the Richard Johnson, Clapham and Morris Ltd firm to Trafford Park, the playing grounds were {{offered to the}} Parks Committee of the Manchester Corporation for £2,400. At the time, the ground was described as being fenced all round with iron railings, containing bowling greens, a number of tennis courts and a cricket pitch, together with two well-built pavilions. For many years the land was used for community events including football and funfairs. A cycle speedway track was built during the 1980s. In 2005, a 2.4 m green powder coated weld mesh <b>fence</b> <b>with</b> gates was erected at {{the perimeter of the}} fields. Moston Juniors Football Club secured a lease for the site in 2007, with a view to future development.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{annotation}} of {{the stone}} is in a church inventory from 1829, and it says that the stone was illegible. Ljungström documented in 1861 {{that it was in}} the rock <b>fence</b> <b>with</b> the inscription facing the cemetery. When Djurklou visited the stone in 1869, it was still in the same spot. Djurklou considered its placement to be unhelpful because a part of the runic band was buried in the soil, so he commanded an honourable farmer to select a group of men and remove the stone from the wall. The next time Djurklou visited the location, he found the stone raised in the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|A stuccoed brick <b>fence</b> <b>with</b> {{cast iron}} gates and an iron Star of David enclose the cemetery. Within the walls, {{there are two}} main {{pathways}} which meet {{in the center of the}} cemetery at a circular decorative piece including a fountain. The oldest graves are in the northern half of the cemetery while newer graves were added progressively south. Many grave sites are adorned with well-maintained Victorian era funerary art, which gives the cemetery its historic significance. Among the monuments include the grave enclosure of the Winner family, which includes a bronze bust of Mark Winner, and two marble angels at the entrance of the plot. Other examples include the grave of David L. Rosenbaum, topped with marble shoes and stockings, the grave of Julius Elson, marked by a carved marble fainting couch, and a memorial to Mattimore Meyer, featuring a marble angel.|$|E
50|$|During the 18th century, {{the fashion}} of dueling in Europe focused on the lighter smallsword, and <b>fencing</b> <b>with</b> the broadsword {{came to be seen}} as a {{speciality}} of Scotland. A number of fencing manuals teaching <b>fencing</b> <b>with</b> the Scottish broadsword were published throughout the 18th century.|$|R

5000|$|The German [...] ("long sword") in 15th and 16th-century manuals {{does not}} denote {{a type of}} weapon, but the {{technique}} of <b>fencing</b> <b>with</b> both hands at the hilt, contrasting with [...] ("short sword") used of <b>fencing</b> <b>with</b> the same weapon, but with one hand gripping the blade (also known as a half-sword).|$|R

50|$|Of especial {{influence}} was the Dardi school of <b>fencing</b> <b>with</b> the spada da lato in the 16th to early 17th centuries, which {{gave rise to}} the classical early modern of <b>fencing</b> <b>with</b> the rapier, including Elizabethan Fencing in England and the French school of fencing in the 18th century (which in turn developed into modern sport fencing).|$|R
25|$|The university's {{architecture}} {{follows the}} Georgian style popular {{at the time}} of the campus' relocation to East Parkway. Arch-covered walkways traverse the main campus, allowing students and faculty to get to most buildings shielded from the weather. The campus is enclosed by an iron <b>fence</b> <b>with</b> brick accents with entrances on East Parkway South, Central Avenue, and Avery Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Hold down: The {{circular}} sawblade of a tablesaw {{will pick}} {{up a piece of}} wood if not held down. Hold downs can be a vertical version of featherboards, attached to a <b>fence</b> <b>with</b> magnets or clamps. Another type of hold down uses wheels on a spring-loaded mechanism to push down on a workpiece as it is guided past the blade.|$|E

25|$|After the suspension, Poirier fought Eddie Alvarez on May 13, 2017 at UFC 211. Poirier rocked Alvarez in {{the second}} round, but was {{subsequently}} dropped when Alvarez landed two illegal knees while Poirier was against the <b>fence.</b> <b>With</b> the Texas commission not operating under the new unified rules, referee Herb Dean declared the fight a No Contest as {{he did not believe}} Alvarez knew Poirier was a grounded opponent at the time.|$|E
25|$|Pepé Le Pew storylines {{typically}} involve Pepé {{in pursuit}} of a female black cat, whom Pepé mistakes for a skunk ("la belle femme skunk fatale"). The cat, who was retroactively named Penelope Pussycat, often has a white stripe painted down her back, usually by accident (such as by squeezing under a <b>fence</b> <b>with</b> wet white paint). Penelope frantically races to get away from him because of his putrid odour, his overly aggressive manner or both, while Pepé hops after her at a leisurely pace.|$|E
25|$|To {{guarantee}} her members reliable {{means to}} <b>fence</b> <b>with</b> other fraternities of like principles, Polyhymnia joint the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC) in 1927 and was renamed Corps Altsachsen. The name change from Polyhymnia to Corps Altsachsen happened {{in compliance with}} WSC rules for fraternity names at that time. Likewise, most of the local fraternities merged to form similar umbrella organizations in the following years. From that point on, most of the social activity, such as eloquent balls as well as fencing engagements became limited to like-minded fraternities, the German Student Corps.|$|E

25|$|Because snails usually {{will not}} cross a copper band, another {{solution}} is to top the <b>fence</b> <b>with</b> 3-inch-wide (or wider) copper band. The band can be bent so {{that part of it}} faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.|$|E
25|$|Lee's men {{advanced}} {{with the}} five regiments in line abreast. The 3rd and 5th Virginia Cavalry regiments, led by sharpshooters, ran along the stone <b>fence</b> <b>with</b> the expectation they would find a gap in it somewhere. Pelham moved forward with Lee's men, and as he waved them through a gate in the fence, a shell exploded over his head, sending a tiny fragment into his brain, mortally wounding him. He died a few hours later. The Confederate advance was repulsed by carbine fire from the 16th Pennsylvania Cavalry and shelling from Martin's battery.|$|E
25|$|Al Ghajar {{village is}} another complex border issue west of Shebaa farms. Before the 1967 war this Alawite village was in Syria. It is divided by an {{international}} boundary, with {{the northern part of}} the village on the Lebanese side since 2000. Residents of both parts hold Israeli citizenship, and in the northern part often a Lebanese passport as well. Today the entire village is surrounded by a <b>fence,</b> <b>with</b> no division between the Israeli-occupied and Lebanese sides. There is an Israeli army checkpoint at the entrance to the village from the rest of the Golan Heights.|$|E
40|$|Fine nylon mesh fences (135 cm high) {{with varying}} lengths of downward-sloping {{collection}} overhangs were evaluated for efficacy in excluding the female cabbage flies Delia radicum (L.) from plots of radish, Raphanus sativus (L.). During three trials conducted in 1994 and 1995, fences without overhangs, <b>fences</b> <b>with</b> 12. 5 -cm overhangs, or <b>fences</b> <b>with</b> 50 -cm overhangs were tested against <b>fences</b> <b>with</b> standard 25 -cm overhangs and unfenced control plots. In <b>fenced</b> plots <b>with</b> standard 25 -cm overhangs, {{the mean number}} of D. radicum females caught on yellow sticky traps placed within plots was 85 % less than those caught in corresponding control plots. The mean numbers of D. radicum females caught in <b>fenced</b> enclosures <b>with</b> no overhangs, 12. 5 -cm overhangs, or 50 -cm overhangs, were 61, 67, and 94 % less than those caught in corresponding control plots, respectively. The mean proportion of radishes damaged by D. radicum larvae inside enclosures with 25 -cm overhangs was 62 % less than in corresponding control plots. The mean proportions of radishes damaged inside <b>fences</b> <b>with</b> no overhangs, 12. 5 -cm overhangs, or 50 -cm overhangs were 33, 59, and 81 % less than those caught in corresponding control plots, respectively. Results are discussed in terms of defining an appropriate fence design for commercial use...|$|R

25|$|Renovations {{continued}} through the early 2000s. In 2000 the Conservatory Water opened after a six-month restoration effort, with a $4 million project beginning on the 59th Street Pond, one of the park's most visible and heavily used landscapes. A new Reservoir fence was installed in 2003 under a $2 million capital project that replaced the old chain-link <b>fence</b> <b>with</b> {{a replica of the}} 8,000-foot long steel and cast-iron one that had enclosed the Reservoir in 1926. The new fence, along with removal of invasive trees and shrubs, restored the panoramic views of the park and Manhattan skyline.|$|E
25|$|At 12:00 on July 17 British troops began {{crossing}} the harbor on barges from Boston and landed at Morton's Point on the peninsula, southeast from Breed's Hill. By 2:00o'clock they had landed between 3000 and 4000 men, {{under the command}} of General Howe. Putnam's regiments then began marching for the peninsula across Charlestown neck under heavy cannon fire from British ships, where they arrived, fatigued from marching. At this point Colonel Stark and Captain Dearborn arrived with their troops from New Hampshire and joined in with Prescott's troops, increasing American troop strength to about 1600. Stark's regiment was positioned at the rail <b>fence</b> <b>with</b> Dearbonn in his right wing.|$|E
25|$|Combining a small culvert <b>Fence</b> <b>with</b> a Pond Leveler Pipe {{is another}} {{effective}} method to protect culverts from beaver damming. The culvert fence is made {{small enough to}} encourage the beavers to dam on it, but the resulting pond is prevented from rising to a dangerous level by a Pond Leveler Pipe installed through the culvert fence. The Fence and Pipe flow device needs very little maintenance and limits where and how high the beavers can dam; however, to be most effective, the intake end of the pipe should usually sit in at least 3 feet of water. When this water depth is not possible, a simple Culvert Protective Fence {{may be the best}} option.|$|E
