Meanwhile, Homer escapes jail by attacking Hans Moleman, who was delivering books to the inmates. He enters the burning bar to confront Moe, and the two start fighting. They are both soon rendered unconscious from smoke inhalation, but Barney appears and rescues them. The bar is completely destroyed, and during their reconciliation Homer promises to help Moe get back on his feet. In the final scene, Homer has allowed Moe to relocate <b>his</b> <b>bar</b> to the Simpsons' home.|$|E

5|$|Members {{who would}} become famous {{included}} George Burns and Bucharest-born Edward G. Robinson, who had <b>his</b> <b>Bar</b> Mitzvah there in 1906. Robinson would later laugh that his propensity for taking the stage was demonstrated when he gave the longest Bar Mitzvah speech {{in the history of}} the congregation—"but the men sat still and listened".|$|E
5|$|The synagogue nearly {{failed in}} the early 20th century, but the 1905 hiring of Israel Goldfarb as rabbi, the {{purchase}} of its current buildings, and the 1908 merger with Talmud Torah Anshei Emes re-invigorated the congregation. The famous composer Aaron Copland celebrated <b>his</b> <b>Bar</b> Mitzvah there in 1913, and long-time Goldman Sachs head Sidney Weinberg was married there in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Jerome David Salinger {{was born}} in New York City, on New Year's Day, 1919. His father, Sol Salinger, sold kosher cheese, and was from a Jewish family of Lithuanian descent, his father having been the rabbi for the Adath Jeshurun {{congregation}} in Louisville, Kentucky. Salinger's mother, Marie (née Jillich), {{was born in}} Atlantic, Iowa, of Scottish, German, and Irish descent, but changed her name to Miriam and considered herself Jewish after marrying Salinger's father. Salinger did not learn {{that his mother was}} not of Jewish ancestry until just after he celebrated <b>his</b> <b>bar</b> mitzvah. His only sibling was his older sister Doris (1911–2001).|$|E
60|$|At daybreak he awoke, {{or rather}} was awakened, {{by the sound}} of a {{familiar}} voice, and, looking through <b>his</b> <b>bars,</b> perceived Metem standing before them, guarded but unbound, with indignation written on his face, and tears in his quick eyes.|$|R
6000|$|But Jealousy has fled: <b>his</b> <b>bars,</b> <b>his</b> bolts, [...] His {{withered}} sentinel, duenna sage!

50|$|This proved trickier than first thought, {{because as}} {{the pieces of}} {{honeycomb}} cooled, they absorbed moisture and started sticking together. This hygroscopic nature of honeycomb led Hoadley to eventually dip <b>his</b> <b>bars</b> in chocolate, to keep the honeycomb dry and crunchy. Thus, in 1933, the Violet Crumble bar was created.|$|R
5|$|Lauryn Noelle Hill {{was born}} on May 26, 1975, in East Orange, New Jersey to English teacher Valerie Hill and {{computer}} and management consultant Mal Hill. She has one older brother named Malaney (born 1972). Her Baptist family moved to New York and Newark for short periods until settling in South Orange, New Jersey. She had a middle-class upbringing, knowing both many Jewish families and many black ones. Future actor Zach Braff lived in the neighborhood, and she attended <b>his</b> <b>Bar</b> Mitzvah.|$|E

Angered and upset that his plans have been discovered, Stewie runs upstairs. Soon after, the wives storm the bar and Lois tells them that she only wants to feel appreciated and special, something to which all the other women relate. Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally starts a fire.|$|E
5|$|While {{working at}} <b>his</b> <b>bar,</b> Wever made {{a return to}} {{baseball}} in a coaching role. He was named varsity baseball coach at Redwood High School in Larkspur, California in 2008, after having volunteered for the freshman team the year before.

5|$|I {{know why}} the caged bird sings, ah me,When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,When he beats <b>his</b> <b>bars</b> and would be free;It is not a carol of joy or glee,But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings— I {{know why the}} caged bird sings.|$|R
5|$|Blaine {{spent the}} summer of 1892 at <b>his</b> <b>Bar</b> Harbor cottage, and did not involve himself in the presidential {{campaign}} other than to make a single speech in New York in October. Harrison was defeated soundly in his rematch against former president Cleveland and when Blaine returned to Washington at the close of 1892, he and Harrison were friendlier than they had been in years. Blaine’s health declined rapidly in the winter of 1892–1893, and he died in his Washington home on January 27, 1893. After a funeral at the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington. He was later re-interred in Blaine Memorial Park, Augusta, Maine, in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Dunne {{had hoped}} that by moving to New York to write full-time, {{he would be able}} to greatly expand his output, and he signed to do several projects, {{including}} a play featuring Mr. Dooley, and for a series of third-person stories featuring Molly Donahue, Bridgeport's resident suffragist. But Dunne found that he could not increase his production, and that some of the Dooley projects were ill-suited to the character: the play went unwritten and the Molly Donahue stories were abandoned after four pieces. Dooley appears as a character in some of them. Fanning found them unsatisfactory, with a misplaced Dooley, deprived of <b>his</b> <b>bar</b> and control of the dialogue. Dunne was not happy with them either: a note from the author appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal after the fourth piece was published there, alleging ill-health and dissatisfaction with the product.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a member}} of the Washington Light Infantry, a local Washington, D.C. militia, and played in many of their amateur {{baseball}} games throughout his life. When not playing, he tended to <b>his</b> <b>bar.</b> Noted for being a genial, friendly individual, he was quick to make friends, and was a fan-favorite in his hometown of Washington, D.C. Kinslow was a heavy drinker however, which caused him to miss games and team movements on occasion. Late into his career, these alcohol issues were much less tolerated, eventually hastening his exit from the game. He died at the age of 35, after a year-long battle with tuberculosis.|$|E
60|$|With that, {{he faced}} round {{a little on}} his billet of wood towards the gate; and Mr. Mopes, the Hermit, {{after two or three}} ridiculous bounces of indecision at his bed and back again, {{submitted}} to what he could not help himself against, and coiled himself on his window-ledge, holding to <b>his</b> <b>bars</b> and looking out rather anxiously.|$|R

5|$|Historian Luis Alberto Sánchez writes that, after Morris closed <b>his</b> <b>bar,</b> {{some of his}} {{bartender}}s left to work {{in other}} locales. Bruiget began working as a bartender for the nearby Grand Hotel Maury, where he continued to serve his pisco sour recipe. His success with the drink led local Limean oral tradition to associate the Hotel Maury as the original home of the pisco sour. As other former apprentices of Morris found other work, they also spread the pisco sour recipe. During the 1930s the drink made its way into California, reaching bars {{as far north as}} the city of San Francisco. By at least the late 1960s the cocktail also found its way to New York.|$|E
5|$|Kuykendall {{was raised}} in Romney and {{received}} his primary education in Hampshire County's rural public schools. He commenced his higher education studies at Hampden–Sydney College in Hampden Sydney, Virginia, and later attended Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. Kuykendall subsequently engaged {{in the study of}} jurisprudence at the Cumberland School of Law of Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee, from which he received a diploma in 1901. He then completed a similar course in law at the University of North Carolina School of Law in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Following this course at the University of North Carolina, Kuykendall passed <b>his</b> <b>bar</b> examination before the North Carolina Supreme Court and was admitted to the bar in North Carolina in September 1903.|$|E
5|$|Melvin {{received}} his early {{education in the}} common primary and secondary schools in Hancock and other neighboring counties. He commenced his studies in jurisprudence {{at the age of}} 17 in New Manchester, which was then the county seat of Hancock, and {{received his}} law books and instruction from the town's lawyers. Melvin then relocated to New Lisbon, Ohio, for a year to further his law studies under the instruction of a friend. In 1853, at the age of 18, he passed <b>his</b> <b>bar</b> examination and was admitted to the bar of Hancock County. Melvin then practiced law in association with O.W.

5|$|Sisko and Lieutenant Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) {{board the}} Enterprise but {{can find no}} trace of a bomb. They travel to K7, and scans {{indicate}} that the bomb is in the grain storage compartments. They enter the compartments and discover that the poisoned grain has all been eaten by tribbles, who are now all dead. Suddenly Captain Kirk opens the compartment and is covered in falling tribbles. Dax and Sisko find the bomb before it can kill Kirk and the Defiant transports it into space where it explodes. The crew of the Defiant use the Bajoran Orb to travel {{back to the present}} time, and Sisko finishes explaining the situation to the Temporal Agents. The episode ends with Quark (Armin Shimerman) in <b>his</b> <b>bar</b> on Deep Space Nine's promenade, with numerous tribbles around him.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{noticing that}} <b>his</b> <b>bar</b> was empty, the present-day Moe {{arrives at the}} Simpsons' home and begins to recall {{the events of that}} day. He remembers that while they sat by a fire that night, they saw a near-meltdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The next day, they go to the old quarry for a swim, and Homer jumps in, only to find that there was no water but only mud. However, Homer recalls that there was no water in the quarry because {{something}} was blocking the inlet pipe. When Homer unblocks it, he finds a rotting corpse in it, causing him to scream.|$|E
5|$|Ljotić {{returned}} from Paris on 1 September 1914, and rejoined the Serbian Army. He attained {{the rank of}} corporal by year's end and was wounded during the Ovče Pole Offensive. During the winter of 1915–16, he participated in the Serbian Army's retreat through Albania. Ljotić remained on active service after the war ended, with a unit guarding {{the border between the}} newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the Kingdom of Italy near the town of Bakar. During this time, he also worked for the intelligence service of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1919, he helped break a railway strike meant to disrupt the flow of munitions intended for anti-Communist forces fighting against Béla Kun in Hungary. In 1920, he ordered troops under his command to arrest striking railway workers, convinced that all were complicit in a Communist conspiracy. Ljotić was demobilized on 17 June 1920. He subsequently married Ivka Mavrinac, a Roman Catholic Croat from the village of Krasica on the Croatian Littoral. The couple had two sons, Vladimir and Nikola, and a daughter, Ljubica. Ljotić and his wife relocated to Belgrade not long after their marriage. Ljotić passed <b>his</b> <b>bar</b> examination on 22 September 1921, and began practicing law. He later became vice-president of the diocesan council of the Serbian Orthodox Church in the town of Požarevac, and represented the Požarevac diocese in the church's patriarchal council.|$|E
