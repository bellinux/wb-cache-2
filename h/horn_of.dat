5|$|Blessed Lightning, a monk at the monastery, has {{a vision}} of Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Tharkey in danger. Tintin regains {{consciousness}} and, too weak to walk, gives Snowy a note to deliver. Snowy runs to the monastery, loses the message, but is recognised as the dog from Blessed Lightning's vision. Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey regain consciousness in the monastery and are brought before the Grand Abbot. The Abbot tells Tintin to abandon his quest, but Blessed Lightning has another vision, through which Tintin learns that Chang is still alive inside a mountain cave at the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> the Yak—and that the Yeti is also there. Tintin and Haddock travel on to the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> the Yak.|$|E

5|$|Most (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus. The choroid plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain. It is present throughout the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct, frontal <b>horn</b> <b>of</b> the lateral ventricle, and occipital <b>horn</b> <b>of</b> the lateral ventricle. CSF is also produced by the single layer of column-shaped ependymal cells which line the ventricles; by the lining surrounding the subarachnoid space; and a small amount directly from the tiny spaces surrounding blood vessels around the brain.|$|E

5|$|The fibres {{that form}} the spinal {{accessory}} nerve are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper segments of the spinal cord.

5000|$|... "Horns of Consecration" [...] is an {{expression}} coined by Sir Arthur Evans to describe the symbol, ubiquitous in Minoan civilization, that represents the <b>horns</b> <b>of</b> the sacred bull: Sir Arthur Evans concluded, after noting numerous examples in Minoan and Mycenaean contexts, that the <b>Horns</b> <b>of</b> Consecration were [...] "a more or less conventionalised article of ritual furniture derived from the actual <b>horns</b> <b>of</b> the sacrificial oxen" [...] The much-photographed porous limestone <b>horns</b> <b>of</b> consecration on the East Propyleia at Knossos (illustration, right) are restorations, but <b>horns</b> <b>of</b> consecration in stone or clay {{were placed on the}} roofs of buildings in Neopalatial Crete, or on tombs or shrines, probably as signs of sanctity of the structure. The symbol also appears on Minoan seals, often accompanied by double axes and bucrania, which are part of the iconography of Minoan bull sacrifice. <b>Horns</b> <b>of</b> consecration are among the cultic images painted on the Minoan coffins called larnakes, sometimes in isolation; they may have flowers between the horns, or the labrys.|$|R

Most forms of cow horn are not suitable, as they soon {{delaminate}} with use. The horn can store more energy than wood in compression.|$|E
5|$|Chinese envoys {{had been}} sailing through the Indian Ocean to India since perhaps the 2nd century BC, {{yet it was}} during the Tang dynasty that a strong Chinese {{maritime}} presence could be found in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, into Persia, Mesopotamia (sailing up the Euphrates River in modern-day Iraq), Arabia, Egypt, Aksum (Ethiopia), and Somalia in the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa.|$|E
5|$|During the 7th century, Aksumite power {{began to}} fail, and Ethiopian society began to {{withdraw}} {{further into the}} highland hinterlands, with the coastal areas becoming peripheral areas (whereas Adulis on the coast was once the second city of Aksum).

5|$|Subsequently, {{forestry}} authorities intensified their {{pest control}} methods and additionally started education campaigns, such as warning not to transport firewood over large distances or to store it too long. Through wood export, the wasp can spread to East Asia, West Australia {{and parts of}} Africa. Remote locations, such as the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa, may be spared from the Sirex woodwasp, providing the area is controlled. The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) of the IUCN has graded the wasp as heavily invasive.|$|E

5|$|Activated in 1985, the 10th Mountain Division's second brigade's {{elements}} saw numerous deployments to contingencies {{around the}} world in the 1990s. With the Global War on Terrorism the brigade has deployed six times: initially deployed to Uzbekistan, Kuwait and Qatar in 2001, elements of the brigade later deployed from Uzbekistan into Afghanistan; the brigade deployed again in early 2003, split across Iraq, Afghanistan and the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa; the entire brigade returned to Iraq in 2004–2005, 2006–2007 and 2009–2010 before returning to Afghanistan in 2013 for its sixth deployment.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa. Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1975, {{smallpox}} persisted only in the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa. Conditions {{were very}} difficult in Ethiopia and Somalia, where there were few roads. Civil war, famine, and refugees made the task even more difficult. An intensive surveillance and containment and vaccination program was undertaken in these countries in early and mid-1977, {{under the direction of}} Australian microbiologist Frank Fenner. As the campaign neared its goal, Fenner and his team {{played an important role in}} verifying eradication. The last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox (Variola minor) was diagnosed in Ali Maow Maalin, a hospital cook in Merca, Somalia, on 26 October 1977. The last naturally occurring case of the more deadly Variola major had been detected in October 1975 in a two-year-old Bangladeshi girl, Rahima Banu.|$|E

It also operated the entry control checkpoints, protected U.S. and allied ships at the massive Djibouti Port, and guarded the U.S. Embassy there.

5|$|Italy {{joined the}} war on Germany's side on 10 June 1940, opening the East African Campaign and the Desert War in North Africa. A Rhodesian-led force of irregulars from the Somaliland Camel Corps—based in British Somaliland, on the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa's north coast—took part {{in one of the}} first clashes between British and Italian forces when it {{exchanged}} fire with an Italian banda (irregular company) around dawn on 11 June. Two days later three Caproni bombers of the Regia Aeronautica attacked Wajir, one of No. 237 Squadron's forward airstrips, damaging two Rhodesian aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus {{is perhaps}} most {{distinctive}} for its skull ornamentation, including the swollen and fused nasals and the frontal horn. Other ceratosaurs, including Carnotaurus, Rajasaurus, and Ceratosaurus itself bore crests on the head. These structures {{are likely to have}} played a role in intraspecific competition, although their exact function within that context is unknown. The hollow cavity inside the frontal <b>horn</b> <b>of</b> Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose. While there is variation in the ornamentation of Majungasaurus individuals, there is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
25|$|Minoan horn-topped altars, which Arthur Evans called <b>Horns</b> <b>of</b> Consecration, are {{represented}} in seal impressions and have been found as far afield as Cyprus.

50|$|The <b>horns</b> <b>of</b> the aurochs had a {{characteristic}} and relatively stable shape. At the base they grew outwards-upwards, then forwards-inwards and inwards-upwards at the tips. Aurochs horns were large and thick overall, reaching 80-100 cm {{in length and}} 10 cm or more in diameter. However, the <b>horns</b> <b>of</b> Heck cattle differ in many respects. Usually, they curve too much upwards or outwards compared to the original, or do not reach the length or diameter of the aurochs. Often the <b>horns</b> <b>of</b> Heck cattle strongly resemble the breeds it was created from (i.e. Grey Cattle).|$|R
