5|$|In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{and others}} {{working under the}} auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a {{coherent}} system of units with base units and derived units. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS), including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the barye for pressure, the poise for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosity.</b>|$|E

30|$|The most {{important}} property of a lubricant is the viscosity. Loosely defined, the viscosity is the fluid’s ability to resist motion. <b>Kinematic</b> <b>viscosities</b> (KV) for lubricant are usually determined at 40 and 100  °C. JBL {{was found to}} have <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosities</b> of 39.45 and 8.51 cSt at 40 and 100  °C, respectively. In an earlier work KV of 35.55 and 7.66 cSt were reported at 40 and 100  °C, respectively, for sesame oil based trimethylolpropane ester [34]. Similarly, 35.43 and 7.93 cSt KV were reported for Sesame oil TMP ester [48]. Other researchers have reported the following <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosities</b> at 40  °C: 39.7 – 54.1 cSt for TMP esters of palm and palm kernel oils [6], 43.9 cSt for TMP esters of Jatropha curcas oil [26] and 11.2 – 36.1 cSt for TMP esters of 10 -undecenoic acid [49]. They also reported the following <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosities</b> at 100  °C: 7.7 – 9.8 cSt [6], 8.7 cSt [11] and 3.2 – 7.3 cSt [49].

The experimental data reported herein are considered valuable additions to the literature. The experimental data gathered {{in the present study}} were utilized in testing the predictive capabilities of some well know viscosity models available in the literature. In addition, a new multi-layer artificial neural network (ANN) has been developed for the prediction of the <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosities</b> of multi-component regular liquid mixtures. The concept of modular neural networks has been successfully applied to the design of the current network. Only a part of the experimental binary data was required for the training of the developed network. The remaining data on the binary systems were used for testing the ANN-based model. The developed neural network resulted in excellent viscosity predictions for the cyclooctane-containing systems. The predictive capability of the ANN in the case of the cyclooctane-containing systems was superior to the predictive capabilities of the other tested models for all systems. The predictive version of the McAllister three-body interaction model was the best to predict the <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosities</b> of non-cyclooctane-containing systems. The predictive version of the McAllister three-body model worked very well when the molecular diameter ratio between system components was less than 1. 5. The reliable and accurate data resulting from the present study helped in both critically testing existing viscosity models and in developing a new model that is based on the ANN. Results of the present study are promising for continued work in the same area...|$|R
