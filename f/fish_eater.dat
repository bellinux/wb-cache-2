40|$|Background: Vegetarian diets {{might affect}} the risk of cancer. Objective: The {{objective}} was to describe cancer incidence in veg-etarians and nonvegetarians in a large sample in the United King-dom. Design: This was a pooled analysis of 2 prospective studies includ-ing 61, 647 British men and women comprising 32, 491 meat <b>eaters,</b> 8612 <b>fish</b> <b>eaters,</b> and 20, 544 vegetarians (including 2246 vegans). Cancer incidence was followed through nationwide cancer regis-tries. Cancer risk by vegetarian status was estimated by using mul-tivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Results: After an average follow-up of 14. 9 y, there were 4998 incident cancers: 3275 in meat eaters (10. 1 %), 520 in <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> (6. 0 %), and 1203 in vegetarians (5. 9 %). There was significant het-erogeneity between dietary groups in risks of the following cancers: stomach cancer [RRs (95 % CIs) compared with meat eaters: 0. 62 (0. 27, 1. 43) in <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and 0. 37 (0. 19, 0. 69) in vegetarians; P-heterogeneity = 0. 006], colorectal cancer [RRs (95 % CIs) : 0. 66 (0. 48, 0. 92) in <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and 1. 03 (0. 84, 1. 26) in vegetarians; P-heterogeneity = 0. 033], cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoi-etic tissue [RRs (95 % CIs) : 0. 96 (0. 70, 1. 32) in <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and 0. 64 (0. 49, 0. 84) in vegetarians; P-heterogeneity = 0. 005], multiple my-eloma [RRs (95 % CIs) : 0. 77 (0. 34, 1. 76) in <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and 0. 23 (0. 09, 0. 59) in vegetarians; P-heterogeneity = 0. 010], and all sites combined [RRs (95 % CIs) : 0. 88 (0. 80, 0. 97) in <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and 0. 88 (0. 82, 0. 95) in vegetarians; P-heterogeneity = 0. 0007].

This is Bigfoot the Alaska or Great Brown Bear, {{who lives in the}} extreme northwest part of the continent. Even Silvertip would look small beside him. He is a giant, the largest flesh-eating animal in all the great world. His coat is dark brown. When he stands up on his hind legs, he is almost half again as tall as a tall man. He stands very high at the shoulders and his head is very large. Like {{the other members of the}} Bear family, he eats all sorts of things. He hunts for Mice and other small animals, digs up roots, stuffs himself with berries, and at times grazes on a kind of wild grass, just as Cattle might do. He is a great <b>fish</b> <b>eater,</b> for fish are very plentiful in the streams in the country where he lives. Big as he is, he has learned to fear man just as Silvertip has.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Few {{prospective}} {{studies have}} examined cancer incidence among vegetarians. METHODS: We studied 61 566 British men and women, comprising 32 403 meat eaters, 8562 non-meat eaters who did eat fish (‘fish eaters’) and 20 601 vegetarians. After an average follow-up of 12. 2 years, there were 3350 incident cancers of which 2204 were among meat <b>eaters,</b> 317 among <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and 829 among vegetarians. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated by Cox regression, stratified by sex and recruitment protocol and adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol, body mass index, physical activity level and, for women only, parity and oral contraceptive use. RESULTS: There was significant heterogeneity in cancer risk between groups for the following four cancer sites: stomach cancer, RRs (compared with meat eaters) of 0. 29 (95 % CI: 0. 07 – 1. 20) in <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and 0. 36 (0. 16 – 0. 78) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity 0. 007; ovarian cancer, RRs of 0. 37 (0. 18 – 0. 77) in <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and 0. 69 (0. 45 – 1. 07) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity 0. 007; bladder cancer, RRs of 0. 81 (0. 36 – 1. 81) in <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and 0. 47 (0. 25 – 0. 89) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity 0. 05; and cancers of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues, RRs of 0. 85 (0. 56 – 1. 29) in <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and 0. 55 (0. 39 – 0. 78) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity 0. 002. The RRs for all malignant neoplasms were 0. 82 (0. 73 – 0. 93) in <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and 0. 88 (0. 81 – 0. 96) in vegetarians (P for heterogeneity 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Frequent fish {{consumption}} {{is related to}} a lower risk of coronary heart disease. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying this cardioprotective effect are as yet unknown. We therefore examined certain cardiovascular physiological variables of <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> during rest, whilst conducting mental arithmetic, and during recovery. Findings The participants were 12 <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> (eating baked <b>fish</b> more than 3 – 4 times/week) and 13 controls (eating fish less than 1 – 2 times/week). Analysis of the collected data revealed that heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse wave velocity were significantly lower and pre-ejection period and baroreflex sensitivity were significantly higher in the <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> than in the controls during both rest and mental arithmetic, and that systolic and mean blood pressure recovery from mental arithmetic were faster in the <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> than in the controls. Conclusions These findings suggest a possible physiological mechanism that may explain why frequent fish consumption reduces coronary heart disease risk. </p...|$|R

40|$|Concentrations {{of total}} {{cholesterol}} and cholesterol {{in the various}} lipoprotein fractions were measured in vegans, vegetarians, <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> (who did not eat meat), and meat eaters. Total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were higher in meat eaters than vegans, with vegetarians and <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> having intermediate and similar values. High density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was highest in the <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> but did not differ among the other groups. There were striking trends with age in total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, which differed between men and women: women showed a steady increase in concentration with age, whereas concentrations in men did not increase appreciably {{after the age of}} 40, which may partly explain sex differences in the prevalence of coronary heart disease. The differences in total cholesterol concentration suggest that the incidence of coronary heart disease may be 24 % lower in lifelong British vegetarians and 57 % lower in lifelong vegans than in meat eaters...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Circulating {{concentrations}} of uric acid {{may be affected}} by dietary components such as meat, fish and dairy products, {{but only a few}} studies have compared uric acid concentrations among individuals who exclude some or all of these foods from their diet. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate differences in serum uric acid concentrations between meat <b>eaters,</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eaters,</b> vegetarians and vegans. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A sample of 670 men and 1, 023 women (424 meat <b>eaters,</b> 425 <b>fish</b> <b>eaters,</b> 422 vegetarians and 422 vegans, matched on age and sex) from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Oxford cohort were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Diet was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and serum {{concentrations of}} uric acid were measured. Mean concentrations of uric acid by diet group were calculated after adjusting for age, body mass index, calcium and alcohol intake. RESULTS: In both men and women, serum uric acid concentrations differed significantly by diet group (p< 0. 0001 and p =  0. 01, respectively). The differences between diet groups were most pronounced in men; vegans had the highest concentration (340, 95 % confidence interval 329 - 351 µmol/l), followed by meat eaters (315, 306 - 324 µmol/l), <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> (309, 300 - 318 µmol/l) and vegetarians (303, 294 - 312 µmol/l). In women, serum uric acid concentrations were slightly higher in vegans (241, 234 - 247 µmol/l) than in meat eaters (237, 231 - 242 µmol/l) and lower in vegetarians (230, 224 - 236 µmol/l) and <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> (227, 221 - 233 µmol/l).

5000|$|Our {{knowledge}} of how Dimorphodon lived is limited. It perhaps mainly inhabited coastal regions and {{might have had a}} very varied diet. Buckland suggested it ate insects. Later, it became common to depict it as a piscivore (<b>fish</b> <b>eater),</b> though Buckland's original idea is more well supported by biomechanical studies, and inconsistent with the animal's habits (see flight below). Dimorphodon had an advanced jaw musculature specialized for a [...] "snap and hold" [...] method of feeding. The jaw could close extremely quickly, but with relatively little force or tooth penetration. This, along with the short and high skull and longer, pointed front teeth suggest that Dimorphodon was an insectivore, though it may have occasionally eaten small vertebrates and carrion as well. Mark Witton has argued that the animal was a specialised carnivore, being too large for an insectivorous diet and therefore specialised to hunt small lizards, sphenodonts and mammals, though its relatively weak jaw musculature probably meant that it ate proportionally small prey.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} differences in dietary intakes between 30251 participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Oxford study, comprising 18 244 meat <b>eaters,</b> 4 531 <b>fish</b> <b>eaters,</b> 6 673 vegetarians, and 803 vegans aged 30 to 90 years who completed semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires. We hypothesized that these groups characterized by varying degrees of animal product exclusion have significantly different intakes of many nutrients, with possible implications for dietary adequacy and compliance with population dietary goals. Nutrient intakes were estimated including fortification in foods, but excluding dietary supplements. Dietary supplementation practices were also evaluated. Highly significant differences were found in estimated nutrient intakes between meat eaters and vegans, with <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and vegetarians usually having intermediate values. Meat eaters had the highest energy intakes, followed by <b>fish</b> <b>eaters</b> and vegetarians, whereas vegans had the lowest intakes. Vegans had the highest intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber, vitamins C and E, folate, magnesium, iron, and copper. Meat eaters had the highest intake of saturated fatty acids, protein, vitamin B 2, vitamin B 12, vitamin D, zinc, and iodine. <b>Fish</b> <b>eaters</b> had the highest intakes of calcium and selenium. There were no statistically significant differences in sodium and potassium intakes between dietary groups. With the exception of sodium intake, compliance with population dietary goals was high across diet groups.
