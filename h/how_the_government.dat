5|$|Impressed, Johnson reveals to Homer that in 1945, President Harry S. Truman {{printed a}} one trillion-dollar bill to help {{reconstruct}} post-war Europe and enlisted Montgomery Burns {{to transport the}} bill. However, it never arrived and the FBI suspects Burns still has it with him. Homer is sent in to investigate. At the Burns estate, Homer searches for the bill before Burns, who believes Homer is a reporter from Collier's magazine, reveals that he kept it in his wallet. Johnson and Agent Miller burst in and arrest Burns. Burns shouts <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> oppresses the average American. Moved by Burns's speech, Homer knocks out the FBI agents and frees Burns.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} has {{said earlier that}} {{it will be able to}} allocate different payment amounts to different people. To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property but the question remains on <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> will verify this information gathered by self-reporting. Many people have chosen not to report or withhold information. The {{administration has}} categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it was not clear in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another concern is the accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E

5|$|Haywood {{observed}} <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> frequently {{took the}} side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges {{and put them in}} a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E
25|$|On January 3, 2006, in his yearly {{speech of}} wishes {{addressed}} to the President of the Republic, president of the National Assembly Jean-Louis Debré (UMP) denounced the usage {{by the government of}} the procedure of urgency, which he claimed was used excessively often. He also denounced <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> frequently sent hastily redacted draft laws to Parliament then had to send amendments in order to correct its own texts. Specifically mentioning DADVSI he deplored <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had sent two four-page amendments {{in the middle of the}} examination of the text, alluding to the same amendments that Bayrou had denounced.|$|E

25|$|With British Indian forces {{already on}} the ground, the British {{imported}} civil servants from India who had previous knowledge and experience on <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of a colony is supposed to run.

25|$|After {{being made}} a crown colony since 1843, {{the status of}} Hong Kong was changed {{effectively}} under the British Nationality Act 1981, which came into force on 1 January 1983.

The renaming did not change <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> operated but it affected the nationality status of Hong Kong's then over 5 million inhabitants, {{most of whom were}} to become British Dependent Territory citizens – a status that could no longer be transmitted by descent.|$|E

25|$|In early 1743 the Governor of Cuba {{received}} a petition from three Calusa chiefs who were visiting in Havana. The petition, {{which was written}} in good Spanish and showed {{a good understanding of}} <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and church bureaucracies worked, asked that missionaries be sent to the Cayos (Florida Keys) to provide religious instruction. The Governor and his advisors finally decided it would be cheaper to send missionaries to the Keys rather than bringing the Indians to Cuba, and that keeping the Indians in the Keys would mean they would be available to help shipwrecked Spanish sailors and keep the English out of the area.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} other themes in the novel besides {{censorship}} have been suggested. Two major themes are resistance to conformity and control of individuals via technology and mass media. Bradbury explores <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> is able to use mass media to influence society and suppress individualism through book burning. The characters Beatty and Faber point out the American population is to blame. Due to their constant desire for a simplistic, positive image, books must be suppressed. Beatty blames the minority groups, who would take offense to published works that displayed them in an unfavorable light. Faber went further to state that the American population simply stopped reading on their own. He notes that the book burnings themselves became a form of entertainment to the general public.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to being authoritarian, Lee was accused of promoting a culture of elitism among Singapore's ruling class. Michael Barr in his book The Ruling Elite of Singapore: Networks of Influence and Power claims that the system of meritocracy in Singapore is not quite <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> presents it; rather, it is a system of nepotism and collusion run by Lee's family and their crony friends and allies. Barr claims further that although the government presents the city-state as multi-ethnic and cosmopolitan, all the networks are dominated by ethnic Chinese, leaving the minority Malay and Indian ethnic groups powerless. According to Barr, the entire process of selecting and grooming of future political and economic talent is monopolized {{in the hands of}} the ruling People's Action Party, which Lee himself founded with a handful of other British-educated ethnic Chinese that he met in his days at Cambridge.|$|E
25|$|The WP was {{represented}} by its chairman Sylvia Lim on 29 April. Lim said that the Workers' Party has a committed group of candidates in this election to pursue greater democracy in Singapore. She criticised the PAP for using taxpayers' money to selective upgrade constituencies that voted for the PAP. She called this a narrow-minded and divisive policy, and it encourages voters to act on self-interests instead of national interests. She added that this threatened to split {{the fabric of the}} nation, and run contrary to the spirit of national service that calls for personal sacrifice. She further labelled this as a time bomb and that it set a bad precedent on <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> allocates public funds and service. She asked voters not to succumb to the threat of the PAP, and to vote for the opposition needed to press the government on other important policies such as containing the cost of transport, utility and healthcare.|$|E
25|$|On November 6, the {{formation}} talks became the longest in Belgian history. When the Parliament confirmed {{the formation}} of an interim Government, it had been 196 days since the Belgian people had voted out the previous coalition. It was the second longest formation period in European history, after the Dutch record of 208 days in 1977. Talks were interrupted twice by the resignation of the formateur, which left the political parties waiting for a new appointment by the King. Guy Verhofstadt was appointed as mediator on December 3, with the task not only of looking into {{the formation of}} a new government, but also of investigating <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> could handle certain urgent policy matters. Pressed by time, and some say by the King, on 19 December, Verhofstadt concluded a deal on a Government and presented it to Parliament on 21 December; on the same day the Ministers took the oath of office.|$|E

500|$|The {{implications}} of these subsequent rulings mandated two new rules, one narrow and one broad. First, restrictions may be imposed on LSC {{so long as they}} do not discriminate on the basis of [...] "viewpoint" [...] or [...] "opinion". Because the other restrictions were not based on viewpoint, they were upheld. Second, on a broader scale the government may not discriminate against viewpoints in any instance where it is funding a private entity to promote a diversity of views.
