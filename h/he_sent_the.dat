5|$|William Rufus, King of England, opposed Donald's {{accession}} to the northerly kingdom. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> eldest son of Malcolm, David's half-brother Duncan, into Scotland with an army. Duncan was killed within the year, {{and so in}} 1097 William sent Donnchad's half-brother Edgar into Scotland. The latter was more successful, and was crowned King {{by the end of}} 1097.|$|E
5|$|A German {{officer who}} escaped {{reported}} that the German prisoners were being humanely treated, but when Böhme {{became aware of the}} situation, he decided that retaliation was needed. He ordered III.Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the 717th Infantry Division, to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite the recovery of the captured German troops. Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested. Böhme was furious, and, on 15October, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac to carry out his original orders. This was done on 16October.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of President Nixon's law-and-order philosophies, Nunn called out the National Guard {{to break up}} violent protests in the state. In May 1968, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> Guard to Louisville to break up race-related protests that followed peaceful civil rights marches. This action was criticized by civil rights leaders across the state. In May 1970, Nunn again dispatched the Guard to quell protests against the Vietnam War at the University of Kentucky, and imposed a curfew that interfered with final examinations. The latter protest culminated in the burning {{of one of the}} university's ROTC buildings.|$|E

5|$|Afterwards, they filmed scenes {{set in the}} Amazon jungle in Hilo, Hawaii until August. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was {{the biggest}} film shot in Hawaii since Waterworld, and was {{estimated}} to generate US$22 million to $45 million in the local economy. Because of an approaching hurricane, Spielberg was unable to shoot a fight at a waterfall, so <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> second unit to film shots of Brazil's and Argentina's Iguazu Falls. These were digitally combined into the fight, which was shot at the Universal backlot.|$|E
5|$|Enderlin's France2 report {{placed the}} {{shooting}} {{later in the}} day. His voiceover said that Jamal and Muhammad were shot around 3:00pm local time (GMT+3). James Fallows agreed that Jamal and Muhammad first made an appearance in the footage around 3:00pm, judging by comments from Jamal and some journalists on the scene. Abu Rahma said he remained at the junction for 30–40 minutes after the shooting. According to Schapira, he left for his studio in Gaza at around 4 pm, where <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> footage to Enderlin in Jerusalem at around 6 pm. The news first arrived in London from the Associated Press at 6:00 pm BST (GMT+1), followed minutes later by a similar report from Reuters.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} the battle ended, on October 24, 1781, the British fleet sent by Clinton to rescue the British army arrived. The fleet picked up several Loyalists who had escaped on October 18, and they {{informed}} Admiral Thomas Graves that they believed Cornwallis had surrendered. Graves picked up several more Loyalists along the coast, and they confirmed this fact. Graves sighted the French Fleet, but chose to leave because he was outnumbered by nine ships, and thus <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> fleet back to New York.|$|E

5|$|From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, {{one of the}} Achaemenid capitals, and {{captured}} its treasury. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius {{was long}} remembered favourably in the Western church for his reputed feat in {{recovering}} the True Cross, {{which had been}} captured by the Persians. As Heraclius approached the capital, Khosrau fled from his favourite residence, Dastagird near Baghdad, without offering resistance. Meanwhile, some of the Persian grandees freed Khosrau's eldest son Kavadh II, who had been imprisoned by his father, and proclaimed him King {{on the night of}} 23–24 February, 628. Kavadh however was mortally ill and was anxious that Heraclius should protect his infant son Ardeshir. So, as a goodwill gesture, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> True Cross with a negotiator to sue for peace in 628.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the third act, Bart argues that modern writers like Steven Bochco, one of the creators of the television series NYPD Blue, are more talented than Shakespeare. Bochco saw the episode with his children and was so flattered that <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons staff some NYPD Blue merchandise. After the ghost of Homer has spoken to Bart, he leaves Bart's room by flying through the wall, causing slime to appear on the wall. This is a reference to Slimer, a ghost from the Ghostbusters franchise who has a similar function.|$|E

5|$|Per {{traditional}} accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi {{were still}} not satisfied, and sent two thieves {{to steal the}} manuscript. The thieves tried {{to break into the}} Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. The thieves {{had a change of heart}} and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to know that they were guarding his home at night. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend Rai Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterward, Alan Ray {{came back}} into the picture, {{claiming}} that he had proof the card had been doctored by Mastro at one point after the initial $25,000 trade in 1985. He had a photograph of the card taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card in the photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card.|$|E
5|$|The Raiders {{declined}} to allow New York reporters to watch practices, a courtesy Ewbank extended to Oakland pressmen. Raiders assistant coach (later head coach) John Madden {{was responsible for}} the exchange of game films with upcoming opponents; <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> films to the Jets through Chicago so they would arrive a day or two late, reasoning that Davis, not he, would be blamed for the delay. Ewbank blamed Davis for heavily watering the Coliseum field to slow the Jets' speedy receivers, a tactic the Oakland co-owner credited to Madden.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{publication}} of Opus 50 set betrays {{one of the more}} remarkable examples of Haydn's financial and commercial impropriety. Haydn hurriedly completed the set by September 1787, when <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> fifth quartet to Artaria. Meanwhile, in August, he had offered the set to the English publisher William Forster, who duly printed the six quartets before Artaria did. Haydn was deceiving both publishers: the offer to Forster was unbeknown to Artaria, while Haydn misled Forster into believing that no-one else had been offered the set. Artaria learned of the Forster deal but published the set anyway, in December 1787, as Haydn's Opus 50.|$|E
5|$|At {{the behest}} of Empress Catherine, Şahin allowed Russians to settle in the peninsula, further infuriating Crimeans. A group of these {{settlers}} {{had been sent to}} Yeni-Kale, which remained under Russian control following the installation of Şahin as Khan. Local residents banded together to prevent the Russian settlement, rebelling against Şahin. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> new conscript army he had created to quash the rebellion, only to see his forces defect to the rebels. Revolt spread across the peninsula, and rebel forces advanced on Şahin's palace in Bakhchisaray. Amidst this rebellion, exiled Crimeans in Constantinople pressed the Ottoman government to act. Bowing to pressure, the government sent a fleet to Crimea, ostensibly to preserve the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. Russia, however, was quicker to act. Russian forces arrived at Yeni-Kale in February 1778, crushing the revolt before the Ottoman fleet arrived. When the fleet arrived in March, it found that there were no rebels left to support. It fought a brief skirmish with the Russian navy off Akitar (modern Sevastopol), but was forced to flee. Şahin was reinstated as Khan. Minor skirmishes between the Ottoman and Russian navies continued until October 1778, when the Ottoman fleet returned defeated to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do {{something}} about his daughter-in-law's behaviour; <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a solution to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E

5|$|India Knight, {{a novelist}} and {{columnist}} for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 {{that she had}} been reading The Cuckoo's Calling and thought it was good for a début novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply. Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation. After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym. Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%, and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand. , a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, one of Reshef's {{mechanized}} battalions, {{commanded by}} Major Nathan Shunari, was reinforced with company-sized {{remnants of the}} 40th Tank Battalion, now commanded by Captain Gideon Giladi after the previous battalion commander had been wounded. Shunari was ordered to seize the Lexicon-Tirtur junction. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> tank company ahead first, which initially reported no Egyptian units. Shunari dispatched an infantry unit in six half-tracks to the junction. Upon reaching it, they discovered that the tank company had already been destroyed and Giladi killed. Soon the vehicles began came under heavy fire, stopping their advance. The unit commander reported casualties, and Shunari ordered {{the remainder of his}} battalion to aid the pinned-down men. Attempts to rescue the infantry failed, and the Egyptian battalion defending the junction directed heavy firepower against the area, aided by the brigade's artillery. The Egyptian defenders had managed to catch the Israelis in a prepared killing zone. Shunari, whose troops lacked cover and were threatened with annihilation, regrouped some of his forces and managed to escape the area in vehicles, but the infantry half-track unit first sent to the crossroads remained pinned down.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was {{declared}} of {{age at the}} Parlement of Rouen, {{but he was never}} able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government. Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the Edict of Amboise and revive loyalty to the crown. To this end, she set out with Charles and the court on a progress around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565. Catherine held talks with Jeanne d'Albret, the Protestant queen regnant of Navarre (and the wife of Antoine de Bourbon) at Mâcon and Nérac. She also met her daughter Elisabeth at Bayonne near the Spanish border, amidst lavish court festivities. Philip II excused himself from the occasion. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Alba to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy.|$|E
