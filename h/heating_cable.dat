50|$|Electric {{trace heating}} {{began in the}} 1930s but {{initially}} no dedicated equipment was available. Mineral insulated cables ran at high current densities to produce heat, and control equipment was adapted from other applications.

For this reason, the best installation time is during summer months. There is no practical way to use electric cable systems with pedestal mounted pavers.|$|R

50|$|For a given length, {{a smaller}}-bore pipe holds a smaller volume of water than a larger-bore pipe, and {{therefore}} {{water in a}} smaller-bore pipe will freeze more easily (and more quickly) than water in a larger-bore pipe (presuming equivalent environments). Since smaller-bore pipes present {{a greater risk of}} freezing, insulation is typically used in combination with alternative methods of freeze prevention (e.g., modulating trace <b>heating</b> <b>cable,</b> or ensuring a consistent flow of water through the pipe).|$|E
50|$|Cold frame {{construction}} {{is a common}} home or farm building project, although kits and commercial systems are available. A traditional plan makes use of old glass windows: a wooden frame is built, about one to two feet tall, and the window placed on top.

Dryers can be heated electrically (heating cartridge or <b>heating</b> <b>cable)</b> or by circulating hot water (connected to the central heating). Often a combination of the methods is used. In these cases the dryer is heated by hot water in winter time and by electricity in the summer. A towel dryer, with high output, can also serve as a radiator in a small bathroom.|$|E
5000|$|A series <b>heating</b> <b>cable</b> {{is made of}} a run of {{high-resistance}} wire, insulated {{and often}} enclosed in a protective jacket. It is powered at a specific voltage and the resistance heat of the wire creates heat. The downside {{of these types of}} heaters is that if they are crossed over themselves they can overheat and burn out, they are provided in specific lengths and cannot be shortened in the field, also, a break anywhere along the line will result in a failure of the entire cable. The upside is that they are typically inexpensive (if plastic style heaters) or, as is true with mineral insulated heating cables, they can be exposed to very high temperatures. Mineral insulated heating cables are good for maintaining high temperatures on process lines or maintaining lower temperatures on lines which can get extremely hot such as high temperature steam lines.|$|E

The two-dimensional transient model allowed variations in the physical properties of the substrate with temperature, water content and depth. The operation of nine configurations of a <b>heating</b> <b>cable</b> buried in sand at different depths (50 to 450 mm, at 50 mm intervals) at 200 mm spacing was simulated and assessed. The validated model was used to perform 24 -h simulations applying boundary conditions, and substrate moisture content was experimentally obtained at a mean substrate surface temperature of 13. 98 ºC. Such simulations reproduced the operation of the heating system by setting a reference temperature of 20 ºC at the control point in the root zone. Burying the <b>heating</b> <b>cable</b> in the surface layers of the substrate caused large temperature gradients and high heat losses through the substrate surface. Accordingly, average temperature in the root zone increased with <b>heating</b> <b>cable</b> depth, up to the 200 mm depth. For greater depths, temperature in the root zone was constant. The ON/OFF control was most effective with the <b>heating</b> <b>cable</b> buried in the root zone and at control point temperatures of 20 ± 1 ºC. Burying the <b>heating</b> <b>cable</b> in the surface layers required higher energy consumption, up to 28 % at 50 mm.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is developed to insert fiber optic cables vertically into the ground with direct push equipment. Groundwater temperatures may be measured along the cables with high spatial and temporal resolution using a Distributed Temperature Sensing system. The cables may be inserted up to depths of tens of meters in unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers. The main advantages of the method are that the cables are {{in direct contact with}} the aquifer material, the disturbance of the aquifer is minor, and no borehole is needed. This cost-effective approach may be applied to both passive and active heat tracer experiments. An active heat tracer experiment was conducted to estimate horizontal groundwater velocities in a managed aquifer recharge system in the Netherlands. Six fiber optic cables and a separate <b>heating</b> <b>cable</b> were inserted with a 1 m spacing at the surface. The <b>heating</b> <b>cable</b> was turned on for 4 days and temperatures were measured during both heating and cooling of the aquifer. Temperature measurements at the <b>heating</b> <b>cable</b> alone were used to estimate the magnitude of the groundwater velocity and the thermal conductivity of the solids. The direction of the velocity and heat capacity of the solids were estimated by including temperature measurements at the other fiber optic cables in the analysis.

25|$|An {{electric}} {{underfloor heating}} system has <b>heating</b> <b>cables</b> {{embedded in the}} floor. Current flows through a conductive heating material, supplied either directly from the line voltage (120 or 240 volts) or at low voltage from a transformer. The <b>heated</b> <b>cables</b> warm the flooring by direct conduction and will switch off once it reaches the temperature set by the floor thermostat. A warmer floor surface radiates heat to colder surrounding surfaces (ceiling, walls, furniture.) which absorb heat and reflects all non absorbed heat to yet other still cooler surfaces. The cycle of radiation, absorption and reflection starts slowly and slows down slowly nearing set point temperatures and ceases to take place once equilibrium is reached all-round. A floor thermostat or a room thermostat or combination controls the floor on/off. In the process of radiant heating {{a thin layer of}} air which is in touch with the warmed surfaces also absorbs some heat and this creates a little convection (air circulation). Contrary to believe people are not heated by this warmed circulating air or convection (convection has a cooling effect) but are heated by the direct radiation of the source and reflection of its surrounds.|$|R
