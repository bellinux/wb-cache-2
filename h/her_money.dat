5|$|Eight {{years before}} her death, she had {{reportedly}} placed two-thirds of <b>her</b> <b>money</b> into trusts, {{for the benefit}} of her great-grandchildren. She left the bulk of her estate, estimated to be worth £70million, including paintings, Fabergé eggs, jewellery, and horses, to her surviving daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. As property passing from monarch to monarch is exempt from Inheritance Tax, as is property passing from the consort of a former monarch to the current monarch, a tax liability estimated at £28million (40 percent {{of the value of the}} estate) was not incurred. The most important pieces of art were transferred to the Royal Collection by Elizabeth II.|$|E

5|$|Fielding {{started work}} on his fourth play, The Temple Beau, in April 1729, but did not finish {{until the end of}} the year.

60|$|At the art store she {{was told}} that more of Laura's autumn-flowers were in demand; {{and her face was}} so full of {{innocent}} delight and gratitude it quite touched the old man who sold her the paints, and gave her more than <b>her</b> <b>money's</b> worth, remembering his own hard times and pitying the pretty young girl whose father he had known.|$|R
60|$|Sir Godfrey Marayne smelt a {{good deal}} of {{antiseptic}} soap, but he talked in a way that amused her, and he trusted as well as adored her. She did what she liked with his <b>money,</b> <b>her</b> own <b>money,</b> and <b>her</b> son's trust <b>money,</b> and she did very well. From the earliest Benham's visits were to a gracious presence amidst wealthy surroundings. The transit from the moral blamelessness of Seagate had an entirely misleading effect of ascent.|$|R

5|$|Kanhopatra {{was trained}} in dance and song from early {{childhood}} {{so that she}} could join her mother's profession. She became a talented dancer and singer. Her beauty was compared to the apsara (heavenly nymph) Menaka. Shama suggested that Kanhopatra should visit the Badshah (Muslim king), who will adore her beauty and gift <b>her</b> <b>money</b> and jewelry, but Kanhopatra flatly refused. Traditional tales narrate that Shama wanted Kanhopatra to marry, but Kanhopatra longed to marry a man who was more beautiful than her. Scholar Tara Bhavalkar states that Kanhopatra's marriage was forbidden, as it was not socially acceptable for a daughter of a courtesan to marry.|$|E

[...] "She {{might have}} done {{everything}} to make you love, and respect, and admire her, and been a happy, useful, motherly, old soul; but she didn't choose to, and now she must take the consequences.

5|$|She bequeathed most of <b>her</b> <b>money</b> to her Society. During Fortune's lifetime, {{some of the}} Fraternity {{members had}} {{expressed}} concerns {{with regard to the}} organisation becoming a personality cult revolving around her, and so following her death they did not encourage an interest in her biography. Members of the society have alleged that her successor destroyed most of her diaries, correspondences, and photographs. However, a number of her books would be published posthumously, among them The Cosmic Doctrine, which appeared in 1949, and her novel Moon Magic, published in 1956.|$|E

5|$|While Maud is {{described}} in the book as an attractive young woman, not a deformed monster, Uncle Silas is carefully written and plotted, and it is almost certain that Le Fanu explicitly intended a comparison between Maud's situation and {{the legend of the}} wealthy woman living in isolation and desired only for <b>her</b> <b>money.</b> Le Fanu spent his entire life in Dublin and was editor and proprietor of the Dublin University Magazine, and would certainly have been familiar with the legends of the pig-faced woman, and in particular the case of Griselda Steevens.|$|E
5|$|Although Eve {{initially}} {{believes that}} her baby died, she learns that he survived when she discovers Vincent Clarkson in 2007. Hidden Passions identifies Vincent as born on Christmas Day. The book states that Alistair arranged for Vincent's death, but the hitman Jack placed the baby into social services without Alistair's knowledge. The series changed Alistair's involvement in Vincent's life; instead, Alistair abuses and manipulates Vincent {{as a tool}} for his plans to maintain power over Harmony. For most of the series, Eve and Julian's child is believed to be Chad Harris-Crane, who is later shown to be Liz's child from her rape by Alistair. After the apparent death of her child, Eve leaves Boston and gives up music to attend medical school. Alistair sends <b>her</b> <b>money</b> (which she uses to pay her tuition) to keep quiet about her relationship—and child—with Julian. Eve eventually moves to Harmony and becomes a respected physician at Harmony Hospital. She marries T. C. and has two children, Whitney and Simone.|$|E
